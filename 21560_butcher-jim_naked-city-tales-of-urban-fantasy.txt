naked city tales of urban fantasy an anthology of stories edited by ellen datlow for my parents doris and nathan datlow whom i love dearly and who infected me with their love for reading introduction the term urban fantasy was originally applied to fantasy written in reaction to the works most popular up to the early shighfantasy imaginary worlds with medieval trappings instead some writers began to inject magic into contemporary times and into urban areas both real and invented mark helprin set his charming novel winters tale in new york city and john crowley set his classic little big at least partially in a recognizable new york many of charles de lints newford stories and novels take place in a thinly disguised toronto while emma bulls war for the oaks is indelibly linked to minneapolis terri windling was influential in the subgenres founding by creating borderland a shareduniverse original anthology series the first two edited with mark arnold set in an imaginary city in which humans and magical creatures could meet and interact urban fantasy as we have come to know it today combines the oftendark edge of city living with enticing worlds of magic its subgenres include noir crime and paranormal romance but the urban landscape is whats crucial as one who lives in and loves new york city and enjoys traveling to other cities around the world to me urban centers seem to seethe with an energy cultural diversity and creativity that is more difficult to find in suburban or rural areas you can lose yourself in a big city or you can find yourself in soliciting stories for this anthology i asked writers to consider all types of locations as long as the story takes place in a cityexisting or made up i wanted the city to be as important as anything else in the storyin other words where the story takes place should matter in some way to the story perhaps the most fun of editing an anthology such as this is the sheer variety of types of stories that can fit under the rubric urban fantasy some of the authors chose existing cities that are well known and easy to identify there are several new york storieseach very different other stories take place in london berlin new orleans haifa israel chicago seattle mexico city las vegas asbury park new jersey and cherry creek colorado others created imaginary cities urban centers are packed with people and this component of cities can be both a boon for gregarious types or a curse for those who are shy and reserved it can also be utterly intimidating to newcomers such as the pair of oddcouple immigrants in delia shermans historical fantasy or it can be an opportunity for those with bad intent such as the protagonists in jeffrey fords and matthew kressels stories a weird joyousness pervades john crowleys story which takes some offthecuff remarks by inventor futurist and visionary buckminster fuller quite literally creating an unexpected fantasia some of the greatest loneliness can be experienced when surrounded by peoplesuch is the case for the eponymous character in kit reeds weston walks a recluse who ventures out only periodically nathan ballingruds displaced person a haunted refugee from the natural disaster that took his home and peter s beagles bitter academic hoping for a last chance of stability naomi novik has written the quintessential new york story the naked city was the title of a semidocumentary crime movie inspired by the book by famous urban documentariancrime photographer weegee in turn the lauded television series naked city ran in halfhour episodes to was canceled and then was reincarnated in as an hourlong show lasting until an uncle of mine played a minor role in one episode but i was too young to stay up and watch it the catchphrase was there are eight million stories in the naked city this has been one of them the city was new york and eight million was an approximation of the population at the time so aside from being catchy the title reflects the diversity of what lies between these two covers ellen datlow curses a dresden files short story by jim butcher jim butcher is the bestselling author most known for his urban fantasy series the dresden files he also writes the codex alera series butcher lives in missouri with his wife son and a ferocious guard dog most of my cases are pretty tame someone loses a piece of jewelry with a lot of sentimental value or someone comes to me because theyve just moved into a new house and its a little more haunted than the sellers disclosure indicated nothing chicagos only professional wizard cant handlebut the cases dont usually rake in much money either so when a man in a twothousanddollar suit opened my office door and came inside he had my complete attention i mean i didnt take my feet down off my desk or anything but i paid attention he looked my office up and down and frowned as though he didnt much approve of what he saw then he looked at me and said excuse me is this the office of dolce i said he blinked excuse me your suit i said dolce and gabbana silk very nice you might want to consider an overcoat though now that its cooling off paper says were in for some rain he studied me intently for a moment he was a man in his late prime his hair was dyed too dark and the suit looked like it probably hid a few pounds you must be harry dresden i inclined my head toward him agent or attorney a little of both he said looking around my office again i represent a professional entertainment corporation which wishes to remain anonymous for the time being my name is donovan my sources tell me that youre the man who might be able to help us my office isnt anything to write home about its on a corner with windows on two walls but its furnished for function not stylescuffedup wooden desks a couple of comfortable chairs some old metal filing cabinets a used wooden table and a coffeepot that is old enough to have belonged to neanderthals i figured donovan was worried that hed exposed his suit to unsavory elements and resisted an irrational impulse to spill my half cup of cooling coffee on it that depends on what what you need and whether you can afford me donovan fixed me with a stern look i bore up under it as best i could do you intend to gouge me for a fee mr dresden for every penny i reasonably can i told him he blinked at me you youre quite up front about it arent you saves time i said what makes you think i would tolerate such a thing people dont come to me until theyre pretty desperate mr donovan i said especially rich people and hardly ever corporations besides you come in here all intriguey and coy not wanting to reveal who your employer is that means that in addition to whatever else you want from me you want my discretion too so your increased fee is a polite form of blackmail cost of doing business if you want this done on the down low you make my job more difficult you should expect to pay a little more than a conventional customer when youre asking for more than they are he narrowed his eyes at me how much are you going to cost me i shrugged a shoulder lets find out what do you want me to do he stood up and turned to walk to the door he stopped before he reached it read the words harry dresden wizard backward in the frosted glass and eyed me over his shoulder i assume that you have heard of any number of curses in local folklore sure i said i suppose youll expect me to believe in their existence i shrugged theyll exist or not exist regardless of what you believe mr donovan i paused well apart from the ones that dont exist except in someones mind theyre only real because somebody believes but that edges from the paranormal over toward psychology im not licensed for that he grimaced and nodded in that case i felt a little slow off the mark as i realized what we were talking about a cursed local entertainment corporation i said like maybe a sports team he kept a poker face on and it was a pretty good one youre talking about the billy goat curse i said donovan arched an eyebrow and then gave me an almost imperceptible nod as he turned around to face me again what do you know about it i blew out my breath and ran my fingers back through my hair uh back in or so a tavern owner named sianis was asked to leave a world series game at wrigley seems his pet goat was getting rained on and it smelled bad some of the fans were complaining outraged at their lack of social Ã©lan sianis pronounced a curse on the stadium stating that never again would a world series game be played there well actually he said something like them cubs they aint gonna win no more but the world series thing is the general interpretation and donovan asked and i think if id gotten kicked out of a series game id been looking forward to i might do the same thing you have a goat i have a moose i said he blinked at that for a second didnt understand it and decided to ignore it if you know that then you know that many people believe that the curse has held where the series is concerned the cubbies have been filled with fail and dipped in suck sauce since i acknowledged no matter how hard they try just when things are looking up something seems to go bad at the worst possible time i paused to consider i can relate youre a fan then more of a kindred spirit he looked around my office again and gave me a small smile but you follow the team i go to games when i can that being the case donovan said you know that the team has been playing well this year and the cubs want to hire yours truly to prevent the curse from screwing things up donovan shook his head i never said that the cubs organization was involved hell of a story though if they were donovan frowned severely the suntimes would run it on the front page cubs hire professional wizard to break curse maybe rick morrissey would have a ball with that story my clients donovan said firmly have authorized me to commission your services on this matter if it can be done quicklyand with the utmost discretion i swung my feet down from my desk mr donovan i said no one does discretion like me two hours after i had begun my calculations i dropped my pencil on the laboratory table and stretched my back well youre right of course im right said bob the skull im always right i gave the dried bleached human skull sitting on a shelf amidst a stack of paperback romance novels a gimleteye for some values of right he amended hastily the words were conciliatory but the flickering flames in the skulls eye sockets danced merrily my laboratory is in the subbasement under my basement apartment its dark cool and dank essentially a concrete box that i have to enter by means of a folding staircase it isnt a big room but its packed with the furnishings of one lots of shelves groan under the weight of books scrolls papers alchemical tools and containers filled with all manner of magical whatnot theres a silver summoning circle on the floor and a tinyscale model of the city of chicago on a long table running down the middle of the room the only shelf not crammed full is bobs and even it gets a little crowded sometimes bob is my moreorlessfaithful notsotrusty assistant a spirit of intellect that dwells within a specially enchanted skull i might be a wizard but bobs knowledge of magic makes me look like an engineering professor are you sure theres nothing you missed i asked nothings certain boss the skull said philosophically but you did the equations you know the power requirements for a spell to continue running through all those sunrises i grunted sourly the cycles of time in the world degrade ongoing magic and your average enchantment doesnt last for more than a few days for a curse to be up and running since it would have had to begin as a malevolent enchantment powerful enough to rip a hole through the crust of the planet given the lack of lava in the area it would seem that whatever the billy goat curse might be i could be confident that it wasnt a simple magical working nothings ever simple i complained what did you expect boss bob said i growled so the singlespell theory is out yep bob said which means that either the curse is being powered by something that renews its energyor else someone is refreshing the thing all the time what about this sianis guys family bob said maybe theyre putting out a fresh whammy every few days or something i shook my head i called records in edinburgh the wardens checked them out years ago when all of this first happened and they arent practitioners besides theyre cubfriendly the wardens investigated the greek guy but not the curse bob asked curiously in the white council had enough to do trying to mitigate the bad mojo from all those artifacts the nazis stockpiled i said once they established that no ones life was in danger they didnt really care if a bunch of guys playing a game got cursed to lose it so whats your next move i tapped my chin thoughtfully with one finger lets go look at the stadium i put bob in the mesh sack i sometimes tote him around in and at his petulant insistence hung it from the rearview mirror of my car a battered old volkswagen beetle he hung there swinging back and forth and occasionally spinning one way or the other when something caught his eye look at the legs on that one bob said and whew check her out it must be chilly tonight theres a reason we dont get out more often bob i sighed i should have known better than to drive through the club district on my way to wrigley i love the girls pants in this century bob said i mean look at those jeans one little tug and off they come i wasnt touching that one i parked the car a couple of blocks from the stadium stuck bob in a pocket of my black leather duster and walked in the cubs were on the road and wrigley was closed it was a good time to knock around inside but since donovan was evidently prepared to deny and disavow all knowledge i wasnt going to be able to simply knock on the door and wander in so i picked a couple of locks at a delivery entrance and went inside i didnt hit it at professionalburglar speed or anythingi knew a couple of guys who could open a lock with tools as fast as they could with a keybut i wasnt in any danger of getting a ticket for loitering either once i was inside i headed straight for the concourses if i mucked around in the stadiums administrative areas i would probably run afoul of a fullblown security system and the only thing i could reliably do to that would be to shut it down completelyand most systems are smart enough to tip off their home security company when that happens besides what i was looking for wouldnt be in any office i took bob out of my pocket so that the flickering goldenorange lights of his eyes illuminated the area in front of me all right i murmured i kept my voice down on the off chance that a night watchman might be on duty and nearby im angry at the cubbies and im pitching my curse at them wheres it going to stick theres really no question about that is there bob asked me home plate we said together i started forward walking silently being quiet when you sneak around isnt difficult as long as you arent in any rush the serious professionals can all but sprint in perfect silence but the main thing you need isnt agilityits patience and calm so i moved out slowly and calmly and it must have worked because nobody raised a hue or a cry the empty unlit stadium was just wrong i was used to seeing wrigley blazing with sunlight or its lights filled with fans and music and the smell of overpriced fattening and inexplicably gratifying food i was used to vendors shouting the constant seasurge of crowd noise and the buzz of planes passing overhead trailing banners behind them now wrigley field was vast and dark and empty there was something silently sad about itacres of seats with no one sitting a green and beautiful field that no one was playing on a scoreboard that didnt have anything on it to read or anyone to read it if the gods and muses were to come down from olympus and sculpt unfulfilled potential as a physical form they wouldnt get any closer than that hollow house did i walked down the concrete steps and circled the infield until i could make my way to the seats behind home plate once there i held bob up and said what have we got the skulls eyelights flared brighter for a second and he snorted oh yeah definitely tied the curse together right there whats keeping it going i asked is there a ley line passing underneath or something thats a negative boss bob said how fresh is it maybe a couple of days the skull replied maybe more its an awfully tight weave how so this spell resists deterioration better than most mortal magic its efficient and solidway niftier than you could manage gee thanks i call em like i see em bob said cheerfully so either a more experienced member of the white council is sponsoring this curse and refreshing it every so often or else i caught on or else the curse was placed here by a nonmortal being yeah bob said but that could be almost anything i shook my head not necessarily remember that the curse was laid upon the stadium during a game in the world series ah yes bob said it would have been packed which means that whatever the being was it could blend in either a really great veil or maybe a shapeshifter why i asked what why i repeated why would this theoretical being have put out the curse on the cubs plenty of beings from the nevernever really dont need a motivation sure they do i said the logic behind what they do might be alien or twisted beyond belief but it makes sense to them i waved my hand at the stadium this being not only laid a curse on a nexus of human emotional power it kept coming back week after week year after year i dont see what youre driving at boss whoevers doing this is holding a grudge i said thoughtfully this is vengeance for a genuine insult its personal maybe bob said but maybe the emotional state of the stadium supercharged sianiss curse or maybe after the stadium evicted sianis who didnt have enough power to curse anybody anyhow someone decided to make it stick or maybe my voice trailed off and then i barked out a short bite of laughter oh oh thats funny bob spun in my hand to look up at me it wasnt sianis who put the whammy on the cubs i said grinning it was the goat the llyn y fan fach tavern and inn was located down at the lakeside at the northern edge of the city the places exterior screamed pub as if it were trying to make itself heard over the roar of brawling football hooligans it was all whitewashed walls and heavy timbers stained dark the wooden sign hanging from a post above the door bore the taverns name and a painted picture of a leek and a daffodil crossed like swords i sidled up to the tavern and went in the inside matched the outside continuing the darkstained theme on its wooden floors walls and furnishings it was just after midnight which wasnt really all that late as bar scenes went but the llyn y fan fach tavern was all but empty a big redhaired guy sitting in a chair by the door scowled at me his biceps were thick enough to use steelbelted radials as armbands he gave me the fisheye which i ignored as i ambled on up to the bar i took a seat on a stool and nodded to the bartender she was a pretty woman with jetblack hair and an obvious pride in her torso her white renaissance shirt had slipped entirely off both of her shapely shoulders and was only being held up by her dark leather bustier she was busy wiping down the bar the bustier was busy lifting and separating she glanced up at me and smiled her pale green eyes flicked over me and the smile deepened ah she said her british accent thick and from somewhere closer to cardiff than london youre a tall one arent you only when im standing up her eyes twinkled with merry wickedness such a crime what are you drinking love do you have any cold beer i asked none of that colonial piss here she replied snob i said smiling do you have any of mcanallys dark mcanallys anything really her eyebrows went up whew for a moment there i thought a heathen walked amongst us she gave me a full smile her teeth very square and straight and white and walked over to me before bending over and drawing a dark bottle from beneath the bar i appreciated her in a polite and politically correct fashion is the show included in the price of the drink she opened the bottle with an expert twist of her wrist and set it down in front of me with a clean mug im a generous soul love she said winking why charge when i can engage in selfless charity she poured the beer into the mug and set it on a napkin in front of me she slid a bowl of bar nuts down my way drinking alone that depends on whether or not youll let me buy one for you she laughed a gentleman is it sir you must think me all manner of tart if you think id accept a drink from a stranger im harry i said and so we are strangers no longer she replied and got out another bottle of ale she took her time about it and she watched me as she did it she straightened also slowly and opened her bottle before putting it gently to her lips and taking a slow pull then she arched an eyebrow at me and said see anything else you like something tasty perhaps i suppose i am kind of an aural guy at the moment i said got a minute to talk to me jill her smile faded swiftly ive never seen you in here before how is it you know my name i reached into my shirt and tugged out my pentacle letting it fall down against my tshirt jill studied that for a few seconds then took a second look at me her mouth opened in a silent ah of understanding the wizard dresden isnt it harry i said she nodded and took another warier sip of her beer relax i said im not here on council business but a friend of mine among the fair folk told me that you were the person to talk to about the tylwyth teg she tilted her head to one side and smiled slightly im not sure how i could help you harry im just a storyteller but you know about the tylwyth teg i know stories of them she countered thats not the same as knowing them not in the way that your folk care about im not doing politics between members of the unseelie accords right now i said but youre one of the magi she said surely you know what i do im still pretty young for a wise guy and nobody can know everything i said my knowledge of the fair folk pretty much begins and ends with the winter and summer courts i know that the tylwyth teg are an independent kingdom of the wyld stories might give me what i need the sparkle returned to her eyes for a moment this is the first time a man ive flirted with told me that stories were what he needed i could gaze longingly at your dÃ©colletage while you talk if you like given how much trouble i go to in order to show it off it would seem polite i lowered my eyes demurely to her chest for a moment well if i must she let out a fullbodied laugh which made attractive things happen to her upper body what stories are you interested in specifically i grinned at her tell me about the tylwyth teg and goats jill nodded thoughtfully and took another sip of beer well she said goats were a favored creature among them the tylwyth teg if treated with respect by a household of mortals would often perform tasks for them one of the most common tasks was the grooming of goatscleaning out their fur and brushing their beards for sunday morning i took a notebook from my dusters pocket and started making notes uhhuh the tylwyth teg were shapeshifters jill continued theyre a small folk only a couple of feet tall and though they could take what form they wished they usually changed into fairly small animalsfoxes cats dogs owls hares and and goats she lifted her eyebrows and goats aye though the stories can become very odd at times more than one welsh farmer who managed to capture a bride of the tylwyth teg found himself waking up to a goat beside him in his bed or took his wifes hand only to feel the shape of a cloven hoof beneath his fingertips weregoats i muttered jesus theyre masters of deceit and trickery jill continued and we mortals are well advised to show them the proper respect if we intrude upon them at all what happens if we dont jill shook her head that would depend upon the offense and which of the tylwyth teg were offended they were capable of almost anything if their pride was wounded the usual fair folk response i asked bad fortune children taken that sort of thing jill shook her head harry love the queens of winter and summer do not kill mortals and so frown upon their followers taking such action but the high folk of the tylwyth teg have no such restrictions theyd kill i asked they can have and will take life in acts of vengeance jill said seriously they always respond in balancebut push them too far and they will damn i said those are some hardcore faeries jill sucked in a sharp breath and her eyes glittered brightly what did you say i became suddenly aware of the massive redhead by the door rising to his feet i swigged a bit of beer and put the notebook back in my pocket i called them faeries i drawled the floorboards creaked under the weight of big red walking toward me jill stared at me with eyes that were hard and brittle like glass you of all wizard should know that word is an insult to them oh right i said they get real upset when you call them that a shadow fell across me i sipped more beer without turning around and said did someone just put up a building a hand the size of a christmas ham fell onto my shoulder and big red growled you want me to leave some marks come on jill i said dont be sore its not as though youre trying all that hard to hide you left plenty of clues for the game jill stared at me with unreadable eyes and said nothing i started ticking off points on my fingers llyn y fan fach is a lake sacred to the tylwyth teg over in the old world you dont get a lot more welsh than that leekanddaffodil emblem and as for calling yourself jill thats a pretty thin mask to cover the presence of one of the jili ffrwtan i tilted my head back to indicate big red changeling right big reds fingers tightened enough to hurt i started to get a little bit concerned jill held up a hand and big red let go of me at once i heard the floor creaking as he retreated she stared at me for a moment more then smiled faintly and said the mask is more than sufficient when no one is looking for the face behind it what gave us away i shrugged someone has to be renewing the spell laid on wrigley field on a regular basis it almost had to be someone local once i remembered that the fair folk of wales had a rather singular affinity with goats the rest was just a matter of legwork she finished off the beer in a long pull her eyes sparkling again and my own reaction to the insult was the cherry on top i drained my mug and shrugged modestly i apologize for speaking so crudely lady it was the only way i could be sure powerful clever and polite she murmured she leaned forward onto the bar and it got really hard not to notice her bosom you and i might get along i winked at her and said youre trying to distract me and doing it well but id like to speak to someone in authority over the enchantment laid on wrigley and who says our folk are behind such a thing your cleavage i replied otherwise why try to distract me she let out another laugh though this one was softer and more silvery a tinkling and unearthly tone that made my ears feel like someone with fantastic lips was blowing gently into them even if they are what makes you think that we would alter that weaving now i shrugged perhaps you will perhaps you wont i only request please to speak to one with authority over the curse to discuss what might be done about it she studied me through narrowed eyes for another silent moment i said please i pointed out to her and i did buy you that beer true she murmured and then gave me a smile that made my skin feel like i was standing close to a bonfire she tossed her white cloth to one side and said toward big red mind the store for a bit he nodded at her and settled back down into his chair the jili ffrwtan came out from behind the bar hips swaying in deliciously feminine motion i rose and offered her my arm in my best oldfashioned courtly style it made her smile and she laid her hand on my forearm lightly barely touching this she said should be interesting i smiled at her again and asked where are we going why to annwn my love the jili ffrwtan said pronouncing it ahnoon we go to the land of the dead i followed the jili ffrwtan into the back room of the pub and down a narrow flight of stone stairs the basement was all concrete walls and had a packedearth floor one wall of the place was stacked with an assortment of hooch we walked past it while i admired the jili ffrwtans shape and movement and wondered if her hair felt as soft as it looked she gave me a sly look over one bare shoulder and tell me young magus what you know of my kind that they are the high ladies of the tylwyth teg and that they are surpassingly lovely charming and gracious if you are any example lady and that they could be psycho bitches from hell if you damaged their pride she laughed again base flattery she said clearly pleased but at least you do it well youre quite articulatefor a mortal as we got farther from the light spilling from the staircase the shadows grew thick until she made a negligent gesture with one hand and soft blue light with no apparent source filled the room around us ah here we are she stopped beside a ring of large brown mushrooms that grew up out of the floor i extended my otherworldly senses toward the ring and could feel the quiver of energies moving through the air around the circle like a silent hum of hightension electrical lines the substance of mortal reality was thin here easily torn the ring of mushrooms was a doorway a portal leading to the nevernever the spirit world i gave jill a little bow and gestured with one hand after you lady she smiled at me oh we must cross together lest you get lost on the way she slid her fingertips lightly down my forearm her warm fingers intertwined with mine and the gesture felt almost obscenely intimate my glands cut my brain out of every decisionmaking process they could and it was an effort not to adjust my pants the part of my head that was still on the job got real nervous right about then there are way too many things in the universe that use sexual desire as a weapon and i had to work not to jerk my hand away from the jili ffrwtans it would be an awful idea to damage her pride with that kind of display and besides my glands told me she looks great and smells even better and her skin feels amazing and quiet you i growled at my glands under my breath she arched an eyebrow at me i gave her a tight smile and said not you talking with myself ah she said she flicked her eyes down to below my waist and back smirking then she took a step forward drawing me into the ring of mushrooms and the basement blurred and went away as if the shadow of an ancient mountain had fallen over us then the shadow lifted and we were elsewhere its at this point that my senses pretty much broke down the darkness lifted away to light and motion and music like nothing i had ever seen beforeand ive been to the wildest spots in chicago and to a couple of parties that werent even being held inside our reality we stood inside a ring of mushrooms and in a cave but that doesnt really cover it calling the hall of the tylwyth teg a cave is about the same as calling the taj mahal a grave its technically accurate but it doesnt begin to cover it walls soared up around me walls in the shape of natural stone but somehow surfaced in the polished beauty of marble veined with threads of silver and gold and even rarer metals lit by the same sourceless radiance the jili ffrwtan had summoned back in chicago they rose above me on every side and since id just been to wrigley i had a fresh perspective with which to compare them if wrigley was any bigger it wasnt by much the air was full of music i only call it music because there arent any words adequate to describe it by comparison to any music id ever heard played it was the difference between a footpowder jingle and a symphony by mozart throbbing with passion merriment pulsing between an ancient sadness and a fierce joy every beat made me feel like joining ineither to weep or to dance or possibly both at the same time and the dancers i remember men and women and silks and velvets and jewels and more gold and silver and a grace that made me feel huge and awkward and slow there arent any words the jili ffrwtan walked forward taking me with her and as she went she changed each step leaving her smaller her clothing changing as well until she was attired as the revelers were in a jeweled gown that left just as much of her just as attractively revealed as the previous outfit it didnt seem strange at the time that she should grow so much smaller i just felt like i was freakishly huge the outsider the intruder hopelessly oversized for that place we moved forward through the dancers who spun and flitted out of our path my escort kept on diminishing until i was walking half hunched over her entire hand covering about half of one of my fingers she led me to the far end of the hall pausing several times to call something in a complex musical tongue aside to one of the other fair folk we walked past a miniature table laid out with a notatallminiature feast and my stomach suddenly informed me that it had never once taken in an ounce of nutrition and that it really was about time that i finally had something i had actually taken a couple of steps toward the table before i forced myself to swerve away from it wise said the jili ffrwtan unless of course you wish to stay it smells fine i replied my voice hoarse but its no burger king she laughed again putting the fingers of one hand to her still proportionately impressive bosom and we passed out of the great hall and into a smaller cavernthis one only the size of a train station there were guards thereguards armored in bejeweled mail faces masked behind mail veils guards who barely came up over my knee but guards nonetheless bearing swords and spears and bows they stood at attention and watched me with cold hard eyes as we passed them my escort seemed delightedly smug about the entire affair i cleared my throat and asked who are we going to see why love the only one who has authority over the curse upon wrigley field she said his majesty i swallowed the king of your folk gwynn ap nudd isnt it his majesty will do rang out a voice in a high tenor and i looked up to see one of the fair folk sitting on a throne raised up several feet above the floor of the chamber so that my eyes were level with his perhaps even his majesty sir gwynn ap nudd ruler of the tylwyth teg was tallfor his folk anywaybroad shouldered and ruggedly handsome though dressed in what looked like some kind of midnightblue fabric that had the texture of velvet but the supple sweep of silk he had largeknuckled hands that looked rough and strong both his long hair and beard were streaked with fine symmetrical lines of silver and jewels shone on his fingers and upon his brow i stopped at once and bowed deeply making sure my head went lower than the faerie kings and i stayed there for a good long moment before rising again your majesty sir i said in my politest voice you are both courteous and generous to grant me an audience it speaks well of the tylwyth teg as a people that such a one should lead them king gwynn stared at me for a long moment before letting out a grunt that mixed disbelief with wry satisfaction at least they sent one with half a sense of manners this time i thought youd like that sire said the jili ffrwtan smiling may i present harry dresden magus a commander of the order of the grey cloak sometime mortal champion of queen mab and esquire of the court of queen titania he begs to speak to you regarding the curse upon the field of wrigley in the mortal citadel of chicago we know who he is gwynn said testily and we know why he is here return to your post we will see to it that he is safely returned the jili ffrwtan curtsied deeply and revealingly of course sire then she simply vanished into a sparkling cloud of lights guards king gwynn called out you will leave us now the guards looked unhappy about it but they lined up and filed out every movement in sync with the others gwynn waited until the last of them had left the hall and the doors boomed shut before he turned back to me so he said who do ye like for the series this year i blinked my eyes at him several times it wasnt one of those questions id been expecting um american league im kind of rooting for tampa bay id like to see them beat out the yankees aye gwynn said nodding energetically who wouldnt bloody yankees and in the national league i said the cubs are looking good at the moment though i could see the phillies pulling something out at the last minute i shrugged i mean since the cubbies are cursed and all cursed gwynn said a fierce smile stretched his face cursed is it or so it is widely believed i said gwynn snorted then rose and descended from his throne walk with me the diminutive monarch walked farther back into the cavern past his throne and into what resembled some kind of bizarre museum there were rows and rows of cabinets each with shelves lined in black velvet and walls of crystalline glass each cabinet had a dozen or so artifacts in it ticket stubs were some of the most common items though there were also baseballs here and there among them as well as baseball cards fan booklets team pennants bats batting gloves and fielders gloves as i walked beside him careful to keep my pace slow enough to let him dictate how fast we were walking it dawned on me that king gwynn ap nudd of the tylwyth teg was a baseball fanas in fanaticof the original vintage it was you i said suddenly you were the one they threw out of the game aye king gwynn said there was business to attend and by the time i got there the tickets were sold out i had to find another way into the game as a goat i asked bemused it was a teamspirit thing gwynn said proudly sianis had made up a sign and all proclaiming that chicago had already gotten detroits goat then he paraded me and the sign on the field before the gameit got plenty of cheers let me tell you and he did pay for an extra ticket for the goat so it wasnt as though old wrigleys successors were being cheated the price of admission they just didnt like it that someone argued with the ushers and won gwynns words had taken on the heat that you can only get from an argument that someone has rehearsed to himself about a million times given that he must have been practicing it since i knew better than to think that anything like reason was going to get in the way so i just nodded and asked what happened before the game was anywhere near over gwynn continued his voice seething with outrage they came to sianis and evicted him from the park because they said his goat smelled too awful gwynn stopped in his tracks and turned to me scowling furiously as he gestured at himself with his hands hello i was a goat goats are supposed to smell awful when they are rained upon they are your majesty sir i agreed soberly and i was a flawless goat i have no doubts on that account king gwynn i said what kind of justice is it to be excluded from a series game because one has flawlessly imitated a goat no justice at all your majesty sir i said and to say that i gwynn ap nudd i the king of annwn i who defeated gwythr ap greidawl i the counselor and ally to gods and heroes alike smelled his mouth twisted up in rage how dare some jumpedup mortal ape say such a thing as though mortals smell any better than wet goats for a moment i considered pointing out the conflicting logic of gwynn both being a perfect and therefore smelly goat and being upset that he had been cast out of the game for being smelly but only for a second otherwise i might have been looking at coming back to chicago about a hundred years too late to grab a latenight meal at bk i can certainly see why you were upset and offended your majesty sir some of the righteous indignation seemed to drain out of him and he waved an irritated hand at me were talking about something important here mortal he said were talking about baseball call me gwynn we had stopped at the last display cabinet which was enormous by the standards of the furnishings of that hall which is to say about the size of a human wardrobe on one of its shelves was a single outfit of clothing blue jeans a tshirt a leather jacket with socks and shoes on all the rest were the elongated rectangles of ticketsseason tickets in fact and hundreds of them but the single stack of tickets on the top shelf sat next to the only team cap id seen both tickets and cap bore the emblem of the cubs it was certainly a serious insult i said quietly and its obvious that a balancing response was in order but gwynn the insult was given you unwittingly by mortals whose very stupidity prevented them from knowing what they were doing few enough there that day are even alive now is it just that their children be burdened with their mistake surely that fact also carries some weight within the heart of a wise and generous king gwynn let out a tired sigh and moved his right hand in a gesture that mimed pouring out water cupped in it oh aye aye harry the anger faded decades agomostly its the principle of the thing these days thats something i can understand i said sometimes you have to give weight to a principle to keep it from being taken away in a storm he glanced up at me shrewdly aye ive heard as thats something you would understand i spread my hands and tried to sound diffident there must be some way of evening the scales between the cubs and the tylwyth teg i said some way to set this insult to rights and lay the matter to rest oh aye king gwynn said its easy as dying all we do is nothing the spell would fade matters would resume their normal course but clearly you dont wish to do such a thing i said its obviously an expenditure of resources for you to keep the curse alive the small king suddenly smiled truth be told i stopped thinking of it as a curse years ago lad i arched my eyebrows how do you regard it then i asked him as protection he said from the real curse of baseball i looked from him to the tickets and thought about that for a moment then i said i understand it was gwynns turn to arch eyebrows at me do ye now he studied me for a time and then smiled nodding slowly aye aye ye do wise for one so young i shook my head ruefully not wise enough everyone with a lick of wisdom thinks that gwynn replied he regarded his tickets for a while his hands clasped behind his back now yeve won the loyalty of some of the wee folk and that is no quick or easy task yeve defied sidhe queens yeve even stuck a thumb into the erlkings eye and that tickles me to no end and yeve been clever enough to find us which few mortals have managed and gone out of your way to be polite which means more from you than it would from some others i nodded quietly so harry dresden king gwynn said ill be glad tconsider it if ye say the cubs wish me to cease my efforts i thought about it for a long time before i gave him my answer mr donovan sat down in my office in a different ridiculously expensive suit and regarded me soberly well the curse stays i said sorry mr donovan frowned as though trying to determine whether or not i was pulling his leg i would have expected you to declare it gone and collect your fee i have this weird thing where i take professional ethics seriously i said i pushed a piece of paper at him and said my invoice he took it and turned it over its blank he said why type it up when its just a bunch of zeroes he stared at me even harder look at it this way i said you havent paused to consider the upside of the billy goat curse upside he asked to losing exactly i said how many times have you heard people complaining that professional ball wasnt about anything but money these days what does that have to do thats why everyones so locked on the series these days not necessarily because it means youre the best because youve risen to a challenge and prevailed the series means millions of dollars for the club for businesses all kinds of money even the fans get obsessed with the series like its the only significant thing in baseball dont even get me started on the stadiums all starting to be named after their corporate sponsors do you have a point donovan asked yeah i said baseball is about more than money and victory its about facing challenges alone and on a team its about spending time with friends and family and neighbors in a beautiful park watching the game unfold its i sighed its about fun mr donovan and you are contending that the curse is fun think about it i said the cubs have the most loyal diehard fan following in major league ball those fans arent in it to see the cubs run rampant over other teams because theyve spent more money hiring the best players you know they arentbecause they all know about the curse if you know your team isnt going to carry off the series then cheering them on becomes something more than yelling when theyre beating someone its about tradition its about loyalty to the team and camaraderie with the other fans and win or lose just enjoying the damned game i spread my hands its about fun again mr donovan wrigley field might be the only stadium in professional ball where you can say that donovan stared at me as though id started speaking in welsh i dont understand i sighed again yeah i know my ticket was for general admission but i thought id take a look around before the game got started carlos zambrano was on the mound warming up when i sat down next to gwynn ap nudd human size he was considerably over six feet tall and he was dressed in the same clothes id seen back at his baseball shrine other than that he looked exactly the way i remembered him he was talking to a couple of folks in the row behind him animatedly relating some kind of tale that revolved around the incredible arc of a single gamedeciding breaking ball i waited until he was finished with the story and turned back out to the field good day gwynn said to me i nodded my head just a little bit deeply and to you he watched zambrano warming up and grinned theyre going to fight through it eventually he said there are so many mortals now too many players and fans want them to do it his voice turned a little sad one day they will my equations and i had eventually come to the same conclusion i know but you want me to do it now i suppose he said or else why would you be here i flagged down a beer vendor and bought one for myself and one for gwynn he stared at me for a few seconds his head tilted to one side no business i said passing him one of the beers how about we just enjoy the game gwynn ap nudds handsome face broke into a wide smile and we both settled back in our seats as the cubs took the cursed field how the pooka came to new york city by delia sherman delia

sherman lives in new york city loves to travel and writes in cafÃ©s wherever in the world she finds herself early one morning in the spring of the passengers from the irish maid out of dublin bay trudged down the gangway of the steam lighter washington each of them carried baggage clothes and boots tools and household needments leprechauns and hobs fleas and the occasional ghost trailing behind like a soiled veil liam ocasey late of ballynoe in county down brought a tin whistle and the collected poetry of j j callanan two shirts and three handkerchiefs rolled into a knapsack a small leather purse containing his savings and a great black hound he called madra which is nothing more remarkable than dog in irish liam ocasey was a horse trainer by trade a big handsome man with a wealth of greasy black curls that clustered around his neat small ears and his broad fair temples his eyes were blue his shoulders wide and he had a smile to charm a holy sister out of her cloister hed the look of a rogue a scalawag faster with a blow than a quip with an eye to the ladies and an unquenchable thirst for strong drink looks can be misleading liam had an artists soul in his breast and a musicians skill in his fingers one night in the hold of the irish maid with the seas running high and everyone groaning and spewing out their guts he pulled out his tin whistle to send mollys lament sighing sweetly through the fetid air all through that long night he played and if his music had no power to soothe the seas it soothed the terror of those who heard it and quieted the sobbing of more than one small child after the passengers of steerage were constantly at liam to pull out his tin whistle for a slip jig or a reel liam was most willing to oblige and might have been the bestloved man on board were it not for his great black dog madra was a mystery as a general rule livestock and pets were not welcome on the tall ships that sailed between the old world and the new they made more mouths to feed more filth to clean up birds in cages were tolerated but a tall hound black as the fabled black dog with long sharp teeth and eyes yellow as piss it was the wonder of the world hed been let aboard and once aboard it was a wonder he survived the journey a dog seasick liams neighbor a man from cork pulled his blanket up around his nose as madra retched and whined are you sure its nothing catching liam stroked madras trembling flank hes a landloving dog i fear id have left him behind if hed have stood for being left perhaps hell be easier in my hammock which proved to be the case much to the amusement of the man from cork the boys soft is what it is he told his cardplaying cronies leave him be one of them said fluters and fiddlers are not like you and me when the irish maid sailed into new york harbor new york bay was wide as an inland sea to liams eyes the early morning sun pouring its honey over forested hills and warehouses and riverside mansions and a myriad of ships islands slid past the washington on both sides some wild and bare some bristling with buildings and docks and boats the last of these only a stones throw from manhattan itself was occupied by a round and solid edifice like a reservoir or a fort that swarmed with laborers like ants on a stony hill the cork man broke the awestruck silence holy mother of god he said and what do you think of dublin bay after that with all of america spread out before him like a meal on a platter and the sea birds welcoming him into port liam had no wish to think of dublin bay at all hed come to america to change his life and he intended to do it thoroughly country bred he was determined to live in a city surrounded by people whose families he did not know hed live in a house with more than one floor none of them dirt and burn coal in a stove that vented through a pipe hed eat meat once a week as the lighter slowed the hound at his feet reared himself with some effort to plant his forepaws on the washingtons rail and panted into the wind that blew from the shore after a moment he sneezed and shook his head irritably the cork man laughed seems your dog doesnt think much of the new world liam ocasey better perhaps you should have left him in the old madra bared his fangs at that for all the world the cork man said as though he spoke gaelic like a christian liam stroked the poor animals ears while the lighter docked and the steerage passengers of the irish maid began to gather their bundles and their boxes their ghosts and their memories and staggered down the gangway on the pier customs officials herded them to a shed where uniformed clerks checked their baggage and their names against the ships manifest these formalities concluded the new immigrants were free to start their new lives where and when they pleased the lucky ones the provident ones embraced their families or greeted friends who had come to meet them and moved off chattering a group of the less well prepared including liam and the man from cork lingered on the dock uncertain where their next steps should take them with a sinking heart liam looked about at the piled boxes the coils of rope the wagons the nets and baskets of fish thinking he might as well have been on a wharf in dublin there was the same garbage and mud underfoot the same air thick with the stink of rotting fish and salt and coal fires the same dirty rawhanded men loading and unloading wagons and boats and shouting to each other in a babel of strange tongues thatll be you in a week or so the cork man said slapping liam on the shoulder hard enough to raise dust im for the far west where landlords are as rare as hens teeth and the streams run with gold a new voice joined the conversationin irish happily since his audience had only a dozen english words between them youll be needing a place to sleep the night im thinking come along of me and ill have you suited in a fine clean economical boardinghouse before the cat can lick her ear the newcomer was better fed than the dockworkers his frock coat only a little threadbare and his linen next door to clean he had half a pound of pomade on his hair and a smile that would shame the sun but when the boardinghouse runner saw madra his sun went behind a cloud and he kicked the dog square in the ribs hoy liam roared shocked out of his usual good humor what ails you to be kicking my dog dogs are dirty creatures as all the world knows as thick with fleas as hairs a good deal thicker the man from cork said and everyone snickered for madras coat after five weeks on shipboard was patchy and dull with great sores on his flank and belly the boardinghouse runner grinned flashing a golden tooth just so mistress olearyd not be thanking me for bringing such a litany of miseries and stinks into her good clean house a doorways good enough for the pair of you and then he turned and herded his catch away inland liam sat himself down on a crate his knapsack and his mangy dog at his feet and wondered where he might find a glass and a bite in this great city and how much theyd cost him yon was the villain of the world madra remarked stinking of greed and goose fat youre well shut of him the goose fat i smelled for myself liam answered the greed i took for granted still a bed for the night and a guide through the city might have been useful are you feeling any better at all now weve come to shore madra growled impatiently im well enough to have kept my ears to the wind and my nose to the ground for news of where we may find a welcome warmer than yon goldtoothed conycatchers and where would that be madra in dublin perhaps or back home in ballynoe where i wish to heaven id never left the hound sighed dont be wishing things you dont want not in front of me had i my full strength youd be back in ballynoe before youd taken another breath and sorry enough to be there after all the trouble you were put to leaving in the first place he heaved himself wearily to his feet theres a public house north of here run by the kind of folk who wont turn away a fellow countryman and his faithful hound youre not my hound liam said shouldering his pack i told you back in ballynoe i did only what id do for any living creature you owe me nothing i owe you my life madra lifted his nose to sniff the air that way moving as though his joints hurt him madra stalked away from the water with liam strolling behind gawking left and right at the great brick warehouses of the seaport of new york the pooka was not happy his eyes ran his lungs burned his skin galled him as if hed been stung by a thousand bees and the pads of his paws felt as though hed walked across an unbanked fire he was sick of his dog shape sick of this mortal man he was tied to sick of cramped quarters with no space to run and the stink of death that clung to mortals like a second skin most of all he was sick almost to dissolution of the constant presence of cold iron hed thought traveling with liam ocasey was bad with the nails in his shoes and the knife in his pack but dublin had been worse the weeks aboard the irish maid had been a protracted torture which hed survived only because liam had given over his hammock to him this new city was worst of all as hostile to the fair folk as the most pious priest whod ever sung a mass yet in this same city on this poisonous dock the pooka had just met a selkie in his man shape hauling boxes that stank of iron as strongly as the air stank of dead fish the pooka had smelled the selkiesea air with an animal undertang of fur and muskand followed his nose to a group of longshoremen loading crates onto a dray as he sniffed curiously about their feet one of them grabbed the pooka by the slack of his neck and hauled him off behind a stack of barrels as though hed been a puppy what the devil kind of thing are you asked the selkie in the broadest of scots im a pooka he said with dignity from county down fresh off the boat and rotten with the ironsickness no doubt well youre a lucky wee doggie to have found me and thats a fact the pookas ears pricked you have a cure for ironsickness not i the selkie said theres a sidhe woman runs a lager saloon in five points all the gaelic folk who land here must go to her its that or die the selkie pulled a little wooden box from his pocket and opened it take a snort the pooka filled his nose with a scent of thin beer sawdust and faerie magic one last question of your kindness he said would a mortal be welcome at this sidhe womans saloon at all the selkie replaced the box maybe he will and maybe he wont whats it to you were by way of being companions said the pooka dinna tell me he knows you for what you are the selkie whistled thatd be a tale worth the hearing tell it me and well call my help well paid the pooka knew very well that his tale was a small enough price for such valuable information but it was a price he was reluctant to pay stories in which he was the hero and the mortal his endlessly stupid dupethose he told with pleasure to whoever would hear them a story in which the stupidity had been his own was a different pair of shoes entirely still a favor must be repaid i will so he said the selkie bared strong white teeth but no just now ive work to do and you an irish fay to see shall we say before midsummer ask for iain everybody kens me here on the docks oh and dinna fash yourself over yon mortal the womanll no harm himif he keeps a civil tongue in his head oh hes civil enough the pooka had answered somewhat sourly hes the gentleman of the world he is the creature which was why as much as the pooka resented liam ocasey he could not dislike him and why after six months in liams company he was far from home ironsick and mangy and too feeble to shift his shape burdened with an unpaid blood debt and no prospect of paying it the pooka had a nose as sharp as a kelpies teeth but lower new york was a maze of bewildering and distracting smells the streets reeked of dung and garbage of dogs marking their territory and the sweat of horses pulling heavy drays the pooka was startled out of what remained of his fur when a scrawny halfwild sow squealed at him prudently the pooka whined and wagged his tail submissively the sow snorted at him and trotted on bowing to a pig if the ironsickness did not finish him surely shame would do the job the pooka thought hed like to kill liam for bringing him here but not until hed saved his miserable life liam had been hungry and thirsty when he got off the washington at dawn by noon he was tired and footsore as well and as bewildered as hed ever been in his life listlessly he watched madra sniff the door of maeve mcdonoughs saloon which looked no different to him than the fifty other such establishments hed sniffed along the way except for a sign in the window offering a free lunch liam read the fare on offercold meat pickles onionsand sent up a short and heartfelt prayer to the virgin that their journey might end here he sent a second prayer of thanks when madra pricked his ears raised his tail and trotted down the filthy steps and into the dark room beyond upon inquiry at the wooden counter liam learned that the free lunch came at the cost of two fivecent beers which he was happy to pay even though the beer was poor sour stuff and the meat more gristle than fat while he ate a woman well supplied with dark hair and bold eyes and an expanse of rosybrown skin above the neck of her flowered gown cuddled up giving him an excellent view of her breasts and a noseful of her musky scent like what you see boyo i can arrange for a closer look head swimming he was on the point of agreeing when another womans voice spoke tuneful and sweet as a silver bell the whore hissed showing teeth a thought too long and pointed for beauty and slid back into the crowd of drinkers startled liam looked up into the face of the tall redheaded woman on the other side of the bar shed a fadedgreen woolen shawl tied across her bosom and a look about her he was coming to recognize after six months in the pookas company a luminous look as though her skin were fairer her hair more lustrous her eyes more lambent her whole person altogether more lightfilled than an ordinary womans it was not a look hed expected to see in the new world welcome to five points said the woman theres a fine dog you have liam looked down to see madra sitting by his leg panting cryptically oh hes not mine he said not in the way of ownership our paths lie together for a while thats all it is the womans smile broadened liam noted with relief that her teeth were remarkable only in being uncommonly white and even a good answer young man you may call me maeve mcdonough i am the proprietress of this place you are welcome to drink here should you be looking for a place to lay your head this night ive beds above twenty cents a night or four dollars a month to be paid up front if you please liam laid the silver coins in maeves hand with a bow that made her laugh like a stream over rocks then recklessly ordered another beer and carried it toward a knot of irishmen who looked as though theyd been in new york a week or two longer than he the pooka yawned nervously and licked at a sore on his flank it seemed to him that it like everything else in this forsaken place tasted of iron how many nails were in this building how many iron bands around the barrels of beer he could sense a stove too and most of the customers unless he was much mistaken were armed with steel knives some even carried pistols it was almost unbearable it was unbearable and the pooka was beginning to realize that there was nowhere in this city where he might escape from the pain that gnawed at his bones hemmed in by mortals surrounded by iron with more mortals and iron outside on the street the pooka was ready to bite everyone around him and keep on biting until he died or the pain went away whatever came first a cool hand touched his head a fresh scent as of spring fields after a rain soothed his hot nose and cleared the red mists from his brain the pooka looked up into the amused green eyes of a sidhe woman i am called maeve she said follow me the room maeve led the pooka to was if anything darker and hotter than the saloon itself stacked beer barrels lined the walls and a complex apparatus of glass and tin on a table smelled strongly of raw spirits a pooka maeve said setting down her lantern ive not seen your like before on this side of the wide ocean a word for you my heart the citys no place for a creature of the bogs and wilds yet here i am the pooka said irritably on the point of paying with my life for the privilege too well perhaps it neednt be as costly as that maeve regarded him gravely what is your life worth pooka i havent much to give you the pooka said would you accept my everlasting gratitude maeve laughed what a joy it is to have a trickster to bargain with even one half dead id save you for the pure pleasure of your company but that would be bad business come give me a dozen hairs from your tail that i may call upon you at my need good will is good business lady three hairs will buy you my respect and affection as well as my service seven hairs ill take and no less unless youre willing to give the mortal over to my hands to do with as i will the pooka hesitated much as it galls me to admit it theres a small matter of a blood debt beween us he sighed heavily seven times ill come to you then you drive a hard bargain missus sure and its a hard city for the fair folk to live in then maeve went to a shelf and brought back a charm which she wove into the thick fur of the pookas ruff the charm bit like flies and nettles the pooka whined and scratched at his neck it wont help you if you get rid of it maeve said mildly its tear it off and die or endure it and live it becomes less irksome with time ill endure it said the pooka out in the saloon liam was learning a number of facts item work although possible to come by was not as plentiful in new york as poor men eager to do it item what work there was stretched from dawn to dusk taxed a mans back more than his mind and paid barely enough to keep body and soul together item not all the poor men looking for work in new york were mortal among liams new drinking companions were a midget in a bottlegreen coat sporting a pair of coppery sideburns to rival prince alberts a boyo in threadbare moleskin with black curls hanging down around his ears and a shortish man with curly golden hair and a clay pipe between his teeth mindful of his purse liam refused a bet on a race between a horse and a pig and an opportunity to invest his savings in a sure moneymaking business but when the goldenhaired man pressed him for his name and county liam bethought him that his purse was not the only thing in danger here he made a dive for his knapsack and withdrew his tin whistle anybody for a tune the midget brightened dye know whiskey before breakfast do i not said liam and began to play if he hadnt been tipsy and perhaps a little more than tipsy its likely hed have made a pigs ear of it with his heart thundering in his breast and the spit dry in his mouth as it was whiskey before breakfast came pouring out of his tin whistle as clear and clean as a may morning in ballynoe with all the birds singing the midget tapped his tiny beautifully shod feet the boyo hooked his elbows over the shelf nailed along the wall and sighed the small man laid down his clay pipe and clapped time whiskey before breakfast rippled out over the room until the whole saloon was listening to the bright notes skip through the rafters and ring against the stone bottles ranged behind the bar after playing the air three times through liam dropped the tin whistle from his lips and opened his eyes another the midget said hoarsely liam gave them the witch of the glen and the ladys pantaloons and i buried my wife and danced on top of her which jig had them dancing as they roared out the words and then he segued without thinking about it into an air hed made before hed decided to make his fortune in america when he was done the boyo embraced him dripping salt tears on the top of his head all hail the fluter the midget shouted and lifted his tankard the fluter the others echoed a tankard appeared at his hand when hed drained it another took its place liam wet his mouth and played again by and by liam felt a nudge at his knee and looked down to see madra looking if possible more miserable than hed looked before with a great mat of twigs and mud tangled in the fur at his neck and a wild look in his pissyellow eyes liam tucked the whistle away and knelt is it well with you madra my dear it is not so said madra irritably how do you think it makes me feel responsible for you as i am to see you hobnobbing with leprechauns and cluricans and gancanagh and other such scrapings from the depths of the faerie barrel and me no more fit to protect you than a dayold puppy liam laughed is that what they are well they seem to like my music well enough theyll not harm me im thinking as long as i play for them very likely said madra dryly liam felt a hand upon his shoulder and looked up to see maeve mcdonough herself smiling down at him my thanks sir for the entertainment youve put a thirst on my customers the like of which ive not seen since i came to these shores ive sold enough drink this night to pay for your dinneryes and your dogs too if hes a stomach for a bit of meat come eat it in the back room away from this moither and then youd best take yourself off to bed before they suck you dry entirely left to himself liam might have taken the dinner and forgone the bed so flown was he on beer and praise and his own dancing music but hed madra to think of and madra looked to be on his last legs so liam followed maeve into the back room where he absorbed a bowl of quite reasonable stew as well as madras portion which the poor beast was far too ill to eat indeed the pooka could not have been worse the charm maeve had given him to counteract the ironsickness bit into his neck like a wolf his muscles trembled his vision blurred and hed a mighty thirst on him that water did nothing to assuage in all the long years of his existence hed never suffered sonot even when hed stumbled into a steel trap set for poachers which hed been saved from by a staledrunk horse trainer named liam ocasey by the time liam had eaten the pooka was too weak and sore even to stand clucking liam scooped him up in his arms and carried him bodily up the rickety stairs the state of maeves saloon had given liam a tolerably accurate notion of the accommodations she had to offer it was a dismal enough apartment low ceilinged and airless with a door at each end the side walls were lined with wooden shelves upon which maeves boarders were stacked four high and two deep liam found an unclaimed space on the lowest shelf near the far door and right over the piss pot and tucked madra into it he fit himself as best he could around the dogs burning shivering body and fell asleep thanks to the excitement of the day and the number of fivecent beers hed downed liam slept heavily he woke once when his fellow boarders retired drunk and stumbling on the rickety ladders to the upper sleeping shelves he woke once again when someone trod on his hand climbing down to use the piss pot the third time he woke it was to the piteous whines of a dog in agony liam opened his eyes to see a dozen tiny glowing creatures their gauzy wings whirred as they hovered about madra pulling at his ears and whiskers and the small hairs about his eyes liam shooed them away like bees and like bees they turned upon him and pinched at his face with sharp little fingers owning himself defeated liam gathered madra in his arms and bore him carefully down the stairs to the saloon and there the pair of them spent the balance of the night curled on a floor only a little fouler than the sleeping shelf above in the gray dawn the pooka woke to the toe of a boot in his ribs and maeves face looking down at him the top of the morning to you trickster she said and how are you finding yourself this lovely spring day the pooka levered himself to his feet his body was sore but no longer wracked with pain and the burning glede upon his neck had cooled a degree or perhaps more he yawned hugely and shook himself from ears to tail im alive he said which comes as a pleasant surprise as to the rest i wish i were back in erin deep in a nice bog and a rainy night descending and so do i trickster so do i for a moment maeve allowed her true face to show through the glamour gaunt and fierce as a mewed hawk now wake your mortal trickster ive the floor to sweep and the charms to make for any ironsick folk who chance to wash up at my door the day so the pooka nudged liam ocasey with his nose and gave him to know it was time to be up and about liam awoke with a foul mouth a griping in his belly and an aching head dunking his head in a barrel of stale water did something to resign him to a new day a fivecent beer and a slice of soda bread hot from the oven did more thus fortified liam ocasey set out into the april morning in search of employment madra came with him left to his own devices liam might have stopped to pass the time of day with someone preferably a mortal like himself who might give him advice a mortal could use as it was he could only follow madra trying not to get knocked down by a heavily laden cart or trip over a feral pig or run into a pushcart or one of the hundreds of grayfaced men on their way to work he was hot and out of breath when madra stopped in front of a big square clapboard warehouse liam looked up at the sign greens fine furniture est ebenezer green prop no doubt its slipped your mind that im a horseman madra not a carpenter madra heaved a sigh theres a stable behind you great idioti can smell it go on in now it cant hurt to ask liam brushed down his jacket straightened his cap and walked into the warehouse the place was busy as an ants nest with an army of roughly dressed men running about with raw lumber and finished furniture while a burly man in a loud silk waistcoat over his shirtsleeves and a porkpie hat shouted orders presuming this to be ebenezer green liam approached and greeted him in his best english mr green turned a pigeyed glare on him speak american paddy or git out better yet do both this is a knownothing shop we dont do business with micks and suchlike trash the mans voice was flat and loud his accent unfamiliar his tone and look however were as clear as the finest glass goblet ill be bidding you good day then liam said mr knownothing sir then he turned on his heel and marched out it seems a strange thing to be bragging of he said as he and madra left greens fine furniture behind them he certainly knows nothing about horses madra said did you see his nags like harrows they were draped in motheaten hides youre well out of there the next stable madra found was attached to a hauling company near the docks it was run by cornelius vanderhoof who like all dutchmen didnt care which language a man spoke as long as he was willing to take a dollar in payment for ten hours of work ive no need of a stableman he told liam kindly enough i have two horse boys and thats all i need all boys are good for is to feed and water and muck out liam said id care for them like children i would mr vanderhoof shook his head come back in may i might have work for you if you can handle a team and so it went all the weary day one livery stable proprietor had just hired someone another offered liam fifty cents to shovel muck another shook his head before liam even opened his mouth its april he said nobody will be hiring until summer youre irish right why not carry bricks or dig foundations like the rest of your countrymen im a horse trainer liam said hating the pleading note in his voice i dont care if youre the king of county down the livery man said ostlers are a dime a dozen in these parts you want to work with horses take a train west as they emerged from the livery stable madra broke the heavy silence its getting on toward dusk shall we be heading home liam looked at the heavy carts piled high with crates and boxes lumbering over the rutted streets at the ragged grayfaced men plodding homeward in the fading light at the street children dirty and barefoot lingering by pushcarts in hopes of a dropped apple or an unwatched cabbage his ears rang with the rumble of wheels the squeak of unoiled axles the shouting and swearing and laughter i have no home he said just now it seems to me ill never have a home again he waited for madra to call him a pitiful squinter or prescribe a pint or a song to clear his mind but madra just plodded down the street head down and tail adroop as tired and discouraged as liam himself being immortal folk do not commonly find time hanging heavy on their hands a day is but an eyeblink in their lives a month can pass in the drawing of a breath the pooka had never imagined being as aware of the arc of the sun across the sky or the length of time separating one meal from the next as he had been since his life had been linked to liams today had been a weary length indeed at first the pooka had simply been glad to be alive and reasonably well maeves charm itched but it was a healing itch and he felt some strength return to his limbs he kept running up to railings and barrels and ironshod wheels just to touch them and sniff them and prove once again that they had no power to hurt him the encounter with ebenezer green shook him had he been on his game the pooka would have nosed out what manner of man green was before theyd even crossed the threshold but the pooka was not on his game a whole day on the town and he hadnt tricked so much as the price of a drink out of a living soul the fear grew on him that maeves charm had cured his ironsickness at the expense of his magic what he needed was something to knock him loose from the limited round of mortal concerns hed been treading since liam had freed him from the poachers trap he needed a bet or a challenge or a trick something tried and true for preference not too dangerous that would put him on his mettle and bring liam a bit of silver liam he said i have an idea tomorrow as soon as its light well take ourselves up out of this sty to wherever it is the rich folk live you shall sell me as a ratter for the best price you can get shall i so asked liam wearily and what if no man needs a ratter or will not buy an irish one theres always a man wants to buy a dog the pooka said confidently liam shook his head i will not and theres an end what kind of man do you take me for to sell a friend for silver money oh id not stay sold the pooka assured him id run away and meet you at maeves before the cat can lick her ear and if you cant escape what then will i steal you back again its stark mad you are madra the citys gone to your head the pooka was charmed with his plan and argued it with cunning and passion yet liam would not be moved it was illegal he said immoral and dangerous and that was an end on it all of which confirmed the pooka in his opinion that liam was no more suited for city life than a wild deer were the pooka not there to look after him hed surely have been stripped of his savings and left to starve in a ditch before hed so much as fully exhaled the ships air from his lungs west the pooka thought hed like it out west tomorrow ill think about getting him on a train a furious squeal interrupted the pookas planning hackles rising he turned to find himself nose to bristly snout with a big ugly foulbreathed sow a fights as good as a trick for clearing the mind the pooka bared his teeth and growled the sows amber eye glittered madly and she wheeled and trotted back for the charge the pooka spared a glance at liam saw him surrounded by a handful of halfgrown shoats squealing and shoving at his legs liam was laying about him with his knapsack cursing and trying to keep his feet in the mired street if he were to fall theyd trample him sure as taxes and possibly eat him where he lay fury rose in the pookas breast then pure and mighty ducking the sows charge he leaped into the melee around liam landing square on the largest of the shoats the pig threw him off but not before the pooka had nipped a chunk out of its ear spitting that out he fastened his teeth into the nearest ham the shoat it belonged to squealed and bolted leaving only four and their dam for the pooka to fight hed not endured a battle so furious since st patrick drove the snakes into the sea and the fair folk under hill this fight he intended to win at home on his own turf the pooka would have made short work of the pigs at home even in his dog shape there he was faster than a bee mighty as a bull and tireless as the tide but weeks of ironsickness and short commons stuck in one shape like a chick in its shell had sapped his strength the pooka slipped in the slurry of mud and dung a sharp trotter caught him a glancing blow he felt the bright blood run burning down his flank and a wave of pain and terror washed through and through him immortals cannot die but they can be killed instinct told the pooka that he must shift to save himself fear whispered that he could not shift that hed lost the knack that hed been a dog so long hed forgotten what it felt like to have hooves or horns or two legs and a coat he could take off seeing her enemy falter the sow took heart and charged squealing like a rusty hinge her tusks aimed like twin spears straight at the pookas soft belly instinct triumphed tossing his streaming mane the pooka screamed and aimed his heavy unshod hooves at the sows spine quick as he was she was quicker yet scrambling out from under his feet at the last instant the pooka turned upon the shoats around liam like an angry sea striking with hoof and tooth the sow seeing her shoats threatened charged again barreling toward the pooka like a storm full of lightning wheeling the pooka reared again this time his hooves crushed the sow into the mud the pooka stood over the bodies of his enemies and trumpeted his victory into the evening air an arm snaked across his withers and clung there liams voice shaky with relief breathed in his ear oh my heart my beauty my champion of champions that was a battle to be put in songs and i shall do so just as soon as my legs will bear me and my heart climbs down from my throat the pooka arched his neck proudly and pawed at the corpses piled at his feet a shoat recovering from its swoon heaved up on its trotters and staggered away down the street straight into the path of a bay gelding harnessed to a shiny black buggy driven by a man in a stovepipe hat bruised and shaken as he was liam was no more able to leave a horse in difficulties than swim home to eire no sooner did he see the shoat run between the bays feet and the bay shy and startle and kick its traces than he ran to its head and grabbed its harness the bay tossed him to and fro like a terrier with a rat but liam hung on murmuring soothing inanities in irish and english until the geldings terror calmed and it stood silent and shivering liam stroked the bays nose and looked around him the street was a shambles with the corpses of his late assailants bleeding into the mud a crowd of day laborers stood all around goggling with their mouths at half cock off to one side madra the hound was licking the blood from a gash on his flank the geldings driver climbed down from the buggy his cheeks as white as his snowy shirtfront thank you his voice though flatly american was kind that was bravely done i take it you know something about horses liam touched his forehead with his knuckle i do so sir ostler the gentleman asked back in my own country i was a trainer racehorses the gentleman looked startled a horse trainer ill be blowed do you mind if i ask your name its liam ocasey if it please your honor the gentleman laughed showing strong teeth honor me no honors mr ocasey im plain william graves and i breed horses mr graves produced a pasteboard card heres my card ive a little farm up past the orphan asylumeightyfifth street more or less if you care to come there tomorrow it may be that well find something to talk about mr graves shook liams nerveless hand climbed back up into his buggy collected the reins and drove off well that was a piece of luck and no mistake it was madras voice but when liam turned he saw no dog beside him but a tall man in a blackskirted coat as filthy as it was out of fashion his skin was pale his crowblack hair was tied with a strip of leather and his narrow eyes were set on an upward tilt with his black brows flying above them like wings you can be shutting your jaw now liam ocasey the pooka said im not such a sore sight as that surely madra for shame and me standing before you on my two legs as fine a figure of a man as you are yourself the pooka linked his arm through liams and propelled him down the street come away to maeve mcdonoughs and stand yourself a whiskey for a good days work well done you may stand me to one as well looking back over his shoulder liam saw a pair of cart horses in thick collars pulling a piano in a wagon over the broken bodies of the swine my knapsack he said sadly my tin whistle the works of the late lamented j j callanan were beyond saving the pooka said the tin whistle on the other hand he held it out to liam dented but whole i saved your purse too and my life liam stopped in the street and offered the pooka his hand im forever in your debt the pooka looked alarmed what are you after saying liam ocasey theres no question of debt between us favor for favor life for life were quits now will you be leaving me then asked liam and the pooka could not for the life of him tell whether it was with hope or dread he asked it not before ive had my drink he said and was ridiculously pleased to feel the arm in his relax its tension ill see you safe up to mr gravess farm first do you think hes prepared to employ me of a certainty and give you his daughters hand in marriage i shouldnt wonder liam laughed aloud hes not much older than i madra his daughter would be an infant presuming he had one at all this is the real world were in after all not a fairy tale are we not theyd reached maeve mcdonoughs by now and descended into the hot and noisy saloon and here am i thinking theres room enough for both in a city the size of this new yorks got life in it my friend im minded to stay awhile as long as you come down from the country from time to time and give us a tune theres no joy in a city where you cannot hear whiskey before

devil my life in speculative fiction the authors home page is wwwrickbowescom sean quinlan caught the wakeup call almost before his cell phone began its first ring he murmured thanks glanced at adrianne la farice who wore only a soft lovely smile and barely stirred in her sleep thrust the phone aside slipped from the bed in the pearly morning light and padded quietly out of the room he wasnt awake so much as in a place where the line between work and dreams had been erased in the ample living room he flicked on the dvd player keeping the sound way down in the kitchen he started the coffee back in the living room he sat in his shorts on the arm of the couch and watched the opening scene in an episode of the old naked city tv show grainy blackandwhite detectives in suits and hats chased a gunman over the roofs of early s new york sun through the apartment windows made the gray figures look like ghosts and quinlan liked that effect the gunman turned to fire and the detectives ducked behind a chimney an actor playing a uniformed cop fell shot the fugitive fled down a fire escape with the two detectives firing after him quinlan turned up the sound half a notch to catch the voice of the old character actor who played the hardbitten police lieutenant in the series wounded in the hunt with the law on his trail the fugitive returns to his final lair his first home the old neighborhood the trumpets played the cityatdawn theme music which mixed nicely with early rushhour street noise from downtown manhattan fifty years later the episode was set in a neighborhood of fivestory tenements that quinlan didnt quite recognize it had probably been torn down and turned into highrises when coffee smells spread he stood and discovered adrianne in a floorlength robe with her eyes barely open leaning in the doorway and watching him her smile was gone more detectives she mumbled you never stop working do you sean my granddad and his friends used to make fun of what they called twentyfourhouraday copsguys who were always on duty he said now its like ive become one can i offer you some of your own coffee yes please she made her way to the bathroom saying when we were kids i remember guys backing off from confronting you because they just knew you were the law adrianne la farice had been adie jacobson when they were in their early twenties and she waited tables while he took care of the door at club red light over in the meatpacking district back in the nowlegendary early nineties she returned saying i dont need to be up this early i dont need to be up at all with business the way it is i could spend the day in bed and i think i will she uttered some variation on that every morning and never followed through his divorce had left him broke adies divorce from henry la farice the designer was much more successful leaving her with this renovated condo and a partnership in a prosperous real estate business sadly like everything else in new york that was now in the tank over the last several years theyd made it their pleasant habit to get together like this each time hed been in new york on a job and it was in quinlans mind to see if they could turn this into something more permanent when he brought adie the coffee and half a bialy she was sitting up in bed reading email on her laptop no apartment in manhattans going to be sold today everybody who owns one remembers when it was worth two million dollars anyone who wants one will offer a quarter of that and then either cant get financing or cant explain where they got the cash quinlan took a jacket and slacks out of the corner of the closet that hed been assigned and got socks and underwear from the rolling suitcase in which hed brought them in the bathroom he stared through the steam at the serviceable face he was shaving the short hair with almost no gray the family face anonymous and perfect for stakeout work his grandfather black jack quinlan had said jack quinlan had made detective lieutenant on the job hed died almost thirty years back when sean was barely thirteen he thought about the old man almost every day sean looked in the mirror and smiled just a bit lately hed had occasion to notice that the quinlan face was also perfect for a man on the run he put on a jacket and shirt but no tie because suddenly there wasnt time on the way to the bedroom he picked up the brown snapbrim that hed been wearing for practice and put it on his head with just enough tilt when he kissed her adie said brazil ive got a brazilian with money interested in a penthouse and with that trade agreement he doesnt even have to explain where he got the cash then she looked up and said you are beyond retro mister you disappear and ill start believing in sliders people talk about sliders have you ever known one its escapism not reality i think they took the name from some old tv show nobody watched i know a woman who described her teenage son as a perfect hippie he had the clothes and the hair his room was papered with old posters and he hardly ever left it one morning he disappeared and she thinks he slid back there claims she found notes from him written on old yellow paper and telling her he was ok of course shes also delusional enough to think the dow will hit sixteen thousand some fine day turning to go he said remember the peggy mchugh party tonight adie nodded and pointed to a set of handcuffs attached to one of the brass rods on the headboard can you hide those before you go the cleaning ladys coming today outside on rivington street it was still early enough that quinlan got a cab with no problem this lower east side drug pit of his youth had gotten gentrified and hip beyond measure but times like this on mornings with bright merciless sun shining on empty shop windows it had started to look a bit shabby again as the cab rolled across houston street into the east village he noticed people setting up folding tables on the widened sidewalks opening for business in the big informal flea market that had grown up there portable dressing rooms lined avenue b on tenth street police barricades blocked traffic onto that side street miss rheingold posters and ads for pall malls covered over the mexican restaurant and reflexology parlor signs extras were ready to stand on the corner in greaser haircuts or lean out of firstfloor windows in housecoats and hairnets down the block lights brighter than the sun illuminated a tenement getting out of the cab quinlan was spotted by a couple of the film crew morning officer one said and they all laughed for their amusement and his own he did an imitation of the old cop hed heard on tv this is my once and future city my life consists of long periods of waiting and brief flashes of action and violence my names sean quinlan and when i can get the work im an actor big parts of quinlans life were in a condition he didnt want to think about but he had a good part in a mediumsized film nothing else would matter for the next few hours at one day in the spring of new york police detective pete mcdevitt climbs out of an unmarked buick flicks his halfsmoked cigarette away and steps into east tenth street his suit is gray and his shirt is blue to match his eyes his tie is bloodred and his hat is tilted back a tad to give full value to his face detective pat roark exits from the drivers side wearing brown with a white shirt and blue tie as befits a steady backup man and faithful partner mcdevitt was played by zach terry star of like a hollywood production currently shooting exteriors on the streets of nyc detective roark was sean quinlans role as a featured player it was his duty to exit on the far side of the car and step smoothly into his proper place one pace behind and two feet to the left of the star pete mcdevitt keeps his eyes fastened on an upper floor of the tenement opposite but pat roark gives a quick scan over his shoulder to see if anyone is watching them quinlan planted that gesture in rehearsal and put it in each of the takes wanting it there to emphasize that his character was the competent bythebook cop no one has commented one way or the other what he kept in his mind was a street full of guys and women setting out dressed for work kids going to school on a spring day more than fifty years before he blocked out what he actually sawthe trucks the crew the commissary table the lights and the crowd of gawkers sean quinlan felt a bit dizzy like he was about to fall or maybe fly and wondered if this was how the start of a slide felt he had created a background for his character roark and mcdevitt were supposed to pick up jimmy nails a twobit thug suspected of having ambitions above his station for questioning roark was a tenyear veteran of the force a guy with a wife and two kids who was talking about moving to the suburbs he would not be bouncing on his toes on an ordinary morning on a routine assignment a sound crew moved with them just out of camera range as the two cops continued a conversation that the audience would just have heard them have in the car that scene got filmed in california a couple of weeks back definitely its spring pat my boy says mcdevitt and comes to a halt roarks expression is mildly amused a bit bored until he follows the others gaze without looking quinlan knew terry was wearing the trademark same halfbemused halfaroused little grin he had used at least once in every episode of angel house then roark sees what mcdevitt sees and his jaw drops just a bit they hold the pose cut said mitchell graham the director i think we may have it crew members moved traffic began to flow zach terry looked sean quinlan up and down for a moment before the two of them stepped apart the actors had worked together once a couple of years before when quinlan appeared in an episode of angel house thats the hbo series featuring a law office whose partners are angels but not necessarily good onesan amusing show quinlan thought once you accepted the premise terry was one of the stars quinlan had played a quirky hit man who didnt happen to be guilty of the killing with which hed been charged their two scenes together had gone well and quinlan hoped the look just then didnt mean some kind of tension on the way back to his dressing room he passed a girl maybe twenty in pedal pushers teased hair and pumps she smiled and he turned to watch her walk away a production assistant saw him look and said that kid has all the moves this location is a magnet for sliders they think if they dress in period and hang around sites like this theyll wake up in one told me that the trick was not to think about sliding back while you did all that the kid had a nice ass but not enough to make his head spin like it did in his dressing room quinlan did relaxation exercises sipped iced tea sat silently for a few minutes and finally listened to his calls arroyo the lawyer was first sean i assume everything you wanted to keep is already out of the condo as of today its repossessed second my colleague whos handling your case up in san bernardino says theres no word from the das office we dont know if an indictment is coming down but as we discussed an indictment is just their way of getting you to testify im wondering if you got my bill quinlan had gotten the bill the condo was one more casualty of his divorce and bankruptcy when he could have sold he couldnt bring himself to do it when he had to sell there were no buyers everyone had consoled him about the divorce like hed suffered a death in the family or been laid off from work monica celeste had the better career was a major presence on daytime tv quinlan told himself that if the situation had been reversed he wouldnt have dumped her but all that was in the past the san bernardino matter was current a runaway grand jury led by a selfrighteous young da was investigating collectionagency practices some debtors apparently testified that a few years before quinlan had led them to believe he was a cop so far nothing had gotten out to the media that time just after the divorce was still a jumble in his mind one thing he was sure of was that testifying meant implicating his former employers which would be very unwise another thing about which he was positive was that lawyers had eaten up his like pay adie was at the office and in full business mode when she left a message for the peggy mchugh thing we can meet at ormolu at eight i mentioned that to a prospective client and he knew all about it so we may meet him there the last call was a voice from deep in a disreputable past rollins said you asked around about me here i am i know where to find you quinlan was a bit amused when they knocked on his door to say he had ten minutes quinlan thought about his character for a few moments roark had the usual problems trying to raise a family on a cops salary his wife and he had disagreements but she was a cops wife and understood what that meant a steady guy was roark a good partner detectives mcdevitt and roark hold the same poses as at the end of the previous scene the audience has just watched a sequence shot two weeks before on a sound stage in california it shows what the two cops are watchinga nude woman standing behind gauze curtains the viewers see a reverse strip as she hooks her bra pulls up her panties draws on nylons wriggles into a slip a blouse and a skirt she bends slowly to put on her shoes suddenly mcdevitt shakes himself awake decoy he says shes letting him get away the pair of them run for the front door of the building locations had found an untouched and ungentrified tenement props had filled the dented cans in front with inperiod trasha partly crushed wheaties box a broken coke bottle a striped pillow leaking feathers a little old lady with a wheeled shopping cart gets in their way the stoop is worn and paint is peeling on the railing as they run up the steps the front door opens and there stands laura chante the first time the audience gets a good look at her laura is the girlfriend of a very wrong guy hard but soft bad but good she wears high heels a black sheath skirt and a jacket open to reveal a pale shimmering blouse a scarf with a streak of scarlet covers most of her blond hair you boys looking for someone she asks with an innocent expression laura was played by the young london actress moira tell her posture her accent her attitude were impeccable peggy mchugh still had a sassy smile back in the s and s she had made a career playing bright young girlfriends and wisecracking best pals of toosweet heroines she was the young detectives fiancÃ©e in the naked city tv series at eighty she played tough old broads with a regular role on as the world turns and a girlfriend thirty years her junior in a nod to nostalgia shed been cast as detective pete mcdevitts hip utterly unsentimental grandmother in this movie it was her birthday and mitchell graham the director along with the movies producers threw a little party for her at ormolus on union square and invited the press ms mchugh had already knocked back a jameson on the rocks and was swirling champagne in her glass when quinlan came up and hugged her how are you doing you old witch he asked sean thought id see more of you on this shoot hows your mother still living in new mexico with whatshisname peggy mchugh and quinlans mother the former julie morris had been pals back when his mother was acting back when she married his father detective jim quinlan arizona lou hagan is the current husband nice guyretired broker shes fine sends her love your mother was gorgeous she and your father when they met were more like a movie than any movie ive been in and having taken the conversation to a place where quinlan didnt want to go peggy caught sight of someone else and said bella so wonderful of you to come quinlan stepped away went to the bar sipped a scotch and looked around the room ormolus tin ceiling had been polished to a fine shine the wood paneling looked rich as chocolate the place had been a dump twenty years before when it was a rock club called ladders long before that it had been an italian wedding hall seans parents were quite a storythe young actress and the young cop who got himself quite dirty trying to keep her in style jim quinlan shot himself when the shit came down sean had been three when that happened and found it out in bits and pieces once when he was small his grandfather had explained how it was growing up in the irish new york of the twenties and thirties kids who got in trouble which was most of us got let off with a warning if we had cops in the family those without a relative on the force got a criminal record simple justice and nothing less out of nowhere quinlan had asked about the father whom he barely remembered and knew almost nothing did my dad get into trouble he never forgot the grief on the old mans face as he said your father got more than a couple of warnings adie was across the room talking intently to a thin man wearing thousands of dollars worth of suit and a long dark ponytail where quinlan was standing he could hear mitchell graham say sometimes acting is beside the point and its the physical presence you want someone walks on camera unannounced and the audience knows hes a killer quinlan shifted slightly and saw that the director was talking to moira tell and a reporter in america real mafiosi go to jail get involved in the prison drama group get out and go into business playing mafiosi on stage and screen when friedkin shot sorcerer down in latin america he hired a couple of sing sing school of drama graduates to play the thugs the two stopped off on the way down there and helped pull a robbery this delayed them and held up the shooting when they showed up roy scheider the star said i was told we were waiting for actorsthese are just gangsters supposedly the two were deeply hurt that their artistic bona fides were being questioned moira tell laughed and moved toward the bar on her way she noticed quinlan you are very good she told him sing sing school of drama oh he was not talking about you graham admires what youre doing the presence you bring he believes all that nonsense about inneremotionamerican versus exteriordetailenglish acting you were great this afternoon its wonderful to visit a past that has nothing to do with me at all from across the room they heard peggy mchugh in full voice speaking to a cable interviewer back when the economy was first going down the toilet someone asked me if id like to go back sixty years i thought they meant would i like to be young again instead they just meant me going just as i was before heart bypasses before air conditioning i asked them youre out of your mind i said sweetheart we lived like dogs back then adie said as they were leaving a bit later the one i was talking to is the brazilian from this morning he wants to buy a penthouse hes loaded somehow money had not really come up in all the years theyd known each other the ferry boat called the queen of union city disembarks passengers onto a hudson river pier in the west twenties a woman wearing a veiled hat leads a small boy in an eton cap and a girl in a straw boater by their hands a tall man in a threepiece suit and a topcoat follows them an old slatsided truck piled with crates of live chickens rolls onto the pier past a large sign reading erie lackawanna ferry company under that in smaller letters is departures from manhattan on the hour and the half hour am to pm detectives pete mcdevitt and pat roark stand under a clock that says poised alert and ready to step out from behind the makeshift ferry shed then mcdevitt says now and moves to his right roark at the same moment moves to his left roark served a year in korea firemen are navy cops are army quinlan knows this the next line is his okay nails freeze cut the truck with the chickens went into reverse and parked next to a mintcondition oldsmobile and an oldfashioned ambulance the size and shape of a station wagon before the first take mitchell graham had said sean youre so perfectly in period that i feel like i should film you in blackandwhite as mcdevitt that day zach terry wore his hat at the same great angle as quinlan did graham noticed that after the first take he told quinlan its distracting to have both of you with your hats alike could you straighten yours the game was called protecting the star sean knew that game mcdevitts hat was an important prop today he shifted his own fedora perfect said the director a featured player yields gracefully in the hope that a director will remember when casting in the future quinlan wondered how many movies graham would direct after this one he wondered what his own career would look like if an indictment came down in california crews were setting up for the next scene which would be shot in front of an old threestory building just across from the piers for the movie a sign had been erected on the front that read murphys fine food and drink rooms by the day or week once this had actually been a waterfront tavern with rooms rented to sailors on the upper floors for a while after the waterfront shut down it had been a notorious gay bar called the wrong box carter boyce the actor playing jimmy nails was in costume and taking a practice walk toward the ferry shed carter boyce was a nice guy who happened to have a mug two feet wide with bad news written all over it in the next scene jimmy nails was supposed to have just come down the wooden exterior stairs that led from the second floor of murphys he had an overcoat on his arm and carried a satchel the scene of nails on those stairs had been completed the day before through the miracle of secondunit work detectives mcdevitt and roark stand exactly where they were at the end of the last shot in the background as they start to move toward murphys the oldsmobile and the chicken truck roll off the dock in one direction a red studebaker station wagon goes by in the other twenty feet away from them jimmy nails drops his luggage and overcoat and swings a doublebarrel shotgun their way mcdevitt acting instinctively whips off his fedora and flings it at nailss face in one gesture jimmy his eyes rolling like a trapped beast is a creature of instinct and empties a barrel at the hat roarks gun jumps into his hand and he fires three times jimmy nails goes down firing the second barrel into the ground the hat flying through the air and getting blasted into felt confetti was being shot that same week by a specialeffects outfit in california thanks roark says that hat cost me seven bucks at rothmans says his partner his buddy cut lets put zach and sean about a foot farther apart said graham and sean slower on the reaction let the hat surprise you as much as it does carter sean are you with us quinlan nodded for a moment hed felt like the back draft of the vintage vehicles was pulling him away from this time and place over several takes the vintage studebaker blew a tire and the wind and the sun played hell with mr terrys hair half a dozen people surrounded him spraying his chestnut locks exposure to the elements its not of course but the light makes it look thin lighting adjustment this quinlan knew was also about protecting the star as was the scene they kept enacting mcdevitt needed to save roarks life to mitigate for the audience the fact that his misjudgment was going to cost roark his life as they prepared for what turned out to be the last take quinlan couldnt stop thinking each time he looked at zach terry that this was the bastard who was going to get him killed at some point during the last couple of takes sean quinlan became aware of a figure from his disreputable past rollins stood across the street dark and sharp in a navy blue suede jacket and soft leather shoes and watched everything that went on when they were finished with like for the day he and rollins went down the avenue to what had been a nouveauchic diner and now seemed to be slipping into just being a diner with a liquor license we had some rare adventures you and i rollins remarked when they settled into a back booth a pair of theater students out looking for adventure and not caring where they found it always on the right side of the law though not as i remember there was the time we unloaded the quaaludes those crazy guys from nyu manufactured in their chemistry lab we werent caught thats being on the right side of the law as far as im concerned glad you got in touch ive been following your career sorry about the divorce monica celeste must be loaded quinlan shrugged i see youre still the welldressed passerby he said that routine keeps working for you in any large city there are always the lost the confused and the lonely that need an assist from a passing stranger rollins gave a charming smile actually though ive gone legit im in the tourist businesstours of various old new yorks you heard about that we have people taking daytrips to s new york out in brooklyn in a couple of spots you can walk down a street and almost think its a hundred and twentyfive years ago any decade you can think of people want to see the remains rollins smiled its an amazing confluence you being back in town and making this movie like is on the cusp of the hottest boom in this dying town your movie is going to be porno for the ones who go for fifties new york that ferryboat sliding up to the dock and that truckload of chickens and you and your pal in those hats and paddedshoulder suits will make them cum in their dacronrayon pants sean gave a grin in tough times people want to go elsewhere rollins said with every corner of the planet going down the drain the places they favor are in the past some lunatics even want to go back to the great depression like this one isnt bad enough for them but i dont ask questions i just set up the tours who would have guessed that a masters degree in history from columbia would stand me in such good stead especially since you never went there rollins shrugged what makes it all weird and twisted and thus makes it my kind of enterprise is that some of the clients believe that if they can find a place with enough artifacts that evoke a certain time theyll get a jolt and wind up there most of them want to go back to the seventies the sixties the fifties they figure things would be comfortable enough id requirements were still loose back then sliders know enough about those times that they could make a nice living betting on the world series and buying xerox stock one said that if he could get back to hed have almost sixty years before stuff got really screwy youve heard them talk all this out ever help any of them do it none of my clients and no one else ive ever known has actually managed the slide theyve all heard about someone going back in time they know someone who found a message from someone who disappeared saying hes living like a king in psychiatrists say its delusional people cant deal with bad times you believe the shrinks know what theyre talking about they diagnosed me as a sociopath back when i was in high school it sounded good and i went with it if youre looking for a guide to the slide youre out of luck if you want a job leading s nostalgia tours id be happy to hire you thanks but i have other plans quinlan rose and put a ten down on the table nice talking to you rollo for a moment rollins looked hurt then he said sorry to break your heart quinlan its nice that you figured if anyone in new york knew how to slide it would be me youve been in and out of the city over the years without ever trying to get in contact so i wondered what you wanted somehow i didnt think of this either you got stupid out in california or you got very desperate in the early morning light stepping carefully along a tenement fire escape just off tenth avenue in hells kitchen detective roark edges forward revolver in hand up ahead is figs figueroas window in another moment his partner will knock on the door of the apartment and figueroa will be on the move roark curses the stupidity that led him into this backup is on its way and they could have waited but the lieutenant is not happy with the way theyd bobbled jimmy nailss arrest the other morning or the way theyd then made him too dead to talk mcdevitt thinks the two of them need some redemption as roark inches forward the window right behind him opens he drops to a crouch revolver at the ready turns and sees the terrified face of an old woman about to hang a basket of wet laundry on her wash line when roark turns back figueroa stands on the fire escape with an automatic leveled on him cut on the roof just above quinlan were an assistant director the script girl the cameraman and the director himself we need this one more time said graham just do what youve done before he looked closely at quinlan and said get this man some coffee it was late in the morning and quinlan had already gone up this fire escape six times he guessed this particular building got cast for the part because of this fire escape which was as black and labyrinthine as the stairways of a piranesi prison people fussed with his clothes and his makeup hed lain awake all night next to adie who slept soundly somebody brought him coffee this scene was his best moment in like by coincidence it and the one theyd shoot immediately afterward were his last ones in the film his work in new york was over if someone asked him what like was about quinlan would have said it was the story of a cop who was an ordinary guy wanting the ordinary things and living in a simpler and not very enlightened time this man is pulled by circumstance and human weakness into a situation where his life is on the line again he climbs the stairs and inches forward again the window opens and revolver at the ready he stares into the terrified face and looks up too late to see his killer this morning it seemed as if rollins was right about the slide being a delusion quinlan felt no distant hum of past times his stomach was tight his shoulders tense in his dressing room he looked at his messages adie had called from her office to say she had a meeting with a client and would have to miss the wrap party this morning she had asked himgently indirectly not like he was being evicted yetif everything was ok for him back in la she hadnt mentioned the brazilian but he was an invisible presence as quinlan sat absorbing this arroyo the lawyer called my associate in san bernardino says the grand jury will hand down indictments in an intimidationextortion scheme this afternoon at around six pm new york time youre accused of impersonating a law officer one alleged victim says you showed him a badge threatened to run him in on false charges if he didnt come up with his payment thats a lie sean said that automatically but the only memory the accusation evoked was an appearance hed made as a rogue cop on nypd blue many years before in which hed flashed a shield sean theyre not interested in you they want the ones who hired you speaking those names means ill be dead or in witness protection he said ill get back to you quinlan remembered when he turned thirteen and decided that instead of becoming a cop which was all hed wanted up until then he was going to be an actor his grandfather had said tough luck kid you drew your fathers face and your mothers brains he jumped when a woman from props knocked on the door and came in to put him into a bloody shirt pat roark lies sprawled face up in the alley with the gun still clasped in his lifeless hand his hat beside his head his dead eyes staring at the sky the scene is shot from above the camera looks down as a dozen extraskids carrying schoolbooks women in curlers and housedresses guys in work clothes idlers and honest citizenssuddenly converge from all directions to see the dead man who has fallen from the sky the computer imaging of roark falling backward off the fire escape and slamming into the asphalt had been completed before he left los angeles what was he doing up there a woman with a spanish accent wanted to know hes a cop said a wiseass kid see that police special as the sirens wail and echo off the alley walls pete mcdevitt runs down the fire escape yelling pat jesus no his voice breaks into a sob quinlan couldnt tell if he used the dippy smile the shot of pat roark dead in the alley would be used repeatedly in the film as a motive for zach terrys peter mcdevitt in his quest for the killer and the ones behind the killer who it turned out reached all the way to the commissioners office the old stage actor denny wallace whose father was a polish jew and whose mother was a french ballet dancer played lieutenant ogrady standing over the corpse he delivers roarks epitaph he was worth twenty of you ill have your badge and your gun for this boyo quinlan heard applause on the set which meant this was probably the last take there was comfort in lying dead in an alleyway killed in the line of duty in a time when that meant something this was the part of his life that actually made sense the applause faded and died smell was the first thing he noticed tobacco smoke and garbage and exhaust sirens sounded on the avenue quinlan focused his eyes on a kid with batwing ears a crew cut and jeans so stiff they could stand up by themselves a bunch of scruffy street rats stared down at him its a cop howd he get here the city accents were thick enough to cut he closed his hand on his prop gun and they all stepped back you been shot mister you need a doctor quinlan remembered the prop blood on his shirt front no one he noticed talked about calling the cops hes a fuckin actor look at the makeup said an old lady with way too much lipstick peering into the alley all sean wondered as he got up was how long it would take graham and the rest to notice he was gone he dusted himself off buttoned his jacket to hide the dye on his shirt front and wiped his face clean with a pocket handkerchief it was a fivestory city and the sun shone directly from across the hudson everyone got out of his way as he walked down the alley he stuffed the gun in his pocket anyone follows me he gestured to it he doubted that anyone in hells kitchen was going to call the police but he moved quickly got on tenth avenue and started walking cars and clothes gave only a hint of the year a corner newsstand had a big display of papers dated may his father would be about half his age and still in the army in germany his mother would not have moved here from buffalo his grandfather and grandmother lived up on fordham road in the bronx the avenue was lined with pawnshops the gun was a prop but he figured it would be worth a buck or two black jack quinlan and he would be about the same age if he was here he had to be here once he explained things once he showed this face sean quinlan couldnt imagine them denying this fugitive a welcome the duke of riverside by ellen kushner ellen kushners first novel swordspoint was hailed as the progenitor of the mannerpunk or fantasy of manners style its eventual sequel the privilege of the sword won the locus award and was a nebula nominee and a tiptree honor book a third novel the fall of the kings set in the same unnamed city was cowritten with delia sherman and explores the fate of the city and its people in the next generation the duke of riverside is set shortly before and after the events of swordspoint ellen kushner is also the host of the longrunning public radio series pris sound spirit and a cofounder of the interstitial arts foundation her original spokenword performances include esther the feast of masks and the golden dreydl a klezmer nutcracker for chanukah with shirim klezmer orchestra on rykodisc cd a popular speaker and teacher she lives in new york city with delia sherman and no cats whatsoever that kid never belonged here we all knew that from the moment he walked through the door looking nervous and madder than hell bad combination everyone figured he had a weapon because people like that usually do the drinkers stopped drinking the barmaids stopped serving and the dicers held up their dice midroll sukey moved a little closer to annie as the girls like to protect each other when they can rosalie stepped forward it is her bar after all what can i get you she asked what can you get me his voice told everyone that was the stupidest question hed ever been asked what can you get me all sneer and that snooty hill accent definitely not from around here do you happen to have ludlows treatise on the causes of nature oh no they banned it how about a roast peacock then or a cup of really strong poison rosalie rolled her eyes ill go see she said like shed already taken his measure and decided he wasnt dangerous after all just nuts she turned her back on him and the whole room relaxed he was a scholar clearly he had that long student hair tied back with a piece of string and that long black robe they all wear hanging off his bony shoulders like laundry only it hadnt been washed for a while but pissedoff scholars dont usually come down to riverside hell they dont even come here to get pissed they know its a place youre likely to get rolled rolled and then maybe killed nobody drinks here who doesnt have to red sukey sidled up to him shed been holding on to annie but when rosalie turned her back sukey grabbed her chance buy me a drink he looked down at her he was incredibly tall what for are you thirsty shes not very old not much experience there no she moved a little closer to him to show him what she had id be nice to you he got it then for a drink are you serious we all waited to see if he had any money most men you mention money their hand goes automatically to where they keep their purse just for an instant but his hand didnt even go to his belt nothing then or he was smarter than he looked i myself was willing to wait and see and then nimble willie stuck his head in through the doorway gasping fight fight and we forgot all about the bony scholar and headed for the street to see poor archer fink had finally gotten st vier to take his challenge god knows how richard st vier was too good to fight a newbie like archer and if archer didnt know it we all did probably it was that girl of his the blonde egging fink on to show his stuff maybe she even thought he really had a chance were used to seeing them come and go these young swordsmen they fight like stags in autumn to prove whos best only being swordsmen they tend to kill each other off thats how you get good jobs in the city not to mention respect here in riverside that day my money was on st vier but so was everyone elses i only won eighteen brass minnows it was done in a minutebarely time to make our bets st vier lunged quick and hard archer fink grunted and wheezed and it was all over blood shooting up after the tip of the sword when st vier pulled it out the student was right there he was standing very still he didnt even put up his hand to keep the blood from hitting him his black robe was spattered with shiny black drops he stared at the body like hed never seen one before st vier walked away from the fight and into the tavern rosalie brought him a drink she loved that he drank at her place it brought her custom when the nobles from the hill were looking for a swordsman to hire they sent their servants down to rosalies to find him she loved that too the scholar followed him in ill have one too he said to rosalie she said first let me see your money you didnt ask him for money rosalie snorted st vier i know who the hell are you im no one he said fiercely forget it who are you rosalie said again in that tone of voice that always gets her cash on the barrel he turned his head and looked down at her it was a long damn way alec he said is that all just alec the swordsman was ignoring the whole thing he was leaning on the bar knocking down his thirst with his back to them boththough one hand never left the sword at his side st vier the kid said aloud he pushed loose hair back from his face not even noticing the smear of blood he left there the air around him started to feel dangerous again maybe it was his voice the way he said the name st vier he said again long and low ive heard nobles use that voice up on the hill when theyre telling a servant they want something done yeah i did some work up there once but just once they talk real slow like they have all the time in the world which they do the swordsman heard it too he turned his head yes youre richard st vier the swordsman nodded and you kill people st vier looked him up and down it stretched his neck some the kid was a real beanpole he mustve seen what we all saw young skinny hungry poor badtempered and out of place sometimes i do do you ever kill them just because theyre no earthly use to anyone at all no no i dont think ive ever done that well the kid stepped back putting a swords length between them that is disappointing what do you do it for then sometimes just for practice like now for instance was that just for practice st viers eyes darted over to where archers girl had begun a horrible racket in the corner weeping and wailing sukey and annie were trying to keep her quiet with cheap brandy for a swordsman st vier is pretty easygoing but he never likes a lot of noise in a way it must be very tiring killing all those people not very youll do it again then soon the swordsman looked at him again st vier was popular on the hill those days fighting for the nobles at their parties and stuff demo matches only first blood hardly ever to the death no wonder he liked to practice in riverside nobles can be pretty squeamish but its a good bet st vier would know that voice pretty well by now the low purring voice this ragged guy was using look st vier said do you have a job for me is that what this is about the student tugged his frayed cuff down a job me i dont even have the price of a beer then what do you want i dont suppose youd kill me for free a smile forced its way onto the swordsmans face no for practice then can you fight the scholar opened his robe to show nothing hung on his belt not even a knife not particularly no thats no good then i like a challenge oh the young scholar turned away maybe later then but remember he said over his shoulder you had your chance richard st vier watched the tall man walk out of the bar alone sometimes nobles came down to riverside in disguise looking for kicks or for connection some disguise he wasnt just ragged he was dirty his face was young but thin and hollow like hunger a starving nobleman a jumpedup servant a tutor in disgrace richard shook his head poor kid whatever he was doing in riverside he was going to have an interesting time while he lasted maybe he should have bought him a beer for a sort of welcome the first day was always hard here i myself did not expect to see that alec again but then i kept hearing about him wandering riverside like a lost soul trying not to get laid but to get killed near as i could tell it should have been easy he was going about it exactly the right wayinsulting people asking stupid questions the thing is he was unarmed he had no money sometimes he made people laugh saying things no one else would dare to no one really wanted to be the one to off him he was probably crazy thats a different kind of dangerous i saw him again at rosalies a few days later i was looking over some very fine silver spoons that hal had managed to find in a house uptown and in walks the skinny kid right up to where rosalie is ladling out stew for fabian greenspan is that food he says to her or are you trying to get rid of old wash water you could use a little of both rosalie retorted fabian sniggered some of the soup he was eating came out his nose oh look the kid said its medicinal too fabian had the shakes it was early in the day for himjust past noonand rosalie wanted to feed him before he started drinking and shed have to throw him out he couldnt handle it at either end hungry rosalie asked alec hardly i like rotten pears and castoff cheese mold and ive found the best place for getting them you should try it slenderizing hey fabian protested he had a soft spot for rosalie the boy looked down his long nose well you do get thicker as you get older dont you hey fabian roared feebly and went for the kid hey said another voice a calmer voice the swordsman st vier was peeling fabian off that alec character hey richard rosalie said calmly want some stew if she doesnt like you she just ignores you the young scholar was standing very stiff i guess hed never been attacked by a guy with the shakes before or he wasnt used to being ignored richard st vier he drawled youre off your game no st vier said i ate already he was always polite even to drunks youre a disappointment the scholar went on the swordsman turned to him giving him his full attention how so a swordsmans full attention is not something you really want on you it gave me a chill the tall kids eyes glittered hard like he was fevered but his skin was pale like he was casting his final throw its been three days now you havent killed a soul dont think i havent noticed you havent even stepped on a bug i think youre vastly overrated whats the matter have you lost your nerve the swordsman stood up come with me this is it we thought goodbye scholar the scholars hands were shaking i was close enough to see that but he thrust his pale face forward and followed st vier out of the tavern it wasnt going to be a pretty death st vier wouldnt waste good swordsmanship on an unarmed man but i had a bet on with hal so we followed them out there the scholar was standing against a wall very white in the face against his black robe and the crummy stone remember he was saying fast and breathy one blow to the heart they say youre quick young men can be real fools not just the scholar but the young swordsman we all called dapper dan who must have taken a bad notion to impress st vier guys like that think being a swordsmans all about risks and big gestures and he made one now allow me i heard him say as he drew his blade st vier was st vier dan should never have shown cold steel around him someone with slower reflexes might have taken the time to notice that the blade wasnt coming in his direction but richard st vier moved fast you have to love the guy he drew and slashed right across dan from the side a gorgeous twist nobody else could have made in time dan squawked and fell and st vier said damn when he realized what hed done the scholar hadnt even had time to move out of the way he stared down at poor dan you should have let him he said it wasnt his business said st vier but i was out there and i saw he hadnt drawn until dan did whatever he was planning to do with the scholar it wasnt the long cold kiss of steel as the poets say would you like a drink they walked back into rosalies tavern together and that was that from then on you never saw them apart nobody bet on when they started sleeping together because there was no way of finding out for sure their landlady marie the whore and laundress who lets out rooms above the courtyard of the old place with the well where she washes is usually a pretty good egg but she got all prissy with master st viers business is his own and at least he pays his rent on time most months not like some but why else did st vier make it clear over and over that anyone who laid a finger on his crazy student would have him to answer to more than one bully pimp and bravo fell that year when they tried it anyway as far as st vier was concerned there was one rule dont mess with alec no matter what i guess lord horn didnt know about st viers alec rule how could he when he lived way up on the hill with the rest of them what some old noble wanted alec for was anybodys guess but not everyone was sorry when alec disappeared for a while it made the swordsman jumpy as hell though he made some inquiries killed a few hired toughs who should have known not to mess with riversiders got alec back all rightand then he went after lord horn and took care of him too well what else could he do he had his point to make but the city didnt see it that way brought st vier up on murder charges threw him in the chop nobody liked it but what could we do we dont ask anyone in the city to do us any favors we look after our own no squealers but if youre taken good luck to you alec broke that rule for st vier see of course we didnt know it at the time we thought alec had left again because he was bored or lonely or scared shitless fabian greenspan swore hed seen him lying with his throat slit off fullers way but fabian doesnt always see so clearly red sukey said hed thrown himself from the bridge because of the tragedy of his eternal love but sukey likes theatre then nimble willie came back from plying his trade over by the council hall claiming alec had passed him riding in a carriage with the duchess tremontaines crest on it all decked out in green velvet and gold lace that was a little startling because willies pretty reliable but not nearly as startling as when st vier turns up again the next day and alec a day or so later hair cut short but wearing the same old black robe rattier than ever so we couldnt help ragging on willie with so wheres the gold and velvet willie no velvetand no money either maybe he spent it all to spring st vier i know that alec is broke again because i try touching him for five in silver against my next lucky job uptown and he gives me one of those speeches that basically translates as get away from me or ill get st vier to rip your balls off nice to know theyre still such excellent friends everything back to normal except word trickles down from people with legitimate jobs up in the city meaning riversiders who just couldnt hack it any more gone up there to scrub floors and dishes that alec is in fact a very close relative of the duchess so maybe hes lying about the money but then why doesnt he buy himself some decent clothes alec came storming out of the bedroom in their rooms at maries shoving his hair back behind his ears richard stopped practicing long enough to get out of his way alec never really knew where his body was in relation to anything around him have you seen my boots alec demanded i took them off last night and theyve vanished i think someone ate them im going to the market please dont consume anything else useful while im gone the shad are in and they sell out fast ill bring some home where are my boots behind the bed ive looked there look again alec emerged fully shod clutching his robe to his throat ive lost my cloak pin its here richard picked it up off the mantel careful not to dislodge alecs small collection of precious books do you want me to come with you to protect me from murderous fishwives alec shoved his hair back behind his ears again and shook his head with annoyance as it fell forward theres nothing you can do about it richard said just wait it grows when it grows how philosophical alec drawled sarcastically how very like the wise old farmer in the tutelary readers for young people how long did it take you to grow it out the first time years alec growled and everyone still laughed at me when i got to university because i looked like a new boy it had just gotten good and long when i left the one thing i finally got right and then i had to go and cut it just to make a nice impression on the council for the duchess well it worked richard said not that it wasnt worth it alec added she nearly died when she saw me all cleaned up the hair would grow long again meanwhile there was still enough for richard to sink his fingers into and he did nobody knows who owns most of riverside but its probably alecs relatives and theyve probably buried the deeds because who really wants their very own piece of this crumbling rabbit warren like theres that crazy catlady at the top of that old pile on ferrian alley youd pay not to own that house young guys always believe in luck most of them never get old and some like that alec have it all even if they may not look it at first richard wasnt looking for the letters but the swordsman had a very good sense for what was around him he always knew where things stood in a room and he knew when anything changed the letters were hidden all over the place under the mattress behind alecs books on the mantelpiece even in an old pair of winter boots gathering dust in the corner because they needed resoling but no one could ever remember to take them out richard knew alec would never burn the letters because there was writing only on one side and alec was terrifically cheap richard could see that it was good paperthick and heavy laid the ink on it crisp and clean he had no idea what the writing spelt out but he did recognize the seals heavy with wax that alec would probably melt down sooner or later to reuse tremontaine i was there at rosalies the day the news came tremontaine willie called breathless across the tavern but alec wouldnt look up from his dice he was losing as usual but as usual refusing to quit and cut his losses hey alec listen up nimble willie finally reached the table where alec was dicing with hal and fat rodge hey he panted really he could hardly breathe didnt you hear me calling you i heard you calling someone what is it willie youre dripping like a cheap candle and you stink worse than my luck ive got news alecs fingers tightened on the side of the table and could you blame him news could always be st vier lying somewhere bleeding his guts out well spit it out were in the middle of a game here your grannys gone my granny which granny would that be willie you know what i mean its the duchess the duchess tremontaine shes dead last night i came to tell you oh really he lifted the dice and looked at them for a long time snake eyes he said and threw we all stared at the two perfect spots there in the middle of the table then alec got up and left the tavern no one saw him again for days but hal kept his money for him down to the last brass minnow tied up in a handkerchief you didnt want to piss off st vier and clearly alecs luck had turned arent you going to see her off richard asked he was practicing in their rooms with a blunttipped sword stretching and exercising against the wall which was pitted with the marks of other practice bouts alec had steel of his own a darning needle hed learned to use in his time at university it too was blunttipped which was good considering the uses to which alec put sharp objects i avoided her while she was alive it seems hypocritical to pursue her now i heard there might be fireworks you love fireworks they had fireworks last year for lord galing it cheered everyone up im sure the late duchess tremontaine would want us all to be as miserable as possible there will probably be a choir richard knew he was treading on dangerous ground but he was genuinely curious theyre not expecting you then alec stabbed at the sock oh theyre expecting me richard the show wont be complete without the idiot grandson parading with his savage swordsman wear your scholars robe richard said cheerfully its black it will give them fits shall i put a silver chain around your neck and lead you in the procession richard winced that bad eh the needle fell still in alecs hands bad oh so youd actually mind i was beginning to think you liked the idea alec hated people knowing anything about him even richard and now it was out all over the city all over riverside if you wanted to go id come with you thats all richard went back to practicing striking his sword rhythmically against the wall careful not to look at alec but hearing his acid honey voice by all means lets go to the tremontaine funeral and join the solemn procession of important people showing off just how important they really are theyre expecting us after all we wouldnt want to disappoint them and then we can poke holes in a few that they will not be expecting think what a thrill it will give the assembled mourners it will be the talk of the town the duchess will be utterly forgotten alec jabbed at the socks hole which was not getting any smaller not that she wont be forgotten soon anyway shes got no power anymore has she these people are no longer interested theyll pay their respects because everyones watching and then theyll go right back to trying to figure out whos giving the most important dinner parties now that shes gone she never liked me you know im rotten at dinner parties no conversation and i slouch she likes people who are good at things you impressed her shed like it if you went did you ever work for her never you know that go now then go up to the hill and show everyone you know how to behave properly just because im a disgrace doesnt mean you have to be why would i want to go there without you why would you want to go there with me richard put his hands on alecs shoulders lets not he said go anywhere at all he could feel the tension radiating along his arms how blissful alec drawled how domestic richard reached down to uncover alecs palm the marks that scored it were vivid red but the skin unbroken it was only a darning needle richard raised the hand to his lips the palm was hot and burning so it looked like everybody was going to the duchess tremontaines funeral except alec and he was probably the only one actually invited the rest of riverside was just going to turn up along the route which would run from her big house on the hill to the stone city outside of town the nobles would ride in procession behind and everyone would line up to watch them which was just fine with us nothing better for pickpockets than a good colorful processionand nothing makes a man want a whore faster than being reminded of mortality if alec wanted to hide the letters that kept coming richard wasnt going to say anything if alec wanted to stop crossing the river into the city wanted to give up excursions to the booksellers and the theater well he got that way sometimes the books were all too old alec claimed and the theater played nothing but comedies he detested comedies alec was drinking all the time it made him looselimbed and clumsy quarrelsome and fanciful it didnt mean anything richard thought then on their way home from the market there was a strange swordsman fixed at the end of the alley blocking their way the strangers sword was sheathed but loudly and clearly he spoke i bear challenge to david alexander tielman campion duke tremontaine for a moment richard didnt even understand the words what the hell just kill him alec said richard drew his sword ill take the challenge the other man drew and saluted is it to the death i hope so said alec they can hardly expect me to give up the duchy of tremontaine for first blood it was all over town alec was heir to tremontaine and on either side of the river people were waiting to kill him before theyd let him into tremontaine house lucky for him he had the greatest swordsman in the city at his side day and night to defend him the rules were the rules as long as st vier was there to take the challenge honor was satisfied the nobles had laid out those rules themselves to keep them from killing each other off when there were better men to die for them all st vier had to do was always be thereand never lose by the third challenge richard was getting curious is this usual when people inherit he asked stepping around the dead man in the street to clean his sword alec wiped his sleeve across his face hed barely had time to register the challenge before richard struck the final blow no its my goddamned relatives contesting the succession whats to contest werent you always her heir alec scraped something off the sole of his boot against a corner of a wall no richard did you think i was holding out on you all this time he had actually what everyone wanted to know was why why this crazy guy who didnt have enough sense to get out of riverside when he could and take his famous boyfriend with him was it some kind of a joke if he didnt want to be a duke couldnt he just say so not that we didnt enjoy the challenges nervous swordsmen from the hill paid good money to find out where his young lordship might be we told them where he might be but never where he really was so who was it then richard sheathed his sword but kept his hand on the pommel as he walked no one she wouldnt name an heir while she lived maybe she thought it would make her immortal maybe she just couldnt decide climbing the dark narrow stairs to their rooms richard watched with extra caution for signs of intruders he opened the door first and waited until it was shut behind them to say so she died without naming an heir and it automatically goes to you no richard alec flung his robe down on their only chair and said with entirely unjustified elaborate patience havent you been listening she did name me finally at the end he fished behind on human understanding and pulled out a letter heavy with seals see its all very official chosen chosen chosen like a prize rosebush at the fair by a dying woman they probably nagged to death until she just gave them a name to shut them up richard admired the elaborate writing heavy and black looped and angled so you are now the duke tremontaine it was the first time hed said it aloud it sounded very strange alec snapped the paper shut using the seals as ballast well that depends doesnt it on what on whether i live to the end of the trial period theres a trial period oh yes its open season on me until the thirty days of mourning have passed and then he dared to ask its over were safe i just have to last that long then its not my problem anymore or yours but if you dont want the duchy who says i dont want it do you i want alec said untying richards shirt to make them sweat dont you it was a little harder when they started sending down guys we knew steffis kid luxe whod been so proud when that fancy uptown swordmaster took him on and then steffi never shut up about how her kid had finally gotten himself an important job as some nobles own house swordsman and thats why her boy never came to see her anymore when luxe showed up at rosalies she was thrilled i have to admit he looked good well fed and strong dressed in new clothes they were not any nobles colors though we thought he was off duty but he wasnt he bought a round for everyone and then he said so whats new or whats happening around here or something we all looked at each other he had to know looking for st vier rosalie said bluntly shed never liked luxe that much luxe grinned he had good teeth why shouldnt i no reason everyone else is but you just got lucky in they came st vier and alec walking close together alecs head was up and he was laughing st vier had that half smile listening to him everyone got quiet not even trying to pretend they hadnt been talking about them st viers polite he nodded to the room actually he was checking it outand as alec stepped up to the counter and ordered a beer st vier grabbed him by the elbow and steered him back again said alec again his friend said luxe smiled st vier steffi moved in all tits and curls you remember my boy luxe richard right here he is come to pay us a visit luxe didnt even do her the courtesy of telling her to shut up he just kept on talking will you take my challenge on behalf of his lordship here st vier asked because if youre just showing off id rather not luxe straightened up and you saw the noblemans house servant that hed learned to be i bear challenge to the tremontaine heir he nodded at alec who was busy picking at a loose thread on his cuff that him st vier shifted his weight cutting luxe off from alec just a little more dont try guard then luxe drew there was sweat on his upper lip already he had good form though people spread out and the bets got going i was taking as many as i could so i missed some of the action then steffi was moaning no no no no no no no and rosalie had her arms wrapped around her st vier had luxe pinned to the floor sweating his blade at his throat the throat not the heart st vier said alec alec was sweating too pushing hair back from his face what ask him ask him who sent him we couldnt believe it if theres one thing swordsmen dont do its ask that question the patron pays the patron calls the shots and protects whoevers working for him so you keep your mouth shut thats the rules i dont care who sent him they can all go to hell so do i kill him then steffi screamed hell no alec said what for and turned away he walked on out of the tavern and st vier followed him we all stood staring at the man on the floor shit luxe said he was shaking and he wouldnt get up oh shit the next day i had my great idea i waited for alec on the street not in rosalies where everyone would see us i waited til i saw him out with his basket to do his marketing and i went up to him and i said look heres the thing he looked down his long nose at me way down i cant help if im short yes he said i can see that i ignored the dig you just have to i said you want a message to someone someone up on the hill maybe something you want to say but not write down he just looked at me but not in that sneery way his chin went down a little listening he had the weirdest eyes you can trust me i tried not to talk too fast which is something people say i sometimes do but it was hard with those eyes and him not saying anything back say you make them an offer a hundred royals a thousand i dunno whats it worth to them he snorted look you dont want it they do so why not benefit you save everyone a lot of grief and make a profit good for them good for you and everyone gets what they want he said slowly i hadnt thought of that well of course he hadnt just say the word i told him im your man are you the way he looked at me then if id ever doubted he was really one of them i didnt anymore it wasnt just his eyes it was his voice something curious and measuring like he was checking me out for position of third footman on the left or something im your man thats not how id meant it either i just meant it the regular way i know youre a fairminded guy so i wont even name a price i justwell you know where to find me he nodded turned and walked away richard met alec on the stairs coming up it was too dark for alec to see how bloody the swordsmans shirt was but he could smell it dont go up richard said theres a dead man in there in there alec pointed with his chin to their door at the top of the stairs he was carrying a basket of fruit the first cherries were in from the country and hed spent far too much on them its a mess richard said he walked alec back down the narrow stairs ill tell marie to clean it up down in the courtyard alec could see the corners of the swordsmans mouth were white ill tell her marie was white too i didnt she said i swear didnt let the poor bastard in i should think not we know you hate cleaning up blood marie its all right but who she said who told them where you live everyone knows where we live alec drawled its a wonder they didnt try it before maybe they did and got sick of waiting last time dont worry about it how much longer richard asked when shed gone upstairs with her pail and some rags and sent a boy to find someone to remove the body seven days alec said and then theyll stop sending you new toys to play with i dont like them messing up the house neither does marie ill draw her another bucket of water she appreciates these little gestures i think st vier said well sleep at rosalies tonight what was i doing out that night trying to earn a living same as everyone else the job finished early and i was headed to rosalies for a drink i wasnt trying to spy on anybody but i saw that guy alec come out rosalies back door the one nobody uses alone he had a lantern the moon was good enough for me alec was moving fast but a moment later i saw st vier come out the same door he didnt have a light and i thought hed catch up to alec soon enough but he didnt st vier wasnt really dressed eithershirt unlaced jacket unbuttonedthough he did have his sword in his hand he strapped it on as he walked slowly and quietly following the man with the lantern it didnt take a wizard to know something was up i shouldve turned around and gone straight into the tavern maybe but i thought who knows maybe theyll need backup so i followed them alec went to the river across from the university good i thought hes finally going back to where he came from but he just stood on the bank looking over st vier stayed in the shadows looking at alec when alec moved closer to the water st vier got tense like he was thinking the beanpole might throw himself in but then alec moved on walking along the embankment trailing his hand along the low wall like it was some giant pet when the wall petered out he swung back into riverside passing through the old market which was pretty much empty except for a few people whod built themselves a fire to keep out the chill and the spooks til dawn they glanced up when alec passed trying to make themselves small not to be noticed he didnt even look st vier walked right by them too a moment later i figured it wouldnt hurt to say hello and see if it was anyone i knew but they werent too friendly it was harder in the little streets to keep behind them alec was moving slower like it was a bright spring day and he had all the time in the world to get from rosalies tavern to his own lodgings i heard st vier had killed a man there today they didnt go in alec leaned his head against the crumbling stone archway to the courtyard his arm was up over his head and his fist was clenched he spread his fingers out slowly ran them down the outer wall he backed away slowly from the house like he didnt want to let go even slower he walked down the street where it was so dark we both would have lost him without the lantern did he know st vier was following him how could he not how could he think hed get so far in the night alone and did st vier know it was me behind him he must have or maybe not maybe everyone was out taking a little midnight walk that just happened to go all around riverside all around the places the two of them liked to eat and drink and buy things make trouble and get out of it kill and get talked about all of them like a farewell tour alec crossed riverside all the way to the bridgethe good bridge the big stone one that takes you to the side of the city with all the nice stuff the excellent shops and pretty little houses the wide paths by the river where people go walking under the trees until you climb all the way up to the hill where the nobles in their mansions can enjoy fresh breezes and a really good view there are some nasty bits too with nasty people in them who dont care who your boyfriend is or codes of honor or anything if alec was planning to sneak up to tremontaine house with his lantern in the dark hed better be careful but the dark was a little less dark now you could see his bony ragged form against the sky behind him he went up to the bridge but didnt cross itdidnt even set one foot on it he just stood there staring at the city then he held his lantern up high high over his head like he was showing it to the river or showing the whole world where he stood and he goes and throws the whole thing far out into the water alec turned around then back to riverside back to us i couldnt see his face but i heard his voice richard he asked into the graying light the funny thing was he was looking in the wrong direction st vier stepped out of the shadows lets go home they walked right past me most people in riverside lock their doors if they own anything of value but richard st vier had gotten out of the habit this morning though he found the door to their rooms locked tight they had to go back down to maries to get her key she handed them the cold old iron youll want to keep this ill put a gate over the courtyard entry too maybe should i not yet their rooms were spotless the old elmwood floor scrubbed almost white like the pages of a book said alec he took a burnt stick from the hearth and wrote something on the floor with it then scuffed it out with his foot leaving a charcoal smear richard stood in the middle of the room the furniture was off it had been knocked around during the fight of course and then marie had moved it to do the floor and not put it back exactly right shed missed a spot of blood on the wall he pulled the chaise longue back to its place between the window and the fireplace the inlaid table alec had pawned his velvet coat for should be closer to the wall he remembered the day alec had reappeared in riverside fresh from his last fight with the duchess groceries in hand and tiny shards of glass still glittering on the shoulders of that coat alec flung himself into their ratty old chaise longue stuffing oozed he twisted uncomfortably got up took a book from the pile on the mantelpiecewhich marie had dusted and straightenedand tried the chaise again richard went into the next room where his opponent had been hiding waiting it looked all right but he hated knowing anyone had been in there he opened his sword chest everything seemed in place he took out a practice sword and went back to the front room to work for a while the room was quiet except for the rhythmic thud of his feet on the floor the sword on the wall then alec looked up from the book he hadnt been reading richard he said lets go to tremontaine house all right richard put the sword up when how long will it take you to change your shirt and you are you going to change alec considered his own frayed cuffs no no i dont think so he pulled on his scholars robe and then went out the door and down the stairs without looking back richard did not stop to change his shirt he grabbed the nearest decent sword and followed alec down the narrow stairs catching up with him on the landing alec didnt say anything he just kept walking walking toward the bridge he walked down the narrow lanes where the old houses practically touched each other in perpetual twilight he walked along the streets where the gutters overflowed past the lion fountain with the broken nose where women were washing linens and then it turned into a story thats the only way he could describe it where are you going asked lucy diver and when alec answered tremontaine house lucy put down her washing and said oh yeah mind if i come too alec shrugged why not and lucy did they walked through the market square and people looked up from their trading in freshcaught fish and stolen watches hey alec toothless john called out i got good trout for you today but alec didnt stop where are you going john asked and lucy answered tremontaine house and john fell in with them they came upon fat rodge and hal and where are you going they asked and john answered up the hill and they came along too they picked up three or four more this way and after that people just started joining because it was a crowd and it was a nice day to be going somewhere new i was one of the ones who marched that day the day that funny kid alec became the duke tremontaine a whole big bunch of us parading through riverside drunk and sober some at the end of their day and some just starting out because everyone likes to be in on the action the girls were waving ribbons in the air and everyone was singing something different st vier was guarding all of us like some crazy wedding procession and other swordsmen joined in too making a very nice appearance for a guy with a mouth like that on him alec was awful quiet in fact i dont think he ever said a word just kept on walking a beanpole in black paying no attention to anyone around him just walking like he knew if he stopped the whole thing would fall apart sometimes we even had to run to keep up with him when we got to the bridge we kept right on going we marched through the city past all the shops and the fancy houses singing and carrying on laughing as people fell back out of our way and we heard them shouting and screaming and calling to each other to run away or to come and see some even lined up cheering i heard riverside and tremontaine and a whole lot else besides but we didnt stop we marched all the way up the broad streets to the hill past all those high walls and goldandiron gates until we came to the biggest and fanciest the one that was alecs and they had to let him in we lifted him up on our shoulders and carried him all the way thereover the bridge all the way up the hill to tremontaine house after all he was one of ours oblivion by calvin klein by christopher fowler christopher fowler has written more than thirty novels and volumes of short stories including roofworld spanky psychoville and calabash he lives in kings cross london his work divides into black comedy horror satire mystery and sets of tales unclassifiable enough to have publishers tearing their hair out he is now writing the bryant may series a set of classic mystery novels featuring two elderly argumentative london detectives in his autobiography paperboy was published about this story he says i had been planning a novel about a shopaholic housewifeturnedvigilante for some while and it proved to be one of those books everyone seems to love but no one manages to publishindeed it recently got to page proofs before the last publishing house collapsed so with the character still in my head i freewheeled an urban fantasy around her to create something entirely new my visions of cities are always happiest in their decline so it was important to have an exotic apocalyptic feel to this tale its about a fracture in the consumption cycle that might just turn out to be a good thing on the dankest most miserable saturday afternoon in september helen abbott went shopping in london with a derringer subcompact pistol in her handbag the term shopping hardly seemed adequate what helen did was blast through selfridges department store like an armed witch on a mission spending money was an intimate thing for her so she made sure she knew the entire history of the places where she shopped just as it was a point of honor to memorize the names of all the assistants who offered her their services she was such a familiar face in selfridges that the store detectives kept an eye on her thinking she must be part of some longterm thieving reconnaissance party she did not look poor of course so they suspected her less she always dressed for shopping as if going on a date smart beige patentleather heels and a sleek chocolatetoned skirt never jeans or trainers because she was anxious to be noticed and treated with respect it was not a good idea to shop in a highly emotional state on that day frenzied by the latest proof of her husbands infidelity a used durex fetherlite condom tossed carelessly onto the back seat of his mercedesworse than last time when it was just a gold earring she was one thin step away from sitting down in the middle of the street and screaming convinced that shopping in quantity released pheromones she ticktacked at a furious speed across the marble floors ankles flashing back and forth charm bracelet jangling begging the buzz to kick in the remains of the summer season fashions had been left on the shelves like hard centers discarded in a ravaged chocolate box the sales staff as listless and fractious as children trapped in class as she circumnavigated the territory a huntergatherer on a search for hangered prey she pushed ever deeper into the undergrowth of her desires it was a good way to spend the day lately helen abbott had become fascinated with the textures of fashion fabrics and as she walked she mentally alphabetized them into alpaca astrakhan batiste brocade cotton calico cambric cheviot chiffon chenille crepe de chine cretonne and corduroy by the time she arrived at damask denim and dimity she had already made her first purchase and lost her place in the lexicon of luxury helen had given up on her marriage and her dreams and only the thought of finding new ways to spite her husband kept her from slitting her own throat she hated graham and all of his relatives with an intensity that frightened her the best way to remain calm she had found was to fight through every inch of the day that was why she booked sessions of yoga pilates step classes aerobics rowing and weight training six months ago her husband tried to strangle her in a restaurant and she broke his wrist the fitness kick was wearing off though last week she had been thrown out of her local spas flotation tank for smoking in it helen used to work for a small publishing company in the west end where she became a kind of hero figure because of her inventive rudeness to men but they took away her job when she got pregnant and couldnt restore it to her when she lost the baby because it would have looked too obvious now she worked for a media company where nothing discernible was produced a photograph of her office would have offered no clues to her purpose in the world she was paid an astonishing amount of money to send pointless emails and sit in meetings saying nothing voicing an opinion was a good way to get fired when people asked what she did for a livingnot that they ever didshe told them that she showed up for work helen never watched tv because tv was for poor people besides the news was all bad she never went for a walk because the streets were unthinkable so she shopped passing through the outdoor part of her world as quickly and quietly as possible shopping at selfridges was warm rain on bare skin the cyclamen zephyrs that drifted over her from the perfumery inflamed her membranes she loved the way iceblue counters underlit the ceramic faces of the cosmetic clerks turning them into mannequins their frozen tableaux set her pulse racing they drifted about her with testers and face brushes as if wielding sacrificial tools in some arcane forgotten rite in housewares the hanging crescendos of copper pots tightened helens chest muscles until she could barely breathe there were no stains in these stage kitchens because no food was ever cooked sometimes she pulled open the counter drawers and breathed in their emptiness she studied the beds covered with purplebeaded casbah cushions the pastel french cotton sheets imprisoned in plastic as smooth as plate glass the polished maple dining tables laid for guests who would never ruin everything by turning up when she touched the smokily elegant vases too slender to hold grocery store flowers but perfectly designed for a single arum lily she felt safe in the arms of manufacturers after shopping she always wanted a cigarette and a soapy wash because the entire process was about sex buying an inappropriate dress was the equivalent to a thoughtless onenight stand whereas designer shoes constituted a longterm commitment filled with recrimination and at least one decent orgasm she hadnt been penetrated for over eighteen months at first the dull ache of desire would not go away but after a while it no longer bothered her these days her clitoris was located somewhere near harrods as she swept through oxford streets great cathedral of expenditure she pondered on the verb to spend it had a sexual connotation of course to empty the juices to flush out but she wondered why people talked about spending days as though everything was currency she felt spent the world felt spent helen really wanted a cigarette she smoked because it annoyed her husband to find cigarette butts left in egg yolks coffee cups toilets and beds she sunbathed naked in the garden because it annoyed the neighbors took ages at supermarket tills because it annoyed the staff and lit up in restaurants just to watch the look of horror on diners faces these days nonsmokers reacted to cigarette smoke as if they had just been involved in a sarin gas attack sometimes they actually screamed fuck em thought helen there are bigger things to worry about we just pretend there arent how well we all pretend everyone agreed that graham abbott was an absolute sweetheart who doted on his wife but the gentler and kinder he was the more she detested him and the more he fucked around he sold false ceilings and had a number of gastric disorders that required him to pick at small amounts of food all day so that she never needed to cook for him at night which was just as well because the only thing she could do was eggs an egg being the one food source you actually have to damage to eat helen insolently tapped her gold card against capped teeth as she considered different sweater designs the staff prowled after her like hungry dogs there was always an adrenaline rush when she bought something really expensive a race of blood cells to the brain and heart as she pressed her card into the reader and watched the assistant delicately folding tissue as if packing a rare dead insect for a long voyage by steamer trunk on she went past the tv monitors of starved catwalk girls dipping at the turn of the runway up into menswear a square acre of wood chrome and marble where everything smelled of citrus musk and leatherall the things she had never smelled on her husband who only smelled of cigarettes and computers soon she was carrying so many purchases that the bag ropes left japaneseprisonerofwar marks on her arms through the food hall with its aged ham hocks hanging like the thighs of longdead chorus girls past rows of shocked fish arranged on ice like jeweled purses past the jars of exotic pickles as mysterious as fetuses in a medical museum to the perfume counters patrolled by women like bony cats where she stood paralyzed breathing deep the smell of frangipani honeysuckle gardenia jasmine lavender carnation eucalyptus lemon sandalwood and ambergris the atomizers sprays sachets pomanders powders potpourris balms gels oils soaps lotions sticks and fixatives pumped such a sweet cacophony into the air that the hall shimmered and slipped in her vision she breathed deeper in fact she breathed so deeply that she passed out like an art lover suffering from stendhal syndrome helen abbott regained consciousness to find a goldbraided attendant leisurely picking his nose while peering into her shopping bags and evaluating the contents as she revived he mimed such an extravagant show of helping her to her feet that he attracted a crowd which he was then able to disperse by imperiously waving his gloved hands about like a policeman on point duty until she could gather her purchases and make a break for the exit sometimes helen shoplifted today she stuck her hand into her skirt pocket and closed pearlized nails around a pair of earrings they were golden yellow sunflowers bright cheerful fake looking she owned a lot of plastic jewelery because there were wonderful colors in plastic that you couldnt find in nature whenever she flew on a shopping raid over the west end she bought something for her charm bracelet on this trip it was a carat gold teddy bear with a tiny secret compartment in its stomach an object of such utter vacuity that it actually defied you to find a use for it helen abbott understood a fundamental principle that shopping was the one thing you could do without ever having to be frightened it was a sacred rite that had become her strength and guidance conventional religion offered salvation in the afterlife but shopping provided immediate absolution it had the power to heal to save and restore helen felt she would make a fantastic worshipper in a cargo cult she stroked the barrel of the gun in her purse and stepped into the street as she exited from the main entrance of selfridges she felt as though she were leaving the shelter of the church the edges of oxford street were crusted with rough sleepers like calcium deposits around a drain along the tops of the victorian buildings running indiscriminately over the oncegraceful roofs and windows were red dotmatrix reports filled with news so bad that no one read them anymore she passed a gap store and the irony of its name did not escape her the only gap here was the one between rich and poor she rushed home as if passing through the atmosphere of a hostile planet helen started chainsmoking when outdoors and drinking hard liquor from ten in the morning there were two blenders in her kitchenone for her husbands fruit shakes he had high cholesterol and the other for banana daiquiris the house was empty from am to pm six days a week so on her days off helen was able to spend the day alone peering through the heavily barred windows honing her bitterness at her fitness center she repented with leg weights every morning but then she came home and sinned again hitting the drinks cabinet with a level of vengeful punishment that was usually only found among nuns that week while the rainy gales of a london summer scoured the increasingly derelict suburban streets helens house grew so cold that only her startling bursts of anger could heat it back to life her husband stayed out late then stopped coming home at all on the last fishtankgray saturday afternoon of the month helen headed for a lessexclusive shopping mall on the outskirts of town its neon corridors were populated by tautfaced teenaged girls with hoop earrings and bare midriffs their ponytails threaded through diamantÃ© baseball caps their plastic pushchairs imprisoning stupefied tots consumers drifted in stately distance like seurat figures there were nearly a dozen megastores linked by a central car park with her pupils widened and her tubes unblocked by so many glittering secondrate retail opportunities helen set off to smack up her american express card first of all she bought shoes not real ones for walking in but a pair for slowly crossing her legs on a bar stool and sending young men into inarticulate conflictions of desire the sight of the gaudy heels sparkling on a black velvet dais like some rediscovered peruvian artifact overrode the genetic defenses that governed her ability to think logically they were so obscenely expensive that she had to screw up her eyes to look at the bill then it was time to hit inhabit a furniture shop where she unthinkingly purchased a spindlelegged regencia table nest a locarno foldaway lounge serving unit a carriage clock a dozen silvertrimmed tablemats depicting scenes from the crimean war and a huge china statue of a leopard scratching its claws on a tree she arranged to have them delivered and gave a false address helen blimpton dingley dell bombokoland nobody questioned the delivery instructions they merely loaded them into the computer with a holding smile and printed out her receipts in petland she put a deposit on a borzoi puppy and an inbred hairless cat that you had to wipe down all the time by the time she reached sparkles the discount jewelry outlet she was being trailed by a suspicious security guard the assistant refused to let her open an account there because she had become confused about her fake home address and foolishly presented the girl with three options each of them more ridiculous than the one before when helen surveyed a rack of diamonique catherine the great choker necklaces the strange gleam in her eye made the security guard wonder whether she was on day release or at least coming off medication either way he watched as she slipped a threebandclasp wristlet into her jacket pocket on the way to the exit seconds later he pinned her over a display case of rather desirable handbags the police were called and the manager sent for when the cops showed up they seemed more interested in discussing the previous nights football the manager of sparkles was a slender asian man with thrustup hair and a permanently surprised look on his face as though he had just walked away from a car accident he spoke with the guard and when he recognized helen his expression became even more surprised you know this lady asked one of the cops shes a regular customer please let her sit down helen collapsed on a divan as the manager explained that it was probably just an unfortunate mistake and that he would not press charges she felt sure he knew she was guilty but he let her go preferring to protect someone he considered to be a longterm investment she would return he hoped to gratefully spend a fortune in his store the next time she was afflicted with a shopping braincloud she needed to clear her head and start thinking straight so she shared a mug of coffee with the manager who politely suggested that she might like to arrange twentyfourmonth payment plans with him she agreed so enthusiastically that she felt guilty about climbing out of the window of the ladies toilet and legging it across the car park to the next store in world of washrooms her mastercard such a manly sadistic name appeared for fresh purchases above her material girl played from hidden speakers at just the right volume required to send people mad this particular corporate cd of shoppings greatest hits had been rescored for bongos moog and theremin making helen feel as if she had wandered into an old science fiction film for the sheer hell of it she bought a freestanding chrome towel rack two rhapsody moldedceramic toothbrush sconces an onyx soap holder shaped like buttocks the comfort luxury dralon candlewick pedestal mat available in avocado or pink martini and a ladypore magnifying mirror with builtin makeup tray the staff nearly had to pull her off the shagcovered fauxbamboo laundry hamper and combiheated towel rail she reached the end of the chromerailed floor and snapped a vacant sales assistant from her reverie the girl asked her how she would like to pay with a gunslingers wristflick helen withdrew the mastercard and placked it onto the counter with a sound as satisfying as the snap of her husbands condom coming off the assistant rang everything up then zipped the card through her credit link while she waited she stared into the middle distance and touched the edges of her lacquered hair as if gingerly reading braille when she checked the readout her cheeks crinkled very slightly as though she had just experienced the misery of trapped wind im afraid this one is invalid she explained returning it there might be a fault with the card she didnt believe it for a second and wanted helen to know that she didnt despite the necessity of maintaining the stores politeness policy helen knew her type she could read more nuances into the guarded smiles of service personnel than marcel proust sudden insolvency was an unusual and unpleasant experience she casually riffled through her purse and submitted a lessscorched card and when that didnt work a third in a mounting state of mortification she went through seven more but none of them registered she could feel sweat forming in the small of her back she had no checkbook anymorewho didand had no other way of paying finally the assistant jealously took back her products like a peepshow manager deciding that her viewing time was up helen could tell that the assistant was disappointed with her a teacher marking an f on her favorite pupils work her customer respect vanished as she desecrated the freshly packed treasures helen could not bear it watching her tear open the tissue wrappings was like watching someone rip orchids apart she had been cheated of her shopping climax it wasnt as though shed been looking forward to taking everything homethat part of the process was a postcoital duty like remaking the bedso she mumbled some excuse about having accidentally demagnetized her strips and fled outside on the street she felt shockingly exposed the nonshoppers around her all seemed drunk stoned or mad a fat man with a shaved ginger head was being copiously sick into an octagonal concrete litter bin filled with mcdonalds boxes her fingers closed over the derringer in her bag warming it another man passed her with blood pouring down the center of his face as if his head had been split in two the poor always seemed to be fighting each other instead of going after someone rich they shot up schools instead of storming into financial institutions there were no buses in sight the sky was a strange color helen felt unusual her purse yielded seven pounds fifty not enough for a taxi she hated the thought of being packed like pencils on a filthy train and arriving home in a sticky sheen of sweat to sit in the kitchen staring at the spot where her crisp white cardboard bags should be standing she knew graham had canceled her cards in revenge for being exposed once more as an adulterer he was authorized to do that he played golf with her bank manager she needed a drink she had stopped keeping vodka and orange premixed in a bleach container under the sink after swigging from the wrong bottle shopping bred a discontent that could only be assuaged by more spending drug addiction would have been a healthier option at least she wouldnt have to monitor her weight and would get regular sex from strangers beneath clouds the color of rancid liver she walked to the nearest vehicle in the car park a crappedup blue renault megan the driver was surprised but made no attempt to take the gun from her the derringer was welded to her hand its steel casing matched to her body temperature she waggled it at him opened the passenger door and slipped inside she noticed his eyes brown with black lashes dirty curls over a single dark eyebrow what do you want he asked genuinely puzzled whats your name nathan who are you helen she slapped the dashboard with her free hand drive nathan insisted she should keep the gun pointed toward the floor while they were inside the car which turned out to be a good move because the handle was so slick with sweat that she dropped it under the seat when they hit the first trafficcalming chicane they rode like this for a while past burnedout homes that backed right up against luxury stores pull in here now what he asked calmly putting the gearshift into park i shop for clothes and you pay for everything how is this going to work asked nathan they were walking toward the bright glass entrance of another mall how are you going to try on dresses in a cubicle while keeping a gun trained on me i wont have to try anything on im just going to buy things i know my size in seventeen different countries of manufacture so ill only have to use a fitting room if i see something i like from estonia or portugal youre a retail opportunist and youre on my territory now helen warned him if shopping was a university course id have a chair at oxford she wondered if she had gone too far this time her condition seemed to be getting out of hand i think youve got a problem nothing i cant handle in here they walked into dkny half an hour before the store was due to shut helen kept her eyes on her hostage nathan seemed vaguely amused by her behavior she swept up a whole new wardrobe jumpers jackets belts and pairs of jeans from the racks whenever nathan turned around to complain or to ask where they were going next she allowed the gleaming barrel of the gun to become visible behind her bag like a flasher exposing himself to a child she picked up a trouser suit and a pair of rhinestone evening sandals from dolce gabbana then pushed nathan in the direction of marks spencer she no longer cared whether the cctv could see her what do you think the gray or the blue she asked holding different brassieres against her breasts i dont know i really dont care her hostage replied sulkily she let him see the muzzle of the gun make a decision the blue this is like being married nathan shoved his hands into his pockets do you want me to sit down over there and leaf through magazines while you rob the till he was sexy in a degenerate way probably about the same age as her but more worn in he seemed less concerned about being shot than being embarrassed she changed her clothes in the cubicle with nathan standing on the other side and the gun trained through the door balancing on one leg like an armed flamingo was not an easy thing to do shopping had been her drug of choice and she had gone for one final overdose hoping it would now be out of her system she applied some lipstick while targeting nathan in the makeup mirror annie oakley attempting a trick shot as she did so she caught sight of a cashier peering at them around a rack of remaindered skirts but when she looked back the girl had vanished just stay close enough for me to kill you if i have to she piled her hostage high and aimed him at the checkout on the way nathans mobile rang she nudged him with the gun barrel answer it he listened for a moment hi no im not going to be able to get there he covered the phone its my mother she wants to know where i am where am i he took a look around marks spencers were in mixed separates but i think were heading for knickers and pantyhose no i havent met someone they waited awkwardly by the counter as a listless cashier detagged the items and folded them into carrier bags helen felt the burning panic that had been roaring about inside her receding as each purchase received its tissuepaper prepuce nathan withdrew a platinum amex card and handed it to the cashier she almost fell in love with him whats next nathan asked as they moved toward the exit overhead a soothing voice told them the stores were closing and reminded customers to remain securityconscious as they made their way to the car park helen was disappointed because there was a cartier concession on the first floor and shed have liked a platinum lovebracelet nathan had gotten off lightly give me a minute she told him ill think of something youre a very unusual woman call me helen so what do you want to do now helen he asked dinner arson blackmail when you abduct someone its a good idea to have a plan she had no answer for him now that she had shopped the familiar thrill was fading to postcoital guilt they reached the car with a trolley full of purchases and he began loading them onto the rear seat you dont know do you he pushed look in the back of the car all the clothes you dont want people get so restless they dont know what to do with themselves you have to figure this out what the hell is it you want i dont know how i turned into this horrible person she said trying not to let her face twitch were given too much and its not enough so go and find yourself i dont want to find myself i want to find someone else what you want me to feel sorry for you i have to go to work you can come with me but put the fucking gun away nathan ran a soupandsandwich van for the homeless under a dripping railway arch the services were dying out he said they had become unfashionable and could no longer find sponsors he recited the facts a sermon he had delivered too many times the average life expectancy of those below the poverty line was forty two paupers died on the london streets every day the homeless could stand three weeks of sleeping rough before longterm problems set in a simple state of divorce was enough to force you into the open air perhaps a speech was required before the doling out of food she thought like a victorian lecture helen remembered a mauve cotton sweater a purchase on her last spree it had been carefully folded into white tissue with its arms crossed like a mummy carapace then placed into a stout blue box with a diagonal purple ribbon knotted at one corner it had cost nearly seven hundred pounds she watched nathan serving free dayold cheese sandwiches donated to make the difference between getting by and going hungry a young man in a fur hood leaned against the wall of the arch noisily pissing when he realized she was standing nearby he braked in midflow dont let me stop you she said raising a hand and averting her eyes youre in my bathroom lady the young man buttoned his fly and spat at her legs she waited in the cold as nathan handed out sandwiches to a line that showed no sign of diminishing a little after midnight he closed the van and drove her to the edge of the thames they walked across a litterstrewn concourse as bare as a disused runway to a yellow metal ships container butted up against a beech tree nathan slipped into a diagonal shadow helen hesitated nathan beckoned not everyone is out to hurt you he opened a padlock on a dented steel panel and shoved the door back with a ferrous scrape wait he disappeared inside a match flared and gradually the interior of the oblong box was illuminated the container was constructed of flat steel panels without windows but it had been decorated like the bosphorus selamlik of a turkish pasha rolls of handmade silk in sharp shades of purple yellow and blue swathed the walls a carved emerywood table was covered in copper bowls and fat stone jugs a divan covered in crushed crimson velvet stood on a tattered persian rug cupboards were rubbeddown river driftwood bleached white a black cat with yellow eyes stretched itself across a pile of cushions its all stuff people have chucked away have a glass of wine i doubt its what youre used to your skins so pale is it as soft as it looks he teased out the words with his hands you live here when youre not at the sandwich van i spend most of my time on building sites im working on the electrics at the mall he pulled up his tshirt to reveal a belt lined with different drill bits like gun cartridges his stomach was flat and brown but you have a platinum credit card it belongs to a dead guy i found his body in one of the offices this morning itll run out soon and the car that belongs to my mother what do you do i spend is that all pretty much where did you get the gun i bought it i had a fantasy of using it for target practice in selfridges homewares department not on people on soft furnishings i thought you loved all that shit its complicated the things i own usually end up owning me my signature scent has its own web site for gods sake nathan smiled theres nothing to be afraid of this is just what happens when the world collapses its a perfectly natural thing gounod said our houses are not in the street any more the street is in our houses what happens after that oh both the streets and the houses disappear and we start all over again i think youre helping to speed up the process he filled two scratched blue tumblers with wine from a box they touched glasses and drank nathan watched her with amusement you say theres nothing to be afraid of ive been afraid all my life you dont seem afraid do you know about the legend of the green man its a pagan myth that exists in almost every history of england but you can find him in many churches there are sixty depictions of the green man in exeter cathedral alone he goes back far beyond christian legends who is he a forest creature that destroys dying cities and returns them to nature the result of mixing sex and soil hes benign and terrifying he has a leafy face and tendrils sprouting from his mouth and nose his hair is made from grass his body is made from roots and flowers and branches he is both cruel and gentle hes coming back to turn the cities into forests how do you know hes coming back he lives inside everyone including you including me and you i think i should go nathan suddenly leaned forward and kissed her pushing hard his right hand slipped across her stomach and up to her breasts the left supported her in the small of her back it seemed a good idea to lie down on the velvet divan especially as his mouth was still glued to hers and was gently forcing her in that direction he weighed almost nothing she could hardly feel him straddled across her instead she felt the warmth of his thighs where they touched her hips his forearms against the sides of her chest a wide tongue reaching into the back of her mouth for what seemed like days at some point latershe could not remember whenhis shirt came off and she heard buttons bouncing on the floor his dark soft skin smelled of sandalwood and underarm sweat that lingered on her fingers the base of his erection pressed a denimclad post against her crotch as he unpinned her arms and guided her hands around his hard buttocks his chest hair formed a perfect black trapezoid a ladder of tiny curls tracing to his navel and into the low waistband of his loosened jeans the wide dry palm of his hand covered her pubic bone as he slipped his fingers inside her pants the shock of a young mans cool bare hand over her sex was extraordinary she could not recall the last time someone had cupped her so gently opening her lightly with the tips of his fingers helen sank deep into the cushions her chocolate skirt sliding from her legs for so long she had been constricted by the curse of propriety strapped into a sensible brassiere and expected to behave as if she were shocked and disapproving all the time but what was all the respectability for what had the city given her back apart from a wider choice of fabric patterns she knew she wanted him inside her and allowed him to push her deeper into musky warm darkness the muscles in his slim brown arms lifting and widening as he raised his body over hers each firmly guided stroke burying a hot dark beam farther and farther into her flesh until she could feel his stomach tense and their raised pelvic bones grate hard against each other a cauterizing molten center to their joined bodies that could light up the little cabin and provide enough electrical power for most of the shops in oxford street it was a seduction conducted backward starting with the fierce hard culmination his eyes never leaving hers his body pulling back and pushing in with decreasing connection penetrate and withdraw gentler and gentler resolving to a faint and tender kiss some minutes later she realized he was sitting beside her smoking she dressed slowly and carelessly come back if you like he said over his shoulder ill be here she could not see his smile but knew it was wide and white and dangerous she didnt care how much he had practiced it on other women she liked the idea of being one of the other women it made her feel normal somehow involved part of something powerful rising carefully to her feet and testing the ground to stop it from swaying she tried not to lose her balance she smoothed her hair back behind her ears in an attempt to look vaguely sensible and in control and pulled the container door open a crack as nathan refastened his jeans and took a slug of wine outside she drew a deep breath of dank river air trying to work out exactly what had just happened although it was still night a warm gray nimbus of neverdarkness profiled the skyline of the embankment in contrast nathans cabin was a black silhouette in the center of one of the most overcrowded cities in the world it could have been a chateau in rural france beset by cawing crows and clawbranched trees shunned by villagers abandoned to old gods her lurid yellow shopping bags lay scattered around the cabin like votive offerings of giant sweets a stray cat emerged from one of them and yowled she looked up at the swirling sky something had changed the air was alive with small insects she thought she could hear the roots of trees crackling like scalded ice as they meandered beneath the softening tarmac of the road helen abbott breathed deeply with each passing second she felt darker than the night and brighter than the stars something was kindling and catching within her she could smell it in her nostrils a freshness stronger and sharper than clarins sheer citrus moisturizing mist or coco de mer bitter chocolate body butter in fact when she tried to think of all those spotlit branded jars and bottles lined up on the store shelves she could only conjure images of exploding glass and splattering ointments rack after rack of skimpy garments bursting into flame shriveling and browning in the heat packets of tights spitting droplets of molten plastic a plexiglas bathroom shelf unit held up by plastic mermaids shattering into a million blunt shards a devonshire buffalograin boudoir chair blasted into scraps and springs and stuffing a thousand sizzling pairs of nearly identical trainers a million rugs and glasses vases and table lamps and coffee machines and computer keyboards all catching alight and melting lifting and rolling and blowing away each department store flared up in turn with a sudden whump like indoor lightning followed by the popping of lightbulbs and the gentle bubbling of gilt paintwork they glowed fiercely and soon burned themselves out into blackened shells the city was now dark and dead and windy washed with the stinging baptism of rainfall the streets split apart by emerald offshoots springing from the sap of rapidly rising trees helen shook the visions from her head her cheeks breasts buttocks legs were burning she dug into her bag checked that the gun was loaded aimed it high and fired a single bullet into the sky then she hurled the derringer as hard as she could in the direction of the river and headed home her high heels were starting to pinch her so she took them off and walked barefoot across the concrete toward the station in the warmth left by her departing soles grass sprouted up through the cracks in the pavement fairy gifts by patricia briggs patricia briggs is the numberone new york times bestselling author of the mercy thompson and the alpha and omega series as well as a number of traditional fantasy novels she was born and raised in butte montana a city steeped in stories and storytellersand the odd hobgoblin or two she currently lives in eastern washington state with her husband children and various and numerous animals butte montana present day middecember cold didnt bother him anymore but he remembered how it felt the sharp bite of winter on toes fingers nose and ears even with modern adaptations ten degrees below zero wouldnt be pleasant neither the temperature nor falling snow kept people out of the streets for the christmas stroll however hot apple cider freshly made sausages and abundant cookies under the streetlights strove to make up for the nasty weathernone of which were useful sustenance for him he passed them by with scarcely a glance well then he thought impatient with himself what are you doing here he had no more answer now than hed had two nights ago when hed arrived the people who lived in the old mining town had always known how to party in a hundred years that hadnt changed brutal climate hard and dangerous work brought a certain clarity to the need for pleasure his chinese face garnered a few lookscuriosity no more a century ago butte had had a large chinese population then the looks hed garnered had been dismissive up on the street level but full of eagerness or fear down in his fathers opium den in the mining tunnels where thomas had been both guide and enforcer it was not just the looks that had changed the streets were not cobbled there were no trolleys no horses steep streets had been somewhat tamed and the townonce a bustling placehad a desolate air despite the festive decorations buildings he remembered were abandoned or gone altogether replaced by parking lots or parks the few restored or wellkept buildings only made the rest look worse some of the changes were vast improvements the smelters and oreprocessing plants now long closed meant that the sulfurous fog that had made it difficult to see across the street was gone the air was immensely more pleasant to breath the night was free of the constant noise of the machinery that churned day and night the crowd that moved beside him on the sidewalks was a respectable size though much smaller than those that had filled the streets of his memories he hadnt decided to count that on the good side or the bad side of the changes he put his hands in front of his mouth and blew a gesture to blend in no more even had his hands been frozen his breath wouldnt warm them he didnt know why hed come back here just in time for the christmas stroll no less he wasnt a christian despite the nuns who had ensured he could read and write an education for her children was the only thing his quiet obedient mother had ever stood up to his father for if if he did believe hed have to believe he was damned and had been since his father had brought him to the old man butte montana april here is the son his father said his voice less clear than usual it was hard to talk with a mouth that had been hit so many times last night his father had been set upon by a group of miners who wanted opium and had not wanted to pay for it they had beaten father and tied him up it had been thomass day to protect the shop his older brother tao was away on other business thomas had been shot in the arm and while he tried to stanch the blood one of the miners had cracked his skull with a beer bottle when thomas awoke his mother had bandaged his hurts and was crying silently as she sometimes did from tao because his father would not look at him nor talk to him he learned that his father had given the men what they wanted and more arsenic in the opium would ensure that they thieved from no one again but despite the ultimate victory in the fight his father felt that his honor and that of his family had been impinged he made it clear that he blamed thomas for the shame the next morning his father had left tao in charge of the laundry and gone out to speak with friends hed been gone most of the day and thomas had worked hard despite his aching arm seeking to assuage his disgrace with diligence his uncles his fathers brothers had stopped in with gifts of herbs whiskey and his grandmothers ginger cookies they spoke to his mother in hushed whispers his father returned after the sun was down and the laundry storefront was closed he hadnt said anything to the rest of the family gathered there hed only looked at thomas you hed said in english which was the language he used when he was displeased with thomas because to his fathers horror thomas born in america was as fluent in english as in cantonese you come according to his brother tao when thomas was born a few weeks after his family had come to the new world his father had given him an american name in a fit of optimism it must have been true but thomas could never imagine his father being optimistic or excited about anything american obediently thomas followed his father up the steep streets to a singlestory house nestled between two new apartment buildings there was a dead tree in the yard maybe it had been planted in a fit of optimism his father entered the unpainted door without knocking and left it to thomas to close it behind them the incense burning on a small table didnt quite cover a sour charnelhouse smell thomas followed his father through a partially furnished front room and down the narrow and uneven stairs to the basement where the odor of dead things was replaced by the scent of the dynamite that had been used to blast the basement into the granite that underlay the hillside the stairs ended in a small room lit only by a small beeswax candle the floor beneath his feet was polished and well laid a lightcolored wood ringed by a pattern of darker it seemed an expensive luxury to find in a basement room of a nondescript little house while hed been looking at the floor his father had continued on through a doorway and he hurried to follow there was something odd about this place that made his stomach clench and the hair on the back of his neck stand up he didnt want to be left alone here he darted through the doorway and almost bumped into his father who had stopped at a small entryway that dropped down a single stair and then opened up to a cavernous room it too had only a single candle lighting it thomas couldnt make out the face of the man ensconced in some sort of big chair his father bent over with a pained grunt and set three twentydollar gold pieces on the floor here is the son he said he put the flat of his hand on thomass back and thrust him toward the other man not expecting the push thomas stumbled down the step then turned to look at his fatheronly to see his sandaled feet disappear up the stairway the son said the man hed been left with his accent was eastern europeanslavic thomas thought the slavs were the among the latest immigrant wave that had washed over the mining town since thomas edisons electricity had made copper king pretty boy come here butte montana present day though the sounds of the christmas carols were pleasant enough thomas felt restless impatientthe same feeling that had sent him driving here from san francisco when hed intended only an evenings drive something was calling him here and it certainly wasnt nostalgia there wasnt much left of the town of his childhood the last of the old whorehouses in the redlight district was falling down and only a few buildings were left of the chinatown where hed grown up and died and been reborn a monster no he wasnt nostalgic for butte this wasnt his home he had a condo in san francisco and another in boston none of his family remained here there was nothing here for himso why had it seemed so imperative to come hello tom he froze it had been almost a century since hed been in butte there werent that many people who lived eighty years and still sounded so hail and hearty fae thats why hed had to come hed been called here by magic if he hadnt been walking in the middle of a crowd he would have snarled he didnt see anyone who looked familiar the fae were like that but he did find someone who was looking at him leaning up against an empty storefront where a tobacco shop had once been was a balding man with an oddly fragile air about him he was several inches shorter than thomaswho wasnt exactly tall himself the mans forehead was too large for the rest of him in the manner of some people who were born simple young blue eyes smiled at thomas out of an old face he wore new winter boots red mittens and scarf and a thick down jacket a couple passing by noticed thomass interest and stopped nick the woman half ducked her head toward the little man are you warm enough there are cookies and hot chocolate in the old miners bank building at the end of the block the male half of the couple glared suspiciously at thomas i have good new gloves said nick in the voice of a man but with a childs intonations im warm i had cookies i think im going to talk with my friend tom he darted across the sidewalk and took thomass hand thomas managed not to hiss or jerk his hand free nick was it his scentat this close rangetold thomas that nick was a hobgoblin do you live here or are you just visiting asked the man suspiciously im visiting said thomas he could have lied butte was smaller than it used to be but according to the lady who checked him into his hotel it still had thirty thousand people living here his answer didnt please the man nicks one of ours he said rocking forward on the balls of his feet like a man whod been in a few real fights we watch out for him ah tom thought buttes ties to ireland had always been strong in his day the irish here had set out cream in saucers outside their back doors to appease the fairies apparently the traditions of taking care of the little people changelings and those who might be changelings were adhered to stilleven if as they clearly believed the one they watched over was entirely human just simpleminded this is ron nick the hobgoblin said to thomas he gives me rides in his yellow truck i like yellow ron who drove a yellow truck narrowed his eyes at thomas clearly telling him to go away something thomas was happy to comply with he started to free himself tom likes tea nick informed them his eyes as innocent as he was not not if he were a hobgoblin tom likes the nighttime he paused and with a sly smile added tom likes maggie thomass hand clenched on nicks at hearing her name he gave the hobgoblin a sharp look how did the little man know about margaret was margaret the reason hed been called here does he said the woman with a sharp glance at thomas nick why dont you come with us to see the singer at the old ymca margaret thomas decided that he would see what the hobgoblin wantedand to that end hed have to allay the suspicions of nicks protectors he inclined his head respectfully toward ron nick and i know one another he said i went to school here a long long time ago oh said the woman relaxing not a tourist then the man looked down at his watch if you want to catch your brothers performance wed better go as soon as those two were gone thomas pulled his hand away from the hobgoblins mindful of the watchful glances of the people around himthe couple werent the only ones watching out for nickhe was gentle about it tell me hobgoblin he said with soft menace what do you know about margaret flanagan butte montana he escorted the men through the tunnels keeping to the front of the group so that the lanterns they carried wouldnt damage his night vision and also because it scared them that he didnt need a lantern to find his way the current location of his fathers opium den was a few hundred feet from where theyd started though hed led them through alternate routes that had added a half mile and more to the trip it was imperative that theymostly experienced miners though one was a merchants sonnot be able to find their way here without a guide first payment was made before they entered the mines and anyone who made it to the den was assumed to have paid their fee second it made it difficult for the police to find to ensure the location remained a secret the den was moved every couple of weeks thomas took a final turn and opened the makeshift door in invitation the light from a dozen lanterns inside illuminated the smoky haze within it looked like the hell the nuns had promised him tap her light tommy said one of the men hed escorted giving him the traditional farewell wishes of a miner when forcing a stick of explosive into a drilled hole in the granite a miner wanted to be very careful tapping it in with his hammer it caught thomas by surprise and he took a better look at the mans face juhani hed been a finnish boy whose father worked with the timber crews when theyd gone to school together once upon a timetwenty years and more ago now they were both damnedthomas as his fathers monster juhani koskinen as an opium addict for a moment they stared at each other then juhani stepped through the door into the den followed by the rest of the men dont know why you talk to him johnny my boyo said one of them in a thick irish lilt as thomas closed the door sealing them in he dont never talk not since hed returned from the master as his fathers new slave what was there to say who would talk to him even before his mothers brother a famous scholar from a family of scholars rescued his mother from his fathers care she had not looked upon his face if she could help itnot since he had become a monster she had taken her other children with her when she returned to china with her brother thomas had been left behind for his father he had no words not that his father cared he gave ordersand took him to the master once a week to feed and be fed upon thomas hoped his father regretted his bargain regretted at least the necessity of the onceaweek twentydollar gold piece that was more than his father paid any of his workers either in the laundry or in the opium den hidden down in the mine alone without a light of any kind thomas headed out deeper into the mines the tunnels under the town were the labyrinthine result of more than three decades of everyday roundtheclock mining above ground the gallows frames of the elevators that took men down and lifted them up again when their shifts were done clearly marked the different mines below ground all of the mines interconnected hed heard that there were thousands of miles of tunnels and it wouldnt surprise him if that were so the other two men who ran dens sometimes took their nonpaying customers deep into the tunnels and left them in the maze of tunnels out of which they never found their way his fathers customers all paid ahead of time or they didnt get in he had always been good at finding his way around the mines since hed been turned hed gotten a lot better he didnt need light didnt need to see at all he could feel the tunnel stretch around himand the ones above below and beside him too he could sense the areas where miners were actively digging and the ones where no one had been for a very long time he could tell north from south up from down and he knew where he was in relation to the city over his head he never got lost in the tunnels it was near three in the morning his father had gone to sleepthe men thomas had escorted in were the very lastand thomas was free for the rest of the night there were boys in the den whose job it would be to rouse their customers and escort them to the surface thomas never had to work in the den anymore he scared the customers he wasnt sure if they feared him because his father used him to hurt the ones who displeased him or if some atavistic sense warned them that he was a dangerous predator thomas walked to the nearest elevator shafthe was safely between shifts so he didnt have to worry about the elevator carsand began climbing down the darkness soothed him as did the growing heat it was always hot in the lower levels he didnt need heat to survive anymore but it had been such a luxury for him before that he always took pleasure in it he climbed down until it suited him to stop a few levels above where they were actively mining descending the shaft pushed even his strength and abilities he enjoyed it he was always alone but somehow deep in the heart of the earth with none but himself for company he felt less so walking down tunnels that might not have seen people for decades he felt comfortable in his skin and he relished it even though it made it difficult to deny his growing hunger tomorrow he would have to feed he dreaded the feeding time afterward his master renewed his orders and made certain his fledgling understood his place someday thomas was certain someday he would be free but for nearly twenty years he had been slave to his father and the demonthing that had over a whole long year turned him into what he was now he put out his hand and touched the damp earth there was water here underground a huge lake hed been told and streams that ran just as the creeks aboveground did he couldnt feel the water the way he felt the earth which spoke to his bones somewhere in the darkness in front of him chains rattled please a womans voice and irish he froze where he stood maybe she was one of the ones who did not pay for her opiumthough usually those were left much higher than this no one but he wandered alone down here he couldnt believe that either mr wong or mr luk would waste money on chains for a nonpaying customer please help me he hadnt been walking particularly quietly she knew he was there the boy hed been thomas hao would have run to the rescue but that boy had died a long time ago and left a monster in his place what would you do for me in return he said breathing in for the first time in a long time he didnt have to especially since he didnt speak it made his father nervous when he didnt breathe so he made a habit of letting his lungs sit empty he hadnt sensed her as he did the miners and it bothered him hed assumed he could sense everyone in the tunnels in his realm the chains rattled hard agitated as if the woman had not really believed there was someone else in the mine o lords and ladies you are there she said please my father is the flanagan the old one of high court his element is fire and i am accounted a power in my own right our gratitude will be yours my word on it fae thats why he hadnt felt her now that he knew she was here he could sense her but she felt so close to the sighs and groans of the earth that it was no wonder he hadnt noticed her before shed spoken he avoided the fae when he could and when he could not well the fae unlike humans knew exactly what he was and they despised the monster almost as much as he despised himself please she said if she were fae chained down here no human had done it not this deep under the hill he had no desire to find himself in the middle of a fae dispute sir he could feel her listening but he made no noise this close to feeding day his heart only beat if he made it you have nothing i want he said the words coming out hoarse and strange he turned to go back the way he had come vampire he paused they say there is a vampire who walks deep beneath the hill they must be the fae because the humans didnt know he didnt hunt the master forbade it as a fledgling he could only take nourishment from another vampire anyway taking the blood of humans did him no good at all every week the master had him try it the master himself was agoraphobic unable to leave his basement vampire said the fae woman what do you wish most i can grant you that freedom he thought if only the freedom to die the bleak knowledge that no one would be able to give that freedom to him until long after the remnants of thomas hao had been thoroughly eradicated and there was nothing to free made him angry with a rage that did not cloak his despair the sun it had been so long since hed walked in daylight that the hunger for it nearly eclipsed his growing thirst i have power she said just tell me what you want what i want you cannot give me and in the hopelessness of the thought he found that he wanted her equally trapped equally frantic if only for a little while you could feed me he told her his longunused voice sharp and bitter im hungry come then she said come and drink no hunting was the command no unwilling victims sometimes the master forgot things or did not word things carefully enough maybe hed never conceived that thomas would find a willing victim if he intended to stay out of fae conflicts he should walk awaybut a small part of him made him hesitate it wasnt the hunger it was the boy he had been who wanted the woman freed he found he couldnt ignore the boys necessities any more than hed ever been able to ignore the masters it made the monster angry he gave her no chance to adjust to brace herself he dropped beside her gripping her head and chin he jerked her until her neck stretched out and bit down sinking his fangs deep he could have made it pleasant for her his master insisted upon it being pleasant but he wanted her to struggle which would force him to stop and give him an excuse not to save her to be the monster theythe master and his fatherhad made him other than a gasp as he struck though she was silent and still against him her blood tasted nothing like the masters it reminded him of the taffy hed eaten when he was human not in the flavor but in the feeling of richness of selfindulgence and satisfaction feeding with the master was carnal in its most profane sensepleasure and pain when it was over it sent his senses into a stupor and left him feeling desperate for the bath that never really cleaned the stain from his soul no matter how hard he scrubbed this feeding was as he imagined feeding from a dragon might besharp and not altogether comfortable but rich with the bottomless power of fire and earth the fire cleansed him the earth restored him leaving him raw and off balancebut not filthy it was the first time hed fed from someone other than the master and it was hard to stop one more pull he thought just one more and one more became he remembered the eyes of his old finnish friend as he headed into the opium den it gave him the strength to stop she was limp and unresponsive in his hold he sealed the wounds hed made regretting the roughness of his attack and wondering if he had stopped too late he lay beside her and listened to her heart beat when it continued past the first few minutes he decided that shed survive his hands told him that theyd only chained her feet he slipped his fingers inside the cuffs and broke them one at a time the flesh beneath was blistered and her feet were bare his clever hands told him also that she was young far younger than shed soundedthirteen or fourteen he thought and clad in her nightdress theyd taken her from her bed poor thing he picked her up and carried her to the elevator shaft she didnt wake up until he fed her sweet tea in his fathers dark laundry she drank two cups before she said anything her big gray eyes looking at the face of the monster he was he felt ashamed and at the same time better than he had any time these past twenty years or more as if she had saved him instead of the other way around he was not hungry at all what is your name she asked im margaret flanagan maggie her voice sounded composed but her hands were shaking so badly he was pretty sure she was scared of him he had put his arm around her to brace her while he fed her tea he expected his nearness made it worse but he also expected that if he backed away from her right now shed fall off the stool for all that she was fae she was a child he told himself that her fear didnt make him sad he was confused and hid it behind his usual emotionless mask i am haos monster he told her abruptly where is your father i will take you home she tilted her head she closed her eyes for one breath heaved a sigh of heartfelt relief when she looked up at him she smiled her face as bright as the sun he hadnt seen in years hes coming she said hell be right here good said thomas though he didnt know if that were true if shed had such power as hed felt as he drank from herearth and fire in abundancethen her father likely had more very true said a mans voice answering his thoughtsbecause thomas had not spoken it took all of thomass considerable control not to show his surprise papa said margaret flanagan sounding for the first time as young as she looked she pulled away from him and ran across the room to the arms of the man who stood in haos laundry in a flannel shirt and dungarees though the door was locked and the room had been empty when thomas had carried her here the flanagan didnt look imposingonly a few inches taller than thomas which made him short by the standards of the irish in butte he didnt have the shoulders of a miner though his hands showed the calluses of hard work vampire he said over his daughters head i could destroy you youre right fire is mine and your kind are particularly vulnerable to it yes acknowledged thomas coolly he might have been frightened he thought if he had really been afraid of death hell wasnt a pleasant thought but then neither was a lifetime possibly a hundred lifetimes tied to the depraved thing that was his master if a monster had taken advantage of someone he loved the way he had taken advantage of margaret flanagan he would have killed that one and never felt regret the wounds on her neck were closed but his attack had been brutal and it would be a while before the red marks on her skin faded the flanagan stayed where he was margaret turned her head until she could see thomas you have it now she told him what will you do with it have what asked thomas freedom she told him and then collapsed in her fathers arms he hadnt understood what she had done at first not when hed let her and her father out and relocked the laundrys door not when hed gone into the cupboard where he died for the day not even when what had come to him had been sleep rather than death hed awakened and followed his father up the hill to the masters house hao xun took him down the stairs to the basement as he always did leaving thomas with a gold coin at his feet pretty boy said his master come here to me obediently thomas stepped down the single stair above them he heard his father walk out the door and shut it behind him give us a kiss my sweet thing the vampire told thomas thomas bent down to kiss his masters cheek one side and then the other as he did he reached out with one hand to grasp the long wooden candlestick that always sat on the little table beside the wing chair though the candle it held was seldom lit im so hungry for your blood whispered his master as thomas pulled back as i hunger for yours thomas thought thrusting the candlestick through the soft beeswax candle and into the old ones heart he took two steps back amazed that at long last hed been able to do such a thing the old vampire leaned forward and smiled at him pretty boy he saidand collapsed into himself only then staring at the dust that had been his master did thomas understand the gift hed been given butte montana present day freedom thomas thought following the hobgoblin up the hill to wherever nick wanted him to go hed spoken to her with his lips and margaret had heard his heart thomas had left butte that very night with his fathers twentydollar gold piece in his pocket he could not wait for hao xun to come and get him because he didnt want to kill the man who had sired his human self the way hed killed the thing that had sired his current flesh if hed seen his father again he wasnt certain he could have helped himself he had never seen either of the two fae again either but unlike any of the vampires hed met since then he saw the sun every day and it did not burn him he no longer needed to feed from a vampire in order to survive margaret had given him everything hed desired as well as the feeding hed asked for nick stopped at a small wellkept house near the base of big butte the hill that had given its name to the towndespite not being a butte at all he let himself in the front door thomas stopped on the porch if you want me inside he told the hobgoblin you have to invite me in the little fellow stopped where he was and looked up at thomas you mean no harm to me and mine you will swear it im not fae oaths have no power over me nick he told the fae what i am is already damned the hobgoblin hissed and dismissed that with one hand dont throw christian gobbledygook at me he said margaret told me you would come told me you would help you are here so that is the first but i wonder if the second is true vampire i served her father most of my life i cant afford to get this wrong the fae didnt like vampires thomas would have left because with one exception he didnt like the fae either but it hadnt been nick who had brought him here it had been margaret for her he would do what he could i owe margaret flanagan said thomas who was better educated about fae than hed been a hundred years ago he knew what he was admittingand that the fae would take it very seriously what she did for me was far more than what little i managed for her i swear i mean no harm to her or hers come in and be welcome said nick after a pause and turned to lead the way into his home there were four other people in the little mans living room waiting for them along with a blazing fire in the fireplace that gave out more light than heat one of the people a big blond man looked familiar as though thomas might have known him a long time ago they were none of them human and given that they were in a hobgoblins house thomas was certain they were fae as soon as he entered the room on nicks heels everyone stood upalmost everyone the kid on the piano bench just relaxed a little more thomas judged him the biggest threat the really powerful ones often disguised themselves as something soft and helpless vampire said the only woman she was tall and muscular and spoke with a finnish accent is this the one the big mans nose wrinkled as if he smelled something foul there was an old manor one who looked old since the fae could adopt any appearance that suited them he peered at thomas with nonjudgmental interest which thomas returned it is him said the boy on the piano bench he was a beautiful young man draped between the bench and the piano his elbows on the cover that protected the keys who else could it be how many chinese vampires do you think there are in butte this is thomas hao said nick it is he who will find our margaret he didnt introduce the othershardly surprising as names were odd things for the fae even a nickname if held long enough had power why does margaret need finding thomas asked the woman and the big man dropped their eyes and looked uncomfortable silence hung in the air for a moment it is a long story said nick will you take a seat thomas might be a vampire but he had no way to judge the people in the room and was reluctant to sit down and put himself at a disadvantage the boys smile widened as he slid off the bench and onto the floor sit down vampire doand the rest of you too nickll give him the rundown and then well see if shes right about the vampire the piano bench was hard and easy to rise from unlike the overstuffed furniture in the rest of the room it was acceptableand it told thomas something about the boy that he understood that thomas sat on the bench once he was down the fae took their seats nick sat on the floor opposite thomas though there was an empty chair let me begin this tale in its proper placewith the flanagan he said he was highcourt fae do you know what that means tom powerful replied thomas though there is no high court any longer there are only the gray lords who rule all of the fae aye agreed nick powerful also oldand smart a person didnt survive long in the high court if he werent smart the little man looked down at his hands thats not really where the story starts said the boy sitting at thomass feet it starts with butte with fae who came here hiding among the humans it probably wont surprise you to learn that all the fae dont get along together will it mr hao we vampires are the soul of brotherly love thomas responded dryly i assumed that the fae were the same the boy laughed until tears ran out of his eyes it was not as funny as all that said the woman brotherly love repeated the boy ayah ill remember that anyway the fae came from northern europe and the british isles mostly like the people norwegians swedes finns cornish and irishthey all came italian too thought thomas the serbians the czech the ukrainians the boy sat up straight now his eyes on the woman and the big man turned slightly away from thomas once upon a time the irish fae would have squashed them all but then came the ironmongers and their christ and they bound the old places left us crippled and weak it didnt hurt as badly said the woman softly we have more ironkissed among us we finns and nordic folk ironkissed asked thomas those who work metals dwarves hiisisome of them anyway metal mages so for thirty years we controlled the land here and among us was one a hiisi who was not kind to the other fae the boy laughed as if he thought she were funny too she looked at him most of us were too afraid to object it wasnt an apology not quite he had a talent for finding what you held dear and then using it to make you do his bidding yes the boy said dryly you suffered too didnt you you poor things she bit her lip and turned away apparently she was ashamed and then came the flanagan said the old man he might look fragile and aged but his voice told a different story it rumbled in thomass earsbritish with a hint of welsh or cornish i knew wed get to him sooner or later said nick flanagan changed things for the better rumbled the giant even we could see that the woman snorted inelegantly he pushed the hiisithis was an old and powerful hiisiinto summing the ikutursas the flanagan could have worked something out but he pushed and pushed and would not compromise thomas frowned ikutursas the name sounded familiar hed had some friends in school juhani koskinen matti makela and another boy who was also finnish they told him a story once the dragon thomas said but i thought it was a sea serpent the fae looked at him in surprise except for the woman who smiled and sat back most people dont know finnish stories they didnt grow up here said thomas the tursas is a little more than a mere sea dragon vampire said the boy coolly it can take many forms it attacked the flanagan when he was down in the mines no said the big man at the same time the old man did the bench under thomas slid forward a little bit in eagerness as if it wanted to go to the old man forest fae of some sort he thought setting his feet down a little firmer it attacked the miners said nick playing with them a little the place where theyd be working would start leaking water it was the speculator minethe one flanagan was working for as a mining engineer modern safe well ventilatedthe flanagan insisted upon it highcourt fae always did love the silly humans murmured the boy as if to himself the woman snorted again and reached out with a boot to nudge him hard ive heard you might come from high court yourself she said he jumped up fierce with indignation you take it back you take that back right now she smiled at him of course i never believed it too much stupid not enough looks he shook himself like a wet cat damned piru he snapped easy prey she purred piru thought thomas finnish fae he remembered but was it one of the witty demons prone to games of wit or one of the air ladies who hung out and looked beautiful until something ticked them off he looked at the woman and decided for the clever demon she looked a little too substantial to be floating around it picked groups of miners with fae among them to frighten said nick picking up his story from where hed left off eventually one of them figured out that the water theyd been hitting wasnt just an accident of geology he took the tale to the flanagan he was supposed to charge off to confront the finnish fae who was tormenting his people said the old man he would have too if a certain people hadnt gone to him and told him that what he faced wasnt just any fae there was betrayal on both sides said the woman some did not think that the flanagan was strong enough to keep his promises and it would be the less powerful fae who would suffer others looked to him for justice and a way out from under the hiisis thumb she rubbed absently at the fabric of the couch where she sat it didnt matter he went anyway aye said the big man as he had to being who he was but he went armed and ready instead of oblivious the flanagan he wouldnt back down for tursas wait said thomas the speculator the granite mountain fire this was the mining disaster during world war one said nick when the fire broke out we knew hed won in true germanic fashion said the giant morosely i suppose he had he never came out nick told thomas when the fires went out we pulled out the bodies some of them were fae most were human some you couldnt tell we didnt find the tursas or the flanagan afterward said the woman we met all of us summoning the tursas from its exile as if he were a dog to come to his master if the flanagan hadnt hadnt done whatever he did it might have eaten the world she believed that thomas thought the fae killed him rumbled the old man that hiisi who summoned the tursas hed used so much power to do it he was vulnerable even his allies turned on him all the fae that were here cornish irish finn german norwegian slav and that little guy from italy we killed that hiisi who thought that his power was more important than the survival of all we thought that was the end of it the woman said time passed the city started to die people left and most of us left too just a few stayed but that hiisi had taken the flanagans daughter to make certain of his victory if the flanagan by some miracle had destroyed the ikutursas the boy said searches were made but there are thousands of miles of tunnels we thought her long dead then two years ago she started to talk to us said the boy a highcourt trick that getting into your head unpleasant thomas remembered shes quite mad whispered nick quite mad from all those years trapped in the earth so what do you need me for thomas asked we need you to find her and kill her said the big man it is what she wants said the boy answering thomass raised eyebrow she tells me so over and over ive looked and looked and i cant find her anywhere shes in the mines nicks voice was pensive we dont have an earth or ironkissed fae left here to find hernot that they had much success when they looked before and even if we did she has a haltija the woman looked out the window and thomas noted absently that the fae needed to replace the doublepaned window because ice had formed around the edges of the inside of the glass a what he asked she waved a hand a guard this one is a kalman vÃ¤ki we thinka dead mans spirit he was probably killed and set to guard her when she was taken a kalman vÃ¤ki thomas said slowly how do you know that since you cant find her she told us the big man glanced at thomas searchingly and then looked away thomas knew he wouldnt read anything but mild interest in his face wed have to destroy it to get to her the woman closed her eyes even if we could find her we could not get by that a kalman vÃ¤ki holds the power of mortification it kills with a touch not even the immortal are immune but you arent exactly immortal are you the mines were mostly filled when the company shut them down the old man pulled his beard lightly the old timbers were rotting through and the tunnels collapsing was a time you could take a step off your back porch in the morning to find a hole four or five hundred feet down that hadnt been in your backyard when you went to bed one tunnel collapsing on top of another on top of another was quite the thing to fill themexpensive and timeconsuming both but some of it is left where the tunnels were cut into granite mostly so said thomas you want mea vampireto go looking in the old mines to find margaret flanagan who has been trapped down there for a century because vampires are so good at what dissolving into mist and sinking through the earth i think youve been watching too many bad horror movies she was never the same after she met you nick said she had such a touch with the earth it came to her call and did as she bid she had a little of her fathers gift for fire but it was the earth that knew her she was able to call you here if she can do that she should be able to guide you to her down in the mines where her power is greater hello vampire said the big man softlyand his american accent turned lilting and softened thomas had only talked to margaret for a few hours one day out of the many years hed lived but he recognized her intonations in the mans deep voice the other fae moved away from the big man but they didnt look startled he knew that they would not perceive his surprise his father had taught him well or ill the big man said proving that her gift of reading thoughts that thomas did not speak was still hers the faes clear blue eyes were not quite the same shade as margarets they think i can find you thomas said carefully that because you called me here you can lead me through the tunnels like to like she answered him i dont know why you heard my call just that you did i could not have given you your wish if you had not been earthtouched he knew what she meant how could he not he remembered that sense hed had of how she was a part of the earth that had held them together in its maw hed sensed it because the earth spoke to him too vampires develop abilities the master had told him the master could make humans do as he wanted even before a blood exchangea rare gift and useful thomass mothers family were scholars back as far as their family history wentall the way the stories said to the dragon scholar who knew everything that dragons knew and turned into a man to see what men knew thomass mother had told him that her family was founded by a dilong an earth dragon only a story his father had said rolling his eyes he had never cared for anything that reminded him that his wifes family had higher status than his thomas looked at the assembled fae why do you say that she is mad he asked my fathers blood runs in the earth the big man whispered in margarets voice his fire consumes me when i emerge i will burn them all to dust and beyond we think the flanagan died two years ago said the woman in subdued tones she did not look at the man who sat next to her and spoke with margarets voice that he gave her his last strength so she could call out and find someone to help so she could be saved but it was too late what would you expect of her asked the boy alone for nearly a century trapped with only the dead for company under the earth chained without food or water neither dying nor living and now she has the power of her father who killed the ikutursas he shivered and hugged himself she will kill us all no said thomas coming at last to his feet i shall not allow it the girl i knew would not want your deaths on her conscience she had rescued him a vampire who had hurt her and still she rescued him she did not need the blood of these fae on her hands it took him four days to find a way to the place shed been kept as the old man had promised many of the tunnels hed known were collapsed or filled but his sense of the ways beneath the mining town was as good as it had ever been he found a path as before though that earth sense he had did not betray her to him it was the blood hed taken from her like calls to like shed told him while all the fae around her thought she was talking about her magic he rose in the absolute darkness and felt the shape of the last obstacle that stood between him and his goal it was not just winters chill it was colder than that he found himself wishing for a light to see the vÃ¤ki but hed never needed a light down here so he hadnt brought one why come you smelling so of death it was a womans voice he hadnt expected her to be a woman i am vampire he told the kalman vÃ¤ki i bring death with me mine is the power of illness of mortification of living flesh she said but i would keep my charge though i have no power over the dead no more than i do he said gently i mean her no harm guardian spirit i killed those who did hed killed them her fathers betrayers so that margaret wouldnt have to they hadnt expected it and hed been careful to take out the boy first then the big man who couldthomas was pretty surepick and chose how much margaret could say through his lips he was a vampire and these fae had believed he was their dog to do their bidding they hadnt expected a monster despite knowing what he was killing them had not taken him long thomas had been raised in butte among the irish finns and all the other races who had come to pull the treasures of the richest hill on earth he might wear the face of a chinese man but he came from a family of scholars and lived among the people here for all of his childhood a vÃ¤ki of whatever kind was a protector of the treasure it guarded no one would set such a creature to keep a prisoner in only a fae would think that a vampire would assume a vÃ¤ki of the grave would be an evil thing her father or perhaps the finnish fae who had first warned the flanagan of the dragon must have sent it to protect her if they meant his margaret no harm the vÃ¤ki would not have prevented them from reaching her if margaret had remained powerless in the heart of the earth they would have left her there to rot when her fathers power came to heror whatever had happened that she could tell their thoughts and return her ownshe could finally take action against them they had decided they had to kill her somehow theyd discovered that shed called him for helpperhaps shed taunted them with itthat she had someone she could call for help it didnt matter what do you send against the spirit of the dead a vampire they had the weapon they needed they just had to point it in the right direction once thomas had dealt with the vÃ¤ki they would have killed thomas and margaret both but margaret hadnt told them everything about him they assumed she could summon him because of the wish shed granted him that it had given her some sort of magical power over him but it had been the blood if she had trusted themas they impliedshe would have told them about that part telling him about the vÃ¤ki had been their first mistake not knowing that hed bitten her and taken her blood had been the second nick who had served her father almost all his life would have known a vampire saved her but neither margaret nor her father had told nick the whole story the final and greatest mistake had been implying that margaret had been driven insane imprisoned in the earth what was it nick had said shes quite mad a subtle word was mad nick had used it to imply one thing without a lie crossing his lips thomas would have been angry too imprisoned by his enemies the earth was her element it nurtured her and sustained her if he was wrong if they had been innocent of all he suspected well then he was a vampire after alland they were fae he would not regret their deaths but he had not been wrong because he could feel the guardian move out of his path satisfied by his answer he slipped by it and found the fragile thing he searched for little more than bones in chains please she said her voice as quiet as the whisper of the spring wind he broke the iron shackles first throwing them as far from her as the confines of the tunnel allowed he pulled a blanket out of the pack he carried and carefully gently put her upon it what would you do for me in return he said raising her up and touching a damp cloth to her face she pressed her face against it sucking on the moisture it would take her a long time to get water that wayand it would be slow enough not to make her sick from it when he pulled the cloth away and soaked it in water from his canteen again she said her voice hoarse anything my gratitude you have yes he said pressing the cloth against her face again you gave me such a gift last time gratitude is a poor substitute perhaps i should give your gift back to you shall i he picked her up and she was such a light burden lighter even than shed been the first time hed carried her out of the mine tunnels oh yes she sighed understanding what he didnt say as she had before i should love to see the sun again picking up the pieces by pat cadigan pat cadigan has twice won the arthur c clarke award for her novels synners and fools and has been

in her collections patterns dirty work and home by the sea her work has been translated into many languages including polish russian italian french spanish german portuguese czech and japanese also pirate and swedish chef via google which doesnt count as official publication but she gets a kick out of it anyway the author of fifteen books including two nonfiction titles and one young adult novel she currently has two new novels in progress she lives in gritty urban north london with her husband the original chris fowler and her son rob and their minder miss kitty calgary queen of the cats i dont think ive ever quite forgiven it was one of those years when everything started looking up ok not everything but even after tiananmen square the developments in eastern europe were enough to make a person think the world was actually becoming a better place all right then just me i wondered i was thirtysixtheoretically old enough to know better but young enough to drop everything and fly halfway around the world for my crazy sister quinn dammit everything goes to hell around that girl my father used to grumble actually it was more like chaos which now that i think of it was hell for my father a man who envisioned his daughters as swans and instead gotwell us and quinn in that order the first four of which i was the last made his head spin then when i was sixteen quinn arrived unintended unpredicted unexpected and made everything spin my sister the thrill ride if there is such a thing as reincarnation shell probably come back as a tiltawhirl or a wild octopus maybe a rocket seeing as how she was born the day after the first moon landing but it would have to be a rocket that never came down she wasnt manicdepressive there was no depression just manic and more manic although to be honest it wasnt mania in the clinical sense just high energy and no brakes two separate therapists diagnosed her as a borderline personality i had to look that one up some things seemed to fit some didnt and the rest i wasnt sure about but it all sounded pretty bad in the end i decided the diagnosis creeped me out not my sister quinn could be frivolous and silly the grasshopper to everyone elses ant she could be selfcentered and even insensitive with the attention span of a gnat and poor impulse control but she had never been mean or spiteful most of the time she was goodnatured slow to anger and quick to kiss and make up and more than anything else generous my mother never missed a chance to point out quinns good qualities theres no malice in her shes got a good heart she never goes out of her way to hurt anyone shed give you the shirt off her back what my mother didnt mention however was that when quinn ran out of shirts shed expect you to volunteer yours her tendency to presume wasnt as attractive as her thick curly black hair or her silvery gray eyes or her smile features that could usually persuade the susceptible to overlook her flaws it didnt always work to her advantage of course because she was a child she had a hard time telling the difference between excitement and trouble im not sure she even knew there was a difference because theres no malice in her my mother said because shes got a good heart in november of quinn went to berlin with her good heart which had been captured by a tall rangy blond man with blue eyes cheekbones like the white cliffs of dover and snake hips it was a package that would have held my attention even without the german accent with it everything he said sounded exotic and even a bit mysterious at least to my tin american ear especially after a few glasses of red wine and very good red wine it was too a french bordeaux that actually tasted as good as the label looked he brought two bottles when he and quinn turned up at our parents house for the annual yourfatherwontcelebratehisbirthday dinner in early september only kath lisa and i were notcelebrating with our parents our oldest sister marie and her wife were stuck in toronto seeing their twins through chicken pox and as far as any of us knew quinn was travelingthe family euphemism for that period beginning with the last time anyone had heard from her and ending when she finally called one or more of us to say she was ok and hint she needed a small loan unpredicted and unexpected again surprise everybody and oh hey meet martin the notabirthday dinner immediately turned into the quinn show with special guest quinn was bubbly vivacious and entertaining martin was personable witty and utterly covetworthy and everyone enjoyed themselves though kath lisa and i sneaked commiserating looks at each other even as we did sometimes it was hard not to feel drab around our baby sister but if we felt drab next to quinn we were positively lackluster compared to martin originally from east berlin he was barely more than a toddler when his parents had given him over to some trusted friends who had smuggled him through the berlin wall and taken him to live with them in london since then he had heard precious little of his family all he had was a blurry photo of his parents with the two younger sisters and a brother he had never met my mother teared up this embarrassed martin who apologized quinn however sat back with a faint smile and i knew she was pleased to have brought us someone to prick our social consciencevery much a quinn thing to do she and martin didnt stay long after that and there they go kath sighed as we stood on the front steps watching martins sports car pull out of the driveway back to life among those more beautiful and exciting than us her gaze swiveled to lisa the grammar nazi of the family for once lisa wasnt taking the bait what color do you suppose the sky is on that planet she asked wistfully dunno i said our eyes are probably too ordinary to see it dont be silly jean kath elbowed me itll be gold lamÃ© with real gold girls mom was right on cue theres no malice in her shes got a good heart dad gave a small hmph i hope this martin doesnt break it my sisters and i looked at each other knowing immediately he would quinns call came on one of those rare nights when i had a few friends from work over for drinks and hors doeuvres the conversation was mostly about east european politics was this really the beginning of the end for communism and if so did that mean changes for china after all despite tiananmen square current events along with martins brief visit had me thinking more about politics than i ever had before although he and my sister were the furthest things from my mind when the phone rang she was talking so fast that i couldnt understand a word she was saying i couldnt even tell whether she was happy angry or scared i tried calming her down so i could call her back after everyone left instead i ended up mouthing apologies at my guests while they showed themselves out eventually quinn wound down enough so that i could get in a few questions martin had gone back to london in midoctober promising to return in a week ten days at the most thered been two brief phone calls from himone the day hed arrived in london to let her know hed arrived safely the other two weeks later to say he had the flu and was too sick to fly and after that nothingno calls and only the answering machine when she called him she went on phoning at all hours of the day and night until shed finally gotten an answernot martin but the neighbor who said she was watering his plants while he was in west berlin no she didnt know when martin was coming back big things were happening he hadnt told her much before he left just something about people coming through the berlin wall which would be very exciting if it were true wouldnt it quinn managed to wheedle the name and number of the hotel where martin was staying out of her then decided to take more direct action so here she was in berlin at the hotel where martin had supposedly been staying only he wasnt there now and she had been running all over west berlin for days trying to find him and now shed heard about people who had gotten out of east berlin going back through the wall and getting stuck unable to get out again even if they had passports from the uk or west germany or even america that didnt sound right to me could any country even east germany prevent a foreign national from leaving i thought of what id seen on the news about hungarys relaxed border with austria allowing east germans to escape to the west maybe east germany was tightening its own borders with everyone else to counter this making travel problems for everyone regardless of nationality it didnt seem likely but i just didnt know stranger things had happened maybe the best thing to do is get on the first flight out of there i said the next time she stopped for breath come home wait for martin to call you absolutely not she said martin needs my help i just know it hes one of those people who went back through the wall and cant get out again i can feel it in my bones what makes you think that i asked i just told you i can feel it in my bones quinn said as if i had questioned the existence of gravity havent you ever felt that way like you just know something it was on the tip of my tongue to say yeah but ive always been wrong unless it was something bad that i was in denial about but she was talking again a lot of the people here think somethings about to happen but they dont know if its going to be something good like more travel restrictions being eased or something bad like czechoslovakia in do you even know what happened in czechoslovakia in i asked amazed tanks she said vaguely but whatever happens i cant leave martin to face it alone i sighed quinn honey i think youve got it backward i think martin left you he wouldnt i know it in my heart we have a bond theres no arguing with what someone knows in their heart or feels in their bones but thats never stopped me from trying it was especially counterproductive in this case because the more i argued against it the surer she was about martin and the more determined she became to help him ill go get him myself she said finally ill go through the wall and find him and bring him out again you just said you heard people from other countries were having trouble getting out what if you cant get out again yourself then well be stuck there together she said nobly making me wince and what if hes not there what if hes in west berlin or what if hes already gone back to londonor even the us what if hes been calling your apartment to tell you when to pick him up at the airport he isnt i told you i can feel it in my bones hes in trouble he needs me we argued for another half hour before i could finally make her promise she wouldnt go near the wall before i got to west berlin i couldnt always count on quinns word but all told she had kept more promises than she had broken and there was a very good chance shed keep this one shed made a passing mention of maxedout credit cards before i hung up when the plane touched down at berlin tegel jet lag hit as if someone had dropped a heavy blanket on me i managed to drag myself through customs and the baggage claim and finally through the entrance gate and straight into bedlam i was caught in a sea of utterly joyful people hugging kissing laughing calling to each other in german but also several other languages occasionally even english at least three people kissed me on both cheeks and more tried the hugs were harder to avoidarms came out of the crowd to embrace me while i tried to find the city bus which my travel agent had told me to take to am zoo the hotel where quinn was staying if she was still there i didnt have to wait long at the stop but more people had jammed themselves onto the bus than id have thought possible nonetheless several near the door pulled me and my one small bag up into their midst ignoring my protests that there was no room youre north american us or canadian a woman asked in a heavy german accent uh us i felt awkward we were pressed up against each other so tightly i could feel her breath against my face she had been drinking beer so had everyone else around me ill go there one day i never thought i would but now i know i will her wide blue eyes already red from crying welled up and spilled over with great difficulty she maneuvered one hand into the shopping bag she was holding and came up with a piece of toilet paper i looked down the bag was bulging besides toilet paper i could see bananas marmalade peanut butter face cream shampoo and on top cds by duran duran and cyndi lauper soft enough to wipe your eyes the woman said as she did so nothing will ever be the same my mother dreamed of this she saw the wall go up i only wish she had lived to see it come down again its not down yet a man said not all the way it will be said someone else and everyone around me cheered as the bus lumbered along i found out from the people around me what had happened while i was still in transit the party secretary in east germany had announced there would be no more restrictions on travel to the west effective immediately thousands of east berliners on foot or in cars promptly made a beeline for the wall papers in hand demanding to cross into west berlin they were met by bewildered guards who unsure of their orders refused to let them through in a few hours thousands became tens of thousands until the guards finally gave in and opened the border but some brave souls had decided to break through the wall literally using sledgehammers and power saws west berliners who gathered on the other side greeted them with champagne embraces even money there was music and people were dancing on top of the berlin wall the whole city was caught up in the spirit it was the biggest street party ever by the time the bus reached kudamm i was feeling quite a lot of that spirit myself i was no longer tired my face hurt from smiling and in spite of myself my own eyes were welling up but as i struggled through the heaving masses on the street looking for the hotel i wanted to kill my sister quinn had added my name to the hotel room the people at the am zoo front desk were delighted to see me or rather my credit card which quinn had assured them would take care of the bill incidentals included i made a hopeful joke about discounts for historical events but suddenly no one understood english well enough to get it the room was nice enough though i wasnt sure it was really worth the small fortune i would be paying for it i was relieved to see my sisters things very much in evidenceit meant she hadnt gonealthough she was out of course probably dancing in the streets with everyone else in west berlin crisis or no crisis she never could resist a party i looked out the window at the teeming streets and jet lag hit again even if id known my way around the city i had no energy to elbow my way through all those people i lay down on the bed and passed out the next thing i knew quinn was shaking me like a rag doll come on jean youve got to wake up squinting against the bright overhead light i tried to pull away from her stopyoure gonna give me brain damage apparently she thought i was talking in my sleep i had to use a selfdefense move to get away from her it worked but i almost dislocated an elbow then instead of standing back so i could get up she actually went for me again i rolled away got tangled in the duvet and landed on the floor dont touch me im awake already i yelled as she loomed over me i was just going to help you up she said looking offended whats the matter with you somebody shook me out of a sound sleep whats your excuse i used the bed to pull myself up to a sitting position the berlin wall is coming down she said its history happening right here right now before our very eyes my very eyes still hurt from the bright light in the room i glared up at her murderously and thats why you couldnt wake me up in a more civilized fashion i tried you were dead to the world im jetlagged i spent the night not sleeping in a transatlantic sardine can well perk up cause you have to see this its amazing the east berlin guards are trading hats with the west berlin ones theyve got their arms around each other and theyre singing i struggled to my feet batting away the hand she offered to help then martin isnt trapped anymore and he and his family can see each other whenever they want our work here is done quinn blinked at me baffled what work democracy libertÃ© egalitÃ© fraternitÃ© free at last free at last thank god almighty theyre free at last martin and his family included right now hes probably bonding with the sisters and brother hes never met in between hugging his parents thats your cue to slip away quietly with your sister and go home and hug your parents ill help you pack there arent any flights out now she said how do you know whod want to leave jean you slept the day away there wouldnt be any flights now even if it werent the most incredible day in recent german history i almost laughed being all of twenty my sisters idea of recent history was last christmas fine lets pack your stuff ive got one little bag i havent even opened then well be all ready to fly out tomorrow morning quinn shook her head so vigorously her curls flew no were here now its happening right now every second is history twenty years from now do you want to have to tell everyone that you were in berlin when the wall came down and you watched it on tv in your hotel room i gave in and put on my shoes as soon as we waded into the crowds on the street i realized i wasnt just hungry but famished i hadnt eaten since before the plane had landed and that hadnt been mucha small cup of yogurt and a roll so stale it had mutated into styrofoam quinn didnt mind putting off our eyewitnessing history in favor of food but then with her credit cards maxed out shed probably missed a few meals herself the problem was the crowds not just in the streets but anywhere and everywhere food was served see they dont get any of that stuff in east berlin quinn told me pointing at a smiling man loaded down with two cases of coke next to him his family were eating out of large bags from a fastfood joint they take their kids into stores and the kids think theyre in fairyland what we take for granted is incredible luxury to them she sounded practically authoritative as if she knew all about the privations suffered by people in east germany that would be martin of course she was parroting martin probably right down his tone of voice and then it hit me she was trying to find him i was along to cover expenses i wanted to be wrong but there she was up on tiptoe stretching her neck like a meerkat scanning the crowd irritated i dragged her around a couple grinning at each other as they hefted boxes of stereo equipment through a group of young guys with enough junk food and beer for six weekend toga parties and down a side street where i found what was probably the only restaurant in west berlin without a line of people a block long waiting to get in when i saw the prices i understood why but i was past caring youre looking for him arent you i said as we sat at a table waiting to order dont deny it im not a moron but you are if hes back on this side of the wall hes probably with his family cant you just leave him alone with them for a while give him some space the last sentence replayed itself in my head had i actually said that i wanted to bite my tongue off youre being silly jean its like a tidal wave of people pouring through from east berlin its impossible to find anyone but she wouldnt look at me instead she studied the menu as if the secret of life were printed on it or martins current location i started to say something else but she talked over me lets just eat okay i dont know about you but im almost lightheaded with hunger thats what happens when you max out your credit cards i managed not to say out loud at this point i was too hungry to deal with anything much less quinns foolishness a relentlessly happy waitress took our orders and then brought us two pint glasses of beer we hadnt asked for dancing away before we could tell her we wanted soft drinks instead while the restaurant celebrated around us quinn and i ate our overpriced steaks in silence every so often i stole a glance at her to find her doing the same it wasnt until id finished a little over half the meal that i could find a little humor in the situationthe immediate situation that was there wasnt going to be a whole lot of hilarity in getting my sister home youre twenty years old the words were out before i realized id spoken quinn gave a faint puzzled laugh and youre thirtysix and ever think about going back to college not this again she sawed a piece off her steak as i told mom and dad and marie and kath and lisa and you and everybody and their mother im not the academic type studying isnt my thing so what is your thingchasing some guy halfway around the world now she looked offended martin isnt just some guy hes moreso much more okay hes got quite a history ill give you that being a refugee from behind the iron curtain growing up without his parentsdefinitely not your average man on the street but that doesnt mean he hasnt dumped you doesnt mean he has quinn chewed stolidly and took a sip of beer you have no sense of anything that isnt ordinary to you its all just people shifting around like i dont know little blocks legos martin and i arent legos we have something more profound than you could ever know how long were you with him i asked two months three almost four quinn looked smug so there almost four profound months eh whats his middle name my sister looked startled for a fraction of a second then covered with a laugh nosy arent you cant say you know anyone if you dont know their middle name i said i dont like to pry unlike some people i didnt know eddies middle name was erasmus til after we got engaged turned out that wasnt the only thing i didnt know about him and wed been together for over a year good thing i found out before i did something stupid like marry him you didnt break up with eddie because his middle name was erasmus quinn said i was only ten but i knew that correct i broke up with him because hed been hiding things from me martin never hid anything from me you dont know that four months isnt long enough to know fine quinn said flatly her eyes hard then ill give him a little longer she dragged her napkin back and forth across her mouth before dropping it on the table you really dont know jean theres a lot more to life than you think there really is an unseen world i knowmartin showed it to me my heart sank oh no quinn not like the guru he wasnt a guru he was a swami he was a con man and he saw you coming its not like that she said hotly this isnt america where everything happened ten minutes ago this is the old world time is measured in millennia here and everything isnt always nice and neat and easily explained martin opened my eyes to so much im not going to just abandon him youre going to have to learn the hard way again arent you i said before i could tell myself to shut up quinn didnt take offense laughing she toasted me with her beer well just see who learns what the hard wayme or my older and supposedly wiser sister in the course of my misspent youth i joined the antiwar demonstrations in washington dc some years later i went to prekatrina new orleans for mardi gras both times i thought id been in big crowds this beat them by several magnitudes there was no place not filled with peoplehappy people dancing singing shoutingwhile music played and fireworks went off i held on to quinns arm determined not to lose heror let her lose mebut invariably someone would come between us to hug her or me or both and id lose my grip on her fortunately i always found her again although a few times i would grab for what i thought was her arm only to discover i was manhandling a stranger quinns face would pop up several feet away looking amused as i swam through the crowd to get to her we should have tied ourselves together with rope i said as we squeezed through the masses disoriented i had no idea where we were there seemed to be only two directionstoward the wall or away from itand only two locationsone side of the wall or the other correction there was a third locationon top of the wall people dancing on it were reaching down to hoist others up to dance with them was quinns errant boyfriend up there i wondered as we got closer i could hear below the singing and music and general uproar tapping noises metal on stone in various rhythms hammers chipping away at the wall it would take a hell of a lot of hammers to punch through they needed sledgehammers or better yet wrecking balls abruptly i heard a loud buzzing whine on top of the wall a cascade of sparks erupted as someone attacked it with a power saw people cheered and i found myself spontaneously cheering with them which earned me another amused look from quinn but only very brieflyshe was scanning the mass of people in front of her with more urgency the buzzsaw whine cut off and i heard a new sound the chatter of a small engine working too hard i looked to my left and through a break in the crowd i saw a small car exuding a cloud of exhaust as it inched forward people lunged out of the crowd to pound their fists on it startling the driver and his passengers for a moment i was afraid i was about to see a mob drag them out of the car and attack them but no the crowd was laughing a woman shoved a bottle of champagne through the drivers side window and kissed the wideeyed driver while a couple of teenagers stuck flowers in the front bumper whats that about i asked my sister trabi thumping she said theyve been doing it all day trabants are really awful cars but thats all they have over there another rattletrap car crept along behind it and was given the same treatment i turned to ask quinn how our being out in an enormous crowd watching people dent cars would accomplish anything but she was gone the arm i was holding on to belonged to a middleaged man with a mustache he was grinning at me with delight he went on grinning as i apologized and disengaged feeling like an idiot and a drunken idiot at that i hadnt had much beer but it didnt take much combined with jet lag and mass celebratory hysteria people kept hugging me as i struggled through the crush i stopped trying to fight them off it was faster just to go along with it and keep moving after a while i realized i was automatically hugging everyone i passed when in rome or west berlin working my way through the crowd i began hearing snatches of english when i looked around though i couldnt see who was speaking i listened in vain for quinns voice then all the voices were drowned out by the sound of fireworks multicolored lights blossomed overhead briefly turning the night as bright as day none of the joyfilled upturned faces around me belonged to quinn i kept pushing toward the wall calling out her name more fireworks streaked skyward and exploded suddenly a new light hit my eyes blinding me for a couple of seconds before it slid away and rippled over the crowd someone on top of the wall was wielding a spotlight like a searchlight the bright circle moved back and forth pausing here and there the people caught in it waved their arms and cheered trying to blink away the dark patches of afterimage i kept pushing toward the wall calling out my sisters name more lights appeared high up now large banks of them sending faint multiple shadows from the people on top of the wall over the crowd below i put one hand up to try to shield my eyes watering madly now from the cold or maybe i was so caught up in the moment i was crying with happiness like everyone else in berlin i honestly didnt know anymore and i was starting to feel a little scared not just by that but by the fact that the crowd was getting so thick that sometimes my feet didnt touch the ground abruptly i fetched up against something hard and rough and cold id reached the infamous berlin wall where people had died making a break for freedom machinegunned by east berlin guardsand where it seemed i was going to be crushed to death squashed by the entire happy population of west berlin celebrating its symbolic fall with great effort i pushed myself back so i could turn around just as something hit the stone inches from my right eye i had a glimpse of a grinning male face and then flinched as a large hammer came at me chips and dust flew against the side of my face watch it you moron i yelled startled and angry i got that in my eye i had one hand pressed to my eye and i didnt actually know if that were true but it would have been just my luck to be blinded by fragments from the destruction of the berlin wall where the hell was quinn blind or not i was going to kill her herea special souvenir someone shoved something into my other hand and closed my fingers around it after a bit of careful blinking i determined that my eye was all right even if i was still in danger of being mashed to pulp against the wall then i turned to see the grinning face again he was using a hammer and chisel on the wall but at a safer lower level what are you doing i asked forgetting i was mad at him getting pieces of the wall he said happily special souvenirs i gave you one he jerked his chin at my closed hand i opened my fingers to see a jagged chunk of stone sitting on my palm see piece of the real berlin wall the night it came down have to get it while we can before its gone in spite of everything i had to laugh yeah the berlin wall was most definitely down in a years time thered be chunks of broken stone and brick for sale in every hotel and airport gift shop attached to key chains set in snow globes and paperweights and framed boxes with or without an accompanying historic photopieces of the true wall for sale along with toilet paper shampoo and cds by duran duran and cyndi lauper the people behind the iron curtain had no idea what was about to hit them you want some more the guy asked me pausing with the chisel against the wall there were lots of craters where bits had just been chipped away i dropped the fragment in my coat pocket and shook my head nah save some for the east berliners theyll need the income he frowned i am from east berlin he said i nodded and started to push my way past him when he grabbed my arm wait he fumbled in his coat pocket and came up with a compact camera it looked brand new please could you take my picture i looked at the people crowded around us i can try he posed smiling holding up his hammer and chisel in one hand and a large chunk of stone in the other say cheese no say freeeeeeedom someone shouted to the delight of everyone in earshot the guy did so but then had to wait an extra second while i found the right button for the shutter which probably made his smile look just a bit strained not that it mattered he now had photographic evidence to prove his rubble was really from the wall and not just something he picked up off the ground somewhere there you go i said passing the camera back to him thatll take care of the provenance he thanked me looking puzzled and went on chipping away as i kept moving along the wall i saw that he wasnt the only souvenir hunter lots of people were doing the same thing some of them filling plastic bags with chunks of history there was one woman however who was actually fussy about the pieces she chipped out of the wall she would work on a small area very carefully doing her best to get a chunk at least as large as the palm of her hand once she did that she would hold it for a few seconds head bowed and eyes closed then she would either discard it and look for another section of wall or kiss it and drop it into the large cloth bag slung diagonally across her front i was curious but more concerned about finding quinn i tried calling out her name again and this time the sound of my american accent generated a new and unexpected response american yay american usa usa usa suddenly everyone in my immediate vicinity loved me and i mean loved they rushed me all at once pressing me into the cold stone grabbing me kissing my arms my hands whatever they could get at this was it i thought as i gasped for air i was going to die of love at the berlin wall then i felt my feet leave the ground oh good i thought giddily i was going to crowd surf that was so much better than getting crushed to death i wouldnt even mind if someone groped my butt a small price to pay but i kept rising higher and higher and before i knew what was really happening i was already on top of the wall amid a group of laughing dancing people who also seemed to love me a lot while the crowd below cheered the only coherent thought i had was omigod as my sense of balance disappeared and left me teetering among strangers who might not notice i was about to fall to my death then my balance returned as abruptly as it had vanished and i was fine better than fineit was the perfect vantage point for looking for quinn i hollered as loud as i could between my cupped hands people heard me i saw them turn to look up at me curiously and then go on with their hugging and kissing and dancing and drinking champagne getting a bit more used to where i was i started slowly sidling along the wall stopping only for the occasional hug and kiss flashlights played over the sea of people a flashlight was exactly what i needed i thought maybe everyone loved everyone so much up here that i could persuade somebody to loan me one a tall woman with spiky red hair was only too happy to let me use hers on the crowd first demonstrating zigzags and figure eights and other patterns i obliged briefly and then began searching methodically among the people closest to the wall the light was already dimming in my hands probably after hours of zigzags and figure eights just my luck i thought then i saw a head of shiny black curls directly below me i might not have been sure except for the shiny blond head with her quinn i screamed she and martin looked up at me along with at least thirty other people quinn was surprised as if she had forgotten i was even here martins expression was a mix of dismay and vague puzzlement he didnt recognize me i realized quinn we have to go home now i hollered she made an annoyed face before turning away to argue with martin he wasnt having any he kept interrupting her and gesturing at me all the while shaking his head emphatically no no a thousand times no quinn he said no now lets go home my throat was getting raw i had to get down but how i tried to talk to the people around me to ask them to help me down lower me down or something but no one was listening now theyd just hug me or kiss me and go on dancing or cheering i crouched down trying to estimate by sight how long the drop would be if i were to hang by my hands and let my feet dangle too far not to get hurt i decided assuming i actually could have dangled my own body weight by my hands for longer than an eighth of a second martin gestured at me againno not me the walland pushed quinn back a couple of feet she tried to move toward him but the people directly behind her grabbed her and held her back not roughly but firmly so that she could barely move were all those people with martin who were they i couldnt see their faces very well at this angle but some of them had the same shade of blond hair martins family then theyd gotten through from east berlin or some of them had gotten through and they were here at the wall waiting for the rest but why here why not at one of the actual gates where people were coming through on foot or in their cars so the west berliners could pound dents into them all at once there was an incredibly loud buzzing whine that startled me so much i nearly fell several feet to my right i saw a fountain of sparksanother power saw the hell with rubble grab some power tools and cut yourself a whole panel people on top of the wall and below were cheering except for martin and the people with him i saw they actually looked scared quinn was still struggling to get free martin seemed to be telling the people who had her to hold her tighter then he turned to face the wall and put both hands on the stone i could actually hear my sister screaming above the power saw as martin moved closer to the wall in tiny shuffling steps the angle made it impossible to see what he was doing for that matter i couldnt even see him anymore there was no way to lean forward without taking a header off the top i lay down on my stomach so i could see what was directly below me the people holding quinn hadnt moved and quinn still twisted in their grip but i couldnt see martin i inched forward scanning the people on either side of the spot where he had been standing but he wasnt among them and the spot where he had been remained clear no one crowded in almost as if an unseen barrier were keeping them back quinn lifted her tearful face to look at me i was trying to think of something to say to her when martin came through the wall the actual movement itself seemed so normal that i almost ignored it then i did what i can only describe as a mental double take by that time martin was standing in front of the wall embracing an older woman shaking as she sobbed in his arms they came through the wall they came through the berlin wall except i remembered some people had trouble getting through the wall some people got stuck my rational mind was telling me i was tripping on the atmosphere jet lag beer and possibly something my beer had been spiked with but my rational mind was very small and very very far away what i was seeing told me that i had to get quinn out of the way before she screwed things up quinn i bellowed we have to leave were in the way martin the woman who i figured was his mother and everyone else looked up at me i got up and moved down several feet trying to show them in sign language what i wanted to do even finally getting some help from the people up on the wall with me however i couldnt get close enough to the ground to jump without hurting myself then a few of the people holding quinn gave her over briefly to martin who tolerated her clinging to him for the time it took for them to catch me still it wasnt fun the fall knocked the breath out of me martins people probably were family close up the resemblance was very strong they didnt have much english but enough to make it clear that i had to catch my breath quickly and take my sister away i wasnt sure id actually be able to do that considering it had taken four of them to hang on to her all of whom looked a lot stronger than i was but i guess all the struggling had tired her out i didnt need much help to peel her off martin and once i got her back into the thick of the crowd she wouldnt be able to push her way through them to get back to martin thank you he said to me in a voice that was somehow both formal and warm it takes all of us to will it i cant take her too wed never get out wed die in there im sorry quinn i am he bent to kiss her go this isnt for you no i can help quinn wailed i turned her around grabbed her waist and pushed her into the crowd ahead of me jean dont i love him just stay out of it i growled wincing at the growing soreness in my throat id been shouting so much i was going to lose my voice this isnt your fight not this part you saw it though right she twisted out of my grip and turned to face me you saw now you know yeah i saw i know and tomorrow ill fall out of bed and itll all be a dream clichÃ© ending but if it works it works lets go no i want to be there for him i want to help i want to be part of it quinn tried to push past me but id been right she had no strength left now you cant i rasped youre not part of it you cant be you never could have been theyre them and were us but he showed me his mistake people make mistakes when they think theyre all alone thats not it quinn that is it now we have to let him get the rest of his family out the image of the woman id seen chipping pieces out of the wall popped into my mind tossing some pieces away keeping others kissing them before she put them in her bag because she couldnt get her own people out why not because they had died in there the answer came unbidden and with a certainty i couldnt justify i shoved the thought aside telling myself that when i woke up tomorrow id have forgotten all about it i can help she insisted trying to lunge past me again you cant i pushed her back hard you dont belong with them youre not special you have no place in any unseen world youre like me and the rest of our family get used to it she looked at me like id slapped her oh sorry i said feeling equally stung by her reaction its hell being ordinary but thats the human condition all the fight went out of her then and she let me take her back to the am zoo the next morning i paid the horrendous bill and we flew back to the united states quinn wouldnt talk to me for most of the trip home which didnt bother me much i was too busy sleeping the more time i could spend unconscious after that the less real it seemed and the saner i felt quinn eventually started speaking to me again but never about that night in berlin from time to time ive been tempted to bring it up but i know that would just be asking for trouble im much more curious about what happened with martin and his familyif he got them all out where they are now im pretty sure quinn never heard anything from him i dont know for certain but id bet money that she tried to find him again after we got home and it wouldnt surprise me if she googles his name now and then or looks at footage from that night on youtube ive looked myself and never seen anything unusual ive never gotten back to berlin but one of my friends from work went to germany for the first time a few years ago on her honeymoon she came back and gave us all these little bottles about three inches tall filled with fragments of brick and stone pieces of the old berlin wall she said you can buy them everywhere it doesnt look like much but its history i guess a little bit of history in a threeinch bottle i took mine home and emptied it out on a saucer it really didnt look like anything at all it certainly didnt feel like anything special but instead of putting it back in the bottle i dumped it outside in the backyard maybe it was just debris from some demolished building or maybe it was a collection of pieces of the true wall on the off chance it was the latter i left it to blow away freely

professor of childrens literature he was bitterly used to cutting it close but now with nothing in the wings to follow his mssu gig but jake riskins offer to sub remedial english in the joplin high schools life was officially the bleakest richardson could remember easy enough to blink through grad school dreaming of life as a matthew arnoldesque scholargypsy harder to slog through decades of futureless jobs in secondrank college towns never being offered the cozy sinecure he had once assumed inevitable what about professional respect and privileges what about medical insurance teaching assistants preferred parking what about sabbaticals rescue found him shopping in the west th street savealot his cell phone rang and wondrously instead of jake pushing for a decision the call was from a secretary at the university of washington english department would he she wondered be free to take over classes for a professor who had just been awarded a sizable grant to spend eighteen months at cambridge producing a study of the life and works of joan aiken he said yes of course then took a brief time settling the details which were neither many nor complicated at no time did he show the slightest degree of unprofessional emotion but after he snapped his phone shut he stood very still and whispered saved to himself and when he left the store there were red baby potatoes a pound in his bag instead of cent russets most especially was he grateful at being able to take over the queen anne hill apartment of the traveling professor it was snugthe man lived alone except for an old cat whom richardson who disliked cats had dourly agreed to care forbut also well appointed including cable television washer and dryer microwave and dishwasher a handsome fireplace and a onecar garage with a cord of split wood for the winter neatly stacked at the far end the rent was manageable as was the drive to the uw and his classes were surprisingly enjoyable containing as they did a fair number of students who actually wanted to be there richardson could have done decidedly worse and most often had he had been welcomed to the school with impersonal warmth by the chairman of the english department who was younger than richardson and looked it the chairmans name was philip austin watkins iv but he preferred to be called aussie though he had never been to australia he assured richardson earnestly on their first meeting i want you to know im really happy to have you on board and ill do everything i can to get you extended here if possible thats a promise richardson who knew much better at fiftyone than to believe this believed his students generally seemed to like himat least they paid attention worked hard on their assignments didnt mock his serious manner and often brought up intelligent questions about milne and greene erich kÃ¤stner hugh lofting astrid lindgren or his own beloved e nesbit but they never took him into their confidence even during his office hoursnever wept or broke down confessing anxieties or sins or dreams which would have terrified him never came to him merely to visit nor did he make any significant connections with his fellows on the faculty he knew well enough that he made friends with difficulty and wasnt good at keeping them being naturally formal in his style and uncomfortable in his body so that he appeared to be forever leaning away from people even when he was making an earnest effort to be close to them with women his lifelong awkwardness became worse in the terminally friendly seattle atmosphere once younger he had wished to be different now he no longer believed it possible the legendary rain of the pacific northwest was not an issue if anything he discovered that he enjoyed it having studied the data on the seattle climate carefully once he knew he was going there he understood that many areas of both coasts get notably more rain in terms of inches and endure distinctly colder winters and the yearround greenness and lack of air pollution more than made up for the mildew as far as richardson was concerned damp or not it beat joplin or hobbs new mexico or enterprise alabama what the greenness did not make up for was the nearperpetual overcast seattles sky was dazzlingly exaltingly shockingly blue when it chose to be so but there was a reason that the city consumed more than its share of vitamin d and was the first marketplace for various fullspectrum lightbulbs seattle introduced richardson to an entirely new understanding of the word overcast sometimes going two months and more without seeing either clear skies or an honest raindrop he had not been prepared for this many things that shrink from sunlight gain power in fog and murk richardson began to find himself reluctant enough to leave the atmosphere of the uw campus that he often stayed on after work attending lectures that bored him going to showings of films he didnt understandeven once dropping in on a faculty meeting though this was not required of him the main subject under discussion was the urgent need to replace a particular ta who for six years had been covering most of the undergraduate classes of professors far too occupied with important matters to deal with actual students another year would have required granting him a tenuretrack assistant professorship which was of course out of the question sitting uncomfortably in the back saying nothing richardson felt he was somehow attending his own autopsy and when richardson finally went home in darkness to the warm comfortable apartment that was not his own and the company of the soursmelling old gray cat he frequently went out again to walk aimlessly on steep silent queen anne hill and beyond watching the lights go out in window after window if rain did not fall he might well wander until three or four in the morning as he had never before done in his life but it was in daylight that richardson first saw the troll he had walked across the blueandorange drawbridge at the foot of queen anne hill into fremont which had become a favorite weekend ramble of his though the quirky rakish little pocket always made him nervous and wistful at the same time he wished he were the sort of person who could fit comfortably into a neighborhood that could proclaim itself the center of the universe hold a nude bicycle parade as part of a solstice celebration and put up signs advising visitors to throw their watches away he would have liked to be able to imagine living in fremont richardson had read about the fremont bridge troll online while preparing to leave joplin he knew that it was not actually located under the fremont bridge but under the north end of the nearby aurora avenue bridge and that the troll was made of concrete had been created by a team of four artists weighed four thousand pounds was more than eighteen feet high had one staring eye made of an automobile hubcap and was crushing a cementspattered volkswagen beetle in its left hand as beloved a tourist photo op as the space needle it had the inestimable further advantages of being free unique and something no lover of childrens books could ignore it took richardson a while to come facetoface with the troll because the day was blue and brisk and the families were out in force shoving up to the statue to take pictures posing small children and puzzledlooking babies within the trolls embrace or actually placing them on its shoulder richardson made no effort to approach until the crowd had thinned to a few teenagers with cellphone cameras then he went close enough to see his distorted reflection in the battered aluminum eye he said nothing but stayed there until a couple of the teenagers pushed past him to be photographed kissing and snuggling in the shadow of the troll then he went on home two weeks later driven by increasing insomnia he crossed the fremont bridge again and eventually found himself facing the glowering concrete monster where it crouched in its streetside cave alone in darkness with no fond throng to warm and humanize it the hubcap eye now seemed to be sizing him up as a tender improvement on a vw beetle grendel richardson thought this is what grendel looked like aloud he said hello off for the night the troll made no answer richardson went a few steps closer fascinated by the expression and personality it was possible to impose on two tons of concrete he asked it do you ever get tired of tourists gaping at you every day i would for some reason he wanted the troll to know that he was a sympathetic understanding person he said my names richardson a roupy old voice behind him said dont you get too close hes mean richardson turned to see a black rain slicker which appeared to be almost entirely inhabited by a huge gray beard the hood of the slicker was pulled close around the old mans face so that only the beard and a pair of bright bloodshot gray eyes were visible as he squatted on the sidewalk that approached the underpass with four shopping bags arranged around him richardson took them at first for the mans worldly possessions only later back in the apartment did he recall glimpsing a long italian salami a wine bottle and a french baguette in one of them the old man cougheda long rattling machinegun burstthen growled id back off a little ways was i you he gets mean at night richardson played along with the joke oh i dont know he put up so nicely with all those tourists today daytime the old man grunted sun goes down he gets around he belched mightily leaned back against the guardrail and closed his eyes well richardson said chuckling to keep the conversation reasonable well but youre here taking a nap right within his grasp youre not afraid of him the old man did not open his eyes i got on his good side a long time ago go away man you dont want to be here the last words grumbled into a snore richardson stood looking back and forth at the troll and the old man in the black rain slicker whose snoring mouth hung open a redblack wound in the vast gray beard finally he said politely to the troll you have curious friends and walked quickly away the old man never stirred as richardson passed him he had no trouble sleeping that night but he did dream of the troll they were talking quite earnestly under the bridge but he remembered not even a fragment of their conversation only that the troll was wearing a smokey bear hat and kept biting pieces off the volkswagen chewing them like gum and spitting them out in the dream richardson accepted this as perfectly normal the flavor probably didnt last very long he didnt go back to see the troll at night for a month once or twice in the daytime yes but he found such visits unsatisfying during daylight hours the tourist buses were constantly stopping and families were likely to push baby carriages close between the trolls hands for photographs the familiarity the chattering gaiety was almost offensive to him as though the people were savages out of bad movies and the troll their trapped and stoic prisoner he never saw the old man there presumably he was off doing whatever homeless people did during the day even those who bought french baguettes with their beggings richardsons own routine was as drearily predictable as ever over the years he had become intensely aware of the arc of each passing contract from eager launch through trembling zenith to the unavoidable day when he packed his battered subaru and drove off to whatever job might come next he was now at the halfway point of his stay at the uw each time he opened his office door was one twisting turn closer to the last each paycheck a countdown in reverse to the end of his temporary security richardsons students and colleagues saw no change in his tone or behaviorhe was most careful about thatbut in his own ears he heard a gently rising scream his silent night walks began to fill with imagined conversations some of these were with his parents both long deceased but still reproving others were with distantly remembered college acquaintances or with characters out of his favorite books but the ones that richardson enjoyed most were his onesided exchanges with the troll whose vast unresponsive silence richardson found endlessly encouraging as he wandered through the darkness hands uncharacteristically in his hip pockets he found he could speak to the troll as though they had been friends long enough that there was no point in hiding anything from one another he had never known that sort of friendship i am never going to be anything more than i am already he said to the trollhaunted air forget the fellowships and grants never mind the articles in the new yorker smithsonian harpers never mind the modern language association pen none of it is ever going to happen troll i know this my life is exactly like yoursset in stone and meaningless without realizing it or ever putting it into words richardson came to think of the concrete troll as his only real friend in seattle just as he began resenting the old man in the rain slicker for his privileged position on the trolls good side and himself for his own futility in the middle of one classa lecture on the period political references hidden within lewis carrolls underappreciated sylvie and brunorichardson heard his own voice abruptly say to hell with that he had to stop and look around the hall for a moment puzzling his students before he realized that he hadnt actually said the words out loud on the damp and moonless night that richardson finally returned to the end of the aurora avenue bridge the old man wasnt there neither was the troll only the concreteslathered volkswagen was still in place its curved roof and sides indented where the trolls great fingers had previously rested sun goes down he gets around richardson remembered what he had assumed was a joke and shook his head sharply he felt the urge to run away as if the absence of the troll somehow constituted an almost cellular rebuke to his carefully manicured sense of the rational richardson heard the sound then distant yet but numbingly clear the long dragging scrape of stone over asphalt he turned and walked a little way to look east toward fremont streetsaw the hunched shadow rising into viewturned again and bolted back across the bridge the one leading him to queen anne hill a door he could close and lock and a smelly gray cat wailing angrily over an empty food dish he sat up the rest of the night watching the qvc channel for company seeing nothing near dawn he fell asleep on the livingroom couch with the television set still selling select comfort beds and amethyst jewelry in the morning before he went to the university he drove down into fremont doubleparking at th and winslow to make sure of what he already knew the troll was back in its place with no smallest deviation from its four creators positioning and no indication that it had ever moved at all even its grip on the old vw was displayed exactly as it had been crushing finger for finger bulging knuckle for knuckle splayed righthand fingers digging at the earth for purchase richardson had a headache he stepped graciously aside for children already swarming up to pose with the troll for their parents hurried back to his car and drove away his usual parking space was taken when he got to the uw and finding another made him late to class for more than two weeks richardson not only avoided the aurora bridge but stayed out of fremont altogether even so whether by day or night strolling the campus shopping in the university district or walking a silent waterfront street under the viaduct he would often stand very still listening for the slow terribly slow grinding of concrete feet somewhere near the fact that he could not quite hear it did not make it go away eventually out of a kind of wintry lassitude he began drifting down fourth avenue north again at first no farther than the drawbridge whose raisings and lowerings he found oddly soothing he seemed to be at a curious remove from himself during that time watching himself watching the boats waiting to pass the bridge watching the rain on the water when he finally did cross the bridge however he did so without hesitation and on the hunt fuck off cutnshoot said just fuck off and go away and leave me alone not a chance i have to get ready i have to be there then tell me all you have to do is tell me richardson had found the bearded old man asleepnoisily asleep his throat a sporadic bullroarerunder a tree in the gas works park near the shore of lake union he was still wearing the same clothes and black rain slicker now with the hood down and there was an empty bottle of orange schnapps clutched in his filthy hand bits of greasy foie gras speckled his whiskers like dirty snow when glaring him awake didnt work richardson had moved on to kicking the cracked leather soles of the mans old boots which did it also got him a deep bruise on his forearm from blocking an angrily thrown schnapps bottle their subsequent conversation had been unproductive so far the only useful thing he had uncovered was that the old man called himself cutnshoot after the small town in texas where hed been born that was the end of anything significant aside from the mans obvious agitation and impatience as evening darkened toward night goddamn you somebody gets hurt its going to be all your fault let me go cutnshoots bellow was broken by a coughing spasm that almost brought him to his knees he leaned forward spitting and dribbling hands braced on his thighs im not stopping you richardson said i just want answers i know you werent making that up about the troll moving at night ive seen it yah cutnshoot hawked up one last monster wad so what price of fish cakes aint your job im a professor of childrens literature a full professorfor some reason he felt compelled to lie to the old manat the university of washington i could quote you troll stories from here to next september and one thing i knew for certainuntil i met youwas that they dont exist cutnshoot glared at him out of one rheumy eye the other one closed and twitching you think you know trolls he snorted goddamn useless punk you dont know shit show me the old man stared hard for a moment more then smiled revealing a sprinkling of brown teeth it was not a friendly expression might be i will then maybe teach you a lesson but were gonna pick up some things first and youre buyin come on cutnshoot led him a little over threequarters of a mile from the park along northlake way under the high overpass of the aurora avenue bridge and the low one at fourth avenue then right on evanston richardson tried asking more questions but got nothing but growls and snorts for his trouble best to save his breath anywayhe was surprised at how fast the old man could move in a syncopated crabscuttle that favored his right leg and made the rain slicker snap like a geishas fan at the corner of th street cutnshoot ignored the parallel white stripes of the crosswalk and angled straight across the street to the doors of the fremont pcc he strode through them like alexander entering a conquered city the bag clerk nearest the entry waved as they came in hey cut little late tonight cutnshoot didnt pause cocking one thumb back over his shoulder at richardson as he swept up a plastic shopping basket and continued deeper into the store not my fault professor heres got the rag on when they finally lefthaving rung up of luxury items on richardsons mastercard including multiple cuts of eel river organic beef and a bottle of cadence camerata cabernet sauvignonit was a docile baffled richardson grocery bags in hand who trudged after the old man down the mostly empty neighborhood streets cutnshoot had made his selections with the demanding eye of a lifelong connoisseur assessing things on some qualitative scale of measurement richardson couldnt begin to comprehend that he and his wallet were being taken advantage of was selfevident but the inborn curiosity that had first led him to books as a child that insatiable need to get to the end of each new unfolding story was now completely engaged rambling concrete trolls werent the only mystery in fremont cutnshoot led him east along th street to where troll avenue started a narrow road rising between the grand columns that supported the aurora avenue bridge high on the bridge itself cars hissed by like ghosts while down on the ground it was quiet as the sea bottom and the sparse lights from lakeside boats and local apartment buildings only served to make the path up to the troll darker than richardson liked stupid ratfucks throw a big party up there every october cutnshoot said call it trolloween people batshit stupid well fremonts that kind of place richardson responded i mean the solstice parade oktoberfest the crazy rocket with freedom to be peculiar written on it in latin dont care about all that crap just wish they wouldnt rile him so much jobs hard enough as it is and what job would that be exactly anyway youll see at the top of the road the bridge merged with the hillside forming the space that held the troll with stairs running up the hill on either side tonight the troll looked exactly as it had the first time he saw it it was impossible to imagine this crudely hewn mound of ferroconcrete in motion even knowing what he knew cutnshoot made him put the grocery bags on the ground at the base of the eastern stair then gestured brusquely for him to stand aside when he did the old man got down heavily on one kneenot the right one richardson noticedand started searching through them thats the thing see people never know what theyre doing best place to sleep in town and they had to go fuck everything up its concrete and wire and rebar richardson responded i read about it they had a contest back in this design won there used to be a time capsule with elvis memorabilia in the car for christs sake its not real sure sure like a troll cares what its made of starting out hah that aint the point point is they did too good a job cutnshoot struggled to his feet unbalanced by the pair of brown packages he was holdingtwo large roasts in their tapedup butcher wrapping here he said holding out one of them to richardson get this shit off he wont be able to smell em through the paper you feed him told you i was on his good side didnt i grinning fiercely through his beard now the old man marched straight to the hulking stone brute and slapped the bloody roast down on the ground in front of it there he said first snack of the night better than your usual too and dont you know it ummmmmm thats gonna be good he looked back at richardson just as a car passed its headlights making the trolls hubcap eye seem to flicker and spin well come onyou wanted this didnt you just do like me make it friendly richardson was holding the larger unwrapped roast in front of him like a doily pinching the thick slab of meat between the thumb and forefinger of each hand it was slippery and the blood dripping from it made him queasy as he stepped forward with the offering an old norse poem suddenly came to him the earliest relevant reference his magpie mind could dredge up they call me troll he recited gnawer of the moon giant of the galeblasts curse of the rainhall cutnshoot looked at him approvingly nodding him on companion of the sibyl nightroaming hag swallower of the loaf of heaven what is a troll but that richardson laid his roast down gently beside cutnshoots took a deep breath and backed away without looking up not knowing as he did so whether this obeisance was for the trolls benefit cutnshoots or his own the old mans grating chuckle came to him thats the good side all right thats the way thats the way richardson looked up cutnshoot had pushed back the hood of his rain slicker and was scratching his head through hair like furnace ashes but he likes lively a sight better you get the chance you remember nothings happening richardson started to sayand then something was one by one the fingers of the trolls right hand were coming free of the ground richardson realized that the whole forearm was lifting up twisting from the elbow dust and dirt sifting off as it rose the giant hand turned with the motion deadgray fingers coming together with a sound of cracking bricks thenlike a child grabbing for jacks before the ball comes down and just as fastthe trolls hand swept up the two roasts in one great swinging motion and carried them to its suddenly open mouth the ponderous jaw moved up and down three times before it settled back into place and richardson tried to imagine what could possibly be going on inside a moment later the trolls hand and arm returned to their original position fingers wriggling their way back into the soil and once more becoming motionless there was no moon and no more cars went by but the hubcap continued to twinkle with a brightly chilling malice and evenso it seemed to richardsonto wink he was still staring at the troll when cutnshoot finally clapped his palms together with satisfaction well old sumbitch settled right down think he liked that fancy talk know any more sure my lucky day the old man said now lemme show you what the wines for richardson woke the next morning hung over stiff backed and with a runny nose he was late to class again and that evening when he returned to fremont he brought lamb chops from then on he never came to the bridge without bringing some tribute for the troll most often it came in the form of slabs of raw meat though now and again this being seattle he would present the statue with a whole salmon usually purchased down at the ferry dock from a fishermans wife onceonly oncehe tried offering a bag of fresh crab cakes but cutnshoot informed him tersely dont give him none of that touristy shit and made him go back to the fremont pcc for an entire diestel family turkey richardson also read to the troll most evenings working his way up from obvious fare to selections from the bland tomtar och troll series voiced dramatically in his best stab at phonetic swedish he had no idea whether the troll understood but the expressions on his own face as he dealt with the unfamiliar orthography made cutnshoot howl it didnt always go easily by day the troll was changeless an eternally crude concrete figure with one dull aluminum eye a vacantly malevolent expression and bad hair at night its temperament was as unpredictably irritable as a wasps richardson began to measure his visits on a scale marked in feet yards and furlongs assessing the difference between this tuesday and that saturday by precisely how far the troll stirred from its den in that way he came to understandas cutnshoot never bothered to explainthat the old mans task wasnt to feed the troll at all but rather to distract it to confuse it to shortcircuit its unfocused instinct to go off unimpeded about its trollish business whatever that might be food was a means to that end as now was richardsons cheerfully garbled swedish even so there were nights when it would not yield and lumbered half a mile or more before they could tempt and coax itlike two pekingese herding a mastiffback under the bridge on those nights nothing would do but the lively usually in the form of a writhing rat or pigeon cutnshoot never told richardson howor with whathe caught them the months passed and the weather turned relatively mild and notably dry on campus this was generally spoken of as a function of global warming and greeted with definite anxiety richardson paid little attention to climate crises having his own worries his temporary tenure at the university was coming to an end with the summer quarter and thoughts of the department chairs vague early promises moved in his heart like schooling fish instead of calling up job listings and sending out inquiries he found himself manufacturing excuses to go by aussies office or sit near him in the faculty dining hall hoping that mere proximity might make the man offer him work he couldnt possibly ask for he also began to drink at first in pretended sociability with cutnshoot but later with the devotion of a convert it was not an area in which he had any sort of previous expertise he could neither tell good champagne from bad nor uppershelf vodka from potatopeel swill only that in each case the latter was distinctly cheaper it all invariably left him with a hammering headache the next morning which seemed to be how you could tell you were doing it right having no one to drink with in comfort and understanding he came to spend the early part of many evenings drinking with the gray cat for whom he had conceived an increasing dislike not only did it smell bad it had taken to urinating on the floor outside its box and knocking down the clothes hamper to tear and scratch at richardsons dirty clothes richardson who had never hated an animal in his life no more than he had ever loved one brooded increasingly and extensively about the gray cat nothing would probably have come of this growing fixation had he not already been drunk on the evening he discovered that the cat had peed in his only pair of carpet slippers having noticed a pettransport cage in one of the closets he pounced on the unwary animal and forced it into the cage threw on his coat and stalked down the hill toward fremont muttering in counterpoint to the cats furious wails as the cage banged against the side of his left knee lively right lively it is lively it bloody is cutnshoot said nothing when richardson set the cage down facing the troll shouted lively and walked quickly away paying no heed to the cats redoubled howling he did look back once but cage and bridge were both out of sight by then in the morning between the expected headache and the forgotten prefinals lecture summarizing works intended for children from ad to he remembered the cat only as he was locking the apartment door there was no time to check on the cage just then but all day long he could concentrate on almost nothing else along with trying to invent something to tell the cats owner he became obsessed with the notion that the humane society would be waiting for him at the bridge with a charge of felony animal abuseand quite possibly littering that evening he found the remains of the empty cage between two of the trolls huge fingers the door had been ripped clean away as had most of the front of the cage and the rest of it had been pounded almost shapeless as though by a hammer or a great fist there was fur richardson just made it to the bushes before he was very sick it took him a long time to empty his stomach and he was shaking and coughing when he was done barely able to stand erect his throat and mouth tasted of chewed tinfoil when he finally forced himself to turn back toward the statue he saw cutnshoot grinning derisively at him from the shadow of the bridge one thing when i do it another when you do hah you could have stopped it you had other food there i saw it you could have let the cat out of that thing let it go his stomach contracted and he thought he was going to be sick again but there was nothing left to vomit waste not want not cutnshoot chuckled sides now you really do know trolls with a mean cunning that he would not have suspected himself of possessing richardson designed an advertisement for a lost gray cateven including the name he had never once called ithad a hundred copies xeroxed and mounted them in sheltered places up and down queen anne hill thus when the owner returned from that enviable enviable sabbatical in england he would see that richardson had done everything possible to track down his unfortunately vanished cat would have died soon anyway old and incontinent as it was he surely wouldnt have wanted the poor thing peeing all over his nice condo the next morning he went to a pet shop in the wallingford district and bought two carrier cages the first identical to the one he had found in the apartment the second was a bit larger since one never knew with the latter in his hand he continued his nightly routine the only differences being that his rounds were now somewhat more purposeful and that with purpose came a reduction in his drinking he often whistled as he walked which was unusual for him it astonished him to realize how many animalsstrays and otherwisewere running loose on the streets of seattle cats and the smaller dogs were the easiest to capture though he felt a certain amount of guilt over the ones that came trustingly to his leathergloved hands but he learned that people make pets out of the most unlikely animals he caught escaped ferrets on two or three occasions lab rats and mice with surprising frequency and once even a tame crow with clipped wings he was going to set the crow freeit had a vocabulary of several words and a way of cocking its head to consider himbut then he thought that its inability to fly would make it easy prey for any cat and changed his mind he did go through cages rather often there was no way to avoid that given the trolls impetuous manner of opening them feeding the troll distracted him only somewhat from his terror of impending joblessness it was now much too late to expect reprieve all the best positions at even the worst colleges and universities had long since been snapped up without him ever applying the community colleges were full and thanks to seattles highly educated population there were thirty people ahead of him in line for any oncall substituting even assuming someone would have the human decency to come down ill meanwhile the eversmiling aussie had turned evasive trappist richardson stopped sliding by his door he had no idea that he was going mad with fear frustration and weariness most people dont and mostfrightened academic gypsies includedgo on functioning fairly well he remained faithful to his classes and his office hours and if he was more terse with his students and often more sharp tongued still he fulfilled the function for which he was yet being paid as conscientiously as he knew how because he still loved it and love will keep you reasonably sane for a long time then came the bright and breezy day when word began circulating through the departmenta whisper only at first the merest of hintsthat the tenured prodigal was not coming home at pm a resurrected richardson was thinking furiously as he knocked back half a bottle of scotch and picked at his indian takeout this late in the game it would surely be impossible for aussie to fill the prodigals slot he would have to extend richardson now and if god could create concrete trolls that moved and miracles as plain as this one why he might yet manage a way to make this change permanent richardson had no plans to go out not even to round up a stray dog or cat which had been growing more difficult in recent weeks as queen anne residents had been keeping closer track of their pets blaming coyotes for the recent disappearances considering what to say to aussie in the morning was paramount but eventually he could not bear to sit still and found his legs carrying him to fremont after all something special was clearly called for a little libation to luck so at the pcc he bought more of the eel river beef for the troll and for himself and cutnshoot a half gallon of a unique coconutandmolasses ice cream he had found nowhere else he left the grocery grinning turned leftand saw a block up th street walking away dr philip austin watkins iv the scotch proved stronger than good judgment aussie he shouted then louder aussie bag swinging wildly he began to run the department head had dined out late with friends imbibing one too many himself as the evening wore on youve never been screwed until youve been screwed by the british hed said and meant it thank heavens hed had foresight enough to lay contingency plans it took him a moment to realize that his name was being called and a troubling moment more when he turned around to recognize who it was his apprehension should perhaps have lasted longer instead of a simple greeting followed by meaningless chat richardson slammed full tilt into the issue of the job opening aussie i heard about brubaker and you promised you did promise i promised to do everything i could to help you aussie countered and i did but obviously it wasnt enough im sorry you cant leave the slot open and its too late mr richardson you knew you were a fillin just as i knew from the beginning that the aiken grant was a recruiting hook in disguise if the fish had bitten later i might have had to keep you on as it happens he did it while my own preferred replacement was still sitting by the phone at kansas state waiting for my call exactly where hes been since i first talked to him last april the slot as you call it is already filled oh without thought richardson removed the frozen half gallon of coconutmolasses ice cream from his grocery bag and smashed aussie in the head with it just as hard as he could the man was insensible when he hit the ground but not dead richardson was particularly glad of that that was satisfactory richardson said aloud as though he were judging a presentation in class he heard his voice echoing in his head which interested him looking around quickly and seeing no one close enough to notice what he was doing or to interfere with it richardson got aussiewho was not a small personon his feet hooked an arm around his waist and draped one of the chairmans arms around his own neck saying loudly and frequently told you aussie you cant say i didnt tell you sip the calvados i said dont guzzle it ah come on aussie help me a little bit here ordinarily the walk to the aurora bridge would have taken richardson a few minutes at most dragging the unconscious aussie it took months and by the time he came near the trolls overpass he was panting and sweating heavily the last lively he called out in a louder different voice here you go compliments of the chef a hoarse frantic voice behind him demanded what you doing what the hell you doing richardson let go of aussie and turned to see cutnshoot gaping at him his bleared eyes as wild as those of a horse in a burning barn what the hell you think you doing tidying up richardson said his voice sounded as far away as the old mans and the echoes in his head were growing louder you dumb shit cutnshoot whispered he was plainly sober if he hadnt been a moment before and wishing he werent you crazy dumb shit you fucking killed him richardson looked briefly down shaking his head oh lets hope not hes twitched a couple of times cutnshoot was neither listening to him nor looking directly at him im out of here i aint in this mess im calling the cops richardson did not take the statement seriously oh please can you stand there and tell me our friends always lived on warm puppies nothing like this has ever ever happened before not like this not never like this cutnshoot was beginning to back away looking small and cold hugging himself i got to call the cops see if he got a cell phone or something ah no cops richardson said he was fascinated by his own detachment by his strange lightheartedness in the midst of what he knew ought to be a nightmare he took hold of cutnshoots black slicker which felt like slimy tissue paper in his hand you have got to get yourself a new raincoat he told the old man sternly promise me youll get a new coat this winter cutnshoot stared blankly at him and richardson shook him hard promise damn it richardson heard the long scraping rumble before he could turn still keeping his grip on the struggling babbling cutnshoot the troll was moving emerging from its lair under the bridge the disproportionate length of its body giving the effect of a great worm even a dragon in the open it braced itself on its knuckles for some moments like a gorilla before rising to its full height the hubcap eye was alight as richardson had never seen ita whippingforestfire redorange that had nothing to do with the thin wan crescent on the horizon he thought madly and absurdly not of grendel but of the cyclops polyphemus the troll crouched hugely over aussie prodding him experimentally with the same hand that perpetually crushed the volkswagen the man moaned softly and richardson said as the troll looked up see lively for the first time in richardsons memory the troll made a sound it was neither a growl nor a snarl nor were there any more words in it than there were words in richardson to describe it long ago he had spent threequarters of a year teaching at a branch of the university of alaska and what he most remembered about that strange land was the sense of the pack ice breaking up in the spring much too distant for him to have heard it or even felt the vibration in his bones but like everyone else he foreigner or not knew absolutely that it was happening so it was with the sound that reached him nownot from the trolls mouth or throat or monstrous body but from its entire preposterous existence saying grace richardson asked the troll made the sound again and his head descended jaws opening wider than richardson had ever seen cutnshoot screamed and kept on screaming richardson kept a tight grip on him but the old mans utter panic set the echoes roaring in richardsons head he said quit itcome on relax enjoy a little dinner theater but one of cutnshoots flailing arms caught him hard enough on a cheekbone that his eyes watered and went out of focus for a moment ow he said and then okay then okay very little of aussie was still visible richardson took a firmer hold of cutnshoot lifted him partly off the ground and halfhurled halfshoved him at the troll the old man actually tripped over a concrete forearm he fell directly against the trolls chest snuggling grotesquely he opened his mouth to scream again but nothing came out how about a taste of the guardian richardson demanded he hardly recognized his own voice it was loud and frayed and hurt him coming out how about a piece of the one whos always there to make sure you behave wouldnt that be nice after all this time when the trolls mouth opened over cutnshoot richardson began to laugh in delighted hysteria not only did the great gray jaws seem to hinge at the back exactly like a waffle iron but they matched perfectly hammer and anvil when the mouth slammed shut after the jaws finally stopped moving the troll stretched toward the sky again and richardson realized that it was somehow different nowtaller and straighter its rough edges softening sinking into themselves becoming more fluid becoming more real it stared down at richardson and made a different sound this time like a troll cares what its made of starting out he thought and somehow the echoes in his head and cutnshoots crazy laughter were one and the same well shit he said that meal sure agreed with you he was just turning to run when the things hand no longer concrete but just as hard just as vast and heavy fell on his shoulder breaking it richardson was shrieking as the troll lifted him into the air tucked him clumsily under one arm and began squeezing back into the lair under the aurora bridge crumpled against the monsters sideclothing shredded skin lacerated his ribs goingrichardson heard the tolling of an impossible heart priced to sell by naomi novik naomi novik was born in new york in a firstgeneration

offended the vampire said despondently i just want to stop wasting my time if the board isnt going to let me in i dont care how much they smile and how polite they are id rather they just tell me up front theres no chance i know its terrible jennifer said no coop board was going to say anything like that of course it was asking for a fair housing lawsuit have you thought about a townhouse yeah sure because of course ive got a trust fund built on longterm compound interest he said bitterly im only fiftyfour he didnt look a day over twentyfive with that stylish look vampires got if they didnt feed that oftenpale and glamorous and hungrystaring into his starbucks like it was nowhere near what he actually wanted jennifer wasnt too surprised he was getting turned down right now she was feeling pretty excellent about the garlic salt shed put on the quick slice of pizza that had been lunch well jennifer said maybe a property in brooklyn brooklyn the vampire said like shed suggested a beach vacation in florida it took him five minutes wrapping up to leave the cafÃ© coat gloves hat veil scarf and a cape over all that jennifer was so not envying him the rushhour subway ride home on the lexington avenue line she walked the five blocks uptown and poked her head into dougs office to report the vampire had been bounced over to their team from a broker at black thomas phillips with blessings after getting rejected by a second coop board try him on some of the new condo developments where the developer is still controlling the building doug said whats his budget a million two jennifer said and he wants a three bedroom doug said she winced and nodded not a chance show him some convertible twos and see if the amenities make him happy i was thinking maybe if we could shake something loose in the victorian on seventysixth she said i could send around postcards to the current owners keep it in your back pocket but i wouldnt start there doug said the board there wont mind hes a vampire but theyll mind that hes less than a hundred years old tom knocked on the door and looked in doug sorry to interrupt but youve got that twofifteen with the new client at their place on thirtysecond and first doug didnt really know the building it was a rental and not a good one near the midtown tunnel traffic no views and only an aggressive goblin minding the door who scowled when doug asked for b six b yes doug said you friend the goblin asked even more suspiciously hes expecting me doug said diplomatically some tenants didnt want their landlord knowing they were apartment hunting unbelievably the goblin went ahead and poked a foot at the watchcat sleeping under the front hall table it raised its head and sniffed at doug and said in a disgruntled voice what do you want from me its just a real estate broker broker the goblin said brightening broker huh he moving youd have to ask him doug said but that wasnt a good sign bad landlord references could sink a board application quicker than vampirism he was starting to get doubts about the client anyway anyone who really had a million budget living here the ikea furniture filling the apartment didnt give him a lot of added confidence but the client said oh its its in a trust fund blinking at him myopically from behind small thickglassed round john lennon specs henry kell didnt seem like a candidate to piss off goblins he was a skinny five foot six and talked softly enough that doug had to lean forward to hear him i dont like to spend it and and i dont have very many needs you know only well i think it would be best if if we had our own property and i think hes come around to the notion okay so were looking for a place for you and your partner doug said should i meet him too er mr kell said he took his glasses off and wiped them with a cloth you very likely will at some point i would expect but perhaps we could begin just the two of us kell didnt care about prewar or postwar didnt care about a view although i would prefer he said not to look directly into other apartmentsand only shrugged when doug asked about neighborhoods okay doug said giving up he figured he was going to have to take kell around a little to get some sense of the guys taste i can show you some places tomorrow if you have time that would be splendid kell said and the next morning he set dougs new personalbest record by walking into the first place he was shown looking around for a total of ten minutes and coming back to say hed take it for the asking price not that doug had a deep aversion to getting paid more for less work but he felt like he wasnt doing his job are you sure you dont want to see anything else he said honestlythe ask here is a little high the place has only been on the market a week no i kell said i think i would prefer really to tie everything up as quickly as possible the apartment is quite excellent not a lot of people would have called it that it was an estate sale the kitchen and the bathrooms were original and the late owner had committed crimes against architecture with a pile of ugly builtins but nobody could deny it met kells criteria for privacythree rooms facing into blank walls another one into a courtyard and the bedroom had a little slice of a view into riverside park the neighborhood was quietthe elves at riverside kept it that wayand it was a condo how soon can we sign a contract kell asked ill get your lawyer in touch with the sellers lawyer doug said and called tom to cancel the rest of the viewings shrugging a little helplessly to himself wow tom said when doug got back into the office yeah that was really something doug said i think i get bragging rights for easiest commission ever made on this one how did it go at tudor city tom shook his head glumly the tudor city apartment was a beautiful placeview of the un formal dining room and two bedrooms renovated kitchen new subwaytile bathrooms and priced to move unfortunately it had come on the market as part of a divorce settlement and before moving out the owners had gotten into a knockdown dragout screaming fight that had ended in dueling curses in the living room people werent even getting to the master suite they came in stuck their heads into the big entry closet walked into the living room saw the long wall swarming over with huge black bugs and turned around and went right out sometimes they screamed even though doug always warned their brokers beforehand but it was a tough market right now and no one wanted to give up a chance for a sale the potential buyer this afternoon hadnt screamed she was a herpetologist and tom had really thought that was going to be perfect hed pitched it to her as free food supply for her snakes but apparently they dont eat beetles he said well you win some you lose some doug said lets see if we can get the clients to put up the fee for another eradicator its breaking my heart to see that place list for half a million under market the real estate market in manhattan was always an adventure everyone wanted to live somewhere in the city the elves fought tooth and nail with wall street wizards over gramercy park townhouses and fifth avenue coops developers tried to pry brownies out of abandoned industrial buildings in greenwich village so they could build loft conversions for rock stars and advertising execs college students squeezed in four to a onebedroom with actors and alchemists trying for their big break doug had slogged through the dark days of the early nineties when thered been seven years of inventory on the market and nothing selling the immortals were the worst unless you had a coop with a limit on how long you could sublet good luck getting a rakshasa or a vampire to lower their asking price no matter how bad the market was it was always ill hang in there another decade and see how things go even then hed liked the challenge of finding the perfect match of buyer and seller that moved manhattan real estate and he liked it a lot more now that he had his own offices tucked into a corner of the richard merriman inc corporate headquarters handling the clients with his own team and farming out the boring overhead to the firm right now though it was getting a bit more challenging than he liked just last week a million deal for one of his exclusivesdown from an ask of million at peak and happy to get ithad fallen through after an accepted offer the buyer had lost a quarter of her net worth in the huge ponzi scheme that had just gotten busted as though there wasnt enough bad news out there oh it was brilliant shed said grimly calling to tell him why the deal was off they put all these zombie investors on the books paid them out of our money then the zombies fell apart and their accounts went to the animators who turn out to be working for a firm owned by the partners in the fund can you get any of the money back doug asked ask me in five years after i finish paying the lawyers she said it made every sale twice as important and ten times as fragile he was a little surprised theyd gotten the vampire from black thomas phillips actually even with the two coop rejections speaking of which he sat down to make a few phone calls to people he knew with condo exclusives but before he got the phone off the hook it was ringing under his hand what the hell kind of crazy buyer are you bringing me rina lazar said without so much as a hello she was the selling broker on the riverside apartment oh boy doug said what happened did kell back out that would be great two new recordsquickest sale quickest flameout ohhh no rina said backing out backing out would have been fantastic he got my sellers number dont ask me how called them up and told them quote their bleeping apartment was a bleeping pile of bleep the builtins were a disgrace and the place smelled like dead old ladyi am not kidding you hereand nobody in their right mind would pay more than one million for the wreck take it or leave it end quote the daughter just called me up in tears oh my god doug said plan on sending me a financial sheet on anyone you want to bring to any of my exclusives from now on she said and banged the phone down hard enough to make him wince oh dear henry kell said when doug called i gather that this means the deal is off uh yeah the deal is off doug said mr kell maybe i need to explain this since youre a firsttime buyer once you make an offer you cant just no no i perfectly understand kell said i assure you i had no second thoughts myself it must have been he must have had strong feelings on the subject i cant think why is this your partner were talking about doug said mr kell if you arent the sole purchaser here well i am legally speaking kell said only er he can make his opinion felt in in other ways as you see doug rubbed his forehead and looked at the balance sheet on the open laptop in front of him although he really didnt need to he could keep track of all the contracts he had out right now in his head mr kell im sure we can find a place that will make both of you completely happy he said but i really am going to need to speak to your partner too oh dear mr kell said wow theyre a superinteresting touch very kafkaesque the art dealer said considering the bug swarm on the wall its definitely a unique feature tom said trying not to look at the wall too hard himself the bugs made a low raspy sound climbing over each other which he could hear even though hed cracked the windows to let in some of the noise of the first avenue traffic outside the buyers brokershe was backed into the far corner of the living roomlooked at him with raised eyebrows as her client went to poke around in the kitchen tom shrugged at her a little what was he going to do i do like the details the art dealer said coming back out theres something special in the contradiction between the formal style of the classic six the stainedglass windows and the wood paneling and the raw brutality of the insect swarm oh tom said that isyes absolutely the clients are very negotiable he added with a faint stirring of hope the art dealer stood looking around the apartment a little more and then shook his head its a really tough call but i dont think so the apartment is great but you know tudor city its so stuffy i just cant see it it would be almost like living on the upper east side but tell the sellers i love their style he added why is the maintenance so high the vampire said suspiciously reading the offering sheet for the battery park apartment well the selling broker said and then he admitted that it was a landlease meaning the coop didnt actually own the ground underneath the building and also the lease was running out in fifteen years and no one had any idea what the term renewal was going to be but weve got a brownie super and theres a fantastic sundeck on the he stopped at the look jennifer shot him waiting in the lobby as the vampire dispiritedly bundled himself up again jennifer said ive got a few condos lined up that we could take a look at this weekend i dont want to live in a condo the vampire said muffled as he wrapped a scarf around his head those places let anyone in jennifer opened and shut her mouth okay she said after a moment okay a coop it is you know whatcould i maybe get you to send me your last board application ive got the money the vampire said offended his eyes glowing briefly red from behind the scarf no im sure you do jennifer said not fumbling for the little crucifix shed worn under her blouse i dont even really need the financials im just thinking maybe theres something we could do to polish it up a little extra for a board it might be worth getting an early start on it oh the vampire said mollified all right ill have my last broker send it to you i guess it couldnt hurt oh but it could one of his three personal reference letters was from his mother i thought it was sweet the vampire protested shows i havent lost touch with my mortal life shes ninetysix and lives in arizona jennifer said when was the last time you saw her the vampire looked guilty i call every day he muttered the other two letters were from a pookajust the kind of guest everyone wanted visiting their neighbor especially in horse form and snorting flamesand a necromancer but shes inhouse at goldman sachs with the lostwealth research division the vampire said okay see thats excellent jennifer said lets maybe ask her to revise this letter to focus on that and lets just skip mentioning the necromancer part now about the pooka hes a biotech entrepreneur the vampire said lets see if theres someone else we can get okay jennifer said the goblin doorman let doug up without any hassle this time even doing a good goblin impression of beaming it took some effort not to glare at him no wonder he was so happy kell and his partner were looking for a new place if the other guy was some kind of nut kell was in the apartment alone looking even smaller and hunched in a large shapeless sweater and he twisted his hands anxiously as he let doug in i suppose he said i suppose theres no way to reopen the deal id be willing to pay more not a chance doug said mr kell i dont think you get it if you or your partner does something uh unusual you look unreliable and that scares sellers closing can take two or three months even if you pay more its not worth having a sale fall through at the last second oh kell said dismally honestly the solution here is to find a place that your partner will be happy with too doug said is he here i really do need to meet him kell sighed and said just a moment he went to a cabinet and opened it and took out a bottle of whiskey and a glass he brought them over to the table and poured a glass doug had seen a lot weirder things than a client needing a drink but it did take him by surprise when kell slid the glass over to him instead of downing it thanks but no kell said youll want it in a moment doug started to ask except kell wasnt talking anymore hed fallen back onto the couch and he was doubled over with his face in his hands and something weird was happening to him he seemed to be growing uh doug said and then kell lifted his face out of his hands and it wasnt kell anymore the eyes were the same color but bloodshot and wider apart in a broader face with a flattened nose and a jaw that looked like it had been carved out of rock his neck was thickening even while doug watched well fucking finally notkell said straightening up even more the couch creaked under him so youre the broker who took him to that shithole doug paused and said and youre notkell was coughing a little bit thumping himself on the chest as he finished growing he would have made about two of kell with some leftovers he belched loudly and bared his teeth in what you couldve called a grin if by grin you meant a mouth full of more shining white teeth than anybody shouldve had call me hyde okay doug said after a second so that would make him hyde snorted i know he changed the name when he moved here fucking pathetic he pointed to the drink are you going to have that doug looked at the glass then slid it back across the table so mr hyde he said can you tell me what youre looking for in an apartment the eradicator stepped back from the wall of bugs and shook his head slowly and lugubriously really nothing tom said heart sinking sorry the eradicator said these people they lived here like twenty years or something they put down roots this he waved a hand at the bugs this goes way way down i could charge you ten grand and strip off the top layers of the curse wipe the bugs out but theyd be back in two months might be even worsemillipedes or something i hate those things the eradicator shuddered his shoulders up and down expressively anyway youre not getting this out for good until you rip down the whole building he stopped and thought about it and after a moment added or you could get the two sellers back in and get them to make up that can clear stuff like this up sometimes tom looked at him the sellers divorce took two years to finish and theyre still in court on some issues the eradicator shrugged do they want to sell their apartment or not tom sighed then he paused and said so wait if you tried to take off the whole curse the bugs might get worse right the eradicator said if you didnt try that tom said could you maybe do something else with them what did you have in mind the eradicator asked the vampires application was still pretty disheartening especially when jennifer compared it to the one she was putting the final touches on that afternoon she didnt like to jinx things but kitsune or not it was pretty much guaranteed mei shinagawa would be a shooin at the nodogsallowed berkeley six letters of reference terrific financials and shed even tucked in tiny origami cranes to be included with the copies of the application one for each of the board members the vampires tax return on the other hand had a suspicious reddishbrown stain on the front to make the day complete after shed gotten off the phone with the vampire jennifers phone went off with another allcaps call me text message from one of their former buyers a lawyer whod bought into the topdrawer oryx coop for the panoramic views from the twentyfourthfloor apartment now those were about to go away thanks to a new development and she was having fits if the landmarks commission has approved the renovation and theres nothing in the zoning to stop it jennifer said apologetically she felt bad but what could you do that was manhattan you put one building up somebody else put a bigger one up next door my view was supposed to be protected angela said it faces onto a freaking landmarked church im sorry theyre going to preserve the exterior shell and put up a new building on the inside mimicking the facade and carvings all the way up jennifer said we could look for a new place for you if you want how can i afford a new place with this millstone around my neck who is going to pay two million for a one bedroom with a view of a brick wall accessorized by carvings of smiley angels or whatever these guys are putting on their monstrosity angela said no one thats who oh my god why did i buy at peak i knew better of course she hadnt known better nobody knew better that was why it was peak jennifer said some comforting things with half a mind while she collated pages of the kitsunes application and got off the phone then she stopped and picked the phone up again and called back angela can you get a picture of the facade and email it to me granite countertops hyde said i want some granite fucking countertops none of this cheap formica shit okay doug said adding that to the list under high ceilings subzero fridge central ac and hardwood floors the list was getting pretty long any particular neighborhoods thats another thing i want someplace where theres a little goddamn fucking life you understand me hyde said i mean what the hell was he thinking riverside park yeah because i want to live next to a bunch of elves singing kumbaya to the sun every morning not unless i get to pick em off with a shotgun that wouldnt be such a great idea doug said fun though hyde said sort of wistfully so doug said getting off that subject can you tell me anything about what your er what mr kell wants he hasnt been all that clear that asshole just wants to crawl under a rock and read books hyde said look at this he pointed to the particleboard bookshelves sagging with hardbacks all this ikea crap everywherejesus and this is a dream compared to what he had in here before those purple fucking builtins i had to take a sledgehammer to the whole pile of shit he glared at the bookshelves and then abruptly heaved himself up off the whimpering couch and headed for them with his fists clenching and unclenching like he couldnt handle looking at them a second longer so you know doug said hastily i do have a place id like you to take a look at hyde paused before reaching the bookcases distracted yeah what the hell lets go now i dont know if i can reach the broker doug started we can look at the outside hyde said the vampire called her up less than a minute after jennifer forwarded on the email what the hell was that he yelled i almost dropped my iphone in the gutter really jennifer said sothat actually hurt it was a picture of five million crosses fantastic jennifer said can you meet me at seventyfifth and third in half an hour getting hyde into a taxi involved waiting fifteen minutes for one of the minivan ones to come by empty but doug was just fine with that he spent the time frantically texting back and forth with tom to get the selling broker down to the apartment in time to meet them he didnt completely trust hyde not to just knock down the front door and go inside otherwise he got a call back from the broker while they were heading downtown i just want to make sure you realize the guy said yes i know doug said its completely mint inside though right oh absolutely the broker said architectdesigned gut renovation they got out in front of marble cemetery one of the wispy sadeyed apparitions paused by the iron railing to watch as hyde climbed out of the cab which almost bounced as he finally stepped out it looked up at him hyde glared down at it you want something casper he said the apparition prudently whisked away so bowery is two blocks that way and the hells angels club is on the next street over doug said leading the way to the townhouse next door looks small hyde said and he did have to duck his head to get through the front door but inside the ceilings were ten feet he stamped his foot experimentally what is this stuff brazilian hardwood the selling broker said faintly staring up at hyde with rabbitwide eyes maybe lets take a look at the kitchen doug said encouragingly do you have an offering sheet uh yeah the broker said still staring as he backed up slowly right this way all right now this is fucking something hyde said approvingly coming into the kitchen there was a long magnetic strip mounted on the wall with five or so chefs knives stuck onto it he picked off a cleaver and tossed it casually in his hand as the broker edged around him pointing out the miele appliances and granite countertops as requested doug added lets see the bathroom hyde said he didnt leave the cleaver behind the master bath on the second floor had a big soaking tub and another small apparition hanging around outside the window staring in with miserable empty eyes that spoke of endless despair and horrors beyond the grave get lost hyde told it and it disappeared so the uh the thirdfloor ceilings the broker said stumbling over his words as they came out back to the staircase a little lower im not sure maybe we could have mr kell take a look doug suggested to hyde assuming that you like the place so far hyde looked around and said yeah this is decent but make sure that asshole doesnt try to negotiate he gave his toothy grin to the selling broker who shrank away ill handle that part sure doug said and hydes smile and shoulders curled in on themselves and kell was there wobbling a little in his suddenly toolarge clothing he looked around uncertainly and said i im not sure the front windows on the streetanyone could see inside why dont we go upstairs doug said shepherding him onto the third floor kell paused about halfway up as the builtin bookcases came into view before continuing up well those are nice he said and the windows look on the cemetery back here doug said of course i realize its a little inconvenient he added and kell looked at him since mr hyde wont be able to get up to this floor oh kell said oh doug shook the selling brokers hand as they left the house will you be around later he said um the broker said could you maybe not give my number to dont worry about it doug said ill handle going between the other broker looked relieved the seller is totally negotiable he added throwing a look at the cemetery a gardener was busy nearby spraying a thin clutching revenant hand that was struggling out of an old grave who is the seller doug asked watching investment banker the broker said doug dropped kell off and took the cab the rest of the way back to the office tom had just gotten back beaming with celebratory lattes whats this for doug said we need to order new photos for tudor city tom said and showed them the little video clip off his camera phone doug squinted at it the wall was still moving but are those butterflies jennifer said twentythree varieties some of them endangered tom said i used the catalog from the exhibit at the museum of natural history wow doug said tom this doesnt call for new photos this calls for a relisting they clinked latte cups then jennifer shrugged into her coat i have to get to hunter college community board eight is having a review meeting for a proposed new building next to the oryx is angela still yelling at you about that doug said you want me to talk to her we told her before she bought theres pretty much no such thing as a protected view no worries jennifer said were getting a fair housing protest in theres a sponsor apartment on the thirteenth floor that would be facing the new development theyre selling it to the vampire theyll have to keep the new building below that height she stopped short with her hand on the door though as a thundering knock hit and then another she glanced back at doug and tom then shrugged and pulled it open a giant horse was standing outside in the hall gazing down at them nostrils flaring a thin trail of smoke rising from them glowing red flames shone in its eyes there was a dent in the office door where it had knocked with a front hoof people were sticking their heads out of other offices down the hall to watch hi the pooka said marvin said you could help me marvin tom said under his breath the vampire jennifer said the pooka nodded mane flopping im looking for an apartment they all stood and considered jennifer suggested after a moment maybe a groundfloor unit tom said or a place with a good freight elevator theres the atlantica doug eyed the hooves parquet and hardwood were definitely out marble tile maybe he looked up at the pooka so tell me how do you feel about trump buildings the bricks of gelecek by matthew kressel matthew kressels fiction has appeared in interzone electric

we were not city folk we lived beyond all borders where the onyx sands merged with raven skies where the desert beasts came to die and even the hated demons of fintas miel dared not tread out here the stars twirled in strange orbits the sun weaved drunkenly by day and the wind blew steady slow and forever they called this place the jeen i called it home always in fours we came to your cities the sand blew us into flesh and we walked like men through your iron gates and your tented marketplaces dust fell from our fingertips our feetthe dust of decay of aeons of ash we touched your fruits and your doorposts we patted the heads of your children and shook the calloused hands of your husbands you smiled at us within hours came the winds the decay the screams pits formed in the streets where we had stepped your statues rusted and blew away your houses fell to kindling your children vanished like whispers by dawn there was nothing left but a hole in the earth and those who had carried thoughts of this vanquished city and its people found a blank spot in their minds a void where once there were men we did this for pleasure and of our name we had none for who remained to name us sometimes i grew bored with the sundering of cities sometimes i wished to be away from my brothers and their boasts of desolation so i wandered the desert under the drunken sun to entertain myself with the mysteries of the jeen the constant winds carried strange sounds on their wings the dying whispers of aged widows the murderous thoughts of jealous cuckolds the suicides cry of regret as the soul fled the body the voices spoke of objects and forms but always their true concerns were intangible things regret shame love despair the gamut of human emotions i listened eagerly for the voices spoke of a world beyond my own a world i could never touch without destroying it i floated over the twinkling sands when i heard a small voice like a flute echoing off of a mountain it cried out to the ineffable what am i and its sound was music sweet and innocent without rue for things come and gone or the dark cynicism heard often in men the sound danced above me in crimson wisps like lingering campfire smoke it zigged and zagged hopped and paused catlike across the desert the song haunted me for some reason i could not fathom so i pursued the sun skipped across the sky as i followed the music until the jeen was long behind me a thousand camel skeletons and their unfortunate riders lay wasted on the sands below and still the voice sang a large city crested the horizon birds squawked in monstrous flocks above its thousand spires and towers hugged its center like beggars waiting for handouts on the heels of the city just before the sand devoured all was a small house the smoke belching from its chimney reeked of rams bladder and hoof spicea sin offering to the goddess mollai a girl sat before the house and sang as she fumbled with toy bricks the desert makes no promises she does not long abide for those who seek to find her face no semblance they can find the sun burns down from heavens throne turning all to dust and so i ask the cosmos now of what use is rust her words had the resonant pluck of a zither then i understood her song had entwined itself in the smoke of the sin offering and the winds had carried her plea out over the desert to my ears and the words they stirred something deep within me that i could not name hello she said to me have you lost your caravan are you thirsty i had not intended to be seen i had unwittingly collected myself into human form no i howled like a sandstorm trying to terrify her but she was unmoved by my words who are you then and i had the same question who was this girl who stood firm before the winds of annihilation who taught you that song i asked thats mine she said shyly i wrote it you wrote it i said why a girl can write song she said firmly of course i said but your song is different her brown eyes twinkled in the sunlight as she studied me who are you i can tell from your clothes that youre not quog bedu or zwai clan and everyone knows you dont walk geleceks streets of glass and dung without shoes she pointed to my bare feet i grew frustrated with her questions and reached out for her head with one touch she would fall to dust within hours and would trouble me with her words no more but a heavy man waddled out of the house he carried a large cleaver and his bare chest was covered in sweat and blood instantly i made myself as transparent as the sky come inside agna the man shouted mollai is coming to bless our house papa we have a visitor she replied a stranger from the desert you can play with your toys later the man said the girl turned and saw i had vanished she furrowed her brow and looked deeply disturbed but he was just here she said a plump woman covered in offal shoved the man out of the doorway she wiped bloody hands on her apron and thrust them to her hips get inside now agna or youll wish you were never born the girl stood quickly scanned the desert for me once more then ran inside no thing of form had ever seen me and lived let alone begged answers of me as the smoke fluttered from the chimney i comforted myself in the knowledge that one day my brothers and i would return to erase her city from existence i flew back to the jeen in silence years passed like dripping molasses and i forgot about the singing girl my brothers and i trod through the crystal kingdom of aphelia whose walls had stood for ten millennia whose conquests were heralded in a thousand tongues no one would remember its name we touched the port city of mesach built within the pine barrens beside the salty river do it disappeared as if it never were we sundered allia blÃ¶msnu cintak ektu el traders on the way to a sundered city would suddenly forget why they had ventured out into the harsh desert with overburdened camels cities vanished from minds too how many walls fell under our hands i could not count but always ambitious men built new ones they raised towers of stone and wrapped domes with hammered gold they adorned palaces with jewels and paved streets with tar and glass caravans traveled across inhospitable wastes to deliver mortar wheat and wine after a time a new city breathed under the stars as if it had existed for all eternity i began to see these cities not as a thousand separate entities but the organs of a much larger creature whose severed limbs always grew back one night as i wandered the jeen under the bright and nervous stars i heard the girls song again one seed planted may not grow two seeds planted in a row five seeds in my garden plot mollai bless they will not rot one stone mortared may yet fall two stones aye a trinity but a thousand stones do make a wall that stands for all eternity i followed her song across abyssal landscapes made gray by the pregnant moon until i came to her faroff house in the city of gelecek i saw movement in a window and i crept up to it conscious not to take human form or to touch her house lest it fall to ashes agna sat upright in bed in the years since i had seen her she had grown inches now she had the body of a young woman though she still had the face of a girl she leaned into the pallid moonlight as she scrawled on parchment her small voice hummed a few bars then she crossed out a word and replaced it with another she hummed again and the notes brought me back ages i recalled cities i had conquered and forgotten the starshaped city of gelf with its bejeweled ivory columns the ziggurats of phalantine and its perfumed gardens karad and its herds of black giraffes i had no words to describe the feelings her songs evoked in me i needed to listen until i understood what i felt i thought i dreamt you all those years ago she whispered but here you are she was staring at me through the window frame i found myself in human form though not by my own will her song had oddly drawn me into flesh you remember me i said how could i forget you vanished like smoke and you smell like the deep desert she said like a spent campfire like ash who are you i have no name but what are you her eyes twinkled in the moonlight are you a mancer a demon i am dissolution i am nothing what do you want with me your songs i said they fill me with memories of forgotten places they make me feel i cannot describe it sing one again i demanded agna a voice grumbled wood groaned in the dark corners of the house whats that sound leave she whispered to me father has killed thieves before please i begged sing another sing one now agna a man bellowed if youre using one of my candles again i swear ill beat you back to kalagia agna mumbled a response pretending to be asleep then she whispered to me go away i dont know who you are but dont come back in the far corner a sphere of light blossomed around a candle in the lambent flicker frowned the sweaty face of her father he stepped toward us and i backed away from the window into darkness is this how you repay me for training you her father said i told you not to use the candles but i didnt papa she said dont lie to me agna i smell soot i swear it wasnt me there was a man a stranger from the he lifted a heavy belt from a chair and beat her with it i watched from a distance and listened to the desert swallow her screams when he had finished beating her he said go to sleep agna you have to be up early for work i expect you at posterity hill before first prayer as he blew out the candle she whimpered her acknowledgment i wanted to hear her sing again but this was not the place then i recalled her fathers words posterity hill a place of men and in the darkness i had an idea i traveled to the wastes beyond the jeen where the white sands breathe in irregular tides deep within a mammoth cleft of stone i begged the demon atleiu to craft me a suit of human flesh in return i promised her the only thing i coulddestruction she agreed and proceeded to cut skin from one of her human slaves tempering it with the hoarfrost of the north and the iron stones that fall from the sky whereas before anything i touched turned to dust within hours nowwhile encased in atleius suiti could walk among men without destroying them i could follow agna anywhere she went i could touch and be touched the sun was rising hot and huge in the east when i reached the first stone of geleceks streets i worried that atleius suit might fail i took a tentative step with my sandaled foot onto stone always when i decimated cities i felt the ecstatic rush of annihilation i sensed none of that now the stone remained a stone posterity hill i asked a bearded vendor and he pointed with an arthritic hand deep into the city i weaved through a collection of low stone buildings clothing and bedding swayed from lines strung above me people hurried past with satchels tossed over backs or barrows thrust before them i smelled uncooked animal flesh and human feces but the air was also dense with smells of sandalwood sage and the sweet twinge of honey as men and women bumped me i felt impotent they would remain to bump others tomorrow i reached a sign that read posterity hill future home of the jarrifa family high walls were fashioned with polished brown stones that jutted from the facade like giant thumbs the work of a skilled hand this is private property a shirtless boy said i ignored him and climbed to the top of the sloping road as he followed me young masons labored within a large stone foundation scooping mortar and laying stones with advanced skill from this plateau i glimpsed the full city to my left a hags spine of roads twisted into the desert to my right spires rose like candles into the sky did you hear me feg the boy said behind me this is private property theres no such thing i said but before he could scold me again i descended the hill i searched the base of the foundation until i found a corner where i could watch the workers without being seen and there i waited for agna her father stepped out of a pavilion and walked around the foundation admonishing the boys for apparent flaws that neither the boys nor i saw one of the boys whispered to him and pointed at me who the frib are you agnas father said as he stepped up to the wall and looked down at me his foot resting on a stone above my head i stood from my hiding place is your daughter here what do you want with her is she here he leaped down to my level and the ground shook with his weight did you hear me he said what do you want with her you would not understand i said it is beyond you you freak he said as his fist slammed into my face i fell onto my back he kicked me and i raised my hand to block the blows with his next kick atleius flesh suit tore at the index finger when he tried to kick me again i stuck out my hand and his leg scraped my unprotected finger he gasped while the ecstasy of nothingness coursed through me whats wrong with him the boys said is he having a heart attack agnas father bent over holding his stomach then he stood looked at me nervously and said you stay the frib away from my daughter or ill kill you he walked up the hill and vanished behind a wall some of the boys chuckled and kicked pebbles at me until i heard his stern voice order them back to work in the distance agna watched me until i heard her father order her back to work too carefully i wrapped my torn finger back into place i circled the streets until i found a better hiding spot on the opposite side of the foundation three small walls obscured me completely from view but a tiny slit allowed me to see out the sun beat down on the boys as they worked and agna to my joy worked alongside them though she was the only girl among three dozen boys they gave her no special treatment she spread mortar and hefted heavy stones without help she chiseled with practiced skill but i noticed in her craft an attention to detail that the boys lacked every stone held her full consciousness every rap of her hammer carried the weight of aeons and she sang while she worked oh what sweet music the boys sang with her they mixed mortar by verse carried stones by stanza and finished walls by song so that their labors resembled a dance more than a burden i knew the power of her song now and let it consume me i reveled in forgotten vistas geysers from the oasis city of sul erupted in my mind the mirrored walls of nier el du blinded my dreams the gargantuan city of poc carved from a single piece of stone crushed me under its weight i thought for a moment that this feeling might be greater than the bliss of annihilation you agna said i woke from my visions to see her peering down at me from the foundation wall she threw her hands to her hips and frowned and i recognized her mother in the gesture she sniffed the air i thought i smelled ash she said your songs they are beautifulyes thats the word i said she glanced over her shoulder i was wondering who it was that father beat this morning now he has beaten us both i said we are kindred by dawn he will kin hardly youd better leave whoever you are hell kill you dont be stupid tell me agna i said do your songs carry you to forgotten places do you have visions of dead cities what she said she stepped back from the wall mouth agape how do you know agna her father shouted from behind her who are you talking to is that feg here again she stared at me then she shook her head and said go away go away but her words were insubstantial like a desert cloud meet me at the bottom of the hill i said she disappeared behind the wall and i knew she was mine now at the bottom of posterity hill shadows crept across the ground as the sun turned overhead just after high noon agnas small figure appeared at the top of the hill and scampered down to meet me how do you know about my visions she demanded did mother tell you damn her no i see them when you sing you said theyre dead cities what did you mean by that they have been forgotten erased yet your song rekindles their memories agnas father appeared at the top of the hill surrounded by three boys lets go she said before father sees us we turned through the busy streets the air smelled of cracked spelt boiling beans and the pungent reek of humans going about their business animals being slaughtered cried out and fell silent she led me into a courtyard filled with date palms and speckled shade theyre not dead cities she said they havent been born yet no theyre very dead but your songs give them new life she frowned ive tried to tell father about them to let him know that theres more to my songs than just music and words but he wont have an ounce of it he says a woman needs a stable trade as much as any man that my poems and music will only get me to a street corner begging for change hes wrong i watched the boys sing with you they work twice as hard under your spell do you think so father works us all so hard a song makes the day go by a little faster her eyes filled with water the prefect plans to hire father as his chief mason when father gets that job ill be able to design buildings myself i wont have to take orders from him anymore and when i turn sixteen father promised to give his business to me says his backs no good anymore ill be free to create whatever i wish i have dreams things i want to build i remembered that i had touched her father that he would vanish from existence before dawn your mother has a wellpaying trade though i said wellpaying shes a seamstress in the textile guild the pay is the only thing worse than the work she doesnt want me to follow in her footsteps but i love working with thread too i often help her with embroidery its wonderful you cant get the same precision with stone not if you want to finish within this century she stared at her calloused fingers and all through this has been your music ballads have propelled me ever since i was a girl will you sing me one now right here right now yes this is silly i dont even know you there is nothing to know she shook her head well she said maybe just the one you did get a beating after all just to hear one then she began by dawn the sun low on our backs is cool while birds are singing by noon the mortars showing cracks and masons ears are ringing but come a week a month a year when chanced upon this hill where fathers eye had built a house that stands upon there still i forget the sweat the grime the shoveling of sand and fill my heart with future dreams to build one by my hand vistas of dead cities assaulted my consciousness but this time there were new places cities i had not glimpsed before cities of glass cities in the sky even cities floating among the stars perhaps as she had suggested not all of these kingdoms were dead some had yet to be created i closed my eyes and savored the sweetness of them all who are you she said does it matter my name yes it does a mans name is his being his essence all the more reason why i have none i dont understand she said you come to me begging to hear my songs but i know nothing of you where are you from what do you do how is it that you have come to me agnas father burst into the courtyard surrounded by a dozen boys they carried chisels and hammers and walked briskly in my direction agna her father shouted stand back he smacked the head of a hammer into his palm youre dead stranger do you hear me i backed away they could not hurt my true essence of course but they could destroy my suit i needed it to last for atleiu was a fickle demon and would not craft me another one for aeons who are you she said to her father and what do you want with us what her father shouted has he drugged you youre safe now baby papas here who she said she looked like she was going to be sick i dont feel right somethings wrong but i had to leave i fled the courtyard through the rear gate and the boys pursued i ran through crowded streets hiding behind bales of tobacco and under piles of manure when i was certain i had lost them i headed back to my brothers in the jeen i was not troubled by morning her father and his rabble would forget we have followed you my brother said to me that evening in the jeen as the bright stars oppressed us you entered a city in the guise of a man and walked among its people touching them this night their walls hold firm the winds are calm and their children do not scream tell us why brother youve broken our trust i dared not reveal agnas power to enthrall with her song lest they try to usurp her for their own but i could not deny what they had witnessed we have no rules i said nor laws preventing me from doing what i have done i followed my will but you are a thing of destruction my brother said that is your nature what do you seek in the world of form sometimes in the winds of the jeen i hear whispers of human things have you never been curious to know what they are sometimes yes but if i satisfy my curiosity what purpose does it serve the curiosity vanishes one day the thing which piqued my interest will vanish too all is impermanent then so too is my interest in this city i said it will vanish your concern will vanish too as all things do but now our brothers need to know what is it that draws you there in the morning sun to walk among them without destruction i paused before answering of all the cities we sundered brother i said how many do you remember not many he said none i said he paused perhaps i go to that city dear brother to remember but why nothing is worth remembering memories like cities fade i felt pain when i realized that one day agna would vanish from the earth what are we then without our memories we are nothing brother we have and will always be nothing you may convince yourself for a time that you are more but it is only selfdeception and with these words my brother left me in the winds of the jeen i heard a laugh i searched the desert six times to make sure i was in the right place yes this was the spot of sand where gelecek had once stood like a drying oasis the citys circumference had shrunken inward its walls were devoid of grandeur a few leaning towers thrust into a cloudless sky and scattered buildings spotted an uninspiring landscape and agnas house was gone i entered the city and hunted for her within its changed streets where am i i asked its residents this is gelecek they responded forlornly as if the citys name itself was a curse there was a foundation i said to an elderly woman mashing chickpeas on posterity hill do you know it she shook her head never heard of it of course i thought i had destroyed the mason who had created it there is a girl i said agna daughter of a seamstress have you heard of her the old woman squinted rheumy eyes at me nay but theres the seamstress guild up on trajen row why dont you bother them i lost my way several times but eventually found trajen row a cobbled deadend street with hundreds of dyed linens drying from hemp lines like standards the air reeked of chemicals and colored puddles filled the cracks between stones inside cramped buildings hundreds of seamstresses stuck needles into cloth combed lambs wool or threaded looms i found agnas mother working in a corner her needlework tiny feats of prestidigitation she looked much thinner than i remembered and her face was wrinkled and bitter im looking for agna i said where is she who the frib are you she said without looking up im a friend i was supposed to meet her today i dont know who youre talking about agna your daughter she stopped her stitching and looked up at me is this a joke did the girls put you up to this no please where is she she started to cry youre cruel go away this is not a joke im not here for anyone but myself i am seeking your daughter to after my last incident with her father i tempered my words to protect her from a great evil she began her needlework again then said to the sky mollai great maker why do you torment me so then she said to me i dont know who you are stranger but your words sting i never had a husband or a daughter nor do i know this agna you speak of now leave me i backed away as the shock of her words consumed me always when i destroyed cities my destruction was total complete i had never been selective in annihilation before it had never occurred to me that erasing her father would erase agna too an alien feeling welled up inside me as i stepped out into the sun it was there was only one word for itloss a thousand linens snapped angrily in the wind i walked the streets in a daze i dont know how long i wandered before i heard a voice a beautiful voice it sang i followed the song around a corner into an alley overgrown with weeds a cat hissed at me and ran away the voice came from a doorless building and i crept inside halffinished canvases crowded a large studio and the air was heavy with the reek of paint majestic cities adorned the canvases some i recognized as cities i had sundered at the far end of the studio a young woman danced her brush over a canvas while she sang on the dark side of morn the workers lie waiting sunrise to sunset their backs break in toil from out of the desert come caravans sweating burdened with legumes rich hemp seed and oil agna i shouted youre alive the girl turned to me but her face was not agnas her eyes were too green her nose too buttonlike her face too round not agna but a stranger startled she said who are you but her voicethat was agnas you wont remember me i said she dropped her brush no ive dreamt of you sometimes i dream that i lived another life with different parents in a different house i was a builder of cities and a weaver of thread then a ghost came along and erased everything i thought it was just a recurring nightmare but that ghost had your face im sorry agna i didnt know agna thats the name my dream parents called me my name is dina its a beautiful name i said stepping closer stay away from me she said im not here to hurt you dina i only came to hear you sing why i pointed to her paintings these cities why do you paint them the architects buy them they tell me my drawings inspire them but why do you paint them i dont know they come to me in vision when you sing how do you know that she said who what are you i am the no thing of the deserts beyond form and the sunderer of civilization i and my brothers have destroyed these cities i had forgotten them all but your songs bring them back to me i have the very same question for you dina what are you she looked sick it was real wasnt it my other life there were too many details too many feelings i had a difficult life yes but i had dreams and aspirations and you destroyed all of that didnt you but youre not dead dont you see i said i couldnt erase you from history you spring back like the cities i and my brothers sunder youre disgusting she said you destroy as easily as i create perhaps but for once in my life i want something else the winds gusted outside knocking over a few canvases i heard the rasp of sand blowing against stone and a familiar shudder of ecstasy coursed through me a sandstorm she said i have to close the windows no i said to her as i stepped out into the sun i knew him before he spoke not by the way he walked nor by the tailor of his clothes but by his indifference toward all things he gave a beggar a coin and patted him on the shoulder he dragged his hands along the walls of a portico he stepped up to me and paused every move was filled with emptiness hello brother he said what are you doing here i demanded i could ask the same of you what business have you here in this flesh suit of yours you must leave i said before you destroy this place its too late he said our brothers have decided that your sojourn here shall end we followed you to this city four of us walk inside these walls now spreading oblivion we love you brother and when this city falls you will return to us and be the soul we remember i dont want to go back not yet please listen to one of her songs look at her paintings then youll understand why im here theres nothing to understand theres nothing at all thats the sole and final truth my brother smiled and fled the alley patting a boy on his head as he turned the corner agnadina come on we have to go i shouted i reentered the studio but dina had vanished dina where are you i found a small door in the back it led up a small curving stairwell to a storeroom on the second floor when i opened the door dina jumped out and stabbed me in the chest with a putty knife i pushed her away and pulled out the knife from my chest there was no blood when i dropped it to the floor the blade shattered she pounded on me with her fists go away go away dina dina please you must listen to me my brothers are destroying this city as we speak we have to go now or youll be killed get away from me id rather die i grabbed her she was small and easy to contain i lifted her over my shoulder and she beat me as i carried her down the stairs through the studio and out onto the streets she screamed for help so i gagged and tied her with sackcloth i took the back alleys and leastcrowded streets and fled the city as quickly as possible making sure that neither i nor dinas bound body touched a thing she cried but her voice was muffled by her gag i know you think im cruel i said but i do this for your own good ive figured it out dina i know what you are whereas i am the sunderer of cities you are their genesis your songs your visions your dreamsthey are the impetus that creates new ones i destroy cities with my touch you create them with your song we are kindred if you die then in a way so do i i found a black horse tied up beside a tent on the outskirts of the city and stole it before its owner could stop us i spread dina before me and we rode deep into the desert after several hours she stopped struggling so i took off her gag water she mumbled i found a canteen slung around the horse and gave it to her after drinking several large gulps she said my family friends my paintings will they all vanish im sorry but you can create new ones do you think its that easy that i can just start over in a new city as if nothing at all has happened everything i know is going to die the horse grew tired as the sun set behind a dune so i dismounted i untied her hands as the stars winked to life above us if you flee i said by the time you get back to your city it will be dust no one will remember it not even you wont i vanish too she said i was born in that city i erased your father it changed you but you were born again as someone else i think you are a seed that cant be destroyed then why bring me all the way out here i looked at her and realized that i didnt have an answer when i was six my mother bought me my first paint set my father took me to the top of jimn mountain when i was nine i remember the first time i kissed a boy i remember breaking my arm when i tried to scale dell wall all of that will be erased wont it but you will rebuild it somewhere else in some other time you dont understand humans are not like a wall where the bricks of our experiences are interchangeable each instant is precious unique you rob the universe of the sacred cant you see that i i have known nothing else i said until i met you is that consolation for ruining my life that the ghost of annihilation has second thoughts i didnt mean to hurt you but you have this wasnt supposed to happen what wasnt she said slowly the destruction of your city what city gelecek what a beautiful name she said where is it and who are you how did i get here i sighed and had to look away i feel funny she said as if im not supposed to be here my body feels light like air whats your name my name i said my name is destruction when i looked for her again there was only sand the girl the horse everything was gone even my suit of flesh i cried out to the stars but they did not respond i did not move from that spot my brothers came to me on the sand they said come back to the jeen with us brother for you have no reason to dwell among form now and i said leave me the sun rose and set a hundred times and my brothers came to me again and again please they begged its not proper that you be apart from us come and obliterate a city with us and feel your old self again but how could i in each city might dwell the spark of agna or dina or her kin i could not bear to erase her from existence again go away i told my brothers and they did i sat there in the same spot of sand where dina had disappeared while the sun turned in slow orbits overhead i felt like a top spinning spinning but never slowing the stars and sun turned through slow aeons and still i did not move one silent afternoon a dark cloud appeared in the sky once in a hundred years it rained in the desert today it poured down in great sheets the sky grew as dark as the gloaming and the sands turned to mud forks of light split the sky in dreadful thunder i collected myself into human form gave myself strong arms and hands and began to mold the wet sand into a brick the pounding rain seemed to shout agnas songs across the desert and to their tunes i crafted another brick and then another fashioning them into a rudimentary wall i knew it was temporary i knew that tomorrow when the sun rose hot and burdensome above the sands my wall would grow weak the desert winds would topple it in time that all was essentially nothing but heaven help me i couldnt stop weston walks by kit reed kit reed is the author of the baby merchant dogs of truth and thinner than thou her short novel little sisters of the apocalypse and the collection weird women wired women were both finalists for the james tiptree jr award her most recent novel enclave appeared in her short fiction has been published in various anthologies and magazines including asimovs science fiction fantasy and science fiction the yale review postscripts and the kenyon review her next short story collection what wolves know will be published in when your life gets kicked out from under you like a chair you thought you were standing on you start to plan you swear never again after the funeral lawrence weston sat in a velvet chair that was way too big for him while the lawyer read his parents will out loud he didnt care about how much he was getting he only knew what he had lost and that he would do anything to keep it from happening again he was four like a prince in the plague years he pulled up the drawbridge and locked his heart against intruders nobody gets into westons tight carefully furnished life and nobody gets close enough to mess up his heart now look when your money makes money you dont have to do anythingso nothing is what weston ordinarily does except on saturdays when he comes out to show the city to you it isnt the moneydont ask how much he hashe just needs to hear the sound of a human voice he lives alone because he likes it but at the end of the day thats exactly what he is alone its why he started weston walks he could afford an led display in times square but he sticks to three lines in the village voice new york an intimate view walk the city tourists never see hell show you things youll never find spawning upstream at broadway and fortysecond street or padding along fifth avenue in your puffy coats this is the insiders walking tour nobody wants to be an outsider so you make the call its not like he will pick up his phone goes on ringing in some place you cant envision coming as you do from out of town you hang on the phone humming pick up pick up pick up when his machine takes your message youre pathetically grateful excited too you are hooked by westons promise tailored to your desires what these are he determines on the basis of a preliminary interview conducted over coffee at balthazar on himor at starbucks on youdepending on how you are dressed and whether he likes you well enough to spend the day with you in which case hell let you pay he is deciding whether to take you on no matter how stylish your outfitor how tackyif he doesnt like what he hears he will slap a hundred or a twenty on the table at balthazar or starbucks depending and leave you there its not his fault he went to schools where you learn by osmosis what to do and what not to wear its not your fault that you come from some big town or small city where weston would rather die than have to be whatever you want to see weston can find and if you dont know what that is and he decides for you consider yourself lucky this is an insider tour youre itching to begin your weston walk but you must wait until the tour is filled and that takes time weston is very particular at last you meet on the designated street corner youre the ones with the fanny packs cameras monster foam fingers deely bobbers statue of liberty crowns on the kidsunless youre the overdressed southerner or one of those razorthin foreigners in understated black and highend boots westons the guy in black jeans and laidback sweater holding the neatly lettered sign he is surprisingly young quieter than youd hoped reserved but in a good way nothing like the flacks leafleting in times square or bellowing from tour buses on fifth avenue or hawking buggy rides through central park he will show you things that youve never seen before from discos and downtown mud baths nobody knows about to the park where your favorite stars rollerblade to the exclusive precincts of the academy of arts and lettersin the nosebleed district its so far uptownto the marble grand staircase in the metropolitan club which j p morgan built after all the best clubs in the city turned him down notice that at the end weston says goodbye in grand central at ground zero or the northeast corner of columbus circlesome public place where he can shake hands and fade into the crowd you may want to hug him but you cant which is just as well because he hates being touched by the time you turn to ask one last question and sneak in a thankyou slap on the shoulder hes gone he vanishes before you know that you and he are done you thought you were friends but for all he knows you might follow him home and rip off his van gogh or trash his beautiful things you might just murder him dispose of the body and move into his vacant life dont try to call he keeps the business phone set on silent its on the pugin table in his front hall and if you dont know who pugin was you certainly dont belong in his house the house is everything weston hoped meticulously furnished with treasures carefully placed a little miracle of solitude leaving the upperclass grid at venerable st pauls and harvard was like getting out of jail no more roommates clutter and intrusions no more headon collisions with other peoples lives he sees women on a temporary basis hell do anything for them but he never brings them home which is why it always ends its not westons fault hes fastidious remember hes an orphaned only child to survive he needs everything perfect sunlight on polished mahogany in his library morning papers folded and coffee ready and housekeeper long gone no outsiders no family to badger him they all died in that plane crash when he was four he spends days at his computer although he deletes more than he types lunches at a club even new yorkers dont know about hunts treasure in art galleries and secondhand bookstores can get the best table wherever he wants but girls hes waiting for one who cares about all the same things too bad that wings germaine and not the first tourist he booked the one with the lovely phone voice whom he loved on sight at the interview shows up for the lastever weston walking tour while thirteen lucky tourists gather at the subway kiosk on seventysecond at broadway wings is waiting elsewhere and for unstated reasonsdown there weston has no idea whats ahead its a sunny fall saturday light breeze perfect for the classic central park walk so what could be easier or more convenient its a half block from his house all he has to do is collect his group outside the kiosk where they are milling with vacant smiles they light up at the sight of his neatly lettered placard grinning he stashes it in the back of his jeans to be used only when for some unforeseen reason he loses one of them a glance tells him this is a starbucks bunch with their cameras and sagging fanny packs they wouldnt be comfortable at chic old cafÃ© des artistes which is right around the corner from his house its not their fault their personal styles are well a bad match but they are hes one short which bothers him where is that girl he liked so much too bad he has to move on but maybe shell catch up nice day nice enough people he thinkswith the possible exception of the burly tourist in the black warmup jacket with the marine corps emblem picked out in gold who walks with his shoulders bunched leaning into a scowl never mind its a beautiful day and weston is in charge happy and obedient his tourists trot past the spot where john lennon died and into the park on a zigzag heading for the east side where the metropolitan museum bulks above the trees like a mastodon lumbering away he keeps up a lively patter spinning stories as his people smile blandly and nod nod nod all except the man with the scowl who keeps looking at his watch weston looks up ooops like a cutting horse his exmarine has the herd heading into a bad place time to get out of here hell walk them south on fifth point out houses owned by people he used to know all right he says brightly time to see how the rich people live wait the big marine fills the path like a rhino bunched to charge you call this the insider tour smile weston didnt i just he points to a gap in the bushes weston knows it too well take us the fuck inside no behind those bushes a gash in the rocks opens like a mouth he cant go back weston struggles for that tourguide tone what would you like to see tunnels the ground underneath the park is laced with unfinished city projectstunnels aborted subway stations all closed to them weston has researched and he knows oh he says relieved then you want city spelunking tours i have their number and not those the ones real people dug nam vets old hippies there arent any the big man finishes with a disarming grin crazies like me i have buddies down there theres nothing down there weston shudders hes a client dont offend thats just urban legend like a lot of other things you think you know now if you like legends i can take you to frank e campbells where they have all the famous funerals or the house where stanford white got shot by harry k thaw no down the renegade tourist roars like a drill sergeant and the group snaps to like firstday recruits now moving out weston holds up his placard shouting wait too late like a pack of lemmings the lastever weston walking tour falls in behind the big man they are heading into a very bad place no weston doesnt want to talk about it he waves his arms like signal flags wrong way theres nothing here the marine whirls shouting you fucking well know its here the hell of it is weston does he is intensely aware of the others in his little group the newlyweds the dreary anniversary couple the plump librarian and the kid in the derek jeter shirt the others are watching with cool judgmental eyes in spite of their cheap tourist claptrap and bland holiday smiles they are not stupid people theyre fixed on the conflict eager to see something ordinary tourists dont see the authority of their guide is at issue they are waiting to see how this plays out there is an intolerable pause well one more minute and the last weston walking tour will die of holding its breath if you knew what weston knew you would be afraid his only friend at st pauls vanished on their senior class trip to the city one minute weird ted bishop was hunched on the steps of the museum of natural history shivering under a long down coat that was brown and shiny as a cockroachs shell and zipped to the chin on the hottest day of the year then he was gone last winter weston ran into bishop on third avenue with that same ratty coat leaking feathers and encrusted with mud it was distressing he did what he could he took him into a restaurant and bought him hot food looked away when his best friend stuffed everything he couldnt devour into his pockets with the nicest smile i went crazy i hid because i didnt want you to know i wouldnt have minded westons stomach convulsed at first i was scared but then weston oh it was terrifying all that naked emotion so close he shrank as if whatever ted had was catching then they found me bishops pale face gleamed man theres a whole world down there i suppose you think im nuts not really weston reached for a gag line i thought youd gotten a better offer i did ted lit up like an alabaster lamp one look and i knew these are my people and this is my place you have to see ill try he did he followed the poor bastard to the entranceits right behind these bushes he knowsand stopped wait and heard teds voice overlapping wait i have to tell them youre coming you will wait for me right weston wanted to be brave but he could not lie ill try he couldnt stop ted either the tunnel walls shifted behind his friend as if something huge had swallowed him in its sleep its foul breath gushed out of the hole weston heard the earth panting waiting to swallow him forgive him he fled awful place he vowed never to but they are waiting okay he says finally plunging into the bushes like a diver into a pool full of sharks okay with the others walking up his heels weston looks down into the hole its dark as death relieved he looks up sorry we cant do it today not without flashlights now got it covered the veteran produces a bundlehalogen miners lamps on headbands handing them out he says the obvious always weston groans prepared he stands by as his tourists drop into the tunnel one by one if they dont come out what will he tell their families will they sue will he go to jail hes happy to stand at the brink mulling it but the marine shoves him into the hole your turn he drops in after weston shutting out daylight with his bulk the only way they can go is down all his life since his parents died lawrence weston has taken great pains to control his environment now he is in a place he never imagined life goes on but everything flies out of control he is part of this now blundering into the ground weston doesnt know what he expects rats lurking dragons thugs with billy clubs a tribe of pale blind mutants or a bunch of gaudy neohippies in sordid underground squats in fact several passages fan out from the main entrance rough tunnels leading to larger caverns with entrances and exits of their own the underground kingdom is bigger than he feared he had no idea it would be so old debris brought down from the surface to shore up the burrow sticks out of the mud and stone like a schoolchilds display of artifacts from every era the mud plastering the walls is studded with hardware from the streetcargaslight s fragments of glass and plastic from the dayglo skateboard s and motherboards abandoned crts bumpers from cars that are too new to carbon date the walls are buttressed by fourbyfours lit by led bulbs strung from wires but weston moves along in a crouch as though the earth is just about to collapse on his headwhich might be merciful given the fumes although fresh air is coming in from somewhere there is the intolerable stink of mud and small dead things and although to his surprise this tunnel at least is free of the expected stink of piss and excrement there is the smell that comes of too many people living too close together an overpoweringly human fug at first weston sees nobody hears nothing he can make sense of knows only that he cant be in this awful place dense air weighs on him so he can hardly breathethe effluvia of human souls then a voice rises in the passage ahead a girls bright almostfestive patter running along ahead of his lastever weston walking tour as though she and the hulking marine and not weston are in charge meanwhile the mud walls widen as the path goes deeper the tunnels are lined with people their pale faces gleaming wherever he flashes his miners lamp and it is terrifying the man who tried so hard to keep all the parts of his life exactly where he put them has lost any semblance of control the orphan who lived alone because it was safest is trapped in the earth crowdedno surroundedby souls dozens perhaps hundreds of others with their needs their grief and sad secrets and emotional demands the pressure of their hopes staggers him all at once the lifelong solo flier comprehends what he read in ted bishops face that day and why he fled educated careful and orderly and selfcontained as lawrence weston tries so hard to be only a tissue of belief separates him from them now they are all around him i cant every crease in his body is greased with the cold sweat of claustrophobia i wont he has forgotten how to breathe one more minute and he doesnt know frothing he wheels cranked up to fight the devil if he has to anything to get out of here hell tear the hulking veteran apart with teeth and nails offer money do murder or if he has to die in the attemptanything to escape the dimly perceived but persistent needy humanity seething underground as it turns out he doesnt have to do any of these things the bulky vet lurches forward with a bigbear rumble semper fi in the dimness ahead a ragged gravelly chorus responds semper fi the marine shoulders weston aside found em now shove off round up your civilians and move em out miraculously he does he pulls the weston walks placard out of the back of his jeans and raises it pointing the headlamp so his people will see the sign then he blows the silver whistle he keeps for emergencies and never had to use it makes the tunnels shriek okay he says with all the force he has left in his body time to go on to fifth avenue and he goes on in his best tourguide voice its a desperation move but weston is desperate enough to offer them anything the russian tea room ill treat dinner at the waldorf suites for the night courtesy of weston walking tours oddly when they emerge into fresh air and daylightdear god its still lightthe group is no smaller but it is different it takes weston a minute to figure out whats changed the bulky exmarine with an agenda is gone an absence he could have predicted but when he lines them up at the bus stop yes he is shaking quarters into the coin drop on a city bus he still counts thirteen newlyweds yes anniversary couple librarian assorted bland satisfied middle americans yes pimply kid the group looks the same but it isnt he is too disrupted troubled and distracted to know who safe at last in the russian tea room he knows which one she is or thinks he knows because unlike the others she looks perfectly comfortable here lovely woman with tousled hair buff little body wrapped in a big gray sweater with sleeves pulled down over her fingertips when she reaches for the samovar with a gracious offer to pour he is startled by a flash of blackrimmed fingernails never mind maybe its a fashion statement he hasnt caught up with instead of leading his group to times square or grand central for the ceremonial sendoff so he can fade into the crowd he leaves them at the waldorf all marveling as they wait at the elevators for the concierge to show them to their complimentary suites spent and threatened by his close encounter with life weston flees the first thing he does when he gets home is pull his ad and trash the business phone then he does what murderers and rape victims do in movies after the fact he spends hours under a hot shower washing away the event it will be days before hes fit to go out he quiets shattered nerves by numbering the beautiful objects in the ultimate safe house he has created assuages grief with coffee and the days papers in the sunlit library taking comfort from small rituals he needs to visit his fathers turner watercolor stroke the smooth flank of the brancusi marble in the foyer study his treasure a little remington bronze when he does go out some days later he almost turns and goes back in the sexy waif from the tour is on his front steps same sweater same careless toss of the head the intrusion makes his heart stop and his belly tremble but the girl who poured so nicely at the russian tea room greets him with a delighted smile i thought youd never come out you have no right you have no right she looks so pleased that he starts over what are you doing here i live in the neighborhood she challenges him with that gorgeous smile how do you explain to a pretty girl that she has no right to track you to your lair how can you tell any new yorker that your front steps are private specific only to you how can you convince her that your life is closed to intruders or that she is one he cant i have to go where are you staggered by a flashbacktunnel air repeating like something he ateweston is too disturbed to make polite excuses beep his driver manage any of the usual exit lines china he blurts and escapes at the corner he wheels to make sure hes escaped and gasps oh following him at a dead run she smashes into him with a stirring little thud that splits his heart exposing it to the light oh the chipped tooth that flashes when she grins um china this very minute yes he is embarrassed well not really i mean coffee first she tugs down the sweater sleeves beaming lets ill pay by the time they finish their cappuccinos and he figures out how to get out without hurting her feelings hes in love how does a man like weston fall in love accidentally fast its nothing he can control still he manages to part from wings germaine without letting his hands shake or his eyes mist over he must not do anything that will tip her off to the fact that this is the last good time he even manages to hug goodbye without clinging although it wrecks his heart its been fun he says i have to go no big nothing is forever she says exposing that chipped tooth dying a little he backs away with a careful smile to keep the life hes built so lovingly he has to but its hard so bye her foggy voice curls around him and clings take care theyre friends now or what passes for friends so he trusts her not to follow even though its barely four in the afternoon he locks his front door behind him checks the windows and sets the alarm that beautiful girl seemed to be running ahead of his thoughts so fast that when they exchanged life stories she saw the pain running along underneath the surface of the story he usually tells her triangular smile broke his heart im so sorry she said dont be he told her its nothing you did no she said oh no but ive been there and i know what its like orphaned he assumed like me he thinks although she is nothing like him named in honor of her fighterpilot father she said art student she said but she never said when mystifyingly she said you have some beautiful stuff had he told her about the calder maquette and forgotten or mentioned the sargent portrait of his greatgrandfather or the manet oil sketch he has replayed that conversation a dozen times today and he still doesnt know at night even though hes secured the house and is safely locked into his bedroom he has a hard time going to sleep before he can manage it he has to get up several times and repeat his daytime circuit of the house he patrols rooms lit only by reflected streetlights padding from one to the next in tshirt and pajama bottoms touching table tops with light fingers running his hands over the smooth marble flank of the brancusi because every object is precious and he needs to know that each is in its appointed place day or night weston is ruler of his tight little world secure in the confidence that although he let himself be waylaid by a ragged stranger today although he ended up doing what she wanted instead of what he intended here at least he commands the world then why cant he sleep the fourth time he goes downstairs in the dark he finds her sitting in his living room at first he imagines his curator has moved a new degas bronze into the house in the dead of night then he realizes its wings germaine positioned like an ornament on his ancestral brocade sofa sitting with her arms locked around her knees what he cries delighted angry and terrified what wings moves into his arms so fluidly that the rest flows naturally like a soft brilliant dream i was in the neighborhood they are together in a variety of intense configurations until weston gasps with joy and falls away from her exhausted drenched in sense memory he plummets into sleep when the housekeeper comes to wake him in the morning wings is gone by day weston is the same person days pass in their usual sweet order but his nights go by in that fugue of images of wings germaine who hushes his mouth with kisses whenever he tries to ask who she is and how she gets in or whether what they have together is real or imagined no matter how he wheedles she doesnt explain i live in the neighborhood she says and the pleasure of being this close quiets his heart he acknowledges the possibility that the girl is rather only hallucination andastounding for a man so bent on controlhe accepts that as long as his days pass in order he tells himself as long as nothing changes hell be okay he thinks when wings arrives she does what she does so amazingly that hes never quite certain what happened only that it leaves him joyful and exhausted then she leaves his nights are marvels uncomplicated by the pressure of the usual lovers expectations because they both know she will be gone before the sun comes up she always is he wakes up alone to coffee and the morning paper sunlight on mahogany their nights are wild and confusing but in the daytime world that weston has spent his life perfecting everything is reassuringly the same or so he tells himself its what he has to believe if he saw any of this for what it is hed have to act and the last thing weston wants right now is for his dizzy collisions in the night to end until today when he hurtles out of sleep at am panic wakes him the roar of blood thundering in his ears his synapses clash in serial car crashes the carnage is terrible he slides out of bed in the gray dawn and bolts downstairs lunging from room to room shattered by the certain knowledge that something has changed unless everything has changed what he wonders running a finger over tabletops the rims of picture frames the outlines of priceless maquettes by famous sculptors all still in place reassuringly there what dear god his picasso plates are missing treasures picked up off the masters studio floor by greatgrandfather weston who walked away with six signed plates under his arm leaving behind a thousand dollars and the memory of his famous smile horrified he turns on the light pale circles mark the silk wallpaper where the plates hung empty brackets sag reproaching him he doesnt mention this to wings when she comes to him that night he only breathes into her crackling hair and holds her closer thinking it cant be her she couldnt have it couldnt be wings then he buries himself in her because he knows it is before dawn she leaves weston drowsing in his messy bed dazed and grateful his nights continue to pass like dreams the rich orphan so bent on life without intrusions welcomes the wild girl in spite of certain losses love hurts but he wants what he wants their time together passes without reference to the fact that when weston comes down tomorrow his king george silver service will be missing to be followed by his kang dynasty netsuke and then his best mirÃ³ i love her too much he tells himself as objects disappear daily i dont want this to stop he inspects all his external systems remain in place alarms are set theres no sign of forcible entry or exit it is as though things he thought he prized more than any woman have dropped into the earth without explanation he can live without these things he tells himself he can love is love and these are only objects until the brancusi marble goes missing in a spasm of grief his heart empties out wings wont know when they make love that night that her new man is only going through the motionsunless she does know which straightforward weston is too new at deception to guess he does the girl with one eye on the door which is how he assumes she exits once shes pushed him off the deep end into sleepwhich she has done nightly vanishing before he wakes up careful wings tonight will be different to him wings is a closed book he needs to crack her open like a piÃ±ata and watch the secrets fall out guilty and terrible as he feels about doubting her confused because he cant bear to lose one more thing he cant let this go on with wings still in his arms he struggles to stay awake watching through slitted eyes for what seems like forever she drowses he waits the night passes like a dark thought sullenly dragging its feet waiting is terrible by the time a crack of gray light outlines his bedroom blackout shades hes about to die of it the girl he loves sighs and delicately disengages herself grieving he watches through slitted eyes and when she goes he counts to twenty and follows he knows the house better than wings shell take the back stairs so he hurries down the front when she sneaks into the central hall and silences the alarm so she can escape with another of his treasures hell spring sliding into the niche behind the brancusis empty pedestal he crouches until his joints crack echoing in the silent house he has no idea how she escaped damn fool he thinks and does not know which of them hes mad at himself or elusive wings germaine when they lie down together after midnight westons fears have eased of being caught followingthe tears of regret the recriminationsunless his greatest fear was that she wasnt coming back because she knew did she know he followed does she she slides into his arms in the nightly miracle that he has come to expect and he pulls her close with a sigh what will he do after he ends this what will she steal from him tonight and what will she do when he confronts her he doesnt know but its long overdue when she slips out of bed before first light he gives her time to take the back stairs and then follows like a shadow he drifts through darkened rooms where the girl moves so surely that he knows she must linger here every night having her way with his treasured things with the swift smooth touch of a child molester she strokes his family of objects but takes nothing damn is he waiting for her to steal what is she waiting for why doesnt she grab something so he can pounce and finish this emptyhanded she veers toward the darkened kitchen westons back hairs rise and tremble as wings opens the door to the smoky stone cellar and starts down his heart sags is that all she is a generic homeless person with a sordid squat in a corner of his dank basement when wings germaine comes to his bed at night she is freshly scrubbed she smells of wood smoke and rich earth and in the part of his head where fantasies have moved in and set up housekeeping weston wants to believe that shes fresh from her own rooftop terrace or just in from a day on her country estate idiot he has two choices here he can go back to bed and pretend what he must in order to keep things as they are in spite of escalating lossesor he can track her to her lair but oh the missing furniture of his life the art his brancusi what happened to them has she sneaked his best things out of the house and fenced them or does she keep them stashed in some secret corner of his cellar for reasons she will never explain is his treasured mirÃ³ safe is anything he has to know oh lover it is a cry from the heart forgive me he goes down the cellar is empty wings isnt anywhere he shines his caretakers flashlight in every corner and underneath all the shelves and into empty niches in greatgrandfathers wine rack but there is no sign it takes him all morning to be absolutely certain hours in which the housekeeper trots around the kitchen overhead making his breakfast putting his coffee cup and the steaming carafe his orange juice and cinnamon toastand a rose because roses are in seasonon his breakfast tray he times the womans trips back and forth to the library where he eats her visit to his bedroom where she will change his sheets without remarking because she does it every day he waits for her to finish punch in the code and leave by the kitchen door then he waits another hour when hes sure the house is empty weston goes back upstairs for the klieg lights his folks bought for a home tour the year they died bright as they are they dont show him much there are cartons of books in this old cellar bundles of love letters that hes afraid to read his parents skis the ice skates they bought him the christmas he turned four the sledall remnants of his longlost past this is the sad but ordinary basement of an ordinary man who has gone through life with his upper lip stiffer than is normal and his elbows clamped to his sides it makes him sigh maybe he imagined wings germaine then when hes just about to write her off as a figment of his imagination and the missing pieces up to and including the brancusi as the work of his housekeeper or the guy who installed the alarms he sees that the floor in front of the wine rack is uneven and that there are fingerprints on one stone very well he could be speke starting out after burton or livingstone heading up the zambezi the shell weston has built around himself hardens so that only he will hear his heart crack as he finishes alone when she comes back too long after midnight he is waiting provisioned this time equipped with pick and miners lightbecause he thinks he knows where wings is goinghandcuffs and a length of rope he will follow her down never mind what weston thinks in the hours while he crouches in his own basement like a sneak thief waiting dont try to parse the many heartbroken reproachful angry escalating to furious ultimately threatening speeches he writes and then discards the minute that stone moves hell lunge if hes fast enough he can grab her as she comes out if shes faster and drops back into the hole then like a jungle cat he will plunge in after her and bring her down then hell kneel on the womans chest and pin her wrists and keep her there until she explains he already knows that eventually hell soften and give her one more chance but it will be on his terms shell have to pack up her stuff and move into his handsome house and settle down in his daytime life because he is probably in love with her then hell have every beautiful thing that he cares about secured in the last safe place and by god shell bring all his stuff back she will hes been staring at the stone for so long that he almost forgets to douse the light when it moves he manages it just as the stone scrapes aside like a manhole cover and her head pops up oh she cries although he has no idea how she knows he is crouching here in the dark oh fuck its a long way to the bottom the fall is harder than he thought by the time he hits the muddy floor of the tunnel underneath his house wings germaine is gone he is alone in the narrow tunnel riveted by the possibility that its a dead end and theres no way out hes even more terrified because a faint glow tells him that there is to follow wings he has to crawl on and out into the unknown weston goes along on mudcaked hands and slimy knees for what seems like forever before he comes to a place big enough to stand up in its a lot like the hole where the runaway tourist stampeded him but it is nothing like it the manmade grotto is wired and strung with dim lights the air is as foul as it was in the hole where ted bishop disappeared but this one is deserted he is at a rude crossroads access tunnels snake out in five directions and he has to wonder which one she took and how far they go stupid bastard he calls wings there is life down here weston knows it she is down here but he has no idea which way she went or where she is hiding or in fact whether she is hiding from him a man in his right mind even a heartbroken lover would go back the way he came haul himself up and station his caretaker by the opening with a shotgun to prevent incursions until he could mix enough concrete to fill the place and cement the stone lid down so no matter what else happened in his house she would never get back inside instead he cries wings oh wings he knows better than to wait if anything is going to happen here he has to make it happen the idea terrifies him worse there are others here for the first time in his wellordered life careful weston who vowed never to lose anybody or anything he cared about is lost the chamber is empty for the moment but there is life going on just out of sight he hears the unknown stirring in hidden grottoes moving through tunnels like arteriesapproaching for all he knows the knowledge is suffocating the man who needs to be alone understands that other lives are unfolding down here untold masses are deep in their caverns doing god knows what a born solitary he is staggered by the pressure of all those unchecked lives raging out of sight and beyond the law or any of the usual agencies of control encroaching god trembling he tries wings as if she cares enough to answer the tunnels give back nothing he wants to run after her but he doesnt know where worse she may see him not as a lover in pursuit but a giant rat scuttling after food he should search but hes afraid of what he will find much as he misses his things hes afraid to find out what wings has done with them and who she is doing it with overturned he retreats to the mouth of the tunnel that leads to his house and hunkers down to think there are others out theretoo many accustomed now weston can sense them hear them smell them in the dense underground air connected by this tunnel to the treasures he tries so hard to protect the labyrinth is teeming with life but he is reluctant to find out who the others are or how they are they could be trapped underground like him miserable and helpless snapped into fetal position in discrete pits they have dug for themselves they could be killing each other out there or lying tangled in wild orgiastic knots doing amazing things to each other in communal passion pits or thinking great thoughts writing verse or plotting revolution or they could be locked into lotus position in individual niches halfway to nirvana ornothey could be trashing his stolen art he doesnt want to know it is enough to know that for the moment he is alone at a dead end and that in a way its a relief surprise for the first time since the runaway tourist forced him underground and wings flew up to the surface and messed up his life weston has nothing to hope for and no place to go and for the first time since he was four years old he feels safe after a time he takes the pick he had strapped to his backpack in case and begins to dig in the hours or days that follow weston eats he supposes by the time the hole is big enough to settle down in his supply of granola bars is low and the water in his canteen is almost gone but he is not ready to go back into his house in between bouts of digging he probably sleeps mostly he thinks and then stops thinking as his mind empties out and leaves him drifting in the zone what zone he could not say what he wants and where this will end he is too disturbed and disrupted to guess then just when he has adjusted to being alone in this snug reassuringly tight place when he is resigned to the fact that hell never see her again she comes flashing into life before him like an apparition and smiling that sexy and annoying enigmatic smile wings damn that wild glamour damn the cloud of tousled hair damn her for saying with that indecipherable superior air what makes you think im really here the girl folds as neatly as a collapsible tripod and sits crosslegged on the floor of the hole weston has dug fixed in place in front of him sitting right here where he can see her waiting for whatever comes next its better not to meet her eyes not now when he is trying to think it takes him longer than it should to frame the question what have you done with my stuff damn her for answering the way she does what do you care its only stuff everything he ever cared about simply slides away they sit together in westons tight little pocket in the earth they are quiet for entirely too long she doesnt leave but she doesnt explain either she doesnt goad him and she doesnt offer herself she just sits there regarding him its almost more than he can bear a question forms deep inside westons brain and moves slowly like a parasite drilling its way to the surface finally it explodes into the still close air are you the devil or what this makes her laugh whatever sweetie what do you think i dont know he shouts i dont know so get used to it but he cant he wont more or less content with his place in the narrow hole he has dug for himself weston says its time for you to go and when she hesitates wondering he pushes wings germaine outside and nudges her along the access tunnel to the hub the one place where they can stand facing she gasps and recoils to his astonishment he is brandishing the pick like a club then he clamps his free hand on her shoulder and with no clear idea what he will do when this part is done or what comes next he turns wings germaine in his steely grip and sends her away before he ducks back into his territory weston calls after her on a note that makes clear to both of them that they are done dont come back behind him the cellar waits but he cant know whether he wants to go back to his life he is fixed on what he has to do resolved relieved because he know this at least he sets to work on the exit where he left her erasing it with his pick the projected girl by lavie tidhar lavie tidhar is the author of the linkedstory collection hebrewpunk the steampunk novels the bookman and camera obscura the literary novel osama the sf novel martian sands and with nir yaniv the short novel the tel aviv dossier he has lived on three continents and one islandnation and was last seen in southeast asia note david tidhar was an israeli detective author and hero of the twentyeight david tidhar balash detective novels on dannys tenth birthday uncle arik gave him a conjuring set uncle arik had just come back from a spell in england hed stayed hed said in a fivestar hotel in a place called brixton apparently hed stayed there for the whole year and three months of his absence a bed to lie on a roof over your head and three meals a day uncle arik told danny what is there to go out for when hed finally left the hotel however and before boarding the el al flight back home uncle arik had stopped in a shop called davenports and there remembering his favorite and only nephews rapidly approaching birthday he purchased the conjuring set its a shop set underground he told danny in confidence below the great train station of charing cross unless you know its there you will never find it course its a magic shop it was dannys conviction that his uncle arik was a mossad agent his mysterious job was seldom referred to yet it took him to many exotic places often for great lengths of time he had once heard his father say when he thought danny couldnt hear him that uncle ariks work involved things falling off the back of trucks for a while therefore danny thought uncle arik was a truck driver or perhaps a mechanic yet he had never seen him driving a truck nor were there ever signs of grease on his immaculately ironed shirt or trousers a conjuring set dannys father said to his brother when he saw the present im not sure its such a good idea its a great idea uncle arik said its what every kid wants and how would you know dannys father said i was a kid once uncle arik said i always wished mum had bought one of those for me mention of their mother merely brought a head shake from dannys father but the present was given and it stayed go on open it uncle arik said remember the magic you learnyouve got to keep it secret and he put his pointing finger over his lips and danny mimicked his gesture and they both laughed i tell you uncle arik said sitting down in the armchair favored by dannys father wiping sweat from his bushy eyebrows and opening the top button on his checkered shortsleeved shirt ive been to a lot of cities in my time ben ive seen the sights of paris and rome tokyo and new york and london i guess you had a lot of time looking out of windows his brother said but theres nothing uncle arik said ignoring him quite like coming home danny who had never been out of israel and seldom out of haifa shared uncle ariks sentiment wholeheartedly the cityhis citysurely it was the greatest possible place anyone could wish to be born and live in from the balcony above the streetveined slopes of mount carmel danny could always see the great blue expanse of the sea spreading away from haifa like a crayoned map until it fell off in a great rim of waterfalls beyond the horizon from the balcony he could if he was patient enough lick the tip of one finger and then trace at his leisure a trajectory of the sun as it came over the green slopes of the mountain hovered directly overhead and fell at last into the water on time for sunset every time as uncle arik liked to say and standing on the balcony and leaning slightly out over the railings danny could see the streets below where partisans rabbis poets and assassinated politicians wove between each other there hannah senesh who parachuted into yugoslavia and death at the hands of the nazis there the baal shem tov who could perform miracles there the great arlozorov street named after the man who was shot on the beach back in looking left the golden dome of the bahai temple shone in the sun and there farther down was the great sprawling mass of hadar with its shawarma stands its cheap clothing and sunglasses its secondhand book stores dingy travel agents and numerous coffee shopsdannys favorite place in the whole wide world many children are given at one point or another a set of magic tricks for their birthday dannys conjuring set having come from davenports was better than most it included a thumb tip and silk handkerchief a pack of bicycle cards a cutandrestore rope an egg bag a svengali deck and the inevitable wand but it was not guaranteed to turn a kid into a magician most children play with the magic kit for the length of time required to learn that coins dont really disappear its in the other hand that everyone knows a card trick or two and would be happy to display it when presented with the slightest opportunity and that performing magic requires practice like playing the clarinet unless one enjoys the task one soon abandons it and it would surprise no oneand dannys father least of allthat danny too abandoned the magic kit shortly after receiving it and after some time of its remaining untouched in his room it finally made its way into the family boydem the storage area in the ceiling where all unused but notunwanted things inevitably end up in fact the magic kitthe conjuring set to use uncle ariks termbears little relevance to our story but for its consequences at thirteen a jewish boy celebrates his bar mitzvah an occasion of great pleasure for his family and often of acute embarrassment for the boy himself dannys bar mitzvah took place in a rented hall near crusaders road close to the garden of statues and was attended by a great many people some of whom he knew besides the cousins second cousins loose cousins this is tali dannys father said her grandmother was once married to your grandmothers brother works in diamonds uncles aunts and other assorted relatives there were also friends of his fathers this is barashi uncle arik told danny in confidence friend of your fathers from army training days good man lives in jerusalem buys and sells danny said buys and sells what and uncle arik smiled and tapped his nose conspiratorially acquaintances and school friends of dannys with an entourage of parents of their own he was given presents barashi gave him a black plastic combination flashlightscissorsmeasuringtape device and tousled his hair aunt miri gave him handknitted socks and a wet kiss on the cheek cousin uri from the kibbutz gave him a rubber catapult and said i made it myselfit was confiscated by dannys dad as soon as it was givenand there were also envelopes with his name written on each which were given to his father on dannys behalf after the party was over they took a cab back to the flat just danny his dad and his uncle mazal tov the taxi driver said in the flat the two adults sat back on the sofa and danny sat in the armchair sitting together his dad and uncle arik looked remarkably alike it was in the lines around their eyes in the way their hairlines receded in an almost identical fashion but mostly it was in the way they smiled well uncle arik said what are you waiting for pass the envelopes it will all have to go toward paying for the hall dannys father said uncle arik saw dannys reaction and winked at him lets count the money first they divided the envelopes into three dannys dad and his uncle began to open some danny put his on the low round table by the armchair too late he realized the mornings mail was also on the table and in trying to extract it from underneath the pile of envelopes upset the whole thing envelopes fluttered to the ground like a flock of seagulls settling down to rest in the harbor danny hurriedly bent down to pick them up dannys dad frowned but said nothing they sorted notes in piles by denomination danny collected strewn paper debris when he was finished and as he sat back down and began sorting through the pile a small dirtyblue envelope fell down and fluttered into his lap he picked it up unlike the others it bore no givers name the paper felt brittle when he took his hand away there was dust on his fingers he tore it open there was no money inside at first he thought it was empty then when he tipped it pressing the envelope open as if squeezing a lemon a small single sheet of paper slid out he picked it up and looked at it there was a line of writing in black ink the letters carefully drawn as if the writer was not quite comfortable with the hebrew alphabet the handwriting seemed feminine the note said daniel whatever is happen i love you it was signed with a single letteraleph whats that his father said briefly looking up from his work a check danny didnt reply he looked at the note again mutely aleph could stand for imamum but his mother had died when he was four of cancer he had only a vague recollection of her the smell of cooking stuffed cabbage and cigarettes and perfume like at the mashbir department store on herzl street danny what is it but the language was wrong and no one ever called him daniel he said nothing dad and put the note back in the envelope im just going to the bathroom he said he got up and still holding the envelope went instead to his room he looked at the envelope again as he stared at its back it seemed to him that he could see some faint etchings in the paper as if an address had been written there before and there was also a depression in the top right corner as if a stamp was once affixed there its just an old letter he thought maybe it finally surfaced from wherever it was and got mixed up with the normal mail hed read stories where things like this happened he looked around his bookshelves on the bottom shelf lay zeev vilnais sevenvolume guide to eretz yisrael and alongside it all seventeen volumes of the encyclopaedia britannica on the shelf above it was a nearcomplete run of am oveds science fiction paperbacks in the distinct white bindings above these the western secret agent mystery and karate paperbacks that could be found at ten shekels a pop in every secondhand store in the cityand on the last shelf tended carefully like a row of elderly geraniums the rare books left him by his mother the detective library series the worn paperbound books that featured the adventures of the first hebrew detective david tidhar and which were at thirteen dannys abiding passion he looked through them revenge of the maharajahno the blue crosses tales of the hashish smugglersno but theredisappearance on mount carmel a mystery in the margins of the city he wanted to look through it but his father was calling him from the living room danny put the letter into the slim volume where it nestled next to the title page he felt strange as if he had momentarily stepped into something beyond the ordinary and for which he had no words im coming he called and returned the book to the shelf his father and uncle were still counting money when he returned and he joined them though less enthusiastically now at last the task was done ill get us a drink uncle arik said ben just some water dannys dad said uncle arik departed to the small kitchen and returned with water for his brother a coke for danny and a whisky with ice for himself lechaim he said raising his glass and mazal tov danny when the events hall and other expenses were all paid for some money yet remained and so a decision had to be made what should danny spend his money on danny was initially in favor of a computer computers were the latest thing you could buy one to have in your house you could play games on itan argument he didnt quite put forward to his father they would need to add extra money for the purchase pricequite a lot of extra money when it came to thatbut uncle arik in an uncharacteristically somber display suggested putting the money in a savings account at the bank to accumulate interest until danny was twentyone danny was not wholeheartedly supportive of the idea at last dannys father said why dont you buy some books with it take it down to hachalutz street to that shop you always go to danny said really and then as caution took hold of him said anything i want his dad laughed any books you want danny its your money and so it was decided the bookshops of haifa are clustered like a gaggle of elderly generally goodnatured but occasionally difficult uncles in lower hadar around hachalutz street and below in sirkin dannys favorite was called mischar haseferthe book tradeat number hachalutz where it had resided for many years and where it continues to reside seeing as the book dealers of haifa as a body follow the ancient tradition of that city and take a lengthy afternoon spell between one and four in the afternoon danny went there early in the morning the entrance to mischar hasefer is crowded with english paperback books imported pornographic magazines hanging from the rafters by thread like condemned convicts a tasteful spread of romantic novels and a dusty bargain bin overflowing with cookbooks modern fiction and the occasional title in russian on the opposite side of the street is a shawarma stand and the smell of roasting meat arising from its confines accompanied danny as he stepped into the bookshop he browsed happily as bluehaired ladies came and went for their daily fix of mills boon a literature student haggled over a paperback war and peace and a young uniformed soldier with an m slung over his shoulder obscured the science fiction and fantasy shelves from view behind the counter the formidable owner a romanian immigrant of indeterminable age whose name danny had never learned was marking books occasionally raising her voice in a shrill call for her sonitzik itzikfollowing which her son himself of an age whose exactitude could not be determined would pop his head out of the stockroom in the basement to assist with whatever query needed addressing danny made his way through shelf after shelf accumulating half a dozen titles in the process for his collection prominent amongst them three patrick kimthe karate man titles comprising the thousand lakes conspiracy the statues of doom and demon of pale death he also purchased two ringo western titles the gun of revenge and death at high noon and finally the highlight of his visit a rare paperback from the series of horror with a cover showing a grinning deformed skull dan shockers creatures of the devil doctor but it is not dannys literary taste as lamentable as it may be that concerns us the books were mysteries in that danny felt they reflected life they asked important questions such as what is the meaning of life is love eternal and what exactly was it that the doctors devilish creatures do behind the counter itzik had replaced his mother he wiped sweat from his balding head added up the prices and said nice selection you get back half if you return them i think ill keep them danny said itzik shook his head everyones a collector he said sadly dyou know he said as if imparting a great truth to his young audience these are marginal titles a boy like youyou should be reading agnon grossman oz appelfeld serious literature not this trash these books you got there half of them dont even appear in the national library catalogs they dont even officially exist take my advice kid dont waste your time when he had finished at the book trade danny progressed down the stairs beside the store paid a perfunctory visit to the textbook shop underneath and stepped into sirkin and to his second favorite bookshop martef haseferthe book basement the book basements only concession to advertising was and remains an ancient handpainted sign laconically saying books with an arrow pointing farther down the hill follow the arrow and you are confronted with more steps a rubbish heap the smell of urine and going past these delights a door danny opened the door and went in the book basement resembles a crusadersera monastery in its interior books are huddled together in dusty catacombs that spread out in all directions from the vaguely lshaped main corridor shelves rise from the vault of the floor and disappear in the darkness overhead the smell of the interior is of dust and old paper a smell a little like bad breath and a little like wellpreserved perfume it was inside the shop after he had wandered somewhat aimlessly between the aisles that in the darkest corner deepest into the maze of books he came across his find it was not at first or even second glance much to look at it was sitting on a bottom shelf sandwiched between two disintegrating books and seemed initially to be a book itself it was bound in black leather and dannys fingers left marks on the thick layer of dust that covered the binding there was no title the book felt warm like body temperature when he opened it however danny discovered it was rather than a book a sort of thick notebook with blank offwhite pages that had been filled by hand sometime in the past in an untidy cursive script scribbled with black ink he leafed through it saturday february birthday party for dr katzdaughter rabbit from hat linking rings handkerchief routine streamers from mouth production cigarette routinevanish materialization multiplication milk pitcher silk in egg doves routine levitating vase went well around children used regular patter katz paid promptly in cash danny stared at the bound volume in his hands it was a magicians journal every page seemed to be the same a list of magic tricks that varied little from one performance to another sometimes a short record of some new patter used or deviated from the norm a record of the locations which included the british army barracks a function for the harbor officials birthdays weddings and the obligatory bar mitzvahs notes on the number of people in the crowd the date and notesthough no amountsconcerning the payments dotted amongst the pages were a few a very few newspaper clippings which inevitably described a performance particularly worthy of the publics notice the paper of these clippings was yellow like bad teeth danny would have pursued these items further but he was already gripped by that mostunbeatable of compulsions which is aroused by the collectors discovery of what is called a find how much the owner of the book basement looked up at him in amusement he was busy marking a pile of ancientlooking tarzans what have you got there danny wordlessly pushed the diary across the desk the owner leafed through it unhurriedly where did you find this he asked at last danny pointed what do you want this for the owner said i thought you liked detective novels danny cautiously mentioned having once practiced the art of magic which was not entirely the truth his one performanceone saturday at the flat for an audience comprising several family membersdid not go as well as could have been hoped for he failed twice to guess the card picked was left with two pieces of rope that he couldnt join back together and finallyand he still didnt know howthe wand broke as he waved it in the air danny was in other words a terrible magician and that performance contributed in great measure to the conjuring sets eventual exile up in the boydem oh i had a magic kit once the owner said you know that thing with the egg danny denied any knowledge of a thing with eggs little plastic thing had like a blue egg in the middle you could make it disappear just a toy really he seemed to gaze into the air nostalgically lost in thoughts of better days danny said so how much and then because he was a polite kid said please oh have it for fifty the owner said anything for a fellow magician eh danny left a fiftyshekel note on the counter and left the shop as the absorbed owner was unsuccessfully trying to make the note disappear as he walked home along balfour street he passed the old technion building climbing up the hill laden with books he felt sleepy and slow the sun was hot in the sky he vaguely thought of investing some of his remaining money in a glass of orange juice from a stand by the side of the road but decided against it to his left he noticed something that he realized he had seen countless times before but never paid it much attention it was graffiti of a sort one of those street paintings done on the walls that fenced off old buildings which in faroff tel aviv was considered art but here was considered merely a nuisance he stopped the place was shady and looked at the painting it showed a field of sunflowers in vivid yellow a deep blue sky and a range of mountains in the distance that might have been the slopes of mount carmel but those were merely background details what drew his attention with a sudden sharp shock was the girl in the painting she was standing in the field of sunflowers and seemed to be looking out he had the uncomfortable feeling that she was looking out of the painting into the street where he stood she was young and pretty her eyes were olive black her hair fair she had a european look like a new immigrant and delicate features not yet made brown by the sun she seemed strangely alive vibrant it must be the colors danny the great art connoisseur thought the painting disturbed him the girl didnt look like she belonged in the field there was something unearthly about her he wondered what her name was when he finally came home the flat was empty his father had left him some schnitzels and mash in the fridgethe universal meal of the israeli family danny was what they called a yeled mafteach a key child that is he did not have a mother at home had a key on a string around his neck and was expected to fend for himself in the absence of parental supervision it was thus with great leisure that danny sat at the kitchen table the heated food before him the magicians journal open by his side the sun came streaming through the window in the distance the sea was a perfect calm blue he was facing the outside while remaining comfortably inside he leafed through the journal his attention was drawn by a new trick that the magician was apparently using from around the middle of the journal onward it was called the projected girl details were scarce yet it appeared to be a great success audience numbers were up newspaper clippings from this point onward became if not exactly abundant at least slightly more frequent in the pages of the journal danny shoveled some mash absentmindedly into his mouth dropping a little back onto the plate and began perusing the articles haaretz june haifa magician brings wonder to troops haifalast night there was a benefit gala for the british troops stationed in haifa harbor the event took place in the casino building mr mordechai isikovichthe great abrakadabra as he prefers to be knownperformed for the assembled guests bringing shock and wonder to the audience it was truly remarkable mr etzioni of the city council told haaretz i just dont know how he did the things he did the magicianwho reputedly worked in a circus in hungary before making aliyah in the early sperformed such miracles as pulling a selected card signed by a soldier in the audience out of an orange and made doves mysteriously disappear the highlight of the show however was his latest creation which the magician calls the projected girl using a screen and a light projector the audience could clearly see the shadow of the magicians assistanta young womanas it began to shrink and finally disappeared the magician then removed the screento show the girl transformed into a picture on the wall as the assembled guests burst into spontaneous applause the magician reversed the process and he and his assistant took their bows together before the crowd it was amazing british private eddie gall told haaretz i dont know how he did that when asked mr isikovich smiled but did not comment davar september magician entertains detainees cypruscelebrated haifa magician mr mordechai isaakovitz has just returned from cyprus on board hms napier cyprus is currently home to detention camps where jewish refugees from wartorn europe are held by the british for illegally trying to enter palestine by ship i am very grateful to the british authorities for letting me go mr isaakovitz told davar while i cannot free our people i can at least try and lift their spirits i hope they will be released soon and allowed to come to eretz yisrael the magician was accompanied by an assistant danny stared at the open journal hed finished the schnitzels a small globule of mash remained on the plate looking strangely like the dome of the bahai temple he knew about the refugees trying to enter palestine by ship the jewish settlement in palestinethe yishuvsent men to italy and greece members of the palyam or sea brigades who bought what decrepit old ships could be found and tried to smuggle refugees and guns into mandateruled palestine if the british caught them they were arrested and sent to cyprus many ended up back in europe sometimes back under nazi rule but if they got through the british blockade well then there would be lights winking in the darkness from the shore and the boats would be lowered stealthily into the water and the refugees would travel that last distance to land to the secret coves of haifa of which there were many he had heard the stories from his grandfather shaul the british had a radar station up on mount carmel by the stella maris monastery but the yishuvs fighters blew it up after the war he leafed farther ahead the journal stopped abruptly in february the magicians entry for that day must have been written in advance of the performance which was to take place outdoors on balfour street it included only a list of tricks the last of which was the projected girl the rest of the journal was left blank for a few weeks danny mulled over the mystery of the magicians notebook in his spare time magic and mystery may have occupied his mind but society dictated it should have been occupied in more beneficial pursuits and uppermost amongst them was school there were lessons to be endured sines and cosines isosceles triangles and parallelograms the stories of ruth and esther both stories where a foreigner and a jew triumph over obstacles to consummate their love for your homework write an essay in no less than one thousand words the anatomy of the palestinian painted frog extinct meaning and symbolism in dan pagiss holocaust poem written in pencil in the sealed railwaycar and more in chalk on blackboard and in mimeographed handouts blueinked against white it was with a sense of some relief therefore that one bright morning the school break finally came and to celebrate uncle arik only recently returned from another mysterious assignment having lost both weight and his tan in foreign climates took danny out for a slice of pizza and a cappuccino which in haifa comes in a tall glass the upper half of which is generously filled with whipped cream they sat in the paved nordau street and watched the passersby so tell me about the palestinian painted frog uncle arik said danny stared at him vaguely he was still thinking about the magician isikovich or isaakovitz he took to picturing him in black evening dress with a dashing top hat a rabbit poking out under the brim while his assistant dressed in a sequined blue dress handed him props and looked glamorous not unlike daryl hannah who had only recently appeared in splash and was subsequently occupying much of dannys daydreams in class its a rare kind of frog he said dragging his attention back to the present it used to live in the huleh swamps before they were drained in the fifties they only ever found it twice so no one knows much about it its extinct but you uncle arik said seriously you do know as long as you can remember something it isnt truly lost he had become more philosophical with the years full of deceptive depths and shadowed valleys occasionally surprising even his brother i guess danny said he felt both sleepy and restless it was getting hot and the people going past were moving slowly lethargically like frog spawn trying to swim upstream it was lunchtime oho if it isnt my young magician friend danny looked up and saw the owner of the book basement smiling benevolently strangely the man wore a top hat that looked ridiculous over his workingmans checkered shirt and in his hands he held a pack of cards he was busy shuffling go on pick a card any card he extended the deck toward danny cards fanned hi arik what are you doing uncle arik demanded the owner grinned somewhat apologetically always wanted to be magician you know go on pick one danny picked a card it was the queen of hearts now put it back here let me just shuffle them for a moment here take the pack now is your card there no well he reached behind dannys ear was this your card very good danny said he didnt have the heart to tell him that he saw him palming the card just a moment before dont encourage him uncle arik said well anyway the booksellerturnedmagician said i better go oh that reminds me danny i found this the other day it must have fallen from that book you bought last time do you want it and he handed danny a small slip of paper its in english the boy has good english uncle arik said like his uncle yeah sure well see you later and he hurried down the road his hands still busily shuffling cards the top hat precariously balanced at a crooked angle on his head danny looked at the slip of paper the palestine news february magicians assistant disappears haifain a public performance last night outside the jewish technion building magician mordechai itzikovic performed his renowned trick the projected girl for what may be the last time in the shows finale the magician uses a projector to seemingly make his assistant shrink only to appear moments later inside a picture on the wall the assistant is then returnedbut not last night i dont know what went wrong a distraught mr itzikovic was reported as saying where did she go the assistant a young jewish woman was sought last night for questioning by the palestine police force and mr itzikovic has been detained by the ppf to help with their inquiries in a baffling turn of events the projected picture of the girl remained last night on the wall despite the magicians apparatus being turned off shortly after the performance so she disappeared danny said ha whos disappeared uncle arik said and then with a broad grin are you having girl trouble danny what no shed disappeared and the magician never performed again that was a feat of deductive reasoning on dannys part for why else would the notebook be left blank questions what happened that night so tell me about her uncle arik said danny sighed he felt adult beyond his years he was a detective on the trail of a missing girl he was the keeper of a mystery only he knew existed he was assailed by the adults sense of importance mixed with doubt power mixed with confusion how can such opposite feelings coexist danny took a deep breath there was once this magician he began you cry in bright petals and sometimes i pick your tears to press between the pages of a book left on the shelf for someone else to find some other time long after forgetting why we cried when only our names remain like flowered shreds entwined in the margins there was once this magician and he made a girl disappear or the girl disappeared despite the magician it all happened long ago in another town that resembled this one only slightly it was a town of crusaders and templars of bedouin sheikhs and ottoman empire builders city walls were built destroyed built up again the russians built a wharf the turks put through a train line the british rebuilt a harbor that once saw phoenician ships dock their sails bellowing with cedar from lebanon and spices from africa seagulls cried and dived overhead jews came went came back the city was an old lady draped in the patchwork clothes of centuries worn with the dust of holy books it was not a holy city it was not a jerusalem preening in white stone cold and aloof on its hills it was a working city an immigrant city a city of sailors and prophets of prostitutes and monks elijah fought the priests of baal on mount carmel and napoleon quarantined his soldiers sick with the plague after the siege of acre in the monastery of stella maris and had them executed there leaving a plaque behind it was a city whose history was written in the margins between the market stalls and the houses of ill repute between the narrow lanes that separated dusty stores selling the produce of other moreexotic places and outside the bars and inns that had served the armies and navies of all the vanished empires it was a city that sometimes it was not too hard to disappear in some of this danny had learned from his uncle arik who in his solitary pursuits whose nature could never be adequately explained had had plenty of time to learn the history of his city and some of its secrets some he had learned later through books through storieswhich are the lies that people put in books to make them trueand some of it and more he learned eventually from his fearsome and formidable greataunt zsuzsi you must ask aunt zsuzsi uncle arik said when danny had finished his story she will know who your mystery girl was danny did not take kindly to that idea he had the jewish boys natural fear of elderly relatives and greataunt zsuzsiblue haired cigarette smoking stooped but not at all frail zsuzsiwas by far the worst she tended amongst other things to test at assorted family functions be they weddings funerals birthdays or bar mitzvahs the four cornerstones of the familial social calendar dannys knowledge of the classics by speaking to him loudly and ponderously in the ancient latin she had learned in ancient days at school in transylvania since dannys knowledge of that venerable old tongue was precisely none the conversation was rather onesided and he could only take comfort in the hope that a cousin might shortly come along and be pounced upon in his stead greataunt zsuzsi had a voice thickened by cigarettes she liked to pinch cheeks she had a blue number tattooed on her arm and she could remember everything youd ever done from the time you were three years old and peed your pants at cousin ofers bar mitzvah onward she had been an archivist for the harbor authorities and she had lived in the city for decades in a small thirdstory flat in the stella maris neighborhood a family invitation to which caused children to develop immediate and lasting symptoms of flu chicken pox mumps or measles depending on the season and the childs knowledge of medical matters no way danny said uncle arik laughed who ever said being a detective is easy come on im still hungry fancy going to mcdavid for a burger danny gravely acknowledged that he was indeed amiable to such a suggestion on his way back that day he passed by the technion building again the painting of the girl in the field of sunflowers was still there he looked at her with new eyes and he had the strangest feeling that she was looking back at him from across the wall and that she was smiling that night danny looked through his bookshelves again answers could be found there he was sure the shelves were like a packed convention of detectives bursting with clues feats of deduction witnesses and dissemblers clouded with pipe smoke bellowing with cloaks the books of david tidhar were there and danny was drawn back to the volume where he had secreted that mysterious letter on the day of his birthday he pulled out the slim volume disappearance on mount carmel he opened the book at random what is it the commandant asked shorttemperedly pausing from his examination of the case files that had been baffling him and the entire force for the past week it is i tidhar said the newcomer the commandant jumped from his seat as if bitten by a tiger and hurried toward the newcomer welcome he said reaching out his arms to the famous detective welcome danny leafed ahead david tidhar sat alone in his office the pipe dangled from his lips it had all but gone out but he hadnt noticed the stale smell of tobacco hung in the air his mind was abuzz with speculation where was the missing girl the situation was difficult the detective did not believe in magic but he was troubled she was a girl without papers without identity he had heard she came from the ships that she had as they said smuggled the border if he found her would not the british send her back to the lands of the great fiend perhaps he mused aloud it is the work of my great enemy the hangman of corfu only such a devious mind could devise such a devilish scheme he reached for his matches and absentmindedly relit his pipe the solution was close at hand he could feel it danny dinners ready just a minute dad how did the book end hed read it before it was about a girl who went missing in haifa and the great david tidhar was called to assist the police coming down all the way from tel aviv but the case naturally became more complex the more david probed and involved a secret plan by the yishuv leadership to smuggle in two ships full of refugees from germany an arab revolt and nazi spies in danny knew it had seemed as though hitler was very close to achieving one goal of his war and overrunning palestine itself were that to happen haifa and carmel would become the last bastion of jewish resistance in the event rommel was turned back at al alamein and the german invasion of palestine never happened in the book however worry remained but what of the girl danny leafed to the end of the book surely the great david tidhar at least had solved the puzzle david tidhar shook hands with the british commandant and boarded the car that was to take him back to tel aviv he had stopped the spiesjust in time it seemed before they could communicate their vital information to the nazi fiendand at the same time had assisted the palyam to safely smuggle the refugees into eretz yisrael but the commandant had no need to know that david the commandant said if it werent for you i believe a nazi invasion would have been inevitableand imminent thanks to you we can continue the fight fight until the germans are defeated i was only doing my job david tidhar said and he nodded to the driver the engine started and they were off away from the green mountain and this old and belligerent city that was so unlike his own modern tel aviv i was only doing my job he thought but he could find no satisfaction the girl it was the one case he would always afterward remember his one failure he never did find the missing girl what danny said and despite all his budding bibliophiles instincts he threw the book across the room danny are you all right in there no yes ill be out in a minute dad wearily he went to pick up the book the letter fell from it and he picked it up the scent a womans perfume was still on it daniel whatever is happen i will always love you somehow he was convinced it was from her but what did it mean he sighed a sound older than his years replaced the letter in the book and at last went to dinner a week later he was at the german settlement the old templar village that sits beneath the bahai gardens he was walking along the fighters of the ghetto road when he passed a large ancientlooking pine tree surrounded by fallen cones he nearly missed it but something some irregularity in the color of the bark perhaps drew his attention suddenly and when he approached it he found carved in small neat letters into the flesh of the tree a dark and old tattoo that said as if mocking him i will leave you signs my love in the margins of our city that day danny decided to make the ultimate sacrifice and as a first step got his dad to phone greataunt zsuzsi you phone her his father said in matters of his aunt he was not unlike danny dad what do you want from zsuzsi shes an old lady she shouldnt be disturbed she needs to be left alone danny was wholeheartedly in agreement with his father on this matter the image of a strange blond girl however drove him its a history project for school he said please the phone call was made reluctantly dannys father spoke briefly into the mouthpiece he nodded though the other party clearly couldnt see him he spoke into the mouthpiece again the sun came through the window and illuminated him no longer a young man with pouches under his eyes and hair that had been receding steadily away from his high forehead like a crusader force being driven back from a fortress by hostile saracens for all that there was still something sunny about him though more and more often now the sun seemed submerged in the sea just beyond the horizon he said aha yes aha and cradled the phone she wants to speak to you there was nothing to it like a roman gladiator who might have once entered the arena in nearby caesarea danny stepped forth aunty zsuzsi he said mens sana in corpore sano the elderly voice on the other end of the phone pronounced im sorry a healthy mind in a healthy body great aunt zsuzsi said still no latin for shame you wish to see me i have some questions its for this monday five oclock bring waffles waffles are you deaf as well as ignorant goodbye the phone went dead danny said goodbye into the silent phone and thought he heard the ghostly echo of a laugh returned to him over the wire what did she say danny repeated his instructions oy his father said and sighed you better go to the shop then stella maris the sea star sits on the northern peak of mount carmel and commands like the diminutive french general who once held her extraordinary and longreaching views zsuzsis door up three flights of stairs opened onto a modest yet comfortable abode where the entire mediterranean sea it seemed was spread outside like sparkling fresh laundry shalom daniel oh youve grown so much give your aunty a kiss danny that tireless pursuer of the balash or detective story knew about informers many times they were crucial to the plot they were sources of secret knowledge purveyors of hidden information and naturally had to be paid i brought the waffles he said after being subjected to his cheeks being pinched and the inevitable tobaccoflavored kiss i brought both chocolate and lemon flavor i didnt know which one you liked how sweet of you zsuzsi said and when she smiled it made her seem for just a moment not young but yet terribly innocent it was the face of a goodnatured baby shortly after being fed please sit down daniel ill make some coffee she disappeared into the small kitchen and the smell of turkish coffee was soon wafting through the room danny sat on the couch and waited the flat was sparsely but pleasantly decorated old photos mostly in black and white were framed on the walls people in oldfashioned hats and coats bookshelves lined the walls and there amidst the unknown titles in hungarian and romanian and the scattering of hebrew booksit couldnt be butwas that the detective library featuring the exploits of none other than david tidhar so zsuzsi said sitting down opposite him and laying a tray bearing two cups a finjan full of black coffee and a plate heaped to the brim with dark chocolate waffles on the table what is it that you wanted to ask me young man danny wordlessly handed over the magicians journal zsuzsi took it from him there was care in the way she handled it she leafed through the pages her fingers treated the old paper gently she looked at the newspaper cuttings she came to the last page when she looked up her face had changed once again it was older now and sad and yet she was smiling they never did get his name right did they she said its because the name itself was a misprint you see it was heisikovitz it should have been isikovitz but she shrugged i guess when the authorities came to their village to write down their surnames the officer in charge spelled the name wrong that would have been around the eighteenth century transylvanian like our family you knew him she shook her head no they were from marosvÃ¡sÃ¡rhely we were from brasov and the time of this story she tapped on the journal with her finger gently i was in auschwitz not haifa but agi was here he had heard the name before agiagnetawas his grandfathers youngest sister he followed zsuzsis gaze to a photograph on the wall thats your grandfather in the middle zsuzsi said and me on the right and the little girl holding his handthats agi she was what seventeen eighteen when she followed your grandfather to palestine that would have been in fortyone when it was still possible to go she had said auschwitz matteroffactly and that was how danny accepted it he said and she knew the magician somehow zsuzsi said and that same smile knowing and amused was back on her face i suspect it isnt the magician so much that you are interested in as it is his assistant daniel she rose from her seat and made her way to a cabinet by the wall when she returned she was holding a photo she handed it to danny the magician was short and stocky he had dark wavy hair and a waxed mustache and eyes that seemed ready to twinkle he was dressed in a black suit and wore a tall hat beside him was the girl he recognized her face it was the girl from the painting shed always had that effect zsuzsi said and she was beautiful danny wanted to ask questions but he sensed silence was being called for she would tell him what she knew in her own time her name was eva zsuzsi said and danny thought about the letter in his book signed with an aleph was it an aleph for eva he had thought it stood for ima mother but without vowel markings the nikud underneath the consonants it could have been either she was from austria perhaps the nazis had her for a while somehow she escaped she made her way to italy and onto one of the ships and she came to palestine to haifa she couldnt have been much more than eighteen like agi they became friends she sighed and her eyes seemed to dim like windows looking out not at the sea but a great distance still across a land veiled now in darkness where only a few stars still shone i dont know how much you understand of that time daniel she said the yishuv was fighting the british and their white booktheir changing policy on palestineand at the same time working with the british against the nazis bengurion said we shall fight the nazis as if there was no white book and fight the white book as if there were no nazis it was not an easy strategy and the girls were young you know agi and eva saved from the holocaust so alive and finding themselves in this city filled with dashing soldiers who were just as young just as handsome as themselvesthey used to go to the old casino building to dance it must have been exciting and of course the excitement stemmed partly from the fact that it was not right for them to do it to associate this way with the british the colonizers agi worked as a secretary for a dr katz eva had no papers but one day she met mordechai and it was an easy enough decision for him to make danny thought of cashonly payments and of stage names and stage clothes and he said surprised he hadnt realize this before he hid her in plain view like a magician and so the days of the war went on so what happened danny demanded have a waffle i he chose not to argue for several minutes there was silence not uncompanionable as the two of them drank coffee and ate the kibud the refreshments zsuzsi lit a cigarette the smoke curled up and was blown toward the glittering sea she fell in love zsuzsi said simply with a british soldier deeply madly rashly in love it was the sort of love that leaves no room for compromise for anything other than itself his name was daniel like yours you know what they did to her what did they do danny said and fear eased itself into him edging beside the sudden jealousy that had flared there he didnt yet ask who they were they cut off her hair the cigarette shook in zsuzsis hand her long beautiful hair its what the yishuv did to girls who went with the enemy they took her one night when she was coming home from the casino singing to herself in the dark they grabbed her and forced her down and they did this to her like the nazis did in the camps agi told me it was meant as a warning to the other girls after that she wore a wig for the performances and someone told on her then it was only a matter of time the police danny said thinking of that last newspaper cutting they would have sent her back young and old looked at each other across a table sharing a horror which for the one was born of stories and for the other of memories what did they do she could have married him but she had no papers and he was only a boy himself a common soldier with no influence they loved each other very much agi told me they planned to run together leave palestine the army go to india or hong kong a place where they could disappear in the great story of the world they were unimportant marginal is that what happened danny said thinking of that night all those years ago when the projected girl had for the last time disappeared did they run away i dont know zsuzsi said the words hung heavy in the air like thick smoke no one does some say the magician was a part of their plan and some say that frightened hunted she found refuge in the only place they couldnt touch herin that picture in the field of sunflowers where she could be always in the sun and never suffer darkness again it was magic zsuzsi smiled sometimes you have to believe sometimes you want to believe and the magician what happened to him he never performed again is he still alive the smile remained it was a small private smile there in the corners of her mouth and sad like the last lingering note of a symphony yes she said simply and if you want him you must go to the mukhraka to the place of burningand there ask for brother mordechai how did it go fine i said ill come and see her again next week dad what are you doing his father turned and gave him a nervous smile he was fiddling with the top button of his shirt which looked new do you think i look all right you look fine honestly where are you going to take her im not sure his father said worriedly i thought maybe a movie and then something to eat danny grinned just dont do what you did last time his father it had turned out in his nervousness and desire not to disappoint had driven his date from one empty eatery to another refusing so he said to eat in an empty restaurant they had ended at last at a kebab place in the old check point outside haifa once manned by the british and now a busy road of traffic and commerce the kebab place was bursting with truckers prostitutes and several friends of uncle ariks it had not gone well what do you think i should do where can i take her how about the harbor yeah thats a good idea his father said looking relieved he was looking better sunnier danny thought or at least his forehead did seem rather shiny youll be fine he said giving his dad a reassuring pat on the back he watched him go down to the car start it noisily and drive awayand he smiled and thought about love for every balash there comes a time when a final confrontation must take place the case becomes clear a truth is reached yet some things dont need truth or clarity a sense of closure perhaps or a sense of freedom from the dogged facts may be all that is needed one day in early spring a family outing was planned and carried out present in the car were danny his father uncle arik uncle moyshe from the kibbutz on dannys mothers side and cousin uri they were not going far the car chugged along the moria road past herbert samuel and einstein where moria turns into freud they took a left and went along aba hushi encountering einstein again along the way passing aharonson golda meir and the ivory coast they gave the hard shoulder to oskar schindler and took a right this time past liberia sweden and costa rica past haifa university with its array of satellite dishes and listening devices aimed at the skies and nearby lebanon briefly admired the view from the top of mount carmel and coasted down again passing through forests of pine and the druze villages of usefiyeh and daliat elcarmel winter had not yet given up its grasp on mount carmel and the air had just the hint of chill about it as they climbed out of the car the dir elmukhraka the arabs called this placethe monastery of the place of burning it belonged to the carmelite order here elijah fought the priests of baal and here a great fire came down from the skies consuming the wood and the stones and the dust the priests of baal ran and were pursued until they reached the river kishon and there they were slain well im hungry uncle arik announced where are the egg sandwiches they were going to picnic in the forest but first they trooped into the monastery building past the statue of elijah holding his sword and climbed up to the flat top of the monasterys roof from which one can see as far away as nazareth and mount tavor on the way back danny stopped an old man dressed in the habit of the monks was working in the garden and something about him he approached the monk and said a little nervously brother mordechai the man straightened his back he leaned on his spade and examined danny somewhat warily yes the great abrakadabra the man nodded slowly as if confirming something to himself once he said i wanted to ask you i mean about eva the eyes seemed to twinkle for a brief moment danny had an image of the monk before him with a waxed mustache and a top hat he said i have your journal oh the man looked momentarily surprised then he laid down his spade carefully and said come lets sit down somewhere danny turned to shout to his family that hed be right back but in any event there was no need a small group had appeared in the monasterys yard and he saw the security minister ambling along trailed by his coterie and two boredlooking photographers no doubt on an official visit of some sort the minister he saw to his surprise was making for their small group and as danny watched the minister came up to uncle arik and solemnly shook his hand drawing him aside danny watched puzzled as his uncle and the minister spoke together in low voices no one was paying danny much attention he followed the old monk to a bench overlooking the wooded slopes of mount carmel you want to know about the projected girl the monkthe great abrakadabrasaid yes after all these years the monk said and he shook his head but then he smiled she did have that effect on people he said eva i was in love with her you know from the moment i saw her at dr katzs it was a horrible evening the kids were screaming the rabbit wouldnt come out of the hat but then i saw her and i forgot everything else she was so beautiful he sighed too beautiful i never even had a chance what happened that night danny said and there was no question between them of what night that was the monk shook his head we were performing the projected girl he said as normal it was not in truth an overly complicated trick i used a light projector a lantern really with a cardboard cutout of evas profile it was quite easy to make it seem she disappeared back then something like this was still novel you know but his hands were browned by the sun and liver spotted for a moment he turned to face danny reached behind his ear and pulled out a fiveshekel coin he moved his hand over it and it changed into a stone he raised his fist to his mouth blew softly and when he opened his hand the stone had disappeared he smiled apologetically at danny i still do that sometimes he said i find it calming the picture danny said it stayed on the wall dont you think i know that i was there that night she should have been in the he hesitated then smiled and said i may have made one vow now but it does not mean i should forsake the other he meant the monkhood in the first instance danny thought and the magicians oath in the second never reveal a secret the old magician hesitated she should have been there he said at last the picture was just thata picture light projected on wall but when i removed the screen for the second time the picture was there as if it had always been there and eva eva was gone it was magic not the kind of magic i could do i couldnt understand it i checked everywhere i had a lot of time to think about it later the police came and they thought i helped her escape and it was a week before they let me go i kept thinking how could this have happened was it a trick did she set it up herself it was possible but if she did i still dont know how danny lifted his head somewhere in the forest a bird was calling and was being answered by its mate a cool breeze rustled the pine needles otherwise it was quiet what was it then he said speaking in a low voice the elderly monk looked sideways at him and said a miracle no have you seen her the monk demanded have you seen her there in her field of sunflowers looking out into the city every day for the past forty years it took me a long time to think it through but i have no other explanation i went to visit her for months id go past that wall and look at her and i could swear her expression changed the way she stood the way she he subsided she could see me he said and she wouldnt come out she was safe there in the margins of the city and for that im glad danny sat back you became a monk he said brother mordechai smiled if it was a miracle he said that suggests the existence of god i was a jew before i became a magician but i was a monk only after i stopped being a jew maybe it was the way they treated her i felt something break inside me like the clockwork inside one of my old tricks when i saw and you are convinced i thought i saw her once the old magician said i was in italy with the brothers in rome walking down a busy streeti thought i saw her her hair was grown again and she was not so young anymore but still beautiful there was a child with her a little girl and then a man came and put his arm around her and they were gone lost in the crowd he shook his head it couldnt have been her but if it was yes she seemed happy they sat together in silence and looked over the forest at last danny stood up thank you mr heisikovitz he said the old man looked up at him and his eyes twinkled they were covered in a fine mist brother mordechai he said thats what i am now and anyway the family changed the name a few years ago they wanted something more hebrew oh what to tidhar the old man said and he shrugged i think its a kind of biblical tree all stories and even ours must come to an end a week later danny spent the last of his bar mitzvah money in the bookshops of hadar and was returning home along balfour street he had hoped to look at eva again but when he approached the wall he was in for a surprise two workmen were standing on the pavement dressed in blue paintspattered overalls with a bucket of white paint at their feet and brushes in their hands they were painting the wall danny ran toward them what are you doing cleaning graffiti the one on the left said he had a bushy mustache and was smoking a cigarette mayors instructions keep the city clean this isnt graffiti he craned to look they hadnt done much damage yet butwhat did you do to it he demanded what do you mean the one on the right said he was thin and balding at the top weve only just started what happened to the girl the two workmen looked at each other and back at danny they ponderously laid down their brushes what girl danny stared at the painting it was somewhat obscured now by white as if a screen of clouds were descending on the scene hiding it from view still he could make out the outline of the mountains in the distance a sunflower nodding in the breeze the deep blue skies behind the clouds of white it was all still there all but for one thing there was no girl kid do you mind weve got work to do the one on the left said yeah the one on the right said you got a complaint go to city hall the two workmen looked bemused as the boy wandered off inexplicably he was grinning funny kid the one on the left said should be at school or something yeah the one on the right said looking quizzically at the picture i dont see what he was getting at he complained his friend picked up his brush and shrugged kids he said the way station by nathan ballingrud nathan ballingrud has had stories appear in inferno new tales of terror and the supernatural the del rey book of science fiction and fantasy sci fiction the rd alternative and the years best fantasy and horror among other places recently he won the shirley jackson award for his story the monsters of heaven he currently lives in asheville north carolina with his daughter beltrane awakens to the smell of baking bread it smells like that huge bakery on mlk that he liked to walk past on mornings before the sun came up when daylight was just a paleness behind buildings and the smell of fresh bread leaked from the grim industrial slab like the promise of absolute love he stirs in his cot the cot and the smell disorient him his body is accustomed to the worn cab seat with its tears in the upholstery and its permanent odor of contained humanity as though the car had leached some fundamental ingredient from them over the years but the coarse grainy blanket reminds him that he is in st petersburg florida now far from home looking for lila someone sitting on a nearby cot back turned to him is speaking urgently under his breath rocking on the thin mattress and making it sing around them more cots are lined up in rank and file with scores of people sleeping or trying to sleep there are no windows but the night is a presence in here filling even the bright places you smell that man he says sitting up his neighbor goes still and silent and turns to face him hes younger than beltrane with a huge saltandpepper beard and grime deeply engrained into the lines of his face what bread the guy shakes his head and gives him his back again maaaaaaan he says sick of these crazy motherfuckers did they pass some out im just sayin man im hungry you know we all hungry bitch whynt you take your ass to sleep beltrane falls back onto the bed defeated after a moment the other man resumes his barely audible incantations his obsessive rocking meanwhile the smell has grown even stronger overpowering the musk of sweat and urine that saturate the homeless shelter sighing he folds his hands over his chest and discovers that the blanket is wet and cold what he pulls it down to find a large damp patch on his shirt he hikes the shirt up to his shoulders and discovers a large square hole in the center of his chest the smell of bread blows from it like a wind the edges are sharp and clean not like a wound at all tentatively he probes it with his fingers they come away damp and when he brings them to his nose they have the ripe deliquescent odor of river water he places his hand over the opening and feels water splash against his palm poking inside he encounters sharp metal angles and slippery stone beltrane lurches from his bed and stumbles quickly for the door to the bathroom leaving a wake of jarred cots and angry protests he pushes through the door and heads straight for the mirrors over a row of dirty sinks he lifts his shirt the hole in his chest reaches right through him gas lamps shine blearily through rain deep water runs down the street and spills out onto his skin new orleans has put a finger through his heart oh no he says softly and raises his eyes to his own face his face is a wide street garbage blown with a dead streetlight and rats scrabbling along the walls a spray of rain mists the air in front of him pebbling the mirror he knows this street hes walked it many times in his life and as he leans closer to the mirror he finds that he is walking it now home again in his old city the bathroom and the strange shelter behind him and gone he takes a right into an alley somewhere to his left is a walled cemetery with its aboveground tombs giving it the look of a city for the dead and next to it will be the projects where some folks string christmas lights along their balconies even in the summertime he follows his accustomed path and turns right onto claiborne avenue and theres his old buddy craig waiting for him still craig was leaning against the plateglass window of his convenience store two hours closed clutching a greasy brown paper bag in his left hand with his gray head hanging and a cigarette stuck to his lips a few butts were scattered by his feet the neighborhood was asleep under the arch of the i overpass a row of darkened shopfronts receded down claiborne avenue the line broken by the colorful lights of the good friends bar spilling onto the sidewalk the highway above them was mostly quiet now save the occasional hiss of latenight travelers hurtling through the darkness toward mysterious ends beltrane sixtyfour and homeless moseyed up to him he stared at craigs shirt pocket trying to see if the cigarette pack was full enough to risk asking for one craig watched him as he approached i almost went home he said curtly you wouldnt leave old trane the hell i wouldnt see if im here next time beltrane sidled up next to him putting his hands in the pockets of his thin coat which he always wore in defiance of the louisiana heat i got held up he said you what you got held up what do you got to do that you got held up beltrane shrugged he could smell the contents of the bag craig held and his stomach started to move around inside him a little what you got a date some little lady gonna take you out tonight come on man dont make fun of me then dont be late craig pressed the bag against his chest beltrane took it keeping his gaze on the ground i do this as a favor you make me wait outside my own goddamn shop i just wont do it no more you gonna get my ass shot beltrane stood there and tried to look ashamed but the truth was he wasnt much later than usual craig came down on him like this every couple of months or so and if he was going to keep getting food from him he was just going to have to take it a couple years ago beltrane had worked for him pushing the broom around the store and shucking oysters when they were in season and for some reason craig had taken a liking to him maybe it was the veteran thing maybe it was something more personal when beltrane started having his troubles again craig finally had to fire him but made some efforts to see that he didnt starve beltrane didnt know why the man cared but he figured craig had his reasons and they were his own sometimes those reasons caused him to speak harshly that was all right he opened the bag and dug out some fried shrimp theyd gone cold and soggy but the smell of them just about buckled his knees and he closed his eyes as he chewed his first mouthful where you been sleepin at night trane my boy ray tells me he aint seen you down by decatur in a while beltrane gestured uptown in the opposite direction of decatur street and the french quarter they gave me a brokedown cab who them boys at united thats better than the quarter beltrane nodded theys just a bunch a damn fuckedup white kids in the quarter got all kinds a metal shit in their face they smell bad man craig shook his head leaning against the store window and lighting himself another cigarette oh they smell bad huh i guess i heard it all now beltrane gestured at the cigarette can i have one hell no so you sleeping in some junk heap now you gone down a long way since you worked for me here you know that you got to pull your shit together man i know i know listen to me trane are you listening to me i know what you gonna say well listen to me anyway i know youre fucked in the head i got that i know you dont remember shit half the time and you got your imaginary friends you like to talk to but you got to get a handle on things man beltrane nodded half smiling this speech again yeah i know no you dont know cause if you did you would go down to the va hospital and get yourself some damn pills for whatevers wrong with you and get off the goddamn street you will fucking die out here trane you keep fucking around like this beltrane nodded again and turned to leave you better get on home craig might get shot out here now whos making fun craig said he tried to push himself off his window but the glass had grown into his head his shoulders were stuck too its too late he said i cant go home im stuck here forever now god damn it im goin up to the white neighborhood beltrane said he avoided looking at craig turned his back to him and started to walk uptown yeah you go on and get drunk see what thatll fix im goin to find that little ivy man she always hang out up there this time im gonna get that girl i cant understand you anymore my ears are gone and it was true craig had been almost wholly absorbed by his window now or maybe he had merged with it in any case his body was mostly gone only the contours of his face and his small rounded shoulders stood out from the glass his lower legs and feet still stuck out near the ground but he was mostly just an image in the glass now beltrane hurried down the street feeling the beginnings of a cool wind start to kick up he glanced behind him once looking for craigs shape but he didnt see anything just the empty storefront staring back at him beltrane stands in front of the mirror and watches his face for movement he exerts great concentration to hold himself still the slopes and angles of his face the wiry gray coils of beard growing up over his cheeks the wide round nostrilseven his eyelidsare as unmoving as hard earth the skin beneath his eyes is heavy and layered and the fissures in his face are deep but nothing seems out of place nothing is doing anything it isnt supposed to be doing hes standing over one of the sinks in the shelters bathroom it has five partitioned stalls most of which have lost their doors and a bank of dingy gray urinals on the opposite wall after a moment the door opens and one of the volunteers pokes his head in when he sees beltrane in there alone he comes in all the way and lets the door swing closed behind him hes a heavy man with high yellow skin a few dark skin tags standing out on his neck like tiny beetles beltrane has seen him around a little bit over the couple of days hes been here kneeling down sometimes to pray with folks that were willing you all right the volunteer asks beltrane just looks at him he cant think of anything to say so after a moment he just turns his gaze back to the mirror the way you charged in here i thought you might be in trouble the volunteer stays in his place by the door beltrane looks back at him you see anything wrong with my face the man squints but comes no closer no looks okay to me when beltrane doesnt add anything else he says you know we have strict policies on drug use in here i aint on drugs i got this thing here i dont know i dont know he lifts his shirt and turns to the volunteer who displays no reaction can you see this he asks that street there yes i can see it beltrane says i think im haunted the man says nothing for a moment then is that new orleans beltrane nods i guess youre here from katrina yeah thats right it fucked my world up man everybody gone the man nods most people from new orleans are going up to baton rouge or to houston what brings you all the way to florida my girl my girl lives here im gonna move in with her your girlfriend no my girl my daughter youve been here two days already havent you where is she she dont know im coming i got to find her beltrane stares at himself his face is dry his hair is dry he lifts his shirt to stare at the hole there one more time but its gone now he runs his hand over the old brown flesh the curly gray hairs the volunteer says nothing for a moment then how long has it been since youve seen her beltrane looks down into the sink the porcelain around the drain is chipped and rusty a distant gurgling sound rises from the pipes as though something is alive down there in the bowels of the city he has to think for a minute twentythree years he says finally the volunteers face is still thats a long time she got married is that when she moved here i got to find her i got to find my little girl the volunteer seems to consider this then he opens the door to the common area my names ron davis im the pastor at the trinity baptist just down the street a few blocks if youre all done in here why dont you come down there with me i think i might be able to help you beltrane looks at him a pastor come on man i dont want to hear about god tonight thats fine we dont have to talk about god if i leave they wont let me back in they just give up my cot to someone else davis shakes his head you wont have to come back tonight you can sleep at the church if were lucky you wont ever have to come back here if were not ill make sure you have a bed tomorrow night he smiles itll be okay i do have some influence here you know they leave the shelter together stepping into the close heat of the florida night the air out here smells strongly of the sea so much that beltrane experiences a brief thrill in his heart a sense of being in a place both strange and new to their left several blocks down central avenue he can see the tall masts of sailboats in the harbor gathered like a copse of birch trees pale and ethereal in the darkness to their right the city extends in a plain of concrete and light softly glowing overpasses arcing over the street in grace notes of steel people hunch along the sidewalks they sleep in the small alcoves of shop doors some of them lift their heads as the two men emerge one of them tugs at beltranes pant leg as he walks by hey are you leaving is they a bed in there davis says something to the man but beltrane ignores them both he hopes the walk to the church is not long the pleasant sense of disorientation he felt just a moment ago is gradually turning to anxiety the buildings seem too impersonal the faces are all strange he looks up at the skyand there in the thunderheads he finds something familiar piling rain clouds and the cool winds which precede a storm made the walk from the treme to the lower garden district more pleasant rain was not a deterrent especially in the summer months when the storms in new orleans were sudden violent and quickly over low gray clouds obscured the night sky their great bellies illuminated from time to time by huge silent explosions of lightning beltranes bones hummed in this weather as though with a live current he made his way out of the darkened neighborhood and into the jeweled glow of new orleanss central business district where lights glittered even when the buildings were empty the streetcar chimed from some unseen distance roaring along the unobstructed tracks like a charging animal he walked along them past the banks and the hotels until at last he hit the wide boulevard of st charles avenue and entered the garden district the neutral groundthe grassy swath dividing the avenue into uptown and downtown trafficwas wide enough here to accommodate two streetcar tracks running side by side palm trees had been planted here long ago by some starryeyed city planner a half mile ahead they gave way to the huge indigenous oaks which had seen the palm trees planted and would eventually watch them die they stood like ancient gods protecting new orleans from the wild skies above her here we are ron says and beltrane drifts to a stop beside him there are no trees here there are no streetcars the trinity baptist church is just one door in a strip mall sandwiched between a christian bookstore and a temp agency the glass of its single window is smudged and dirty deep red curtains are closed on the inside and the corpses of moths and flies are piled on the windowsill ron takes a moment to unlock the door then he reaches inside and flips on the light my office is in the back he says come on in they walk through a large open area with rows of folding chairs arranged neatly before a lectern the linoleum floor is dirty and scuffed with years worth of rubber soles ron opens a plywood door in the rear of the room and ushers beltrane into his cramped office he seats himself behind a desk which takes up most of the space in here and directs beltrane to sit down in one of the two chairs on the other side then he switches on a computer while it boots up he says well look online and see if we can find her whats your name henry beltrane you said she was married will she still have your name um delacroix thats her husbands name daviss fingers tap the keys and he hunches closer to the screen he pauses and begins to type some more twentythree years is a long time he says how old would she be about now forty fortyfive beltrane says fortyfive years old its the first time hes said it aloud it works like a spell calling up the gulf of years between now and the time he last saw her when he was drunk in a bar and she was trying one more time to save his life dad shed said were leaving four more days were doing it hed turned his back to her then thered been a television behind the bar and hed fixed his eyes to it have a good trip hed said its not a trip do you understand were moving there im moving away dad yeah i know shed grabbed his shoulders and turned him on his stool so that he had to look at her daddy please hed watched her for a moment shaping her face out of the unraveling world he was so drunk the sun was still up filtering through the dusty windows of the bar her eyes were tearing up what hed said what what you want from me davis releases a long sigh and leans back in his chair i got a sam and lila delacroix that sound right beltranes heart turns over thats her lila thats her davis jots the address and phone number down on a sticky note and passes it across to beltrane guess its your lucky night he says though his voice is flat beltrane stares at the number in his hand a faint disbelieving smile on his lips you call her for me davis leans back in his chair and smiles what right now its almost midnight mr beltrane you cant call her now shell be in bed beltrane nods absorbing this look i keep a mattress in the closet for when i dont make it home i can pull it out for you you can crash right here tonight beltrane nods again the thought of a mattress overwhelms him and he feels his eyes tearing up his mind skips ahead to tomorrow to wondering about how soft the beds might be in lilas home if shell let him stay he wonders what it will feel like to wake up in the morning and smell coffee and breakfast to have someone say kind things to him and be happy to see him he knew all those things once they were a long time ago you have a problem davis says the words push through the dream and its gone he waits for his throat to open up again so he can speak he says i think im haunted davis keeps his eyes locked on him i think so too he says beltrane cant think of what else to say his hand rubs absentmindedly over his chest he knows he cant see his daughter while this is happening to him i was haunted once too davis says quietly he opens a drawer in his desk and withdraws a pack of cigarettes he extends one to beltrane and keeps one for himself then the ghost went away beltrane stares at him with an awed hope as davis slowly fishes through his pockets for a lighter how you get rid of it davis lights both cigarettes beltrane wants to grab the man but instead he takes a draw and the nicotine hits his bloodstream a spike of euphoria rolls through him with a magnificent energy i dont want to tell you that davis says i want to tell you why you should keep it and why you shouldnt go see your daughter tomorrow beltranes mouth opens hes half smiling you crazy he says softly what do you think of when you think of new orleans he feels a cramp in his stomach his joints begin sending telegraphs of distress he cant let this happen fuck you im leaving davis is still as beltrane hoists himself out of his chair the shelter wont let you back in you said it yourself you gave up the bed when you left where are you going to go ill go to lilas it dont matter if its late shell take me in will she with streets winding through your body with lamps in your eyes with rain blowing out of your heart no she will slam that door in your face and lock it tight she will think she is visited by something from hell she will not take you in beltrane stands immobile one hand still clutching the chair his eyes fixed not on anything in this room but instead on that awful scene he hasnt seen lilas face in twenty years but he can see it now contorted in fear and disgust at the sight of him he feels something shift in his body something harden in his limbs he squeezes his eyes shut and wills his body to keep its shape please says davis sit back down beltrane sits youre in between places right now people think its the ghost that lives between places but its not its us tell me what you think of when you think of new orleans moving up st charles avenue beltrane arrived at the avenue pub which shed light onto the sidewalk through its open french doors and cast music and voices into the night he peered through the windows before entering to see who was working the good ones would let him come in have a few drinks the others would turn him away at the door forcing him to decide between walking all the way back down to the french quarter for his booze or just calling it a night and going back to his wrecked car at the cab station he was in luck it was john he stepped inside and was greeted by people calling his name he held up a hand in greeting getting into character this was a white bar there were certain expectations hed have to fulfill if he was going to get his drinks some college kidhe had short hair and always smelled of perfume he could never remember his namegrabbed his hand in a powerful squeeze trane my dog what up dude awright awright beltrane said letting the kid crush his hand it was going to hurt all night the kid yelled over the crowd yo john set me up one of them shots for trane here john smiled youre evil dude oh whatever man pour me one too i cant let him go down that road all by hisself beltrane maneuvered to an open spot at the bar beside a pretty white girl hed never seen before and an older guy wearing an electricians jumpsuit the girl made a disgusted noise and inched away from him the electrician nodded at him and said his name the college kid joined him in a moment with two milky gray shots in his hand he pushed the larger one at beltrane dude im worried bro i dont know if youre man enough for a shot like this shiiiit i a man this is a mans drink dog dats what i am i a man then do the shot he did the shot it tasted vile of course like paint thinner and yogurt they always gave him some horrible shit to drink but it was real booze and it slammed into his brain like a wrecking ball he coughed and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand the college kid slapped his back shit trane you okay i thought you said you was a man he tried to talk but he couldnt get his throat to unclench he ended up just waving his hand dismissively beltrane screwed a bleary eye in the bartenders direction who moved in a series of ripples and left a ghostly trail in his wake a beer seemed to sprout from the bar top like a weed he held out the bag of shrimp hed gotten earlier heat this up for me john when john came back a few minutes later with the bag beltrane said you seen ivy tonight she was here earlier you still trying to hit that you pervert beltrane just laughed he clutched his beer and settled into his customary reverie as bar life broke and flowed around him wrapping him in warmth like a slowmoving river he downed the shots as they appeared before him and concentrated on keeping them down somewhere in the drift of the night a girl materialized beside him her back half turned to him as she spoke with somebody on her other side she had a tattoo of a japanese print on her shoulder which dipped below the line of her sleeveless white shirt she was delicate and beautiful he brushed her arm with the back of his hand trying to make it seem accidental and she turned to face him hey trane she said her eyes shed a warm yellow light he wanted to touch her but there was a divide he couldnt cross we all gods children he said yeah i know she looked at the boy she was talking to and rolled her eyes when she looked at him again she had raised windows for eyes with curtains blowing out of them framing a yellowlit room below them her face declined in wet shingles flowing with little rivulets of rainwater it took him a moment to realize the water was flowing from inside her behind her her friend rose to his feet wood and plaster cracked and split as he stood his eyes were windows too but the lights there had been blown out water gushed from them the bar had gone silent in his peripheral vision he saw that he was ringed with wet shining faces a figure moved to the window in the girls face it was backlit he couldnt make out who it was water was rising around his feet soaking through his shoes making him cold davis says theres some people i want you to meet his voice is so soft beltrane can barely hear it davis is sitting on the edge of his desk looming over him his eyes are moist beltrane blinks i got to get out of here just wait please you cant keep me here i aint a prisoner no i know your your ghost is very strong ive never seen one that was a a city before beltrane is suddenly uncomfortable with daviss proximity to him what you doing this close back off a me man davis takes a deep breath and slides off his desk moving back to his side of it he collapses into his chair theres some people i want you to meet he says will you stay just a little bit longer the thought of going outside into this strange city does not appeal to beltrane he doesnt know the neighborhood doesnt know which places are safe for homeless people to go and which places are offlimitswhether due to police or thugs or just because its someone elses turf he was always safe in new orleans which he knew as well as he knew his own face but new places are dangerous you got another cigarette he says davis seems to relax a little and passes one to him after its lit beltrane says how come i cant get rid of it you can says davis its just that you shouldnt do you do you really know what a ghost is mr beltrane this must be where you start preaching a ghost is something that fills a hole inside you where you lost something its a memory sometimes it can be painful and sometimes it can be scary sometimes its hard to tell where the ghost ends and real life begins i know you know what i mean beltrane just looks away affecting boredom but he can feel his heart turning in his chest and sweat bristling along his scalp but if you get rid of it mr beltrane if you get rid of it you have nothing left he pauses you just have a hole beltrane darts a glance at him davis is leaning over his desk urgency scrawled across his face hes sweating too and his eyes look sunken as though someone has jerked them back into his head from behind his appearance unnerves beltrane and he turns away emptiness silence is that really better you need to think carefully about what you decide you can live without mr beltrane he pauses for a moment when beltrane stays silent he leans even closer and asks what do you really think is going to happen when you make that call tomorrow a cold pulse of fear flows through beltranes body but before he can think of a response a sound reaches them through the closed door people are entering the church from the street davis smiles suddenly its an artificial smile manic out of all proportion to any possible stimulus theyre here come on he leads him into the large room with the lectern and the rows of chairs two peoplea young slender latina woman and an older obese white manhave just entered and are standing uncertainly by the door although theyre dressed in simple cheap clothing its immediately obvious that theyre not homeless they both stare at beltrane as he approaches behind the pastor come on everybody davis says gesturing to the front row of chairs lets sit down davis arranges a chair to face them and soon they are all sitting in a clumsy circle these are the people i wanted you to meet he says this is maria and evan theyre haunted too maria tries to form a smile beneath eyes that are sunken and dark like moon craters or like cigarette burns she seems long out of practice evan is staring intently at the floor hes breathing heavily through his nose with a reedy pistoning regularity his forehead is glistening with sweat im trying to start a little group here you know people with your sort of problem this is how we gonna get rid of it beltrane asks davis and maria exchange glances they dont want to get rid of them davis says thats why theyre here he turns to the others mr beltrane came here from new orleans hes looking for his daughter maria gives him a crushed look oh pobrecito she says the news seems to affect her deeply her face clouds over and her eyes well up beltrane looks away embarrassed for her and ashamed at his own optimism his ghost is a city this seems to catch even evans attention who looks at him for the first time im the ghost of christmas past evan says and barks a laugh my family died in a fire two days after christmas the fucking tree its like a joke right davis pats evan on the knee well get to it my friend we will but first we have to help him understand right right but it wants to come out it wants to come out right now mr beltrane thinks he lost his city in the flood davis continues i did lose it beltrane shouts feeling both scared and angry to be among these people after katrina came i lost everything craig moved away after his place flooded places i go to are all shut down the people all gone ivy ivy she she was in this empty old house she used to crash in his throat closes and he stops there davis waits a moment then puts his hand on his shoulder but its not really gone though is it he touches beltrane on the forehead and then on his chest is it beltrane shakes his head and if it ever does go away well god help you then because you will be all by yourself you will be all alone he pauses you dont want that nobody wants that evan makes a noise and puts a hand over his mouth i had enough of this crazy shit beltrane says and stands davis opens his mouth but before he can speak the room is filled with the scent of cloves and cinnamon the effect is so jarring that beltrane nearly loses his balance evan doubles over in his seat hands over his face his big body shuddering with sobs the smell pours from him smoke leaks from between his fingers spreading in cobwebby wreaths over his head beltrane wants to run but hes never seen this kind of thing in anyone but himself before and hes transfixed oh here it comes davis says not to the others but to himself his eyes glassy and fixed staring at evan thats all right just let it out you have to let it come out you have to hold on to whats left never let it go he looks at maria can you feel him maria can you maria nods her eyes are filled with tears her hands are clutching her stomach and beltrane watches as it grows beneath them accompanied by a powerful sickly odor that he does not recognize right away when he does he feels a buckling inside the turning over of some essential organ or element and he is overwhelmed by a powerful need to flee will you get rid of this davis is saying his face so close to marias they might be lovers will you get rid of your child maria who could ask that of you who would dare beltrane backs up a step and falls over a chair sprawling to the floor in a clatter of noise and his own flailing arms theres a sudden spiking pain as his elbow takes the brunt of his weight the air grows steadily colder the appalling mix of cinnamon and desiccated flesh roots into his nose davis kneels between the others one hand touching each body and once again his features seem to be tugging inward even his round stomach is drawing in as though something empty some starving need is glutting itself on this weird energy as though theres a black hole inside him filling its belly with light please god just let it come davis says beltrane tries to scramble to his feet and slips a large growing puddle of mississippi river water surrounds him it soaks his clothes he tries again making it to his feet this time and staggers to the door he pushes his way outside into the warm humid night and without waiting to see if theyre following he lurches farther down the street away from the church away from the shelter until an alleyway opens like a throat and he turns gratefully into it he manages to make it a few more feet before he collapses to his knees he doesnt know anymore if the pain he feels is coming from arthritis or from the ghost which has wrapped itself like a vine around his bones across the alley in the alcove of a delivery door he sees a mound of clothing and a duffel bag this is somebodys roost a shadow falls over him as a figure stops in the mouth of the alley the city light makes a dark shape of it a negative space what you doin here it says beltrane closes his eyesan act of surrender i just restin man he says almost pleads i aint stayin you dont belong here come on man just let me rest a minute i aint gonna stay cant you see whats happening to me when he opens his eyes he is alone he exhales and it almost sounds like a sob i wanna go home he whispers i wanna go home he runs his hands through his hair dislodging drowned corpses which tumble into his lap beltrane left the avenue pub behind well and truly drunk walking slowly and carefully as the ground lurched and spun beneath him he summoned the presence of mind to listen for the streetcar which came like a bullet at night just last year it ran down a drunk coming from some bar farther up the road thats some messy shit he announced and laughed to himself the united cab offices were just a few blocks away if he hurried he could beat the rain halfway there he found ivy rooting lazily through a trash can she was a cute little thing whod shown up in town last year after fleeing some private doom in georgia she was forty years younger than beltrane but hope lived large in him they got along pretty wellshe got along well with most men reallyand it was always nice to spend time with a pretty girl he waved at her ivy hey girl she looked up at him her face empty sup trane what you doin she straightened and tossed a crumpled wrapper back into the can im goin to bed girl its late she appraised him for a moment then smiled you fucked up he laughed like a little boy caught in some foolishness she saw the bag he still clutched in his hand i aint had nothing to eat trane im starving he held the bag aloft like the head of a slain enemy i got some food for ya right here she held out a hand and offered him her best smile it lit up all that alcohol in him it set him on fire well give it over then she said you must think im crazy come on back with me to my place shit that old cab beltrane turned and walked in that direction listening to her footsteps as she trotted to catch up the booze in him caused the earth to move in slow steady waves and the lights to bleed into the cloudy night a cold wind had kicked up and the buildings swooned on their foundations together they trekked the short distance to united cab he found himself as always stealing glances at her though she was gaunt from deprivation she seemed to have an aura of carved nobility about her a hard beauty distinct from circumstance or prospect she was young enough too that she still harbored some resilient optimism about the world as though it may yet yield some good for her and who knows he thought maybe it would the first hard drops of rain fell as they reached the cab it had died where it was last parked two years ago it sagged earthward its tires long deflated and its shocks long spent so that the chassis nearly scraped the ground as beltrane opened the door and climbed in it smelled like fried food and sweat and he rubbed the old air freshener hanging from the rearview in some wild hope he could coax a little life from it yet the front seats had been taken out giving them room to stretch their legs the car was packed with blankets old newspapers and skin magazines ivy stared in after him wrinkling her nose this is it baby he said it stinks in here it aint that bad you get used to it he leaned against the seat back stretching his legs to the front he hooked one arm up over the backseat and invited her to lean into him she paused still halfway through the door on her hands and knees i aint fuckin you trane you too damn old shit girl he tried to pretend he wasnt disappointed get your silly ass in here and have some food she climbed in and he opened the bag for her the shrimp retained a lingering heat from the microwave at the pub and they dug in afterward with warm food alight in their bellies and the rain hammering on the roof she eased back against the seat and settled into the crook of his arm at last resting her head on his shoulder beltrane gave her a light squeeze realizing with a kind of dismay that any sexual urge had left him that the feeling he harbored for her now was something altogether different altogether better i dont know nothing about you trane she said quietly you dont talk very much what you mean im always talking yeah but you dont really talk you know like you got any family around well he said his voice trailing somewhere i got a little girl somewhere she lifted her head and looked at him for real he just nodded something about this conversation felt wrong but he couldnt figure out what it was the rain was coming down so hard it was difficult to focus i aint seen her in a long time she got married and went away she just abandon you thats fucked up trane i wasnt like this then things was different sorrow crested and broke in his chest she got to live her life she had to go you ever think about leaving too maybe you could go to where she live hell no girl this is my home this is everything i know its just a place trane you can change a place easy he didnt want to think about that anyway he said she forgot me by now ivy was quiet for a time and beltrane let himself be lulled by the drumbeat over their heads then she said i bet she aint forgot you she adjusted her position to get comfortable putting her head back on his shoulder i bet she still love her daddy they stopped talking and eventually she drifted off to sleep he kissed her gently on her forehead listening to the storm surrounding the car the air was chilly but their bodies were warm against each other outside was thrashing darkness and rain what hed said what what you want from me shed blinked tears from her eyes come with us im worried about whats gonna happen with you when im gone damn lila hed said turning away from her again you gone already beltrane awoke with a fearful convulsion the car was filling with water it was pouring from ivy from her eyes and her mouth from the pores of her skin in a black torrent lifting the stored papers and the garbage around them in swirling eddies rising rapidly over their legs and on up to their waists the water was appallingly cold he lost all feeling where it covered him he put his hands over ivys face to staunch the flow without effect her head lolled beside him her face discolored and grotesquely swollen he was going to drown the idea came to him with a kind of alien majesty he was overcome with awe and horror he pushed against the car door but it wouldnt open beyond the window the night moved with a murderous will it lifted the city by its roots and shook it in its teeth the water had nearly reached the ceiling and he had to arch his back painfully to keep his face above it ivy had already slipped beneath the surface her lamplit eyes shining like cave fish all thought left him his whole energy was channeled into a scrabbling need to escape he slammed his body repeatedly into the car door he pounded the glass with his fists beltrane awakens to pain his limbs are wracked with it his elbow especially he opens his eyes and sees the pavement of the alley climbing to his feet takes several minutes morning is near through the mouth of the alley the streetlights glow dimly against a sky breaking slowly into light there is no traffic and the salty smell of the bay is strong the earth has cooled in the night and the heats return is still a few hours away he takes a step toward the street then stops sensing something behind him he turns around a small city has sprouted from the ground in the night where hed been sleeping surrounded by blowing detritus and stagnant filth it spreads across the puddlestrewn pavement and grows up the side of the wall twinkling in the deep blue hours of the morning like some gorgeous fungus awash in a blustery evening rain it exudes a sweet necrotic stink hes transfixed by it and the distant wails he hears rising from it are a brutal beautiful lullaby he walks away from it when he gets to the street he turns left heading down to the small harbor the door to the church is closed when he passes it and the lights are off inside theres no indication of any life there soon he passes the shelter and there are people he recognizes socializing by its front door but he doesnt know their names and they dont know his they dont acknowledge him as he walks by he passes a little restaurant the smell of coffee and griddlecooked sausage hanging in front of it like a cloud the long white masts of the sailboats are peering over the tops of buildings he rounds a corner and he is there the water of the bay glimmers with bright shards of light as the sun climbs the boats jostle gently in their berths a pelican perches on a short pier wings spread like hanging laundry he follows a sidewalk along the waterfront until he finds a pay phone with a dial tone he presses zero and waits i wanna make a collect call he says fishing the slip of paper davis gave him out of his pocket and reciting the number he waits for the automated tone and announces himself its henry its your dad a machine says please hold while we connect your call leaning over the small concrete barrier he can see the shape of himself in the water his reflection is broken up by the waters movement small pieces of himself clash and separate he thinks that if he waits here long enough the water will calm and his face will resolve into something familiar a voice speaks into the silence filling it guns for the dead a graveminder story by melissa marr melissa marr is the author of the new york times bestselling wicked lovely series a film of which is in development by universal pictures and the forthcoming adult novel graveminder currently she lives in the washington dc area with one spouse two children two rottlabs and one rottweiler you can find her online at wwwmelissamarrcom at the sound of boots on the plank walkway outside her shop alicia closed the cash box and lifted the sawedoff shotgun from a modified undercounter rack shed hoped that the boys would be back by now but they werent daft enough to be walking in the front door of general supplies without calling out she swung the shotgun up as the door opened the owner of the boots stopped just inside the shop he was new enough that she didnt recognize him to his credit though he didnt flinch at the sight of her particular brand of customer service his gaze slipped briefly over the shop with curiosity the interior of the frontiertown general goods store seemed a little out of time to new arrivals over there more than a century had passed she thought about updating the look but the comforting familiarity of the drygoods shop outweighed her discomfort over revealing her age screw em with its tins and barrels glass cases and the wood floorboards it was home but clearly not what his home looked like the newcomer put his arms out to the sides demonstrating that he was either trustworthy or idiotic maam she took in his frayed jeans faded black tshirt combat boots and a relatively new revolver in a belt holster most of those items were commonplace here now shed even acquired shirts and boots much like his in recent years the holster he wore could be purchased in a dozen spots around the city but post weapons came from one shop onlyhers she pursed her lips since she didnt recognize him hed either taken it from a customer or bought it at significant upsale boyd sent me he said and she didnt lower her weapon there was something decidedly awkward about aiming a shotgun onearmed for any time at all but a businesswoman didnt greet strangers unarmed she stepped back andusing her free hand for leveragehopped up on the counter the newcomer raised his brows but his posture remained unchanged he said to tell you that the old bastard started trouble and that hell be out for a day huh alicia lowered the shotgun so it was aimed at the floor in front of her and where is boyd that youre delivering this message got shot she tensed by see thats the thing no she interrupted she slid off the counter and stepped forward simple question shug shot by whom me but there were circumst the rest of his words were lost under the shotgun blast she threw herself to the side as she fired hoping to dodge a return shot that didnt come when she realized that he hadnt even reached for his piece alicia rolled to her feet definitely a newcomer she stood and looked down at him his blood was leaking all over her floorboards and thats why we dont have carpet she sighed sometimes she had misplaced urges for finery that had no place in the shop maybe if it was a dark carpet she walked around the counter but not close enough that he could pull her to the ground injured or not he had a size advantage he looked up at her least it was a slug not scattershot you want to see whats in the second barrel she extended her arm and took aim but didnt fire whyd you shoot boyd had to the man said why she motioned with the gun the bleeder on her floor had his hands pressed over his leg wound if he was still alive hed be in a sorry state but being dead tended to change things in unpredictable ways from the way he pressed his hands down he was even newer than she thought getting used to living in the land of the dead took a little time i came looking for him to ask about you and things took a turn he said slowly alicia sighed i think youre going to need to start at the beginning aftershe looked pointedly at his beltyou slide that over here if i didnt reach for it when you shot me im not going to now he muttered but he still pulled the pistol out of the holster and held it out toward her buttfirst francis lee lemons stared at the woman who according to everyone hed met since he died ran the guns for the land of the dead and shot me he wanted a job straight up plain and simple he wanted to work for her hed never been on what one might call the right side of the law and he didnt see any need to change that now that he was in this odd afterlife getting along over here was a mite more brutal than in the living world but he figured that a familiarity with a lessthanupstanding lifestyle would be an asset maam alicia glanced at him but she didnt say anything would it offend you overmuch if i either took off my shirt to staunch this or asked for a bandage of some sort he asked as respectfully as he could you got any funds no maam job not yet he looked directly at her im in the middle of what i hope to be a promising interview though she snorted youre bleeding on my floorboards thats promising she walked over to a basket of rags that sat alongside the front counter and pulled out an obviously stained one she tossed it to him its not the cleanest but we dont get infections over here yes maam he tied it around his thigh arranging it so as to cover both the entrance and exit wounds alicia she said he looked up midknot if you know enough to apply for a job you already know my name she walked over and slid a bolt on the door and then proceeded to do the same at the shutters that covered the inside of the windows alicia she glanced back im frank well francis lee lemons but i dont care who you are yet shug she leaned against one of the large wooden casks in the corner talk so frank told her i took the revolver off a man in a game of darts too stupid to realize he could even be hustled at darts and im mostly honest but it seemed a wise plan to be armed around here you know alicia nodded found out who supplied it started asking about you and ended up at a weird bar with boyd what bar she prompted mr ds he paused but she didnt say anything so he kept going boyd was explaining that you were particular about who you took on lots of dead folks want a position on your team and not just anyone could meet up to make his case nervously frank looked at alicia but her expression was unreadable so he added the damning part but we were talking and then boyd suddenly says shoot me i didnt think i heard right he repeated it again shoot me right here he pointed right at his forehead now then go find alicia he told me to tell you what i did when i walked in quietly alicia asked what did you do frank had a fleeting wish that hed kept his gun then but he answered her in a steady voice exactly what he said why instinct frank shrugged i dont know really he seemed sober sane as anyone else here and i know hes your righthand man and i want this job and i didnt know what else to do so i did what he said i should good enough alicia reached behind a tin on one of the shelves next to her and grabbed a revolver she tossed it at him lets go he caught it and checked the chamber you in the habit of throwing loaded guns you expected to do me any good with an unloaded piece alicia cocked her head frank glanced at his leg before answering if i had to but not right this minute call it part of the interview alicia held up a hand and started ticking things off on her fingers assuming youre telling the truth i know you listened to boyd and you reacted well to stress thats two since you got here youre not bitching over that scrape she gestured at his bloody thigh now you caught and flipped the gun in your hand like youre comfortable she held her hand out to him and helped him to his feet tells me you have potential frank swallowed against the sting of putting weight on his leg he knew he was dead now but he wasnt sure what happened when the dead were shot can i die more he looked at his blood on their clasped hands obviously the dead bled he asked did i kill boyd boyds been dead almost a century she pulled her hand free of his and wiped it on another rag she grabbed out of the basket not real sure on that whole reincarnation thing she tossed the rag to frank frank stared at her for several moments before saying here did i kill him here alicia reached up and patted his cheek sweetie only one man around here can kill the dead whos that the man who were going to seethe old bastard mr d she tucked his revolver in her own holster slung her shotgun over her shoulder and walked to the door as they walked through the city alicia slowed her pace a little for him getting shot wasnt fatal here but it still hurt like a bitch frankie lee she hadnt heard that anyone was asking about her but hed found boyd knew she was the one that ran the black market and managed to get a meeting with boyd that meant that frankie lee was stealthy she glanced at him his lips were pursed and he was limping a bit but all things considered he was holding up fairly well for having a hole in his thigh how long you been dead frankie lee frowned i dont know week or two i guess well heres your newcomer welcome information frankie lee frank he interjected alicia ignored him the grand pain in everyones ass around here is charles the old bastard and i have a regular conflict she reached into one of her trouser pockets and pulled out a couple pills take these frankie lee obediently swallowed them he didnt ask what they were and she didnt tell him hed figure it out soon enough when his leg stopped hurting as they walked through the evershifting city a few people glanced their way they were in one of the sections that remained steadfastly not modern it was a bit cleaner than the way her experience of liveworld equivalent was but it was comforting all the same alicia had adjusted to the appearance of new sections in the city blocks that belonged to eras that happened after she was already dead but she felt ill at ease around flappers orworse stillthose cookiebaking alwayssmiling women not as sweet as they act either else theyd have moved past here mr waverly tipped his hat to her one of the tadlock sisters tilted her ridiculous parasol so she couldnt see them millicent alicia called out to her and predictably the woman had a sudden urge to dart into a milliners shop she was from alicias own era and clung to the notion that ladies shouldnt acknowledge ruffians it didnt stop her from buying the derringer she no doubt had in her handbag alicia and frankie lee crossed a street separating the s and early s shops and one of the young newshounds came scurrying into their path who shot you mister are you going to go settle up with them alicia nope is he the boy pestered dont know are you frankie lee she glanced at him he frowned at her no and no one calls me that its that or francis she smiled your choice after a pause he nodded not francis frankie lee isnt going to settle up with the one that shot him thats all you get for now she shooed the newshound out of the street once the boy was gone she resumed her version of a newcomers talk charles thinks my organization is crude hes a despot dictator really no free trade no modernizing the city if he had his way women would all be relegated to arm candy or other foolishness he builds what he wants when he wants makes the laws he wants and were just to be content with whatever he creates and you im not content she scowled at one of the moremodern dead men soliciting a couple of the silly flapper girls who liked to linger near the century line one of charless people stepped in so she kept going grudgingly she told frankie lee charles maintains some parts of the city well but hes stuck on the idea of empires i dont agree so its political differences frankie lees tone did little to hide his surprise alicia laughed not entirely im here im staying here and im not his subject i didnt fare well when i was under his authority memories of her life of a time when she trusted charles flooded her a long time ago she lived for charles here well she might still exist because of himexcept now it was to thwart him not to help him i have a financial interest in my politics she walked a little faster and thanks to her medicinal aid frankie lee kept pace guns in the land of the dead are the main source of my livelihood the more modern the better because of a loophole theres a man and a woman from the living world who can come over here i got myself in the habit of bartering with the undertaker so he buys my help with the things he brings in the old bastard cant stop the undertaker from supplying my prototypes and once i get models of new gear i can replicate some of it which im guessing he dislikes got it in one alicia didnt like taking on new people very often her business required a particular skill set that lots of folks thought they had but there was a significant difference between wearing badass as a costume and being the real deal any manor womancould throw on the right clothes whichever era they preferred and posture no amount of leather or sharp suits equaled true grit frankie yesm he kept a rolling pace now but his attention was on the side streets rather than on her whether shed ordered it or not he was standing guard what did you do when you were alive she held up a hand signaling him to wait for the train the conductor took pleasure at running silent in hopes of plowing over newcomers frankie lee shrugged i did work for hire last few years grew up around guns no explosives skills or anything fancy but im a quick study i do alright in close situations decent trigger man if you need it seemed to fare well enough at observation they pay well for that topside these days sometimes if youre good enough i was good enough most of the time butfrankie lee gave her a wry smilenot the last time alicia closed her eyes against the gust of air as the train passed in front of them it used be the train but the conductor moved it up one minute each month as far as calendars went shed heard of worse it certainly proved incentive to keep track of the month howd you end up qualified she asked my mama enlisted out of high school and she got sore over the things she wasnt allowed to do so she taught me and my sisters all that she did learn and then we all four learned what she wasnt taught frankie lees upuntilthen calm faltered he was good at what she needed but he wasnt unnecessarily coldwhich was an asset in her book a coldhearted employee was a different sort of problem than one that was all sass and no ass the right sort of associate was neither too cocky nor too cruel your mama sounds like a smart woman alicia stepped into the street and frankie lee followed she was but my sistersll look out for her well enough shes not big time but she has connections enough that she does alright for herself alicia figured the sideways scowls that more than a few of the upstanding citizens sent her way were clue enoughwell that and the fact that he was limping because shed shot himbut she figured it was only proper to fill him in you do get that im not exactly on the right side of the law here no disrespect alicia but i doubt you could be any less lawabiding than my mama was and i dont think the law here is necessarily one im after following he motioned toward a glass door with mr ds tiptop tavern painted on it this is where we were alicia grabbed the brass bar that served as a door handle and yanked the door open before he could open it for her lets see how well you follow orders frankie lee frank walked into the shadowed interior of the tavern twice in almost as many hours he already knew that it was a wideopen club exposed pipes ran the length of the ceiling no alcoves to hide in round tables with varying numbers of highbacked chairs were spread throughout the room far enough apart at places that a private conversation was possible the biggest risk was the curtained doorway beside the bar it would allow cover to sight down on any of the customers with either a rifle or a handgun depending on who minded whatever space was on the far side of that curtain without asking he knew that alicia was well aware of the same threat shed paused swept the room seeking someone or maybe just assessing threats then she swung her shotgun from where shed carried it over her shoulder and held it barreldown as they walked into the room dont say anything unless i tell you to she murmured frank nodded at the dead middle of the room alicia stopped pumped her shotgun and aimed it at the baby grand piano on the stage in front of them all around them people stood and walked out no one ran no one said anything they merely stood pushed in their chairs and headed toward the exit once the room was cleared of everyone but the bartender alicia winked at frank and then shot a pipe that was just to the left of the stage steam hissed from it id like to talk she called the barmaid caught franks gaze and widened her eyes imploringly he didnt think she was in any real danger though alicia seemed to be concentrating on the piano she shot a second pipe this time water sluiced from the fragmented pipe it didnt pour down on the piano but it was very close something shorted sparked and smoked off to the side of the stage a man came from behind the curtained doorway he carried himself with the easy confidence of someone whos always been obeyedand had the power and money to keep it that way he wore an oldfashioned dark gray suit broken up by the scarlet of his tie and his pocket square we have telephones here alicia telegraphs too he shook his head and then turned his attention to frank francis i see youve met my dear alicia is she helping you get your sea legs frank didnt reply aaaah already on her payroll the man tsked with your mothers influence one would expect as much i suppose as i doubt alicia will introduce ushe touched his fingertips to his chest lightlyi am charles how does he know about my family alicia dropped her shotgun on the table looked over her shoulder at frank and said go on up to the bar and grab me a drink he raised his brows at her but kept his mouth shut she nodded and turned back to charles leave frankie lee out of it frank walked over to the polished wooden bar by the time he got there the barmaid already had two highball glasses and a wineglass out she filled two glasses with bourbon and the third with some sort of wine the wine is for the boss he looked at her my boss she corrected and he carried the three drinks back over to the table as he approached alicia poked charles in the chest you cant bully boyd hes mine at what point did you gain any authority in my domain you live in my city because i allow it charles nodded absently to frank and took a seat alicia grabbed one of the glasses from frank and upended it her shotgun lay like a line bisecting the table make me leave then charles remained silent he sipped his drink and stared at alicia who now stood with her hands on her hips not knowing what else to do frank handed his drink to alicia and stood to the side so she could draw without interference and he could still be there if she needed help something older than logic told him that charles for all of his polish wasnt the sort of man whod go down easy in a fight even as he thought it charles smiled at him youll do just fine around here francis alicia tensed and frank said the only thing he could think of in the moment my name is frankie lee sir alicia grinned frankie lee was going to work out just fine i dont want semiautomatic weapons on my street alicia charles motioned at the seat across from him i overlook a lot but there are limits i explained that to boyd last week on this i will crush you she sat and motioned for frankie lee to do the same she tried the same argument that usually worked i dont see why these no not this time i play by the rules that means here and there youll outmaneuver me on this its not going to be anytime soon i overlook revolvers but thats where we are staying the damage the loss of life i cant explain it charles looked genuinely sad but she knew well enough that the old bastard was able to fake emotions you have been out of that world for years alicia dead because you had me killed she corrected beside her frankie lee tensed but he stayed silent true charles sipped his wine ill negotiate or ill start killing your boys permanent death so as theyll be removed from the city alicia paused and me charles leaned back in his seat i wont kill you you know that again say it at least you wont kill me again i wont kill you again butcharles glanced at frankie leeill kill him boyd milt each and every one you employ charles made a comehither gesture one of her information runners lewis was brought in you all exist because i allow it you can die because i prefer it no semiautomatic weapons alicia you will agree to stop pushing this matter charles said softly or he dies she started im not going to give in because of a threat charles fixed his gaze on her and snapped his fingers lewis crumpled there are always unbreakable rules right now this is one of them and you of all people know that i will do what i must to enforce the unbreakable rules alicia looked at lewis where do they go if they die in the land of the dead shed asked that question often enough but charles never answered no automatic weapons for how long you have no room to barter charles said she suppressed a shiver at the threat in his voice just checking the rules thirty years we can renegotiate then thirty years alicia agreed but you owe me a replacement or undo what you did to lewis for a moment charles was silent then he nodded and said i cant undo his death but as a gesture of good faith ill allow you to take one of the staff to replace your employee alicia kept her expression bland but she felt the wave of sorrow that shed been resisting charles had finally answered her some deaths apparently were even fatal enough that they were out of his reach shed known there were other dead cities and hoped that those who didnt reanimate here went to another world a world where they were happier she knew such worlds existed her own loved ones had gone on to them shed hoped though that the dead folk who were rekilled here went on to other dead worlds but if that were the case charles could have undone lewiss death lewis is dead thinking about the metaphysics of living in the land of the dead made her head hurt so she didnt lewis is dead because i pushed charles too far the same trait that had made her good at opposing charles both before and after her death got lewis killed silently alicia walked over to the bar and accepted the drink the barmaid held out as she approached behind her charles said shall i invite my staff here or would you deign to visit my home without looking back at him she said here an hour later frankie lee watched as several dozen people tromped into the room beside him alicia sat with her boots propped on the table as one of themthe only one charles said was off limitstold alicia their names and roles charles had cooks maids barmaids singers a personal tailor and god knew how many other employees frankie lee tuned most of it out after the first fifteen minutes finally alicia pointed toward a young woman ill take her charles frowned there are others no her alicia folded her arms over her chest shes not suited for your sort of work alicia perhaps steven hes handy with some sort of martial art or elizabeth shes an accomplished companion charles gestured toward a pretty redhead no why charles asked the smile alicia offered was as frightening as her glare im a good judge of character you softened at the sight of her charles frowned at alicia what kind of job do you have for a singer im sure ill find a good use for her alicias boots thunked to the floor as she stood i expect her and boyd delivered to the inn frank felt a twinge of worry for the girl as apparently did charles however charles merely inclined his head slightly and then walked out once charles and his people had all left alicia glanced at frankie lee lets go what will you do with her he asked alicia leaned as close as she could get without her lips touching his and whispered dont ask questions i dont feel like answering he hadnt ever been intimidated by much but he knew when to have a healthy respect for a predator alicia was definitely on the predator list and maybe her attitude should intimidate him shed shot him when he walked in her door shot up the tavern and in general seemed pretty quick on the trigger frank could hear his mothers voice in his memories dont poke a rattler francis no matter how contrary youre feeling good sense keeps a person alive he grinned he was already dead now and by the way alicia had reacted to lewiss death frank was pretty sure that the permanent sort of death was rare i suspect youre aiming to intimidate me i probably should step back butfrank stood up invading her space as he did soive grown up with hardass women tell me what you have in mind for the girl please charles likes her he wont strike her easily and ive been thinking about ways to spruce up the inn hes a pushover for music so she must be good we cater to a rougher crowd so its a highrisk spot i cant lure his favorites away but this time alicia shrugged she can work at my inn and shell be safe because charles is fond of her and aside from the people who work for me no one crosses him smart frank smiled at her and they walked toward the door i think ill like working for you who says youre hired frank opened the door all the same i might as well walk back that way alicia laughed and together they crossed the weird city in comfortable silence once the general store was in view she linked her arm with his you did good work thank you alicia she stopped in the street i guess you ought to go home home alicia gestured at the inn across the street an unknown man stood at the door watching them milt will give you a key to whichever rooms yours its not fancy but its ours ours frank repeated i do try to take care of whats mine frankie lee im sorry about lewis she nodded you might get truly killed working for me ill need to be telling the rest of the boys later but before you decide decided when we were there frank shrugged i like having a family yours feels like home to me thank you alicia smiled then and added guess your interview was promising after all frank chuckled yes maam he had a healing gunshot wound in his thigh a job and a home all told frankie lee figured that it was the best day hed had since he died being dead wasnt anything like the preacher said it would be but considering the life frankie lee had led that wasnt such a bad thing he nodded his head at his boss and headed off to find his room frankie lee he paused and looked at her is it as bad as all that over there she asked haltingly its been a while since i was alive frankie lee thought about the bullets that had ended his own life a bullet is a bullet the difference was how many of them tore into him that day he shrugged i wont be eager for those thirty years to end oh alicia faltered but it lasted only a moment before she said maybe itd be good for you to tell me whats new over there in the living world i cant take care of everyone if im out of touch and frankie lee saw the side of his boss that proved he had done right by trusting his guts alicia was good people he kept his smile subdued and nodded youre the boss i am alicia agreed before going back into the general store for a minute frankie lee stood there looking at the strange pioneerera building and then out over the city where a towering castle loomed eras clashed and coexisted nothing at all like the preacher said it wasnt the life hed known or the afterlife hed expected but he couldnt wipe the grin off his face some things were constant finding a place where a person belonged a job that made a man feel good about himself and a boss he could respectthose were the keys to a happy life or a happy afterlife in this

population to enter with room enough inside for all hands to dance the twist in average nightclub proximity buckminster fuller day and night the jetliners come in to idlewild fully packed and fly out again empty then the arrivals have to get into the city from the airportsspecial trains and buses have been laid on of course day and night crossing into the city limits and returning empty bean cans whose beans have been poured out but the waits are long the army of organizers and dispatchers who have been recruited from around the world for this jobselfless patient as saints minds like adding machines yet still liable to fainting fits or outbursts of rage god bless them only human after allmeet and meet and sort and sort the incomers into neighborhoods into streets in those neighborhoods addresses floors rooms they have huge atlases and records supplied by the city government exploded plans of every building they pencil each room and then mark it in red when fully occupied still there are far too many arriving to be funneled into town by that process and thousands maybe tens of thousands finally set out walking from the airport its easy enough to see which way to go especially people are walking who walk anyway in their home places bare or sandaled feet on dusty roads with children in colorful slings at their breasts or bundles on their headsthose are the pictures you see in the special editions of life and look tall watusis and small people from indochina and peru just walking and the sunset towers they go toward how beautiful they are patient unsmiling in their native dress the family of man we have set out walking too but from the west weve calculated how long it will take from our home and weve decided that it cant take longer than the endless waits for trains and planes and buses to say nothing of the trip by car no matter how often weve all been warned not to do it forbidden to do it but who can turn them back once theyve set out people have been piling into their station wagons and sedans loading the trunks with coolers full of sandwiches and pop a couple of extra jerricans of gasabout a dollar a gallon most placesand setting out as though on some happy expedition to the national parks now those millions are coming to a halt from new jersey north as far as albany and south to philadelphia a solid mass of them like the white particles of precipitate forming in the beaker in chemistry class drifting downward to solidify then you have to get out and walk anyway the sandwiches long gone and the trucks with food and water far between no weve left the valiant in the carport and were walking just our knapsacks and identification living off the land and the kindness of strangers there was a story in my childhood a paradox or a joke which went like this suppose all the chinamen have been ordered to commit suicide by jumping off a particular cliff into the sea they are to line up single file and each take his or her turn every man woman and child jumping off one after the other and the joke was that the line would never end for the jumpingoff of so many would take so long even at a minute a person that at the back of the line lives would have to be led by those waiting their turn and children would be born and more children and children of those children even so that the line would go on and people would keep jumping forever this no this wouldnt take forever there was an end and a terminus and a conclusion there was a finite number to accommodate in a finite spacethat was the pointthough of course there would be additions to the number of us along the way that was understood and accounted for the hospital spaces of the city have been specially set aside for motherstobe nearing term and anyway how much additional space can a tiny newborn use up in those hospitals too are the old and the sick and yes the dying its appalling how many will die in this city in this time the entire mortality of earth a number not larger than in any comparable period of course maybe less for that matter because this city has some of the best medical care on earth and doctors and nurses from around the world have also been assigned to spaces in clinics hospitals asylums overwhelmed as they might be looking over the sea of incapacity as though every patient who ever suffered there has been resurrected and brought back holloweyed gasping unable to ambulate but they are there thats what were not to forget they are all there with us taking up their allotted spacesor maybe a little more because of having to lie down but never mind theyll all be back home soon enough they need to hang on just a little longer and every one who passes away before the termination the all clear whatever its to be calledwill be replaced very likely by a newborn in the ward next door and what about the great ones of the world the leaders and the presidentsforlife and the field marshals and the members of parliaments and presidiums have they really all come if they have we havent been informed of itof course there are some coming with their nations but the chance of being swallowed up amid their subjects or constituents suffering whoknowswhat indignities and maybe worse has perhaps pushed a lot of them to slip into the city unobserved on special flights of unmarked helicopters and so on to be put up at their embassies or at the plaza or the americana or in the vast apartments of bankers and arms dealers on park avenue surely they have left behind cohorts of devoted followers henchmen whatever men who can keep their fingers on the red button or their eyes on the skies just in case it has all been a trap but we have to be realistic not every goatherd in macedonia every bushman in the kalahari is going to be rounded up and they dont need to be for this to workyou can call your floor thoroughly swept even if a few twists of dust persist under the couch a lost button beneath the radiator the best is the enemy of the good hes an engineer he must know that and it is working they are filling from top to bottom all the great buildings the graybar building the pan am building cyanamid american metal climax the empire statea crowd of dutch men and women and children fill the souvenir shop at the top of the empire state building milling handling the small models glass metal plastic of the building they are in the metropolitan museum is filling as though for a smashhit opening van gogh rembrandt the modern as for a pollack retrospective or op art show there is even champagne how is it that certain people have managed to gather with people like themselves as on fifth avenue at the catholic diocesan headquarters scribners bookshop the university club whereas old st patricks is crowded with just everybodies as though they had all come together to pray for rain in a drought or to be safe from an invading army they are the invading army we know so little really plodding along footsore and amazed and yet strangely elated among the millions the river of humanity as ed sullivan said in his last column in the daily news before publishing was suspended for the duration the broad streets broadway just filled all the way across with persons a river breaking against the fronts of the dispatcher stations streams diverted uptown which is north more or less downtown which is south and now the flood is at last beginning to lessen to loosen a vortex draining away into the shops and the apartments the theaters and the restaurants she and i have received our assignment the building is in manhattan below houston street which we have learned divides the newer parts of the city from the older parts though old greenwich village is mostly above it and all of wall street is below it we would like to have been ushered down that far to find a space for ourselves in one of those titans of steel and glass where perhaps we could look out at the statue of liberty and the emptied world we were surprised to find we both wished for that id have thought shed want a small brownstone townhouse on a shady street anyway its neither of those its a little loft on the corner of spring street and lafayette street an old triangular building just five stories tall looking down on us from the windows on the east side of the street as we walk that way are italian men and women not people just arrived from italy but the families who live in those places for thats little italy there and the plump women in housedresses black hair severely pulled back and the young men with razorcut hair and big wristwatches are the tenants there theyre waving and shouting comments down to the crowd endlessly passing friendly comments or maybe not so friendly hostile even maybe their turf invaded not the right attitude for now but here we are number we wait our turn to go in and up stairs to the third floor it seems artists now live in the building they are allowed to painters we smell linseed oil and canvas sizing our artist is lean scrawny almost his space nearly empty canvases leaning against the wall their faces turned away we look downmaybe shyand can see in the cracks of the old floorboards what she says are metal snaps snaps for clothing from the days when clothes were made here by immigrants our artist is either happy to see us or not happy excited and irritated thats probably universal we are all cautious about saying anything much to him or to one another after all he didnt invite us okay okay he keeps saying is that dark brooding resentful girl in the black leotard and capezios his girlfriend well better here than in some vast factory floor in the borough of queens or train shed in long island city or out on staten island not much different from where we come from the ferries are leaving from manhattans tip for staten island every few minutes packed with people to the gunwales or the scuppers or whatever those outside edges are called worlds cheapest ocean voyage they say just a nickel to cross the whitecapped bay lady liberty ellis island deserted and derelict over that way where once before the millions came into new york city to be processed and checked and sent out into the streets the teeming streets i lift my lamp beside the golden door for a moment thinking of that looking down at those little metal snaps that slipped from womens fingers fifty sixty years ago it all seems to make sense a human experiment a proof of something finally and deeply good about us and about this city though we dont know what not exactly its the last day the last evening were lucky to have arrived so late there wont be problems with food supplies or sleeping arrangements that others are having the plan has worked so smoothly all the populations are being accommodated there are fights and resistance reported in various locations but these are being handled by the large corps of specially trained minimally armed personsnot police not soldiers for the police forces and the armies were the first to arrive and be distributed for obvious reasonsbecause they could be ordered to and because of what they might do if left behind till last and now its done everywhere in every land palm and pine the planners and directors and their staffs have taken off their headsets removed the reels of tape from the ranks of computers huge as steel refrigerators shut down their telephone banks and telex machinesa network of information tools reaching around the world whose only goal has been this this night they have boarded the last s to leave bombay leningrad johannesburg and been taken just like all the others to the airports in new jersey and long island and when they have deplaned the crews too leave the airplanes parked and take the last buses into the city checking their assignments with one another jokingpilots and stewies theyre used to bunking in strange cities when the buses have been emptied the drivers turn them off and leave them in the streets head for the distribution centers for assignments last of all the dispatchers all done they can hardly believe it not an hours sleep in twentyfour their ad hoc areas littered with coffee cups telexes phone slips fanfold paper cartons from the last chinese restaurants they gather themselves and go out into the bright streetsthe grid is holdingand they take themselves to wherever they have assigned themselves not far because theyre walking all the trains and taxis have stopped no one left to ride or drive them they mount the stairs or take the elevators up to where they are to go its done the streets now empty and silent the city holds its breath they will say later in our loft space we have been given our drinks and our canapÃ©s its not silent here we allow ourselves to joke about it about our being here we demand fancy cocktails or a floor show but in a justkidding wayactually its strangely hard to mingle she and i stick together but we often do that at parties we stand at the windows we think they look toward the southeast in the direction of most of the worlds population though we cant see anything not even the night sky every window everywhere is lit but think of the darkness now over all the nightside of earth the primeval darkness for all the lights out there have been turned off or not turned on perhaps not all but so many the quiet of all that world around the earth and back again almost to here where we stand this little group of islands these buildings alight and humming you can almost hear the murmur and the milling of the people he was right it could be done he knew it could be and it has been weve done it theres a kind of giddy pride overpopulation is a myth there are so few of us compared to spaceship earths vastness we can feel it now for certain in our hearts we hear it with our senses butmany many others must just now be thinking it tootheres more for now the whole process must be reversed and they we have to go home again to our home places spacious or crowded and wont we all remember this wont we think of how for a moment we were all together so close a brief walk or a taxi ride all that separates any one of us from any other and wont that change us in ways we cant predict did he expect that did he think of it did he know it would happen moonfaced little man in his black hornrims had he known this from the start one final test one final proof only remains weve received our second drink at the turntable our host places the on the spindle and lets it drop in every space in the city just at this moment the same on every record player over every loudspeaker the needle rasps in the groovemaybe theres a universal silence for a moment an expectant silence maybe notand then the startlement of music that voice crying out strangely urgent almost pleading with us to take his hand and go like this alone together in the quiet world the nations begin to twist noble rot by holly

the good neighbors with ted naifeh she lives in amherst massachusetts with her husband theo in a house with a secret library agatha picks up the paper bag off of the counter grease has already soaked through the bottom she hates this job but not as much as the one before this one when she worked as a janitor and the night watchman kept asking her for neck massages or the one before that where she washed endless stacks of dishes shes tired of moving so much tired of crappy jobs but that doesnt mean that she will stop stopping means going home which means she cant stop its the rock star john the bosss son says holding out a receipt with an address on it your boyfriend johns younger than she ismaybe too young to work as much as he doesbut hes the only one who can translate stuff into korean

for his food i delivered to him once says john i dont care how much you loved his music its not worth it that guy is creepy his music was pretty good she says but he just shrugs because hes already answering the phone and scratching out the next order she passes the corner eleven flashing with neon its parking lot crowded with cars kids from long branch and deal and elberon looking to buy drugs partiers spilling from clubs or just pausing to flirt in person after a slow cruise down main street tattoos wrap around their arms and fabric sticks to their skin her stomach growls over the sticky sweet reek of spilled slurpees she can smell the salty air blowing off the sea it gets on everything tangling her hair and dusting her skin as she unlocks her bike a discarded newspaper warns of a fresh grave dug up in the mount calvary cemetery and a body chewed on by dogs once asbury park was a resort city to tempt presidents with its glittering hotels and merrygorounds housed in fantastical buildings with sculpted medusa faces making the spines of the windows after those days faded the city was at least a place that turned out rock starssouthside johnny and the asbury jukes springsteen bon jovi colin lainhartall of them playing the stone pony before going on to take over the world now colin lainhart is dying in a cavernous loft and speculation about a marauding pack of corpseeating dogs is the only thing worth putting on the front page she bikes to one of the row houses near the boardwalk despite the influx of renovators and bright rainbow flags hanging from freshly painted houses the block is still kind of shady guys sitting on their stoops call to her when she passes she reminds herself that the guys are probably harmlesstheir faces are leathery with drugs and ageand shes stronger than she looks faster too after she locks the bike to a telephone pole she takes the bag out of the basket its so soaked that the brown paper tears when her fingers touch it but she can still carry it if shes careful she hits the doorbell and waits for colin lainhart to buzz her in johns wrong about him being creepy colin lainhart has cancer or something and hes lonely but thats all sometimes she can smell the illness on him devouring him from the inside and he doesnt ask her to do anything bad most of the time shes not even sure he notices shes there agatha takes the stairs hey she calls the inside of the loft has no walls once colin told her that he and his wife tore them out planning to restore it but they only got as far as putting in the electric before he got sick the wires are exposed running back and forth along joists like veins agatha read that hed met his wife when they were both addicts supposedly he was the reason she finally went to rehab theres a famous picture of her from back then that agatha saw in a magazine somewherestringy brightred hair with heavy black roots knees skinned vomiting her guts onto a street in tokyo she wants to ask colin about that about the pictures of him with loads of curling dark hair and a hungry smile but he doesnt seem like he knows the man in those photos she didnt like his music when she was younger it bothered her the way that it seemed like colins songs were carefree but if you listened to the words they were about despair and death and misery it made her feel like she was being tricked like he was laughing at the audience when he sang agathas best friend when she was eleven selena was obsessed with his songs selena played them over and over again until agatha finally admitted they were good they were good she just didnt like how they made her feel his hair is growing back a thin dusting on his head but his cheeks look hollowed out hes as thin as if he were made of twigs his black tshirt hangs in folds off his shoulders in the dim light from the bare bulbs on the ceiling she has never been able to tell what color his eyes are in the old pictures of him they were beachglass green cashs on the table he says his throat sounds scraped raw all around him are cardboard boxes of vinyl records some of them are opened and discs surround him on the sofa in haphazard piles the sofa is a beautiful thing part sleek black tufted leather but with silver coffin trimmings it had come with the records and a few boxes of other things his wife no longer wanted after the divorce she got the apartment in the city and a lot of his money but he still has enough that he can just stare out the massive wall of windows overlooking the sea or at his tiny blackandwhite television order chinese and wait to die i know she says setting down the bag carefully on a box near where hes sitting i took an extra twenty youre an excellent tipper do you want some lo mein he asks she hasnt taken any money yet but she knows where he keeps ita lacquered box on the makeshift table she doubts he counts it she could probably take eighty bucks a hundred all of it without him noticing you shouldnt let people take advantage of you he shrugs she goes into the kitchen gets out two bowls and brings them to the bag of food he forks out noodles and hands her the bigger bowl how come you always eat at night she asks him i got used to it on the road he says and smiles a little hes easy to be around he has kind eyes once a day like a snake she picks up the controller and turns on the television flicking through the channels they watch a reality television show where a guy from a glamrock hair band has to pick a girlfriend colin laughs every time the guy talks to the camera because colin knows him and cant believe how normal the show has made him seem there was this one time that we were opening for him and after we get offstage theres this delay his whole band is onstage but not him mr lainhart says during the commercial break the tour manager had already gotten into plenty of fights and doesnt want another one so he sends me back to his dressing room and you know what hes doing agatha shakes her head hes got one of those tiny cocktail stirrers and hes down in the corner of his dressing room with two naked groupies snorting up lines of live ants ants as in bugs agatha asks him ant ants he laughs a little which makes him cough yeah the really tiny ones sugar ants im glad that he didnt try for a big black carpenter ant that thing would have chewed off his nose she leans back against the leather so whats the sickest thing youve ever done anything sicker than the ants pissandvodka shots he says it so matteroffactly that she bursts out laughing whose she asks him scandalized now hes laughing so hard that he sounds like hes choking mine he finally chokes out what kind of guy do you take me for i wouldnt drink someone elses piss he eventually manages to tell her the story about a town in indiana where there was a little bar and he and his bandmates and his wife nancy were all drinking there after a show and some grizzled old badass goaded himand the rest of the band with the exception of the drummerinto a drinking contest that turned both nasty and brutally competitive i didnt even win he says nancy did she could drink more than any guy ive been there agatha says when shes stopped laughing the town anyway not the bar he looks at her you always say that youve been everywhere how come you move around so much im an adventurer she says no really he says you sound like me when i was your age i left home when i was thirteen she says with a shrug and i wear out my welcome elsewhere pretty fast too now you really sound like me he says its funny that we never ran into each other in any of those places they eat their lo mein in the flickering light of the television even though colin complains that he cant taste anything anymore by the time agatha leaves shes hungry again when colin moves he can feel his chalky bones grinding together his sinews feel limp and he worries that his veins are liquefying inside him his head is swollen his brain throbbing as though there is a cyst growing ready to crack open his skull and birth some foul goddess for months he hasnt been hungry but today he feels ravenous too tired to call for food he eats leftovers and crackers that scrape his throat and the last spoonfuls of a pint of diet ice cream that nancy left even though its rimed with frost he has stopped the treatments but only because the doctors told him there was no more they could do when nancy left him she said it wasnt because he was sick but because hed given up she needed him to be a fighter she needed death not to get him down hed said he wanted to fight but maybe he didnt fight hard enough a door slams downstairs and a mans voice screams slut slutty slut slut his neighbors are both out in the street you are so selfrighteous shouts the other man like you never theres a crash like hollow metal hitting concrete trash can colin lainhart believes his neighbors are in love theyre always yelling down staircases always throwing one anothers things out the window and onto the sidewalk always storming out colin thinks they fight a lot harder to be in love than he ever fought the cancer he wonders how long it will be until agatha comes and brings him dinner he feels like a dog that scratches at the door waiting to be walked waiting to be fed he can tell that she has no idea hes only ten years older than she is sickness has made him ancient sometimes he wants to beg her to stay a little longer but he doesnt want to disturb the illusion that she likes him he doesnt want her to have to spell it out i am just taking pity on you my mother used to listen to your music the phone rings and by the time he answers it he is already tired colin the voice is familiar but he cant place it yes he says its mark i know colin says ashamed that for a moment he didnt mark is his lawyer his college roommate and famously the guy who let colin sleep on his couch while colin recorded most of his first album youve got to get out of that town mark says mark is full of dire pronouncements like if you dont freeze her bank account youll lose everything or if you dont come back to the city now youll become a crazy hermit mark was also disappointed when colin stopped fighting colin laughs seriously mark says its all over the papers some kind of necrophilianecrophagia cult going on down there something crashes outside and colin smiles against the phone hoping that mark cant hear colins pretty sure that his squabbling neighbors sound enough like a pack of hungry cultists to make mark worry he reaches over for his laptop and types into the window of his browser uh all the local paper has is something about some kids partying in the graveyard and a dog getting into a tomb theyre covering it up says mark when colin just laughs mark interrupts him when are you going to be in town next not gonna be thats ridiculous what do they want you to dojust lay down and die they call it making me comfortable colin says there is a long pause on the other end of the line and when mark speaks again his voice is choked im an asshole dont colin says actually i feel good today better than in a while i might even go out and eat something just saying the word eat has made his mouth water he wipes his lips with the back of his hand your manager says he cant get ahold of you mark says but he doesnt have the surety in his voice that he had before car company wants to license a song for a commercial ill call him colin says even though he knows he wont he feels guilty that the conversation has become awkward more than anything dying is an embarrassment listen i got to go theres a bunch of people outside with torches chanting something about beelzebub fuck off says mark but at least he sounds like himself remember to charge your phone and to answer it the bones of colins spine pop as he stands to put his phone back in the charging dock but after hes up he doesnt feel so bad his stomach growls and he pulls on a hat and sunglasses despite the heat and decides that hes going to go outside after all when agatha knocks on his door next it isnt because hes ordered anything shes carrying a carton anyway she feels a little stupid when she hits the bell but shes afraid that hes not going to answer and then shes going to have to decide if she should break in to see if he died he buzzes her up like usual without even talking into the speakers theres music playing and when she gets upstairs hes sitting by the window and playing a guitar she recognizes the song hes playing its one of his but hes playing it so slowly that the music sounds as mournful as the words she wonders if this was how he wrote the songs how they were supposed to be played she hopes so this music isnt laughing at anyone his hair looks almost grown in military short rather than sickness short like a rock star whos no longer dying might have and it makes her aware that no matter how friendly he seems she has no reason to be standing in his loft he doesnt seem surprised to see her though oh says agatha i thought maybe something happened he looks at her quizzically whats wrong its been three days since you ordered any food she says i didnt know if you were just ordering from some other place or if you were sick or what im sorry i should three days he repeats like he doesnt believe it he looks out the window again like hes going to check the position of the earth but its dark all there is to see are glittering lights and the immense blackness of the ocean i went out today she asks i dont know he says i got strawberries she puts down the bag of fried rice and goes into the kitchen standing there near the refrigerator and the board supported by sawhorses she realizes just how inappropriate shes been rummaging through his things but the strawberries in their plastic green basket are right there on the mockcounter she comes back out with them covered in a fine gray mold and pocked with brownish patches not today i think maybe it has been three days he picks one off the top and brushes off the gauzy threads noble rot he says and pops it in his mouth it is so soft that some of it squirts onto his lip what decay concentrates the sweetness he says shes staring at him in disbelief he grins and its the smile she remembers from the photos rapacious unappeasable it makes her smile too its gross i know he says im just so hungry and its not like im drinking my own piss she holds up the box of fried rice its yours if you want it my treat he takes the box from her unfolding the paper and cupping rice in his palm he shovels it into his mouth as she watches him then abruptly he spits something out it hits the floor hard like a rock and she can see that its a small gold earring wrapped with a wisp of hair ugh he says wiping his mouth agatha bends down and picks up the earring she rolls it in her fingers hardly able to believe whats happening theres a tiny piece of what looks like skin attached she hopes he doesnt notice she has made a terrible mistake i dont know how that got in there she says quickly it must belong to one of the cooks colin is watching her with a strange expression i better take it back to the restaurant she says we should call the police he sits down on his couch not looking at her he reaches for his cell phone but he doesnt dial its just an earring agatha holds it up to her own ear and lets it dangle she feels guilty but keeps talking she has to convince him not to make any calls let me at least go back and see if someone lost it then we can call the police he nods leave the earring here okay she sets it down carefully on the coffee table brushing off whats attached to it she looks over at him not sure what shes hoping to see but his face is blank out the window he watches her go watches her head in the wrong direction for the restaurant he goes to the kitchen and pokes through the box of food with a single chopstick then he leans down to smell it theres a lot of thick brown sauce and underneath that a strange rich smell almost sweet rot all the next day agatha doesnt go over to colins apartment not even when he calls the restaurant and asks for her specifically although that does get her a lot of teasing even worse john catches agatha eating a piece of maggoty pork from the trash in the alley behind the restaurant he drops the plastic bags he was dragging are you crazy you cant put that in your mouth unprepared she just gapes at him i didnt do anything wrong she says finally he fires her anyway andshes pretty surelies to his parents about the reason by the time agatha enters the graveyard she is hungry and tired and sad she wants to curl up in inside one of the crypts but she knows she has to be careful nesting near graves is stupid but as her sharp little teeth rend gray flesh she thinks of the great ghoul city her mother told stories about when agatha was littleits walls wet with silt its spires sparkling with the reflected light of lichen deep beneath the earth in that mythical place all the ghouls of the world could cool themselves in the citys shadow and no one had to be careful sometimes agatha imagines that ghoul city abovegroundherewhere meat would spoil fast in the hot sun in that dream she doesnt have to keep moving there is no series of jobs or haphazard nests and she doesnt have to make a choice between colin dying or hating her an abrupt movement near the gate is enough to snap her out of her reverie and make her move locking the crypt and sticking to shadows she hears footsteps but they are receding she pauses at the stone wall at the edge of the graveyard where dirt and lime and ink and blood marks tell the story of all the ghouls who have passed through no police reads one good eating says another agatha makes a thick chalk mark on the wall territory it means mine she is pushing her bike home lethargic with satiation when she sees a woman who looks familiar getting out of a mercedes for a moment agatha freezes unable to figure how someone she knows is here when she realizes that she doesnt know the woman at all shes nancy colins wife shes famous another woman has gotten out of the drivers side she is in a tailored navy suit and slinging the strap of a soft leather briefcase over her shoulder agatha follows them down the long dark street matching her stride to theirs staying close to the shadows the carrion in her belly makes her feel strong and her fingers flex restlessly the women stop in front of the apartment and press the buzzer then they wait more impatient by the moment nancy flips open her cell phone and presses a few buttons with her thumb then her friend says something and she laughs harshly agatha watches them and her heart starts to speed faster like her body has already decided on something what were you doing colin comes out of the shadows behind agatha forcing her into the light he smells of vomit and his gaze locks on her accusing i didnt agatha starts but doesnt know how to finish she doesnt know how to deny doing what she was thinking without admitting she was thinking it there you are nancy says to colin are you using again you look awful this is agatha colin says stiffly and this is nancy and whitney agatha lifts her hand in a half wave im the lawyer whitney says agatha wonders what nancy needs a lawyer for now here they are already divorced is she a fan nancy says i never asked i dont even know if she likes music says colin which sounds sordid and isnt even true but agatha doesnt correct him lets go up i should probably let you guys have your meeting or whatever agatha says colin shakes his head his fingers closing around her arm we need to talk she lets him lead her toward the elevator one look at his face and it is clear that he knows something but what he knows or what he thinks or what he can guess is so unclear that all she can do is stare at the floor of the elevator and panic were you sick whitney asks colin as the smell of vomit is unmistakable in that small space i am sick he says and no one speaks into the uncomfortable silence nancy walks around the room stopping to stand by the windows you should hire someone to come here and finish the renovation a healthy environment puts you in a healthy frame of mind whats the point he says nancy throws up her hands and looks at whitney you know how stubborn he can be whitney says and the way she and colin exchange smiles seems weirdly intimate agatha is suddenly sure that colin has slept with both of the other women in the room im sorry colin says suddenly agatha and i are going to go and see what we can rustle up in the kitchen right agatha because there is nothing else for her to do agatha answers right the room reels around him and he holds on to the wooden joist in the door frame the sickness has mostly passed and what he feels most of all is hunger deep in his belly a kind of hunger that reminds him uncomfortably of the beginnings of withdrawal let me smell your breath he says leaning toward her she frowns ducking her head but smiling what why do you think im drunk i watched you eat someone he wants to say i followed you to a graveyard and saw you break the lock on a tomb with your bare hands i gagged on the smell threw up leaning against the rusty iron gate and after my mouth watered i want to know if your breath smells like dead flesh so that i can prove to myself that im not crazy i saw you he says instead he wonders if she imagines sinking her teeth into his flesh if shes been patiently waiting for him to ripen in death like the strawberries on his counter he should be disgusted but hes fascinated agatha has opened the cabinet above the sink in the makeshift kitchen there are dusty packets of tea in there and some honey when he speaks she turns toward him her hand still reaching she looks startled her tumble of dark hair pushed back behind one ear a normal pretty girl with sharp teeth in the graveyard he says her fingers close on the honey but dont seem to grip it he watches as it slips the bottle cracks on the wooden floor thick amber fluid spreading slowly from between the shards of glass im sorry she says voice shaking apologizing for more than the honey he realizes that he was waiting for her denial he was ready to believe that despite the fact hed seen her hunched over a corpse it was some kind of jokesome new phase of his sickness involving hallucinations shes talking saying something about not knowing how to tell him saying that she didnt think hed believe her but he cant seem to focus on the words he interrupts her what are you a ghoul agatha says nancy steps into the room looking at agatha like she overheard at least the end of that exchange colin are you alright i thought i heard glass they both turn toward nancy and theres something about their expressions that makes her step back why are you here he asks nancy looks over at agatha i was hoping we could talk just us and whitney he asks nancy hesitates go ahead says agatha with a quick smile ill make the tea he sighs trying to give agatha a look that says okay but if you try and sneak out i will forget about politeness and i will run after you and there is no way this conversation is overand realizing that shes probably not getting anything like that from his expression she could interpret his look as i have a headache or i think i misheard you because i heard ghoul and you clearly meant girl he follows nancy back to the living room and sits down next to her on the sofa shes lost some weight since he saw her last and her fingernails despite being freshly polished are bitten to the quick he watches her reach over and take his hand he glances in whitneys direction but shes looking carefully at his guitar i talked to mark nancy says his expression must have been so completely surprised that she corrects herself okay whitney talked to mark i cant believe youre living like this are you trying to punish yourself punish myself for what she shrugs her shoulders all the drugs you knowyou would always say that if it hadnt been for your job that maybe we would have never gotten as bad as we did that it was your fault he remembered saying that now that she mentioned it back when they both were trying to stay clean all their awful flaws and insecurities and desires ballooned along with his career there was just so much money and with the money temptation that was a long time ago your mother called me she says you wont talk to her she wants you to come home why are you here nancy i know what my mother wants im not dying in the same house i spent a lot of years trying to get out of so if you came all the way down here to suggest it dont nancy flinches someones got to take care of you you were never good at doing it for yourself if youre not going to your mother then im going to have to do it agatha enters the room carrying a collection of mugs that clink together as she walks she sets them down on the box near the couch i couldnt find any sugar but there was milk i put it in one of the mugs does she have to be here nancy asks colin shes not going anywhere he says whitney starts to speak but colin cuts her off youre not going anywhere either everyone just sit down agatha pours milk from one mug into her tea and takes a sip nancy does the same and then spits out the liquid how can you drink that the milks bad theres chunks floating in it let me try colin says he looks right at agatha when he takes a sip he knows that its going to be sour but the taste isnt as bad as he anticipated it reminds him of yogurt tastes fine he says and laughs agatha smiles and gulps from her cup he wishes that he and agatha were alone that they could talk he wants answers he keeps thinking about her sharp teeth and what they would feel like against his skin what her mouth would feel like whats going on nancy says are you two on something a dying man gets painkillers right hes not on anything whitney says with a sigh hes messing with your head did mark tell you that nancy demands colin could be scoring anywherefrom his doctors even whitney crosses her legs and gives colin a sly look she speaks slowly like shes bored i know because i know how he looks when hes messing with you shes right colin said holding up his hands in surrender i apologize whitney opens her briefcase and takes out some papers maybe i should explain what were here about i brought some papers that would give nancy general power of attorney do you know what that is colin shakes his head sounds legal does mark know youre here agatha picks up the mugs and walks toward the kitchen he turns toward her wanting to tell her to stop acting like a maid but her back is to him he wonders if years of restaurant work have made bringing and removing food into a ritual this is just a proposal says whitney if you sign this nancy would be your agent in taking care of things she can deal with your health care finalize the details of certain deals your manager is trying to work out with the rest of the bandbasically do everything to make sure that youre comfortable nancy feels terrible about the divorce i do nancy said touching his arm whitney clears her throat she feels like she left you to fend for yourself at a time when doing so was very difficult and she wants to make that up to you she thinks i didnt fight hard enough colin says numbly i said i lot of things i shouldnt have said nancys hand is still warm on his arm and it makes him realize how cold his own skin is by comparison we were together for a long time and i shouldnt have just thrown that away no says colin im glad you agree look the first thing im going to do is get someone to come in here and put up some drywall then well get you some furniture and hire a nurse no he says again no what nancy asks you live like a squatter its understandable that youre depressed that these things are hard to come to terms with but no one is looking out for your best interests imagine the scandal if your body wasnt found for days and then found here is that how you want to be remembered whitney flinched visibly nancy he stands up im already dead in your mind arent i youre already planning my funeral getting your veil all ready selling the rights to the tribute albumand what youre pissed that i wont be a good little corpse and lie down so you

toward nancy but right now shes someone you can trust who really wants a second chance to be there for you im going to leave the papers here and you can look them over while nancy and i go and grab a bite to eat well bring you back something and then we can talk some more she takes out a gleaming pen and places it atop the papers he follows them to the door and as he looks out at her weariness overcomes him when he speaks his voice is quiet you cant go back you know we cant people cant i cant go back to being the person i was before i was sick and you cant go back to being that persons wife because he doesnt exist anymore of course he does nancy says hes just sad colin closes and bolts the door behind them then picks up the legal pages walking to the window he cranks one wide open and drops confetti of ripped white paper onto the street below it looks like a parade passed through he thinks agatha he calls but theres no response from the kitchen colin walks in expecting to find her perched on the countertop or drinking the rest of the bad milk from the carton but shes not there and the window to the fire escape is wide open on her way down the metal stairs she runs into one of colins neighborsa pale looking man with floppy bleached hair he is smoking a cigarette and the corner of his mouth looks bruised he scoots over so she can sidle past him dont like front doors he asks her dont like goodbyes she says he nods like that makes sense she feels bad leaving like this without explaining to colin what shes done she tries to tell herself that hell figure things out but she knows that her cowardice will cost him as she walks down the road she thinks about the real first time she met colin outside of a club in new mexico shed been washing dishes and was on a break just leaning against the cool stucco of the building next door and listening to the music hed staggered out a moment later his shirt wet with sweat and leaned against the wall too neither of them spoke but in that moment she could tell that their skin itched the same way itched to keep moving to escape to keep looking for the mythical city where they would be sheltered in its shadows when her break was over and she headed toward the kitchen door he gave her a look of sympathy that for a while made her feel less alone she hasnt told him that they have run into each other before she wont ever tell him another memory rises up unbiddencolin leaning toward her in the kitchen tonight his eyes were dark with something that might have been revulsion but that she could pretend was desire and she hates that shes leaving but its better than being around when he realizes how much there is to despise her for he watches crows black wings gleaming like oil peck garbage strewn across a sandy lawn the sun hurts his eyes but hes determined to sit on this bench near the one place he knows she cant avoid shading his face with a hand as he looks over at the graveyard he wonders at the garden of white stone and granite grander and more austere than the tacky spectacle hes finding dying to be when he was a kid all the songs he loved were full of romantic ideas about eternal souls and the deaths beyond death and finding out how mundane and embarrassing its turning out to be is lowering not unlike finding out all the stately roman buildings had once been painted garish colors here you are agatha says he jumps a little and turns toward her shes wearing a silvery sundress and has that horrible earring in one ear he didnt even notice shed taken it from his apartment i figured youd come here eventually he says she sits down next to him on the bench but she wont meet his eyes i figured the same thing about you why would you say that he tilts his head to one side she ignores his question i want to tell you about ghouls i came back to tell youto face you we live on putrid flesh were strong and we never get sick she sucks her bottom lip in a nervous gesture we live a long time too and its not all bad the roving okay he says see those markings she points toward the wall to the graveyard which is covered in marks like the kind hobos left each other at train stations thats how we communicate are you sure youre supposed to tell me your secrets i guess it doesnt matter but i have to tell you she says crouching down beside the bench so that she can trace the marks in the dirt heres how you mark your territory and heres the symbol for danger this is the one for safe placewhich is similar to this one for good place he stares at the marks a secret lexicon for a secret life are you freaked out she asks very he says then takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly ive been thinking too and i want to tell you i get it you were waiting for me to die youve been taking good care of me bringing me food he laughs nervously his hands are sweating but you were getting me ready to eat right agatha stares at him silently and i wanted to tell you that im okay with that i mean i want you to go ahead she leans very close to him and opens her mouth against the place where his shoulder meets his neck he can feel her teeth sharp against his skin he shivers and he reaches out to pull her against him she shifts until shes half risen from the ground leaning between his legs her body as cool as his own his heart is speeding but time has slowed time is moving like the honey oozing on his floor is this what you pictured she says the movement of her mouth the scrape of her teeth is exhilarating and awful i dont know he says his heart is hammering against his ribs every instinct is telling him to push her away to run but he slides his hand to her hip and holds himself still this is better he tells himself because for the first time in months he feels the thrill of life in every ragged breath youre wrong she says slowly drawing back from him wrong his neck throbs where her lips have been im not going to eat you colin lainhart youre not rotten enough for me he frowns disoriented distracted but what did you want then i dont understand i like you i dont have a lot of friends moving around the way that i do youre funny and nice even though youve been ill and in pain why wouldnt i like you i dont know he says people arent liked because they deserve to be you might wish i didnt like you she says he reaches up and touches her dark hair it reminds him of the crows feathers why would i want that she pushes away from him so that shes standing i fed you human flesh in your food you were so sick that you couldnt tell his stomach twists youre going to live she says i sentence you to live oh there is a great roaring in his ears and he rubs his face moments ago he felt ancient but now he feels confused stumbling like a small child youre like me now i turned you youre going to like the taste of spoiled food and things with strong flavors you will crave human flesh but you dont have to eat it all the time be careful colin with that she turns and starts walking in the direction of the highway the crows startled go to wing wait he stands up and grabs her arm you cant leave im not sorry she jerks her arm out of his hand shes right she is very strong you cant make me say that im sorry at least shes no longer moving away from him shes standing right there breathing as if shes been running there are so many things that he wants to tell her but then he remembers the one thing that he hasnt said the one thing that matters stay he says reaching his hand out to her again gently this time i want you to stay please stay stay daddy long legs of the evening by jeffrey ford jeffrey ford is the author of the novels the physiognomy memoranda the beyond the portrait of mrs charbuque the girl in the glass and the shadow year his short fiction has been published in three collections the fantasy writers assistant the empire of ice cream and the drowned life his fiction has won the world fantasy award the nebula award the edgar award and gran prix de limaginaire he lives in new jersey with his wife and two sons and teaches literature and writing at brookdale community college it was said that when he was a small child asleep in his bed one endofsummer night a spider crawled into his ear traversed a maze of canals eating slowly through membrane and organ to discover the cavern of the skull then that spider burrowed in a spiral pattern through the electric gray cake of the brain to the very center of it all where it hollowed out a large nest for itself and reattached neural pathways with the thread of its web it played the boy like a zither plucking the silver strings of its own design creating a music that directed both will and desire before the invasion of his cranium the child was said to have been quite a little cherubbig green eyes and a wave of golden hair rosy cheeks an infectious laugh his parents couldnt help showing him off at every opportunity and regaling passersby with a litany of his startling attributes not the least of which was the ability to recite verbatim the bedtime stories read to him each night many a neighbor had been subjected to an oration of the entirety of the three rum runtkins a change inside wrought a change outside though and over the course of a few months the boys eyes bulged and drained of all color to become millionfaceted buds of gleaming onyx his legs and arms grew long and willowy but his body stayed short with a small but pronounced potbelly like an adams apple in the otherwise slender throat that was his form although a fine down of thistle grew in patches across his back arms and thighs he went bald losing even brows and lashes his flesh turned a pale gray hinting at violet his incisors grew to curving points and needed to be clipped and filed back like fingernails horrified at the earliest of these changes the boys parents had taken him first to the doctors but when the medicine he was given did nothing but make him vomit and the symptoms became more bizarre they took him to the clinic the doctors there subjected him to a head scan photos from the process showed the intruder in negative a tiny eightlegged phantom perched at the center of a dark intricate web it was determined that were they to remove the arachnid the boy could very possibly die the creature had for all intents and purposes become his brain the parents confessing they feared for their lives pleaded with the physicians to operate but the ethical code forbade it and the family was sent home not long after the trip to the clinic the boys mother opened his bedroom door one morning and beheld him suspended in the eye of a silver web that filled the room from floor to ceiling she meant to scream but the beautiful gleaming symmetry of what hed made stunned her she watched as he turned slowly round to face away and then from a neat hole cut in the back of his trousers that shed never noticed before came a sudden blast of webbing that smacked her in the face and covered half her body the door slammed shut as she reeled backward and this time she did scream tearing madly at the shroud whose sticky threads seemed spun from marshmallow unable to bear the boys presence any longer his parents took him for a hike out into the forest i know a place where there are flies as big as poodles his father said and the boy drooled they took him deep into the trees marking the trail as they went and somewhere miles in next to a lake they bedded down on pine needles while he slept they quietly rose tiptoed away and then once out of earshot ran for their lives they never saw the boy again although no one in town could blame them including the constable and they faced no charges for their actions the memory of their fear burrowed in a spiral pattern to the center of their minds and played them like zithers for the rest of their days fifteen years later and a hundred miles from where hed been born the boy appeared one evening at the height of summer not a man but something else a woman living in an apartment of an otherwise empty building on the east side of the city of grindly woke suddenly and looked up there was enough moonlight to see him clearly she said he hung above me upside down his hands and knees on the ceiling he wore a jacket with short tails and the long legs of his satin trousers were striped blue and red i dont know how that hata stovepipe stylestayed on as it had no chin strap his feet were in slippers the moment i saw him he looked directly into my eyes it didnt matter that he wore round rosecolored glasses those evil blackberries that lurked behind still dazzled me i screamed he shrieked and then he scuttled across the ceiling and out the open window i heard him on the roof and then everything was silent the woman told her friends and her friends told their friends and word that something bizarre had come to grindly spread like disease the gazette put out a double edition a whole four pages its entirety devoted to speculation concerning daddy longlegs of the evening a moniker invented by the editor in chief the name stuck and over the course of a few more days was shortened by the populace first to daddy longlegs and then to simply daddy watch out for daddy neighbors said as a salutation when they parted before people bedded down at night they practiced a ritual of checking closets and basements the dark corners of attics and under beds latching all windows and gathering crude weapons on their nightstandsa mallet a wrench a carving knife a club after a few more sightings that he had scrupulously arranged allowing himself to be spotted crawling to the top of and then into a silent mills crumbling smokestack or traversing the sootridden mosaic of gods face on the inner dome of the railway station as the midnight train passed through he was in their hearts and minds and what was even more important to him in their dreams of course he meant to drain the citizenry of grindly of their bodily fluids but first to enhance nourishment it needed to be filtered flavored by nightmare when there wasnt a soul within the confines of the city wall who did not in their dreams flee slow heavy and naked before him or writhe in the coil of their blankets mistaken in sleep for his web he struck it was deepest night when he entered the home of the haberdasher fremin through the unlocked coal chute the hinges on the iron door creaked a warning but that noise was transformed by the dreams of the sleeping husband and wife into the triumphant laughter of daddy longlegs they never woke when he bit them at the base of the skull they never cried out as their fearladen essence left them like old worn luggage the newspaper said describing the condition of the corpses discovered two days later when the medics tried to move the haberdashers body to a stretcher it split with a whisper like a dry husk and out of it poured thousands of tiny spiders police inspector kaufmann the medics the fremins neighbors who were present all ran out of the building and the inspector gave orders for the place to be torched at once as the fire raged the crowd that had gathered belabored the inspector grindlys sole lawman with inquiries as to what he was prepared to do what kaufmann was prepared to do was run take the next train out of town for some shining new place free of rot and nightmares the only thing preventing him was the fact that the train rarely stopped but sped right through as if there really was no platform or station or city if i wait for that he thought we might all be dead by the time it arrives he turned to the citizens and said im going to hunt daddy down and put a bullet in him only the inspector knew that it would necessarily have to be a bullet as he only had one left government supplies from the capitol had dried up over a year earlier that night kaufmann slept slumped over his desk pistol in hand and dreamt of a time before the politicians in the capitol had succumbed to a disease of avarice and sapped all of grindlys resources for themselves once known far and wide as the nexus of manufacture a gleaming machine of commerce where traffic filled the streets faces filled the windows and nobody ate cabbage who didnt want to the inspector had a police force enough bullets and a paycheck again in his sleep he watched the city slowly rot from the inside out and eventually stood on the platform at the station waving forlornly as even the petty criminals left town while kaufmann dozed daddy was busy slipping silently through the shadows he could smell the terror of the populace a sweet flower scent that drove his hunger the music played on the strands of web behind his eyes directed his purpose negating distraction as he shuffled up a wall found an unlocked window and let the breeze in his first victim of that night the pale and beautiful actress monique ledar who still performed nightly onewoman shows of the classics although the stage was lit by candles and squirrels scampered amid the rafters she awoke in the midst of daddys feeding and he saw her seeing herself in the myriad reflections of his eyes he stopped tipped his hat and continued she put her wrist to her forehead and perished the gazette had the story in its latemorning edition the next day daddys dozen read the headline at the end of the lead article that gave a list of the drained and the grisly condition in which each was found there was printed a formal plea from inspector kaufmann for volunteers to help track the killer that evening he stood on the sidewalk in front of the hall of justice a mausoleum of an old marble structure dark and empty inside save for his office the last set of batteries in the flashlight had died so instead he held like a torch out in front of him a small candelabra of three burning tapers hed been waiting for over an hour for the mob of volunteers to form in order to begin the hunt but as it was he stood alone taking the gun from his shoulder holster he was about to strike out on his own when an old woman in a kerchief and a long camelhair winter coat trundled slowly up to him can i help you maam asked the inspector i volunteer she said he laughed this is dangerous work my dear were after a coldblooded killer the old woman opened her pocketbook and took out a blackjack she waggled the tube of stitched leather with lead in the tip at kaufmanns face thats an illegal weapon he said arrest me she said and spat on the sidewalk the avenues and side streets of grindly were empty even the drunks stayed home in fear of being drunk themselves it was slow going and just as lonely for kaufmann with mrs frey in tow hed barely gotten the womans name out of her she followed five steps behind not so much his posse as a haunting spirit he respected her courage her sense of civic duty but found her quiet wheezing and the rhythmic squish of her galoshes incredibly annoying and wondered how long it would be before he used his last bullet on either her or himself it was dinnertime in the city that never woke the scent of boiled cabbage the skittering of rats along the gutters occasionally there was a lighted window and the distant muffled sound of a radio or a childs glee or an argument but for the most part kaufmann and his deputy passed down empty streets of boarded storefronts and burnedout brownstones where the echo of the wind sounded like laughter in the shadows it was dinnertime for daddy as well and he moved along the rooftops keenly aware of the warm spots in the cold buildings beneath heat signatures of those who might find themselves on his menu he was hunting for the essence of the young his last kill of the previous night had been tharshmon the watchmaker a man made old by lack of work and selfrespect no one cared any longer to know the time in grindly it was better left unmentioned when the future arrived as dozens of pocket watches chimed in tharshmons studio at am daddy interceded without a struggle the bereft watchmakers fluid was overripe though insipidly sweet and watery it gave no energy but bruised the will and loosened the bowels daddy skittered down the side of a fourstory apartment building at the lighted window on the third floor he settled upon the fire escape with his face to the glass he saw two young children dressed in their pajamas playing in a bedroom he tried the window but it was locked he tapped at the glass with one long nail their big pink faces drew close to see him and even before they undid the latch his system was creating the chemical needed to digest their juices he had learned it wasnt helpful to let them see him drool at the same moment three blocks away inspector kaufmann was passing the waterworks he turned and peered back up the sidewalk to see mrs freys bent form inching along through the weak glow of the blocks one working streetlight he set the candelabra on the ground holstered his gun and took out his last cigarette hed traded a pair of official police handcuffs with key for the pack it came from leaning down he lit it on the flame of the center candle he was cold and tired and every scrap of newspaper that rolled in the wind or bat that darted out of a blasted window momentarily paralyzed him with fear he took a drag and heard mrs freys galoshes drawing closer the old woman had nearly caught up and there was still a good half of a cigarette left when he heard a desperate scream come from off to his right shit he said flicked the unfinished butt into the gutter drew his pistol and ran across the street there he entered an alley and ran through the dark avoiding piles of broken furniture and old garbage the alley gave way to another street and then another alley and when he was almost winded there was again a shrill scream and he saw a woman at an open window three stories up my babies she wailed kaufmann scanned the sides of the buildings for daddy he heard something move amidst the trash and caught a darker spot in the darkness out of the corner of his eye as he lifted the gun something wet and sticky smacked him in the face he fired blindly by the time kaufmann had wiped the web from his eyes daddy was gone the distraught mother above had spotted the inspector and was yelling for his assistance and behind him mrs frey pocketbook on her wrist the candelabra in her right hand the blackjack in her left shuffled inexorably closer the inspector dropped the gun and ran away daddy sat atop the smokestack of the abandoned harris electric loom mill nursing the wound to his leg where the bullet had grazed his calf the spider in his head unhooked the strings that sent pain and then nestled back into the center of things half high from the effects of the rich essence of youth his imagination took off and he plucked the silver strands composing as he played spinning a web of an idea herd them daddy said in a voice that cracked and clicked the spare scattered pattern of the lights of grindly required design exhausted from running inspector kaufmann leaned against the coral facade at the entrance to grindly station his own thoughts were as scattered as daddys were inspired against what would have normally been his better judgment he chose to believe that for some reason the train would that night stop at the platform and take him aboard he hurried on so as not to miss it his quick footsteps echoed across the wide rotunda and he passed through another set of doors into the dome that held the station platform he was surprised to find himself the only passenger kaufmann cupped his hand behind his ear and cocked his head toward the track in order to check for vibrations of the coming train he thought he felt the merest rumble deep in his chest after listening for a long time all he really heard was the sound of water dripping it interfered with the anticipation of escape then he realized it wasnt water dripping but more a tapping it stopped and then started again he looked up at the inner dome and froze in an eyeblink daddy leaped down on a fortyfoot thread of web and stood before kaufmann mandibles clicked together and daddy did a bad job of hiding the drool from some forgotten byway of his brain the inspectors years of experience on the streets of grindly engaged he made a fist and swung with everything he had the punch hit the mark cracking the left lens of daddys rosecolored glasses and sending him stumbling backward a few feet the inspector didnt know whether to flee or continue to attack and in the empty moment of his indecision he definitely heard the train coming he made a move toward daddy with fists in the air but his nemesis twirled with insect precision and speed and clipped kaufmann under the chin with a foot that struck like the tip of a bullwhip the inspector was almost brought to his knees by the blow but instead of going down he righted himself and backed off blood trickled from the side of his mouth the train was louder now and a faint light could be seen filling the tunnel he looked down and saw that the backs of his heels were off the edge of the platform he put his fists up and kept them moving when daddy took one longlegged step to the left kaufmann saw salvation the roar of the approaching train filled the tunnel and set the entire platform to vibrating so that it was impossible to hear the squish of mrs freys galoshes she inched up upon him from behind the candelabra glimmering the blackjack waggling in her grip kaufmann threw a flurry of jabs to distract the arachnid and the old woman lifted the leather club as high as she could the locomotive entered the station but didnt slow in the reflection of rushing windows daddy detected treachery he spun in a blur his mandibles severing mrs freys neck with a swift clip like cutting a rose from the hole in his trousers he shot a blast of web at kaufmann it happened so quickly that the inspector could only stand motionless as the strand of sticky thread wrapped twice around his neck the webs long tail was pulled in by the rush of the passing train and affixed itself to the handle on the back door of the caboose kaufmann was jerked off the platform by the neck and flew behind the train the last thing he saw in grindly was the mosaic face of god mrs freys head hit the platform then and spat the next evening in an abandoned warehouse by the docks daddy stood in total darkness emitting highpitched squeals that called all the natural spiders of grindly to him when he felt their delicate heaving presence surrounding him he clicked and blzzd out his plan he gave instructions on rethreading the human brain he spoke of the ear and the path to take warning of cul de sacs a quarter pound of fly meat for every human restrung he promised spirits were high later when they returned to him for payment he crushed them beneath his slipper by the time he got done with grindly the city shone and ran like one of tharshmons pocket watches everything moved as if to music it became for daddy a web of human thread purpose without a point he often reminded his human electorate and they tacitly nodded he continued to feed at night roaming the rooftops and alleyways leaving old luggage indiscriminately in his wake people showed him smiles during the day but still no one wanted to meet him in the dark the reconfiguration of their brain patterns didnt eliminate terror only their ability to react to it fear and industry was daddys motto and it took him far after the train was again making scheduled stops at the station daddy boarded with a ticket to the capital one evening he never returned to grindly but instead bit into the larger politics of the realm and kept eating in a spiral pattern until he reached the center of everything there he made a nest for himself the skinny girl by lucius shepard lucius shepard was born in lynchburg virginia grew up in daytona beach florida and lives in portland oregon his short fiction has won the nebula award the hugo award the international horror guild award the national magazine award the locus award the theodore sturgeon memorial award and the world fantasy award his latest books are a short novel the taborin scale and a short fiction collection viator plus forthcoming are another short fiction collection five autobiographies two novels tentatively titled the piercefields and the end of life as we know it and a short novel the house of everything and nothing during the twentysix years in which he had supplied images of the dead to the citys daily newspapers hugo lis had photographed over thirty thousand corpses the victims of strangulation and shooting knifings car crashes decapitations accidental electrocutions and other more idiosyncratic instances of mayhem a considerable number of those pictures despite the anonymity of the victims had been run on the front page above the fold often in conjunction with the photograph of a halfnaked starlet or singer when asked to explain this apparent opposition hugo would suggest that in a place where life has little or no meaning death tends to acquire a certain glamour mexico city had seventyfive thousand streets and death was a celebrity on every one hugo had visited homes in which his photograph of a family members bloody remains snipped from a newspaper now served as the centerpiece of a shrine it was as if the violated flesh and its public exploitation were deemed truer emblems of a loved ones memory than the sunny smile of a confirmation photo or the purposeful forwardlooking pose of a graduation shot or it may have been that the implicit passion and drama of a violent death lent the departed a christlike pathos thereby engaging the catholic sensibilities of the populace hugos attitudes toward the subject albeit no less formalized were not in the least circumscribed by faith or emotion death to hugo lis was simply a way of life as dean of the photographers whose pictures illustrated the notas rojas red news hugo was occasionally approached by foreign journalists interested in doing a story on his life and profession his hair and mustache colored to hide the gray dressed in a black suit tailored to disguise his paunch wearing lifts that added two inches to his diminutive stature he would pose for pictures after negotiating a fee necessary he claimed to guarantee their safety from the gangs he would guide them to one or another of the innumerable shrines devoted to santa muerte saint death in barrio tepito where behind glass or within a confine of plastic panels a human skeleton often a real one dressed in robes or a lace gown stood holding a scythe and a globe representing the earth surrounded by offerings of flowers and fruit and cigars left by thugs kidnappers drug dealers murderers and the disenfranchised whose patron saint she was death has become so prominent a character in our lives weve transformed her into a movie star he would typically say leading his interviewer among the stalls that transformed many of tepitos streets into crowded pedestrian aisles pointing out the various representations of santa muerte available among fraudulent swiss watches and knockoffs of designer clothingstatuettes and paintings of robed skeletal figures juxtaposed with tshirts that depicted her as an emaciated yet beautiful young girl you find her image everywhere he would go on soon there will be films celebrating her starring mayrin villanueva or ninel conde people en espaÃ±ol will proclaim her to be the sexiest woman of the year as befitted his profession hugo was a widower his wife fabiola a thin sallow girl died in her teens as the result of sudden illness which had originally seemed merely a summer cold he could no longer call her face to mind and had come to view the marriage as an adolescent mistake yet he had been dismasted by grief upon her death or better said he had embraced grief with the same childlike fervor that he had love wearing it as an actor would wear a costume using it to simulate authenticity but no matter how deep his investment in the emotion grief had rendered him glib and cynical and purged him of his juvenile ambitions he no longer cared about creating art and thought of photography strictly as a means to an end ironically his work since had been praised for its raw purity and bizarre sensuality and now formed part of the permanent collections of several important museums when asked how he managed to make the dead so attractive so vital even though charred or covered in blood he replied i seek to do nothing i shoot pictures for the newspapers i dont try to frame shots i dont enhance negatives what you see is what i see nothing more he had never remarried and lived in a onebedroom condo close to avenida vincente suarez in the colonia of la condesa a trendy section of the city that echoed the intellectual pretensions of greenwich village and the architecture of south beach yet lacked the cultural traditions of the one and the garish splendor of the other though he welcomed the attentions of women mainly intellectual types attracted by the numena they claimed to perceive in his photographs he refused to adapt his routines to their needs and they would leave after a few weeks or months accusing him of being aloof and passionless except as related to his job this accusation surprised him for he considered himself a passionate sort as for his job well he would admit to being a bit obsessivethat was his naturebut it was scarcely a passion these women he reasoned must have been pampered in their previous relationships and thus demanded too much of him when not at home his life was spent driving from point to point in the distrito federal obeying the prompts of a police scanner on the move for days at a time eating and napping in his car traveling from crime scene to crime scene through snarls of clamorous traffic from black nights fruited with neon to days that whether rainy or bright gave evidence of a polluted haze from the zona rosa where child prostitutes flocked the streets to the sprawl of cuautepec the epicenter of poverty to the zocalo the great central square hemmed in by gray fortresslike government buildings and the equally forbidding cathedral the site of demonstrations and concerts and in winter improbably an outdoor ice skating rink experienced this way the city for all its chaos and violence had a calming almost a narcotizing effect upon him as though it generated a violent beatitude or else like a fish born in a cataract he had grown inured to the crash and tumble of its rhythms one night at the end of such a sojourn he stopped to buy cigarettes at a tiny store a niche no wider than a doorway on a nearly deserted stretch of calle doctor vertis when he emerged from the store two men seized him by the elbows pressed a pistol into his side and forced him into a van where he was made to lie on the floor with his face pushed into a moldy carpet terrified hugo assumed this to be an express kidnapping and that the men would bring him to a cash machine and have him make a withdrawal they did not wear masks and were so nonchalant in their demeanor chatting about a woman of their acquaintance he thought they must be unconcerned about revealing their identities because they planned to kill him yet if that were so would they not head toward a spot where they could complete their business undisturbed he could tell by the buildings whose upper floors were visible through the windows stone facades with balconies and crumbling colonial ornaments and by the increased noise cumbia and rock playing in the hotly lit stores somebody shouting over a bullhorn shrieks and laughter horns braying engines being gunned that they were passing along calle morelos very near the zocalo screwing up his courage expecting a blow in return he asked where he was being taken the man in back with hugo heavily muscled his neck so thickly covered in tattoos that in the shadowy interior of the van he appeared to be wearing a turtleneck glanced at him incuriously and said the skinny girl wants to meet you a certain amount of ambiguity was attached to this statementla flacita the skinny girl was a diminutive for santa muerte an affectionate name used by her devotees the man might be threatening him with death or he might be referring to someone who had adopted the name hugo sought clarification but the driver snapped at him telling him to keep quiet the men began talking about the woman again not in the way such men usually talk about women neither lustfully nor derisively but reverently and with the sort of respect they would normally reserve for a man hugo suspected this woman to be a criminal type who relied on a quasimystical pose to keep the troops in line he told himself that he was going to be all righthed inform her of his police connections and she would come to her senses and release him that the official and the criminal are inextricably aligned should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the workings of their government but nowhere is this juxtaposition so literal and apparent as in mexico city located fifteen minutes walk from the zocalo the seat of the government and home to the immense grim cathedral that is its spiritual analogue lies the seat of outlawry barrio tepito within its borders fully twothirds of the worlds child pornography is produced assault rifles and missile launchers are sold via illustrated catalogs and there are dozens of warehouses filled with drugs and stolen goods you can find anything in tepito its said pirated software endangered species a rolex a guarneri cello a slave a cruel master anything the majority of tepitos business is done on the streets but much of it is accomplished in vecindades old colonial mansions scattered throughout the barrio decayed to the point of collapse each room serving as a boutique given over to a separate extralegal enterpriseit was to such a ruinous structure that his captors brought hugo the earth beneath the house had been excavated creating two brightly lit subterranean levels the uppermost walled in concrete block and plaster ranged by mahogany doors elaborately carved with an imagery of bounteous naturebunches of grapes and orchids and hummingbirds and reeds the men led hugo down to this level and stationed themselves at the foot of the stairs and told him to proceed along the corridor that he would find the skinny girl in one of the rooms when he hesitated anxious about what might lie ahead they drove him forward with kicks and curses the first door admitted hugo to a large poorly lit room smelling of marijuana in which people visible as half shadows sat about on sofas and easy chairs those he could see were swaybacked and patched with tape their conversations barely audible over a music of whiny reeds and clattering drums that had a middle eastern flair it reminded him of his university days smiling young men passing handrolled cigarettes to giggling girls longhaired guys engaged in impassioned arguments he asked a busty freshfaced girl who stood along the wall where he could find the skinny girl no hablo she said in an american accent her companion a sullen kid with a complicated emo hairstyle said pase por alla and pointed to the far end of the room where there was a door and nearby a number of people gathered about a radiant object on the floor blocking it from view a sudden flash of white light cast them in silhouettesome gasped while others cried out and applauded the glow faded albeit slowly and hugo shouldered in among them hoping to discover what they had been watching embedded in the floor was a flat panel of black glassa television screenbut whatever image it had shown was no longer in evidence hugo exited the room and at the urging of the men standing by the stairs continued along the corridor from behind a second door came a racket that reminded him of an oldfashioned printing press he turned the knob but found it locked putting his ear to the next door he heard noises reminiscent of a dog worrying a chew toy and decided not to enter the fourth door opened into a considerable space with bright ceiling lights and a banquet table at which some two dozen prosperouslooking men and women were seated all clad as mourners most with their heads bent murmuring as in prayer three mestizo boys in white coats were serving them two holding a steaming tureen and one ladling a thick black soup the dominant feature of the room was a mural occupying the whitewashed wall at the diners backs depicting a pale asthenic girl clad in black jeans a wide belt with a gold buckle and a sleeveless black top of the countless representations of the skinny girl that hugo had seen this was the first to strike him as having the specificity of an image rendered from life she stood inhaling a cigarette an act that accentuated the hollowness of her cheeks and gazed into an unguessable distance her physical attitude projecting a palpable disaffection an immense ghostly skull looming behind her formed the backdrop of the mural along with some sketchy vegetation and small indefinite figures that might have been cacti or soldiers with spears she wore on her left arm a simple silver bracelet and on a chain about her neck was an oddly shaped gold amulet holding a flat magenta stone her hair was jet black and her long narrow face with its high cheekbones full carmine lips and prominent nose had a severe almost mannish cast yet despite this despite the coldness of her expression and the fact that she had virtually no hips or breasts she seemed to incarnate every principle of feminine beauty albeit in their most forbidding and reductive form at the end of the banquet table nearest hugo sat a matronly woman with a kindly face who had not yet been served she wore widows garb but her crepe dress and lace mantilla were of much finer quality than those of the blackclad women hugo saw each day on the streets of the city grimly clutching their little bundles he approached her and inquired as to whether she knew the woman who had posed for the mural why thats aida of course she said with a faltering tone as if bewildered by the question dont you recognize her its an excellent likeness the old man on her left made a pleased noise as the server filled his bowl i havent yet met the lady hugo said could you tell me where i might find her oh the woman put a hand to her cheek im afraid youll have to leave youre not permitted to partake of communion until youve the serving boys moved behind her and the tallest a beetlebrowed twelveyearold with a yellowishbrown complexion ladled soup into her bowlit smelled of nutmeg yet there was an unpleasant undertone a scent that hugo could not identify the woman closed her eyes and inhaled the steam rapturously she took up her spoon and stirred the soup which had the consistency of partially set custard until what hugo asked until youve met her the woman bowed her head and began to pray glorious death i beseech you she said in a fervent tonethe rest of her words were lost in a muttering consensus only the serving boys abstained from prayer they glared at hugo their black eyes agleam like chitin under the lights their faces glum if he had seen them on the streets of tepito he wouldnt have given them a second thought but the context lent them a sinister aspect and he retreated from the room the corridor veered to the right and after inspecting a room used to store stacks of highend electronics gear still in their cartons he leaned against the wall seeking to order his thoughts nothing that had occurred since the kidnapping made sense and the more forcefully he sought to impose logic on events the less comprehensible they became it was evident that he had not been kidnapped for ransom alone that whoever was behind his abduction was playing games with him but he could think of no reason for such treatment several people passed him by as he pondered and he asked each of them if they knew aidas whereabouts they were uniformly civil suggesting that if he kept going sooner or later he would run across her but each time he raised a question that required a more detailed response they excused themselves and hurried off unable to resolve any of his questions he took their advice and continued along the corridor at length he reached a door that stood partially open the room beyond was furnished with a sofa and easy chairs upholstered in earth tones end tables and a gray rug with a blue diamond pattern typical of zapotec work it had a faintly shabby air redolent of an old hotel that was being kept up but had seen better days pottery occupied niches in the tiled walls ocher with geometric designs of red and green and on the wall opposite next to a doorway hung with a beaded curtain directly above the light switch was a crucifixthe exposed wiring of the switch ran up behind the cross giving the impression that the electricity powering the jaundiced glow from the ceiling lamp was at least partly responsible for christs tormented posture hugo slipped inside closing the door after him and tiptoed to the doorway across the room pushing aside the beaded curtain on his left a staircase led downward to his right a bedroom a womans bedroom judging by the underwear strewn across the floor a noise from without drew his attention and he peered through the beaded curtain a woman stood in the corridor only her hand visible resting on the doorknob a silver bracelet about her wrist all right ill talk to you later she said to someone and entered the room she was identical to the woman in the mural in every respect the same jewelry and clothing even the same severe makeup this reinforced his idea that she was a charlatan who affected the guise of santa muerte for some devious purposesuch an act would play well in tepito he was certain she had seen him through the curtain and in reflex he took a backward step without acknowledging him she lit a cigarette and tipped back her head to exhale a plume of smoke after a silence she said reflectively hugo lis her voice had a husky sonority that made it seem a larger presence was speaking through her yet when she spoke again her words had a normal timbre my name is aida chavez you are welcome in my house since you know me he said pushing aside the curtain and stepping forward as though unafraid you must also know that i have influential friends truly perhaps your friends know my friends she had another hit of her cigarette dont worry no harm will come to you here i dont believe you understand my nieces godfather is mauricio ebrard i know i know a great deal about you your friends where you like to drink i know you took your last vacation in biarritz you spent quite a sum of money on a woman named cinnamon a smile nicked her wide straight mouth no doubt a relative she sat down on the sofa and crossed her legs still there are things i dont understand about you why for instance do you continue to photograph the dead it cant be an issue of moneyyour celebrity has brought you a nice income nor is it because you have a dearth of other options irritated hugo said perhaps i just like driving around and taking pictures im no psychologist why does anyone do anything why do you pretend to be santa muerte is that what i do she kicked out her right leg and considered the tip of a stylish boot are you afraid hugo i should think anyone in your situation would be of course i am im afraid you wont use good judgment if youre really afraid if you fear for your life you may leave he searched her face for a hint of deception reminding himself that she was a poseur an actresshe would be unlikely to detect anything that she had not put there by design she swung her legs onto the sofa and leaned back against the armrest yet youve spent so many years at the entrance to my house it would be a pity if you left without exploring it a little he was aware that she had spoken metaphorically referring both to his photographs of the dead and her affectation as the embodiment of santa muerte but he chose to respond as though the comment had been literal youre mistaken he said ive never been here before her face settled into a haughty disinterested expression that reminded him of his niece a student at the university the look she adopted when she asked him for money and he would question the reason for which she needed it do as you wish she said giving a languid gesture leave or stay its of no consequence she stared at the ceiling smoke curling between her lips holding her cigarette aloft as if using it to gauge perspective he had the idea that he had disappointed her and felt an irrational dismay at having come up short of her expectations he picked through his thoughts examining this one and that one thinking that she might be a witch and had placed them in his headhe did not actually believe in witchcraft but his upbringing in san luis potosi where peyote was sold by brujas in the market compelled him to accept that magic was part of the worlds potential while taking this mental inventory he became aware that he was no longer quite so afraid although he remained unsettled by her diffident manner and general inexpressiveness smiles and frowns scarcely registered on her face she had demanded no ransom and he began to believe that she meant him no harm whatever her intentions he told himself they must have something to do with the cult of santa muerte with her position in it and perhaps there was a story here that could be exploited the bulk of his equipment was in his car but he had a digital camera in his jacket pocket may i take your picture he asked partway through hugos photographic session with her aida chavez started to remove her clothes she did this of her own volition and with the nonchalance of a wife preparing for bed while chatting with her husband hugo was initially taken aback but the hollows of her buttocks the articulation of her ribs collarbone and pelvis and the thrust of her hip bones contrived an eerily erotic terrain that aroused him in no small measure and he snapped picture after picture desire grew furious and sharp in him like the flame from a gas jet turned high he wanted to touch her and might have done so using the pretense of helping her to achieve a pose but an insistent knocking at the door broke the mood aida slipped on her panties and top and poked her head out into the corridor and carried on a brief halfwhispered exchange after which she shut the door and struggled into her jeans irritated hugo waved at the door and said who are all these people what are they doing here aida lit another cigarette and exhaled with a despondent sigh i hoped you would recognize me but since you do not how could i recognize you ive never laid eyes on you before no how odd she reclined on the sofa once again i suppose it would be more accurate to say that i hoped you could identify me but since you cannot ill tell you a little about myself perhaps that will assist your judgment he sat in one of the easy chairs and once he was comfortable she said i was a foundling left on the steps of the nueva vida orphanage when i was barely a few hours old i was grossly underweight and the doctors doubted that i would live yet somehow i managed to survive my infancy as i grew older the nuns tried to fatten me up thinking that if i were closer to normal weight i stood a better chance of being adopted though they forced me to stuff myself often using the threat of physical punishment i remained abnormally thin the other children were cruel to me i wasnt strong enough to fight them off so i developed a kind of passive resistance no matter how painful the beatings i refused to cry i would glare at them until at last they stopped eventually they left me more or less alone and satisfied their need to demean me with the occasional prank they took to calling me the skinny girl sometimes i wonder if their cruelty wasnt a form of recognition a denial of their fear my stoic manner made me even less appealing to potential adoptive parents they wanted bubbly bouncy children and not a gaunt solemn girl who sat without speaking after nine years in the orphanage it seemed clear that i would never be adopted and so it was decided i would enter the convent when i reached the proper age i raised no objection to this plan a nuns life seemed as good as any and better than most in that it offered a guarantee of food and shelter then just prior to my tenth birthday demario chavez came to the orphanage he had heard about the skinny girl dwelling there and asked to see me the founder of the zetas hugo asked that demario chavez aida nodded during our interview i gave minimal responses to his questions and did not expect to see him again but several days later he came to collect me i assume a sum of money changed handsthat would explain why a drug dealer a murderer was allowed to adopt me then too the nuns were likely glad to wash their hands of me they were a superstitious bunch and i suspect they half believed me to be the skinny girl demario took me to his house this house and installed me in an apartment and let it be known that the incarnation of santa muerte was dwelling under his roof living as his ward occasionally he would bring other men to see memen like him gang leaders with dozens of tattoos they offered me giftsperfume food tequila they prayed before me they asked my blessing and all the while demario smirked at me over their bowed heads so said hugo your function was to impress other criminals by posing as santa muerte that was the idea demario rarely confided in me but once he patted me on the head and said that before we were done he would have every criminal in mexico worshipping at my church it doesnt seem credible that you could frighten men to that extent oh i have my moments she said i dont know whether i frightened them as much as i convinced them but this is an unusual house in one room there is an animal that feeds on itself tearing at its own flesh and yet the next day is whole again in another there is a tv screen set in the floor that works only intermittently and shows images of an apocalyptic event that soon will be visited upon us there are other strange things besides some will tell you they are nothing but tricks hightech illusions animatronics and so forth others claim they are magical devices i believe both sides are right that given certain conditions illusions can become real hugo made a dubious noise but aida ignored it whatever their nature she said i think after seeing them the men were disposed to believe in me she lit another cigarette and exhaled through her nostrils demarios behavior toward me underwent a change over the course of the three years that i knew him increasingly he began to display anxiety in my presence during the last year i scarcely saw him at all until one night he broke into my apartment and raped me i reverted to the passive resistance of my orphanage days and glared at him the entire time and gave no outcry after he had finished he appeared terrified he wept and babbled and called me his beautiful death he had been using a lot of drugs those last months cocaine heroin pills i imagined that his substance abuse provoked the incident the next morning he was dead some problem with his heart his woman told me that he had become convinced that i was santa muerte incarnate and that what had started out as a game had evolved into something much darker the rape she said was an attempt to restore his control over me she too believed i was santa muerte and that i had struck demario down for his assault on me she begged my forgiveness and asked me to show her mercy i thought i would have to move out of the house but the story of demarios death and my part in it spread through the barrio and no one ever tried to evict me instead people thronged the house asking for my blessing they would have transformed my home into a shrine to santa muerte a big one like the old womans house on alfareria street but i told them i wanted neither their gifts nor their adoration i said that i had been made flesh in order to explore the nature of my humanity and to fulfill a destiny as yet unrevealed i meant to choose those with whom i surrounded myself the people you asked about the ones who visit me here they are my suitors they come in hopes that i will grant them surcease whenever i feel so inclined i give them a kiss and send them away not one of them has returned some of your suitors are very young are you so naÃ¯ve that you think only the old seek death you believe they are dead the ones you kissed ive come to think so yes then you must believe that you are the skinny girl at first i did not believe it i found the concept ridiculous but lately she failed to complete the sentence and hugo asked what she had intended to say people assume an incarnation is a special soul given physical form she said something apart from creation something that has a different quality but god is in all things so how can his incarnation be separate or different i think an incarnation is a part of god that is gradually shaped by his design to satisfy some need it took jesus years before he understood his destiny she got to her feet and paced off a few steps toward the door lately i have gained a new sense of myself its difficult to describe and there are momentslike nowwhen i doubt what i know in my heart words make it sound utterly preposterous she slapped her thigh in frustration lets just say ive begun to accept that my actions have some wider resonance in the world well said hugo choosing his words with care not wanting to upset her further it should be easy enough to prove have the people whom you kiss followed when they leave invite technicians into the house to examine the television and whatever else requires validation that would prove nothing scrutiny changes the observable no my idea of proof was to bring you here your life has been surrounded by death its your passion hugo started to object but she talked through him ive read your interviews she said you make a point of denying me yet you seek me out in my most terrible forms and perceive in each a vivid grace when you photographed me i felt you were fucking me with the camera i stripped off my clothes because you recognized me you responded to my beauty youve always responded to me your desire was palpable you wanted to touch me why didnt you embarrassed hugo gave no answer youve been my absent lover for a long while said aida soon we will be together dont be silly hugo said i took those pictures to run with your story even the ones the newspapers would refuse to print who are those intended for you cant deny your desire for me much longer we will have our time and on that day i promise you much more than a kiss but our meeting today may have been premature i need to purge myself of doubt my faith must be pure in order to awaken yours fully she beckoned theres something i want you to see afterward you may leave if thats your pleasure he followed her through the beaded curtain and down a short stairway and along a whitewashed tunnel lit by naked ceiling bulbslike a passage leading to a gallows or a gas chamber a few weeks ago i had a vision of you she said as she went i watched you photographing the dead he felt a pang of anxiety dozens of people watch me at work cops medics bystanders but no one saw you working at the new divine did they hugo quit walking you were alone inside the club said aida you must have bribed someone to let you in before the emergency teams arrived there were bodies everywhere the room was still very smoky so you tied a cloth about your face the first picture you shot was of a teenage girl who had been trampled trying to reach the door she had on a green dress you must have seen footage from a security camera he said arent security tapes shot in blackandwhite yet im telling you her dress was green she sniffed dont bother responding you can always construct an alternative explanation reality is full of loopholes at the end of the tunnel was a door with a padlock aida put a key in the lock and said what im going to show you occurred during the earthquake in ninetynine a few days after my arrival in this house demario thought it might have caused the earthquake i didnt learn of it until after his death she threw open the door warm air and a smell of decay rushed out and hugo clapped a hand over his mouth and nose emerging from the wall directly ahead of them wedged in place resting among chunks of rock and white plaster that appeared to have been shattered by its violent incursion were the head and torso of an androgynous giant with chalky skin and long silky white hair and an impassive sphinxlike face it lay on its side the right shoulder and arm crushed beneath its body its left arm protruding from the shattered wall some thirty feet above as though it had been reaching out for someone or something at the instant its momentum ceased the position of the left hand wrist bent and fingers dangling reminded hugo of the hand of jehovah depicted on the ceiling of the sistine chapel halfclotted black blood welled from a gash on its wrist spilling into a pool that had accumulated in a depression in the rock wisps of steam rose from the surface and hugo recalled the soup served in the banquet room at the base of the throat under the collarbone on the shoulder blade and elsewhere were patches of dark webbed veins that showed through the skin like evil snowflakes it came for me said aida or so ive concluded despite the sluggish flow of blood hugo presumed the giant to be dead but then he checked himself and decided it must be a fraud a torso with metal bones and skin fabricated from latex set in place and jammed into a hole the giant twisted its neck and with a laborious effort lifted its head its eyelids opened to reveal cavernous empty sockets crusted with blood and a chthonic groan issued from its throat hugo felt the bellows of its rotting breath and fell back nearly bumping into aida he moved away from her sweat dripping into his eyes demario thought it was an angel she said it doesnt have wings though im not sure what the damned thing is but it refuses to die its like a fucking cockroach the enormous hand overhead clenched into a fist and the giants face contorted it wanted to control me to take me to its house and imprison me just like demario said aida despite the fact that it bungled the job i think it might be god the giant groaned again louder this time and the accompanying stench grew more fecal as if the noise had been dredged up from its bowels it looked to be trying to push itself forward into the room every year it manages to move a few inches said aida at that rate it might break free in a century or two its not very bright but you cant kill it at least i cant ive tried everything even kissing it she wrinkled her nose in disgust doesnt that sound like god to you this big stupid invulnerable thing that resembles us and whose creations are more intelligent than it is the bible left out that part but it would explain a great deal of course she flicked her eyes toward hugo you probably think its a fake and you may be right but even if youre right youre wrong you know hugo wet his lips watch this she said its terrified of me aida approached the giantits nostrils flared and it yielded a keening noise and thrashed about resulting in a heavy fall of plaster dust she backed away and the giants struggles subsided now maybe its a robot but no one else gets that reaction just me go on you try she turned to hugo are you okay you look feverish she stretched out a hand as if to feel his brow and he flinched to avoid her touch i have a bad stomach he said trying to cover his alarm is there a bathroom i can use not down here why dont you use the one in my apartment thanks he hesitated i wont be long take your time she said i want you to be sure what do you mean she adopted a concerned expression but her voice had a sarcastic lilt your stomach i want you to be sure its all right he walked away forcing himself to keep a measured pace and was almost at the door when she called out ill be waiting again he hesitated uncertain what would happen when he stepped through the door the giant made a ghastly noise half a shriek half a grunt as if straining against some internal agony aida stood close by its face threatening to touch it sweat blurred hugos vision and for a moment she looked like a thin black spike driven into the stone hurry she cried the sooner you leave the sooner youll come back to me of his escape hugo recalls very little only that the two men were no longer guarding the stairs and that the streets of barrio tepito into which he fled were packed and filled with demented noise and fractured light and the smells of frying meat and that while making his way through the crowds he was shoved against something hard and glanced up to discover it was a statue of santa muerte bolted to the sidewalk her skull face shrouded in an indigo robehe was trapped in a rough embrace between her scythe and her bony fingers clutching the earths blue globe for months thereafter he tried to slip back into his old habits but he was unable to deploy the nets of faith and logic that had sustained that life when photographing the dead he saw aida chavez in every crowd of onlookers in every group of mourners in the shadowy depths of police vans and the hotly lit interiors of emt vehicles he recognized her postures and attitudes in the vacant faces and akimbo limbs of his subjects he lost his taste for taking pictures of mutilated corpses he had seen death made into life and the bodies were merely life made into death a poor substitute she was remorseless and cruel so fearsome that even god trembled before her but he could no longer deny his attraction to her an attraction that had always been visible to others though not to him in his work nowadays he dreams of returning to the mansion in tepito and he anticipates the rite of communion sipping the giants hot blood marveling at the apocalyptic images on the magical tv and debating the character of aidas destiny with the other suitors in her anteroom not because these things have significance but because their flavors accent the consummation he yearns for the time he will share with her its not so much fear that keeps him from returning what is there to fear after all he understands that he has failed at living as do all men his days have been empty his promise unfulfilled and only in her arms will he learn whether or not his existence has meaning no its rather that he has yet to reach the point where life tips over into death where the need for what she offers be it surcease or something more graspable outweighs everything else he tells himself that once she is free of her doubts the last of his restraints will dissolve and he will come to her like a young man on his wedding night eager to penetrate the secrets of the woman for whom he has waited his entire life a woman who rouses in him a passion like none other each morning and evening he kneels before a statuette of santa muerte that he purchased in the sonora witches market and has been drenched in ritual perfumes and spices above it is pinned a photograph of aida naked on her sofa gazing into the camera with an insensate look as if she has been struck dead with her eyes half lidded and lips parted fingering the folds of flesh between her legs each tendon string every ligament is taut and articulated her erect nipples cast more of a shadow than do her breasts and yet she is beautiful he lights red candles and spits rum on the flames and smokes part of a faros cigarette the brand she favors before leaving it burning at her feet and he offers up a prayer beloved death he will begin be swift in your deliberations and open yourself to me for i would be your consort and companion he will likely falter thenhe has never been a religious man and hes embarrassed to see himself this waybut he fights through the moment pressing his forehead to the base of the statuette allowing the coolness of the stone to pervade and calm him as though it were her potent calmness her coolness that flowed into his skull so that when he continues its with an infirm voice the voice of a lover overwhelmed and exhausted by passion saying i await your summons yet not patiently for with each passing hour my desire grows the colliers venus by caitlÃ­n r kiernan caitlÃ­n r kiernan is the author of seven novels including the awardwinning

for alien and the ammonite violin others her erotica has been collected in two volumesfrog toes and tentacles and tales from the woeful platypus she is currently beginning work on her eighth novel the drowning girl a memoir and a science fiction novella the dinosaurs of mars she lives in providence rhode island it is not an ostentatious museum rather it is only the sort of museum that best suits this modern industrious city at the edge of the high colorado plains this city with its sooty days and dusty crowded streets and night skies that glow an angry orange from the dragons breath of half a hundred bessemer converters the museum is a dignified yet humble assemblage of geological wonders intended as much for the delight and edification of miners and millworkers blacksmiths and butchers as it is for the parvenu and oldmoney families of capitol hill professor jeremiah ogilvy both founder and curator of this colectanea rerum memorabilium has always considered himself a progressive sort and he has gone so far as to set aside one day each and every month when the citys negroes coolies and red indians are permitted access to his cabinet free of charge professor ogilvy wouldand frequently hasreferred to his museum as a most modest endeavor one whose principal mission is to reveal to all the populace of cherry creek the longburied mysteries of those fantastic vanished cycles of the globe too few suspect the marvels that lie just beneath their feet or entombed in the ridges and peaks of the snowcapped chippewan mountains bordering the city to the west cherry creek looks always to the problems of its present day and to the riches and prosperity that may await those who reach its future but with hardly a thought to spare for the past and this is the sad oversight addressed by the ogilvy gallery of natural antiquities before professor ogilvy leased the enormous redbrick building on kipling street erected during the waning days of the silver boom of it served as a warehouse for a firm specializing in the import of exotic dry goods mainly spices from africa and the east indies and to this day it retains a distinctive piquant redolence indeed at times the odor is so strong that a sobriquet has been bestowed upon the museumogilvys pepper pot it is not unusual to see visitors of either gender covering their noses with handkerchiefs and sleeves and oftentimes the solemnity of the halls is shattered by hacking coughs and sudden fits of sneezing regardless the professor has insisted time and again that the structure is perfectly matched to his particular needs and how the curiosity of man is not to be deterred by so small an inconvenience as the stubborn ghosts of turmeric and curry powder coriander and mustard seed besides the apparently indelible odor helps to insure that his rents will stay reasonable on this june afternoon the air in the building seems a bit fresher than usual despite the oppressive heat that comes with the season in the main hall jeremiah ogilvy has been occupied for almost a full hour now lecturing the ladies of the cherry creek chapter of the womens christian temperance union mrs belford and her companions sit on folding chairs fanning themselves and diligently listening while this slight earnest and bespectacled man describes for them the reconstructed fossil skeleton displayed behind him the great anatomist baron cuvier wrote of the plesiosaurus it presents the most monstrous assemblage of characteristics that has been met with among the races of the ancient world now i would have you know it isnt necessary to take this expression literally there are no monsters in nature as the laws of organization are never so positively infringed well it looks like a monster to me mutters mrs larimer seated near the front i would certainly hate to come upon such a thing slithering toward me along a riverbank i should think id likely perish of fright if nothing else theres a subdued titter of laughter from the group and mrs belford frowns the professor forces a ragged smile and repositions his spectacles on the bridge of his nose indeed he sighs and glances away from his audience looking over his shoulder at the skillful marriage of plaster and stone and weldedsteel armature however he continues be that as it may it is more accordant with the general perfection of creation to see in an organization so special as thisand with his ashplant he points once more to the plesiosaurto recognize in a structure which differs so notably from that of animals of our daysthe simple augmentation of type and sometimes also the beginning and successive perfecting of these beings therefore let us dismiss this idea of monstrosity my good mrs larimer a concept which can only mislead us and only cause us to consider these antediluvian beasts as digressions instead let us look upon them not with disgust let us learn on the contrary to perceive in the plan traced for their organization the handiwork of the creator of all things as well as the general plan of creation how very inspirational mrs belford beams and when she softly claps her gloved hands the others follow her example professor ogilvy takes this as his cue that the ladies of the womens christian temperance union have heard all they wish to hear this afternoon on the subject of the giant plesiosaur recently excavated in kansas from the chalky banks of the smoky hill river as one of the newer additions to his menagerie it now frequently forms the centerpiece of the professors daily presentations when the women have stopped clapping mrs larimer dabs at her nose with a swatch of perfumed silk and loudly clears her throat yes mrs larimer a question professor ogilvy asks turning back to the women mr larimeran executive with the front range offices of the german airship company gesellschaft zur fÃ¶rderung der luftschiffahrthas donated a sizable sum to the museums coffers and its no secret that his wife believes her husbands charity would be best placed elsewhere i mean no disrespect professor but it strikes me that perhaps you have gone and mistaken the provenance of that beasts design for my part its far easier to imagine such a fiend being more at home in the sulfurous tributaries of hell than the waters of any earthly ocean perhaps my good doctor it may be that you are merely mistaken about the demons having ever been buried possibly to the contrary it is something which clawed its way up from the pit jeremiah ogilvy stares at her a moment aware that its surely wisest to humor this disagreeable woman to nod and smile and make no direct reply to such absurd remarks but he has always been loathe to suffer fools and has never been renowned as the most politic of men often to his detriment he makes a steeple of his hands and rests his chin upon his fingertips as he replies and yet he says oddly youll note that on both its fore and hind limbs each fashioned into paddles this underworld fiend of yours entirely lacks claws dont you think mrs larimer that we might fairly expect such modifications something not unlike the prominent ungula of a mole perhaps or the robust nails of a cape anteater i mean thats a terrible lot of digging to do all the way from perdition to the prairies of gove county theres more laughter an uneasy smattering that echoes beneath the high ceiling beams and it elicits another scowl from an embarrassed mrs belford but the professor has cast his lot as it were for better or worse and he keeps his eyes fixed upon mrs charles w larimer she looks more chagrined than angry and any trace of her former bluster has faded away as you say professor she manages to make the last three syllables sound like a badge of wickedness very well then professor ogilvy says turning to mrs belford perhaps i could interest you gentlewomen in the celebrated automatic mastodon a bona fide masterpiece of clockwork engineering and steam powerso realistic in movement and appearance you might well mistake it for the living thing newly resurrected from some boggy pleistocene quagmire oh yes i think that would be fascinating mrs belford replies and soon the women are being led from the main gallery up a steep flight of stairs to the mezzanine where the automatic mastodon and the many engines and hydraulic hoses that control it have been installed it stands alongside a finely preserved skeleton of mammut americanum unearthed by prospectors in the yukon and shipped to the gallery at some considerable expense why its nothing but a great hairy elephant mrs larimer protests but this time none of the others appear to pay her much mind professor ogilvys fingers move over the switches and dials on the brass control panel and soon the automaton is stomping its massive feet and flapping its ears and filling the hot pepperscented air with the trumpeting of extinct pachydermata when the ladies of the temperance union have gone and after jeremiah ogilvy has seen to the arrival of five heavy crates of saurian bones from one of his collectors working out of monterey and then after he has spoken with his chief preparator about an overdue shipment of blond kushmi shellac ammonia and sodium borate he checks his pocket watch and locks the doors of the museum though there has been nothing excessively trying about the daynot even the disputatious mrs larimer caused him more than a passing annoyanceprofessor ogilvy finds hes somewhat more weary than usual and is looking forward to his bed with an especial zeal all the others have gone his small staff of technicians sculptors and naturalists and he retires to his office and puts the kettle on to boil he has a fresh tin of formosa oolong and decides that this evening hell take his tea up on the roof most nights theres a fine view from the gallery roof and he can watch the majestic airships docking at the arapahoe station dirigible terminal or just shut his eyes and take in the commingled din of human voices and buckboards the heavy clop of horses hooves and the comforting pandemonium made by the locomotives passing through the city along the colorado and northern kansas railway he hangs the tea egg over the rim of his favorite mug and is preparing to pour the hot water when the office doorknob rattles and neglected hinges creak like inconvenienced rodents jeremiah looks up not so much alarmed as taken by surprise and is greeted by the familiarbut certainly unexpectedface and pale blue eyes of dora bolshaw she holds up her key tied securely on a frayed length of calico ribbon to remind him that he never took it back and to remove any question as to how she gained entry to the locked museum after hours dora bolshaw is an engine mechanic for the rocky mountain reconsolidated fuel company and because of this and her habit of dressing always in mens clothes and the fact that her hands and face are only rarely anything approaching clean she is widely and mistakenly believed to be an inveterate sapphist dora is of course shunned by more proper womensuch as for instance mrs charles w larimerwho blanche at the thought of dames et lesbiennes walking free and unfettered in their midst dora has often mused that despite her obvious preference for men she is surely the most renowned bull dyke west of the mississippi slipping in like a common sneak thief jeremiah sighs reaching for a second cup i trust you recollect the combination to the strongbox along with the whereabouts of that one loose floorboard i most assuredly do she replies like they were the finest details of the back of my hand like it was only yesterday you went and divulged those confidences very good miss bolshaw then i trust this means we can forgo the messy gunplay and knives and whatnot she steps into the office and pulls the door shut behind her returning the key to a pocket of her waistcoat if thats your fancy professor if its only a peaceable sort of evening youre after filling his mug from the steaming kettle submerging the mesh ball of the tea egg and the finely ground leaves jeremiah shrugs and nods at a chair near his desk do you still take two lumps he asks her provided you got nothing stronger she says and only hesitates a moment before crossing the room to the chair no jeremiah tells her nothing stronger if i recall we had an agreement you and i you want your key back professor jeremiah ogilvy pours hot water into a teacup adds a second tea egg and very nearly asks if she imagines that his feelings have changed since the last time they spoke its been almost six months since the snowy january night when he asked her to marry him dora laughed thinking it only a poor joke at first but when pressed she admitted she was not the least bit interested in marriage and whats more confessed she was even less amenable to giving up her work at the mines to bear and raise children when she suggested that he board up his museum instead and for a family take in one or two of the starving guttersnipes who haunt colliers row there was an argument before it was done he said spiteful things cruel jibes aimed at all the tender spots shed revealed to him over the years of their courtship and he knew even as he spoke the words that there would be no taking them back the betrayal of doras trust came too easily the turning of her confidences against her and she is not a particularly forgiving woman so tonight he only almost asks then thinks better of the question and holds his tongue its your key he says keep it you may have need of it again one day fine dora replies letting the chair rock back on two legs its your funeral jeremiah can i ask why youre here that is to what do i owe this unheralded pleasure you may she says staring now at a fossil ammonite lying in a cradle of excelsior on his desk its bound to come out sooner or later but if youre thinking maybe i come looking for old times or a quick poke i wasnt he lies interrupting her well good because i aint which begs the question and its been a rather tedious day miss bolshaw so if we can dispense with any further niceties dora coughs and leans forward the front legs of her chair bumping loudly against the floor jeremiah keeps his eyes on the two cups of tea each one turned as dark now as a sluggish tanninstained bayou im guessing that you still havent seen anyone about that cough he says and that it hasnt improved dora coughs again before answering him then wipes at her mouth with an oilstained handkerchief good to see time hasnt dulled your mental faculties she mutters hoarsely breathlessly then clears her throat and wipes her mouth again it doesnt sound good dora thats all you spend too much time in the tunnels plenty enough people die from anthracosis without ever having lifted a pickax or loaded a mine car as im sure youre well aware i also didnt come here to discuss my health she tells him stuffing the handkerchief back into a trouser pocket its the stink of this place gets me wheezing thats all i swear jeremiah the air in this dump its like trying to breathe inside a goddamn burr grinder thats been used to mill capsicum and black powder no argument there he says and takes the tea eggs from the cups and sets them aside on a dish towel but i still dont know why youre here been some odd goingson down in shaft number seven ever since they started back in working on the molly gray vein i thought shaft seven flooded in october jeremiah says and he adds two sugar cubes to doras cup the professor has never taken his tea sweetened nor with lemon cream or whiskey for that matter when he drinks tea its the tea he wants to taste they pumped it out a while back got the operation up and running again anyway one of the foremen knew we were acquainted and asked if id mind paying you a call i mean do you he asks carrying the cups to the desk do i what do you mind miss bolshaw she glares at him a moment then takes her cup and lets her eyes wander back to the ammonite on the desk so these odd goingson can you be more specific i can if youll give me a chance you ever heard of anyone finding living creatures sealed up inside solid rock two thousand feet below ground he watches her a moment to be sure this isnt a jest youre saying this has happened in shaft seven she sips at her tea then sets the cup on the edge of the desk and picks up the ammonite the fossilized motherofpearl glints iridescent shades of bluegreen and scarlet and gold in the dim gaslight of the office thats exactly what im saying and i seen most of them for myself so i know its not just miners spinning tall tales most of them so its happened more than once dora ignores the questions turning the ammonite over and over in her hands i admit she says i was more than a little skeptical at first theres a shale bed just below the molly gray seam and its chockfull of siderite nodules lots of them have fossils inside matter of fact i think i brought a couple of boxes over to you last summer before the shaft started taking water you did there were some especially nice seed ferns in them as i recall right well anyhow a few days back i started hearing these wild stories that someone had cracked open a nodule and found a live frog trapped inside and then a spider and then worms and so on when i asked around about it i was directed to the geologists shack and sure as hell there were all these things lined up in jars things that come out of the nodules mostly they were dead most of them died right after they came out of the rocks or so im told dora stops talking and returns the ammonite shell to its box then she glances at jeremiah and takes another sip of her tea and you know its not a hoax he asks her i mean you know its not tomfoolery just some of the miners taking these things down with them from the surface then claiming to have found them in the rocks maybe having a few laughs at the expense of their supervisors now that was my first thought but then you saw something that changed your mind jeremiah says and thats why youre here tonight dora bolshaw takes a deep breath and jeremiah thinks shes about to start coughing again instead she nods and exhales slowly he notices beads of sweat standing out on her upper lip and wonders if shes running a fever im here tonight professor ogilvy because two men are dead but yeah since you asked ive seen sufficient evidence to convince me this aint just some jackass thinks hes funny when i voiced my doubts charlie mcnamara split one of those nodules open right there in front of me concretion big around as my fist and she holds up her left hand for emphasis he took up a hammer and gave it a smart tap on one side so it cleaved in two pretty as you please and out crawled a fat red scorpion you ever seen a red scorpion jeremiah and professor ogilvy thinks a moment sipping his tea thats come all the way from taipei city taiwan ive seen plenty of reddish brown scorpions he says for example diplocentrus lindo from the chihuahuan desert and parts of texas the carapace is in fact a dark reddish brown i didnt say reddish brown what i said was red red as berries on a holly bush or a ripe apple red as blood if you want to go get morbid about it charlie cracked open a rock from shaft number seven and a bright red scorpion crawled out thats what youre telling me i am dora nods bastard had a stinger on him big around as my thumb and then some and now she holds out her thumb and two men at the mines have died because of these scorpions jeremiah ogilvy asks no werent scorpions killed them she says and laughs nervously but it was something come out those rocks and then she frowns down at her teacup and asks the professor if hes absolutely sure that he doesnt have anything stronger and this time he opens a bottom desk drawer and digs out the pint bottle of rye he keeps there and he offers it to her dora bolshaw pulls out the cork and pours a generous shot into her teacup but then shes coughing again worse than before and he watches her and waits for it to pass what she told him is not without precedent over the years professor jeremiah ogilvy has encountered any number of seemingly inexplicable reports of living inclusions discovered in stones and often inside lumps of coal living fossils after a fashion he has never once given them credence but rather looked upon these anecdotes as fine examples of the general gullibility of men not unlike the taxidermied jackalopes hes seen in shop windows or tales of ghostly hauntings or of angels or the antics of spiritual mediums they are all quite amusing these phantasma until someone insists that theyre true for starters he could point to an lecture by dr edward daniel clarke the first professor of mineralogy at cambridge university clarke claimed to have been collecting cretaceous sea urchins when he happened across three newts entombed in the chalk to his amazement the amphibians showed signs of life and though two quickly expired after being exposed to air the third was so lively that it escaped when he placed it in a nearby pond to aid in its rejuvenation or a case from the summer of when well diggers in blois france were supposed to have discovered a live toad inside a piece of flint indeed batrachians figure more prominently in these accounts than any other creature and the professor might also have brought to dora bolshaws attention yet another toad said to have been freed from a lump of iron ore the very next year this time somewhere in the east midlands of england the list goes on and on reaching back centuries on may the swedish architect johan grÃ¥berg supposedly witnessed the release of a frog from a block of sandstone so horrified was grÃ¥berg at the sight that he is said to have beaten the beast to death with a shovel an account of the incident was summarily published by grÃ¥berg in the transactions of the swedish academy of sciences a report which was eventually translated into dutch latin german and french too there is the account from by the surgeon ambroise parÃ© who claimed a live toad was found inside a stone in his vineyards in meudon in professor robert plot the first keeper of the ashmolean museum in oxford claimed knowledge of three cases of the toadinthehole phenomenon from britain alone hoaxes perhaps or only the gullible yarns of a prescientific age when even learned men were somewhat more disposed to believing the unbelievable but jeremiah ogilvy mentioned none of these tales instead he sat and sipped his tea and listened while she talked never once interrupting to give voice to his mounting incredulity however her cough forced dora bolshaw to stop several times and despite the rye whiskey toward the end of her story she was hoarse and had grown alarmingly pale her hands were shaking so badly that she had trouble holding her cup steady and then when she was done and he was trying to organize his thoughts she glanced anxiously at the clock and said that she should be going so he walked her downstairs past the celebrated automatic mastodon and petrified titanothere skulls and his prized plesiosaur skeleton standing on the walkway outside the museum the night air seemed sweet after the pepper pot despite the soot from the furnaces and the reek from the open ditches lining either side of kipling street he offered to see her home because the thoroughfares of cherry creek have an unsavory reputation after dark but she laughed at him and he didnt offer a second time he watched until she was out of sight then went back to his office and now its almost midnight and jeremiah ogilvys teacups sit empty and forgotten while he thinks about toads and stones and considers finishing off the pint of rye after she told him of the most recent and bizarre and indeed entirely impossible discovery from shaft seven the thing that was now being blamed for the deaths of two miners he agreed to look at it not it her dora said folding and unfolding her handkerchief she came out of the rocks jeremiah just like that damned red scorpion she came out of the rocks then i am dreaming he says relieved and she smiles not unkindly hes holding her hand this woman who is by turns dora bolshaw and a wispy nervous girl named katharine herschel whom he courted briefly before leaving new haven and the comforts of connecticut for the clamorous frontier metropolis of cherry creek they stand together on some windswept aerie of steel and concrete looking down upon the nightshrouded city and jeremiah holds up an index finger and traces the delicate network of avenues illumined by gas streetlamps and there at his fingertip are the massive hangers and the mooring masts of the arapahoe terminal a dirigible is approaching from the south parting the omnipresent pall of clouds and the ship begins a slow stately turn to starboard to his eyes it seems more like some majestic organism than any human fabrication a heretofore unclassified order of volant cnidaria perhaps titan jellyfish that have forsaken the brine and the vasty deep and adapted to a life in the clouds watching the dirigible he imagines translucent stinging tentacles half a mile long hanging down from its gondola to snare unwary flocks of birds the underside of the dirigible blushes yelloworange as the lacquered cotton of its outer skin catches and reflects the molten light spilling up from all the various ironworks and the copper and silver foundries scattered throughout cherry creek the bones of the world exhumed and smelted to drive the tireless progress of man hes filled with pride gazing out across the city and knowing the small part he has played in birthing this civilization from a desolate wilderness fit for little more than prairie dogs rattlesnakes and heathen savages maybe the world dont exactly see it that way dora says i been thinking lately maybe she dont see it that way at all jeremiah isnt surprised when tendrils of blue lightning flick down from the coalsmoke sky and crackling electric streams trickle across rooftops and down the rainspouts of the high buildings maybe dora continues the world has different plans maybe shes had them all along maybe professor weve finally gone and dug too deep in these old mountains but jeremiah makes a derisive scoffing noise and shakes his head and then he recites scripture while the sky rains ultramarine and the shingles and cobblestones sizzle and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth i dont recall it saying nothing about whatever creepeth under the earth dora mutters though now she looks a little more like katharine herschel her blue eyes turning brown and her trousers traded for a petticoat besides youre starting to sound like that idiotic larimer woman didnt you hear a single solitary word i said to you jeremiah raises his hand still higher as though with only a little more effort he might reach the lightning or the shiny belly of the approaching dirigible or even the face of the creator peering down at them through the smoldering haze is it not fair wondrous he asks dora but its katharine who answers him and she only trades him one question for another repeating doras words didnt you hear a single solitary word i said and they are no longer standing high atop the aerie but have been grounded again grounded now hes seated with dora and charlie mcnamara in the cluttered nook that passes for doras office which is hardly more than a closet situated at one end of the rocky mountain reconsolidated fuel companys primary machine shop the room is littered with a rummage of dismembered enginesevery tabletop and much of the floor concealed beneath castoff gears gauges sprockets and flywheels rustedout boilers and condensers warped piston rods and dials with bent needles and cracked faces theres a profusion of blueprints and schematics some tacked to the wall and others rolled up tight and stacked one atop the other like egyptian papyri or scrolls from the lost library of alexandria everywhere are empty and halfempty oil cans and there are any number of tools for which jeremiah doesnt know the names time being operations have been suspended charlie mcnamara says and then he goes back to using the blade of his pocketknife to dig at the grime beneath his fingernails well at least thats the company line between you me and miss bolshaw here i think chicagos having a good long think about sealing off the shaft permanently permanently jeremiah whispers sorry that he can no longer see the skyline or the docking dirigible i would imagine thats going to mean quite a hefty loss after all the money and work and time required to get the shaft dry and producing again be that as it damn may be dora says brusquely theres more at stake here than coal and pit quotas and quarterly profits yes well jeremiah says staring at the scuffed toes of his boots now then lets get to it yes if i can manage to keep my blasted claustrophobia in check im quite sure well get to the bottom of this no one laughs at the pun because it isnt funny and jeremiah rubs his aching eyes and wishes again that he were still perched high on the aerie the night wind roaring in his ears aint she told you the company geologist asks glancing over at dora what i need you to look at it aint in the hole no more what you need to see well and here he trails off its locked up in a cell at st josephs locked up jeremiah asks and the geologist nods jail would have done her better dora mutters you put sick folks in the hospital killers you put in jails or you put a bullet in the skull and be done with it charlie mcnamara tells dora to please shut the hell up and try not to make things worse than they already are jeremiah shifts uneasily in his chair how did the men die i mean how exactly lungs plumb full up with coal dust charlie says lungs and throat and mouth all stuffed damn near to busting doctor he even found the shit clogging up their stomachs and intestines some of the men dora adds they say theyve heard singing down there said it was beautiful the most beautiful music theyve ever heard jesus in a steam wagon dora aint you got an off switch or something singing aint never killed no one yet and it sure as hell wasnt what got that poor pair of bastards and even as the geologist is speaking the scene shifts again another unprefaced revolution in this dreaming kaleidoscope reality and now the halls and exhibits of the ogilvy gallery of natural antiquities are spread out around him on jeremiahs right the celebrated automatic mastodon rolls glass eyes and its gigantic tusks are garnished with a dripping muculent snarl of vegetation on his left the serpentine neck of the gove county plesiosaur rises gracefully as any swans though he sees that all the fossil bones and the plaster of paris have been transmutated through some alchemy into cast iron the metal is marred by a very slight patina of rust and it occurs to him that considering the beasts ferrous metamorphosis he should remind his staff that theyd best keep the monstrous reptile from swimming or wandering about the rainy streets i cried the day you went away katharine says because for the moment it is katharine with him again not dora i wrote a letter but never sent it i keep it in a dresser drawer there was too much work to do he tells her still admiring the skeleton and much too little of it could be done from new haven behind the plesiosaur the brick and mortar of the gallery walls have dissolved utterly away revealing the trunks of mighty scale trees and innumerable scouring rushes tall as california redwoods here is a dark carboniferous forest the likes of which has not taken root since the mary gray vein at the bottom of shaft seven was only slime and rotting detritus and below these alien boughs a menagerie of primeval beings has gathered to peer out across the aeons so it is not merely a hole knocked in his wall but a hole bored through the very fabric of time she came out of the rocks jeremiah katharine says even though the voice is plainly dora bolshaws just like that damned red scorpion she came out of the rocks youre beginning to put me in mind of a greek chorus he replies keeping his eyes on the scene unfolding behind the plesiosaur great hulking forms have begun to shift impatiently in the shadows there the armored hide of a dozen species of dinosauria and the tangled manes of giant ground sloths and irish elk the leathery wings of a whole flock of pterodactyls spreading wide maybe they worshipped her before there ever were men dora says but then shes coughing again the dry hacking cough of someone suffering from advanced anthracosis katharine has to finish the thought for her maybe they built temples to her and whispered prayers in the guttural tongues of animals and maybe they made offerings after a fashion overhead theres a cacophonous rolling sound that jeremiah ogilvy first mistakes for thunder but then he realizes that its merely the hungry blue lightning at last locating the flammable guncotton epidermis of the airship some of the men katharine whispers they say theyve heard singing down there singing like church hymns they said said it was beautiful the most beautiful music theyve ever heard we come so late to this procession and yet we presume to know so much from behind the iron plesiosaur that anachronistic menagerie gathers itself like a breathing wave of sinew and bone and fur cresting racing toward the shingle jeremiah ogilvy turns away no longer wanting to see maybe in their own way they prayed dora whispers breathlessly and the tall thin man standing before him the collier in his overalls and hard hat who wasnt there just a moment before hefts his pick and brings it down smartly against the floorboards which in the instant steel strikes wood become the black stone floor of a mine all light has been extinguished from the gallery now save that shining dimly from the colliers carbide lantern the head of the pick strikes rock and theres a spark and then the ancient shale begins to bleed and soon thereafter the dream comes apart and the professor lies awake and sweating waiting for sunrise and trying desperately to think about anything but what hes been told has happened at the bottom of shaft seven after his usual modest breakfast of black coffee with blueberry preserves and biscuits and after hes given his staff their instructions for the day and canceled a lecture that he was scheduled to deliver to a league of amateur mineralogists jeremiah ogilvy leaves the museum he walks north along kipling to the intersection with west twentieth avenue where hes arranged to meet dora bolshaw he says good morning and that he hopes shes feeling well but doras far more taciturn than usual and few obligatory pleasantries are exchanged together they take one of the clanking kidneyjarring public omnibuses south and east to st josephs hospital for the bodily and mentally infirm established only two decades earlier by a group of the sisters of charity sent to cherry creek from leavenworth charlie mcnamara is waiting for them in the lobby his long canvas duster so stained with mud and soot that its hard to imagine it was ever anything but this variegated riot of black and gray hes a small mountain of a man all beard and muscle just starting to go soft about the middle jeremiah has thought on more than one occasion this is what men would look like had they descended not from apes but from grizzly bears thank you for coming charlie says i know that youre a busy man but jeremiah tells him to think nothing of it that hes glad to be of whatever service he canif indeed he can be of service charlie and dora nod to one another then and swap nervous salutations jeremiah sees or only thinks he sees something wordless pass between them as well something anxious and wary spoken with the eyes and not the lips you told him charlie asks and dora shrugs i told him the most of it i told him what murdered them two men mulawski and backstrom charlie says dora shrugs again i didnt recollect their names but i dont suppose that much matters charlie mcnamara frowns and tugs at a corner of his mustache no he nods i dont suppose it does i hope youll understand my skepticism jeremiah says looking up speaking to charlie but watching dora whats been related to me regarding the deaths of these two men and what youve brought me here to see id be generous if i were to say it strikes me as a fairy tale or perhaps something from the dime novels it was humedavid humewho said no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle unless the testimony be of such a kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavors to establish dora glares back at him you always did have such a goddamn pretty way of calling a girl a liar she says hell charlie sighs still tugging at his mustache id be concerned dora if he werent dubious ive always thought myself a rational man thats been a source of pride to me out here among the barbarians and them thats just plain ignorant and dont know no better but now after this business yeah well so how about we stop the clucking and get to it dora cuts in and charlie mcnamara frowns at her but then he stops fussing with his whiskers and nods again yeah he says guess im just stalling doesnt precisely fill me with joy the thought of seeing her again if youll just follow me jeremiah they got her stashed away up on the second floor he points to the stairs the sisters aint none too pleased about her being here i think theyre of the general notion that theres more proper places than hospitals for demons demons jeremiah says and dora bolshaw laughs a dry humorless laugh thats what theyre calling her dora tells him the nuns i mean you might as well know that got a priest from annunciation sitting vigil outside the cell reading latin and whatnot theres talk of an exorcism at this pronouncement charlie mcnamara makes a gruff dismissive noise and motions more forcefully toward the stairwell he mutters something rude about popery and superstition and lady engine jockeys who cant keep their damn pieholes shut charlie you know im not saying anything that isnt true dora protests but jeremiah ogilvy thinks hes already heard far too much and seen far too little he steps past them walking quickly and with purpose to the stairs and the geologist and the mechanic follow close on his heels i would like to speak with her he says i would like to speak with her alone and jeremiah takes his face away from the tiny barred window set into the door of the cell where theyve confined the woman from the bottom of shaft seven for a moment he stares at the company geologist and then his eyes drift toward dora maybe you didnt hear me right charlie mcnamara says and furrows his shaggy eyebrows she dont talk leastways not near as anyone can tell youre wasting your breath arguing with him dora mumbles and glances at the priest whos standing not far away eyeing the locked door and clutching his bible might as well try to tell the good father here that the queen of heaven got herself knocked up by a stable hand jeremiah turns back to the window his face gone indignant and bordering now on choleric charlie im neither a physician nor an alienist but youve brought me here to see this woman having looked upon her the reason why continues to escape me however that said if i am to examine her i cannot possibly hope do so properly from behind a locked door its not safe the priest says very softly you must know that professor ogilvy it isnt safe at all peering in past the steel bars jeremiah shakes his head and sighs shes naked father shes naked and cant weigh more than eighty pounds what possible threat might she pose to me and while were at it why precisely is she naked oh they gave her clothes dora chimes in well what passes for clothes in a place like this but she tears them off wont have none of it them white gowns and what have you she is brazen the priest all but whispers has anyone even tried to bathe her jeremiah asks and charlie coughs that aint coal dust and mud youre seeing he says near as anyone can tell that theres her skin this is ludicrous all of it jeremiah grumbles this is not the middle ages and you do not have some infernal siren or succubus locked up in there whatever else you may believe shes a woman charlie and having sacrificed my very busy day to come all the way out here i would like now to speak with her i was only explaining jeremiah how i aint of the notion its such a good idea thats all charlie says then looks at the priest you got the keys father the priest nods reluctantly and then he produces a single tarnished brass key from his cassock jeremiah steps aside while he unlocks the door im going in with you dora says no youre not jeremiah tells her i need to speak with this woman alone but she dont talk dora says again beginning to sound exasperated forcing the words out between clenched teeth the priest turns the key and hidden tumblers and pins respond accordingly dora you go scare up an orderly charlie mcnamara says hell scare up two just in case the cell door opens and as jeremiah ogilvy steps across the threshold the woman inside keeps her black eyes fixed upon him but she makes no move to attempt an escape she stays crouched on the floor in the southeast corner and makes no move whatsoever immediately the door bangs shut again and the priest relocks it just so theres no doubt on the matter charlie mcnamara shouts from the hallway youre a goddamn fool and now the woman in the cell smiles jeremiah ogilvy stands very still for a moment taking in all the details of her and her cramped quarters there is a mattress and a chamber pot but no other manner of furnishings or facilities if he held his arms out to either side they would touch the walls if he took only one step backward or only half a step hed collide with the locked door good morning he says and the woman blinks her eyes they remind jeremiah of twin pools of crude oil spewed fresh from the well and poured into her face there appear to be no irises no sclera no pupils unless these eyes are composed entirely of pupil she blinks and the orbs shimmer slick in the dim light of the hospital cell good morning he says to her again though more quietly than before and with markedly less enthusiasm is it true that you do not speak are you a mute then are you deaf as well as dumb she blinks again and then the woman from shaft seven cocks her head to one side as though carefully considering his question her hair is very long and straight reaching almost down to the floor it seems greasy and is so very black it might well have been spun from the sky of a moonless night and yet her skin is far darker so much so that her hair almost glows in comparison theres no word in any human language for a blackness so complete so inviolate and he thinks what can you be eyes spun from a midnight with neither moon nor stars nor gas jets nor even the paltry flicker of tallow candles and your skin carved from ebony planks and then jeremiah chides himself for entertaining such silly florid notions for falling prey to such unscientific fancies and he takes another step toward the woman huddled on the floor so it is true he says softly you are indeed without a voice and at that her smile grows wider her lips parting to reveal teeth like finely polished pegs shaped from chromite ore and she laughs if her laugh differs in any significant way from that of any other woman the difference is not immediately apparent to jeremiah ogilvy i am with voice she says then for any who wish to hear me i am with voice jeremiah is silent and he glances over his left shoulder at the door charlie mcnamara is staring in at him through the bars i am with voice she says a third time jeremiah turns back to the naked woman but you did not see fit to speak with the doctors nor the sisters nor to the men who transported you here from the mines they did not wish to hear not truly i am with voice yet i will not squander it not on ears that do not yearn to listen we are quite entirely unalike in this respect you and i and i think in many others he tells her and the womans smile grows wider still those two men who died tell me madam did they yearn to listen are you the one who has been chosen to serve as my judge she asks rather than providing him with an answer certainly not jeremiah replies and he clears his throat he has begun to detect a peculiar odor in the cell not the noisomeness he would have expected from such a room as this but another sort of smell kerosene he thinks and then ice though hes never noticed that ice has an odor and if it does it hardly seems it would much resemble that of kerosene i was asked to see you and you have the woman says you have seen me you have heard me but do you know why professor quite honestly no i have to confess thats one of several points that presently have me stumped so i shall ask do you know why the womans smile fades a bit though not enough that he cant still see those chromite teeth or the inkblack gums that hold them she closes her eyes and jeremiah discovers that hes relieved that they are no longer watching him that he is no longer gazing into them you are here before me because you revere time she says you stand in awe before it but do not insult it with worship you revere time though that reverence has cost you dearly prying away from your heart much that you regret having lost you understand time professor when so few of your race do the man and woman who brought you here they sense this in you and they are frightened and would seek an answer to alleviate their fears can they hear you he asks and the woman crouched on the floor shakes her head not yet she says that may change of course all things change with time and then she opens her eyes again and if anything they seem oilier than before and they coruscate and swim with restless rainbow hues you killed those two miners the woman sits up straighter and licks her black lips with a blacker tongue jeremiah tries not to let his eyes linger on her small firm breasts those nipples like onyx shards this matters to you their deaths she asks him and he finds that hes at a loss for an honest answer an answer that he would have either charlie or dora or the priest overhear i was only sleeping the woman says you caused their deaths by sleeping no professor i dont think so they caused their deaths by waking me and she stands then though it appears more as though he is seeing her unfold the kerosene and ice smell grows suddenly stronger and she flares her small nostrils and stares down at her hands from her expression equal parts curiosity and bemusement jeremiah wonders if she has ever noticed them before they gave you this shape he asks her the two miners you killed she lets her arms fall to her sides and smiles again a terror of the formless she says of that which cannot be discerned an inherent need to draw order from chaos even you harbor this weakness despite your reverence for time you divide indivisible time into hours and minutes and seconds you dissect time and fashion all these ages of the earth and give them names that you will not dread the abyss which is the true face of time you are not so unlike them she motions toward the door they erect their cities because the unbounded wilderness offends them they set the night on fire that they might forever blind themselves to the stars and to the relentless sea of the void in which those stars dance and spin are born and wink out and now jeremiah ogilvy realizes that the woman has closed the space separating them though he cannot recall her having taken even the first step toward him she has raised a hand to his right cheek and her gentle fingers are as smooth and sharp as obsidian he does not pull away though it burns her touch he does not pull away though he has now begun to glimpse what manner of thing lies coiled behind those oily shimmering eyes ten million years from now she says there will be no more remaining of the sprawling clockwork cities of men nor of their tireless enterprise nor all their marvelous works no more than a few feet of stone shot through with lumps of steel and glass and concrete but you know that professor ogilvy even though you chafe at the knowledge and this is another reason they have brought you here to me you see ahead as well as behind i do not fear you he whispers no she says you dont because you dont fear time and there is little else remaining now of me it is not so very different than his dream of the castiron plesiosaur and the burning dirigible the shadows pressing in now from all sides they flow from the bituminous pores of her body and wrap him in silken folds and bear away the weight of the illusion of the present the extinct beasts and birds and slithering leviathans of bygone eras and eras yet to come peer out at him and he hears the first wave breaking upon the first shore and he hears the last and professor jeremiah ogilvy doesnt look away from the woman they have not yet guessed she says the true reason theyve brought you here perhaps they will not until it is done likely they will never comprehend i know you he says i have always known you yes she says and the shadows have grown so thick and rank now that he can barely breathe and he feels her seeping into him lungs plumb full up with coal dust lungs and throat and mouth all stuffed damn near to busting you ever seen a red scorpion jeremiah release me she says her voice become a hurricane squall blowing across warm liassic seas and the fiery cacophony of meteorites slamming into an azoic earth still raw and molten and too the calving of immense glaciers only a scant few millennia before this day there are none others here who may she says it is the greatest agony being bound in this instant and in this form and without beginning to fathom the how of it the unknowable mechanics of his actions he does as shes bidden him to do the woman from the bottom of shaft seven comes apart and suddenly the air in the cell is filled with a mad whirl of coal dust behind him the priests brass key is rattling loudly inside the padlock and there are voices shoutingmerely human voicesand then dora is calling his name and dragging him backward into now and out into the stark light of the hospital corridor the summer wears on june becoming july and by slow degrees professor jeremiah ogilvys strength returns to him and his eyes grow clear again his sleep is increasingly less troubled by dreams of the pitchcolored woman who was no woman and the fevers are increasingly infrequent as all men do even those who revere time he begins to forget and in forgetting his mind and body can heal a young anatomist from lawrence was retained as an assistant curator to deliver his lectures and to oversee the staff and the daytoday affairs of the museum as charlie mcnamara predicted the chicago offices of the rocky mountain reconsolidated fuel company permanently closed shaft seven and whats more pumped more than twenty thousand cubic yards of portland cement into the abandoned mine in the evenings when her duties at the shop are finished dora bolshaw comes to his bedroom she sits with him there in that modest chamber above the hall of cenozoic life and the mezzanine housing the celebrated automatic mastodon she keeps him company and they talk when her cough is not so bad she reads to him and they discuss everything from the teleological aspects of the theories of alfred russel wallace to which alloys and displacement lubricators make for the most durable steam engines now and then they discuss other lesscerebral matters and there have been apologies from both sides for that snowy night in january sometimes their discussions stray into the wee hours and sometimes dora falls asleep in his arms and is late for work the next day the subject of matrimony has not come up again but jeremiah ogilvy has trouble recalling why it ever seemed an issue of such consequence what did she say to you dora finally asks him one night so very late in july that its almost august the woman from the mine i mean so you couldnt hear her he says we heard youme and charlie and the priestand thats all we heard he tells her what he remembers which isnt much and afterward she asks for what seems the hundredth time if he knows what the woman was and he tells her no that he really has no idea whatsoever something lost and unfathomable that came before he says something old and weariful that only wanted to lie down and go back to sleep she killed those men sitting up in his bed two feather pillows supporting him jeremiah watches her for almost a full minute by the clock on the mantle before he replies and then he glances toward the window and the orange glow of the city sky beyond the pane of glass i recollect dora a tornado hitting a little town in iowa back in july i think and she says yeah she remembers that too and that the town in question was pomeroy lots of people were killed he continues or rather an awful lot of people died during the storm now tell me do we hold the cyclone culpable for all those deaths or do we accept that the citizens of pomeroy were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time dora doesnt answer but only sighs and twists a lock of her hair her face is less sooty than usual and her nails less grimy her hands almost clean and jeremiah considers the possibility that shes discovered the efficacy of soap and water would you like to sit at the window awhile she asks him and he tells her that yes he would so dora helps jeremiah into his wheelchair but then lets him steer it around the foot of the bed and over to the window she follows a step or two behind and when he asks she opens the window to let in the warm night breeze he leans forward resting his elbows against the sill while she massages a knot from his shoulders it is not so late that there arent still people on the street men in their top hats and bowlers women in their bustles and bonnets the evening resounds with the clop of horses hooves and the commotion made by the trundling smoking woodburning contraption that sprays kipling street with water every other night to help keep the dust in check looking east across the rooftops he catches sight of a dirigible rising into the smog we are of a moment he says speaking hardly above a whisper and dora bolshaw doesnt ask him to repeat

rock dust in their lungs ive met the dead and theres more than ninetysix several hundred enough to fill a big school cafeteria if you could get them to muster out you could count one came for me on sunday as i sat by a blackpainted wroughtiron cafÃ© tablewhich is not such a great idea in august when the intheshade temperature is protected from the worst of the sun by an umbrella and a chinaberry tree a pint of pear cider rested by my hand a nibbled ploughmans lunch spread across a plate id pushed to the other side of the table the stilton was real but the cheddar might as well have been velveeta just like vegas just like me the genius loci of las vegas its all this facade of the exotic over solid topeka i had finished with the sunday reviewjournalsun and was using it as an underpinning for my heaps of poker chips the top story was about martin powers the grandson of the owner of the babylon casino who was up on racketeering charges viva las vegas i was interested in the poker chips you can build cantilevered structures from them where the only things holding them together are gravity and leverage and the weight of the pieces the heavier the chip and the wider the better some of these were stratosphere millenniumfireworks chips and some were blackandwhite dollar chips from the old silver slipper which isnt there anymore the red edges and the black edges made a pattern like the facade on a brick victorian i was engrossed in trying to match the red and black ink of the spill of card suits small as a gilas beaded scales sleeving my left arm and curling across my throat i had stopped to think about my next move while smearing blue cheese on a white roll with all the flavor and consistency of drywallbecause im vegas and we can get you wyders pear cider and branston pickle but were not smart enough to figure out that a ploughmans lunch is only as good as the breadand after a minute or two i noticed somebody watching from the railing i was pretty sure he was a ghost nobody walks in vegas if they can help it one its too hot two were not real good on traffic signals and respecting the crosswalks and all that sissy east coast stuff three i saw him otherwise not in the hardworld way and finally he was transparent which was a clue even in the absence of apparent crushing damage i lifted up my eye patch and scratched under it notsoincidentally taking a long look with my otherwise eye while blocking it from casual view with the hand he stared like a dog who is very politely noticing that youre eating a steak dinner i tipped cider onto the pavement the ghost brightened appreciably but raised a hand and shook his head more for me i finished the pint and set the glass down so it wouldnt tip on the latticework tabletop the ghost turned away looking over his shoulder he couldnt have said follow me better if he was lassie i pinned a twenty and a ten under my empty glass stuffed a last piece of cheddar into my mouth left the chips and vaulted the white picket fence between the patio and the sidewalk painted wood scorched my palm lucky the rail wasnt iron i blew on my palm and shook my fingers out as i followed the ghost down tropicana toward the strip wheels sizzling by on my left each car kicked up a wave of heat and the oil stench of baking asphalt business owners tape towels around the handles of doors in a vegas summer and children blister bare feet on manhole covers my feet baked in my docs the leather of my pants squeaking with every step up and down my left arm the sun picked out the clubs and spades in hot pinpricks in the lot i yanked on my helmet jacket and glovesnot necessarily in that orderand rocked the old bmw off the stand before spurring it to life a fortuitous break in traffic put me on the road ghosts keep up with motor vehicles just fineor maybe i should say on the bike i could move almost as fast as the ghost wanted my guide led me up maryland through the old downtown with its square landclaim grid of numbered streets then up las vegas boulevard where it turns into fifth street he turned west on carey along a strip of californiastyle stucco homes with sixfoot block walls interspersed with desert lots he stopped between mlk and rancho and i let the bike glide to a halt alongside light planes from the north las vegas airport skimmed overhead cutting across a sky with all color baked out on my right more housing developments swelled like cactuses only visible as sandcolored block walls and the red tile roofs rising behind them on my left though the scraggy trees and scrub desert of an old ranch estate were marked by a weathered sign the back and both sides enclosed by housingtract walls you couldnt say much for the curb appeal bmws dont roar like american bikes or whine like japanese ones but mine rumbled as i guided it up the dirt driveway following a serpentine course to avoid the ruts and stones the name on the mailbox was bukvajova which really seemed like it ought to be familiar dust dulled the maroon gas tank and dimmed the chrome on the handlebars before i turned in behind a windbreak of ratty evergreens the house wasnt in any better shape than the vantage from the street suggested mustardcolored paint peeled in scrofulous plates shaggy as cedar bark i might have thought it wasnt inhabited abandoned structures can stand for decades in the desert even if they arent built of stone and a lot of the old vegas houses were made of cinderblock vegas is a city with no history though we have a conspiracy of dismemory tear it down pave it over build something new nothing left but the poker chips and the elephants graveyard of neon signs tucked away in an alleged museum thats not even open to the public if the historical society takes an interest in a building six will get you ten it burns down within a season people forget remake themselves come here to change their lives and their luck sometimes it works small branches from a moribund elm littered the houses tarpaper roof the tree was doomed but not dead dutch elm disease kills from the crown i made sure the kickstand was on hard earth and walked toward the house my ghost had vanished though i had expected to see him under the wind chimes on the front porch a crystalline clinking wasnt only from the chimes around the side another nearly dead elm swayed in the breeze its fingerling branches had been broken off blunt and onto each stick was thrust a colored bottlegold violet emerald tÅ· nant ruby maltine amber ayers cobalt blue they tinkled as the tree moved and i wondered how they managed not to smash in anything like a real wind i was tipping up my eye patch to get a better look when my footsteps alerted someone which is to say a burro in the yard behind the house started braying as if badly in need of oiling and that was the end of my stealth the otherwise glow of trapped ghosts swirled inside the bottles on the dying elm i felt i should hear them tapping scratching at the inside of their rainbow prisons but only the light breeze soughed across the mouths of the bottles some people say the sound is the evil spirits crying for release but its not ive never seen the point in trapping ghosts the ones you could catch in a bottle tree are harmless and the ones that arent harmless you couldnt catch in a bottle tree i wondered where my lassieghost was and where i was supposed to find the well with timmy in it and as i was wonderingthe burro still sawing away no doubt infuriating the suburban neighborsthe front door banged open hard enough that my boots cleared earth i flipped down my eye patch no point making an innocent bystander look at a scarred socket like odin i traded the eye for other things unlike odin it didnt involve a gallows tree and i didnt expect anything in trade but a plain pine box and a hasty burial what i got was being made the genius of las vegas guardian of the sin city and all her fallen angels its a strange old world the woman standing on the shaded porch was in her sixties i thought stoopshouldered yellowing gray hair tucked behind her ears despite the heat she dressed in a raveling cardigan pulled lumpy over a blueandwhite starpatterned shirt that hung untucked to the thighs of shapeless brown slacks she scowled through filthy glasses whos there mushy diction as if shed forgotten to slide her dentures in when i turned to her she leaned forward against one of the fourbyfours holding up the porch roof peering through strings of hair jackie when i stepped from the shade of the dying elm sun thumped my head like hot sand there were a couple of wizened fortyfoot mexican fan palms on the property but they cast no more shade than telephone poles jackie she said and kissed air i thinkno i dont remember you i dont think weve met i said but as i said it i wasnt sure anymore her cloudy blue eyes the shape of her nose useless if shes lived in vegas sixty years i might have seen her hundreds of times especially back when there were only a hundred thousand two hundred thousand people in town but i didnt remember her now maam is this your bottle tree this is private property she blinked sagging lids my bottle tree what do you know about bottle trees theyre for catching ghosts i said protection from evil spirits ms bukvajova mrs she shrugged all the same to her do you have a lot of evil spirits here ms bukvajova a few she said cant you hear em singing away in there dont you remember what thats good for jackie the breeze was enough to ruffle the fans on the palms but its sighs and the chiming were still the only sounds rising from the bottle tree it sounded a little like a glass armonicabenjamin franklins instrument once thought to cause neurological damage because of its vibrations but that might have just been lead poisoning from the paint on the crystal bowls thats just the wind i said those ghosts are harmless ms bukvajova she laughed and came out of the shade of the porch into the sunlight she stumped forward hands stuffed now into the pockets of her mustardcolored cardigan it matched her house the sweater hung from her stooped shoulders like a yoke supporting her fists in slings harmless she said but not useless she pushed past me trailing unwashed sourness flakes of dead skin nested among the roots of her eyebrows and in her thinning hair she pulled a hand from her pocket to tap a metal church key against the base of an ambercolored bottle the sighing and moaning redoubled just the wind she pulled the bottle off the branch and popped a champagne cork into the top then set the corked bottle at the base of the tree im sure i should remember you she said she pulled down another bottle and corked it but had to get a stepladder for the third it was just leaned up under the eaves obviously she used it a lot im not sure theres anything to remember she snorted i forget a lot these days jackie its the price of getting old what do you forget i wasnt too sure of the wisdom of a sixtyyearold woman climbing ladders but its not a citys job to babysit children and old people i might have volunteered to climb up anyway but i wasnt sure i wanted to abet whatever she was doing with the ghosts especially if one were lassie whatever i was opening my mouth to say slipped out of memory even as i was reaching to turn it into words so if theyre harmless but useful i asked instead what do you use them for ms bukvajova was halfway up the ladder she turned stiffly holding on to a fragile dead branch and tapped her forehead with her free hand all sorts of things some i cook myself and some i sell ghosts are memories i reckon theyve got more uses than i recollect even and i recollect a few i made sure to write em down when she clambered down she held a strawyellow bottle in one hand her thumb pressed over the neck she shook the bottle as if shaking up a soda so it would spray and raised it to her mouth the gesture was deft and quick her throat worked as if she chugged a beer her lashes crusted with yellow grains brushed her cheek i watched fascinated searching for any sign of change tatters of otherwise light blew around her but that was all when she lowered the bottle and belched she looked the same hits the spot it does she said and wiped moist lips on the back of her wrist another man might have picked a fight taken the bottles away smashed the tree but then there was the question of what good that would do and who had the right of the matter there was no law against catching ghosts neither mans nor moral they were dead already exploiting a lingering shade to be honest bothers me a damned sight less than eating bacon does and i eat bacon but it made me curious vegas is chinks and cracks and magic grows in some of them im the sort of person who can usually be found poking around deserted lots with a field guide so to speak trying to decide if what i have here is really yellow wood sorrel or something else entirely i like to know what the growing things are so i kept thinking about ms bukvajova as i guided the bmw back through light sunday traffic pausing in front of the gray block latticeandglass facade of st christophers on bruce near the north las vegas police station kids squealed in the public swimming pool down the street chlorine hung acrid on the air children really are tougher than adults it was enough to make me sneeze from here stewart emerged after the exodus blond hair immediately evident in the sunlight i wondered if he had stayed inside to introduce himself to the priest stewarts churchgoing just not religious or just not any one religion in particular he visits them by turns hes the other half of las vegaswell half is the wrong word theres overlapand my city has more churches per capita than any other in america and no that doesnt include wedding chapels stewart sauntered up to where i stood bracing the bike and ran a hand up my arm i handed him his helmet he left a lip print on the glossy side of mine before strapping his own in place then his feet were on the pegs and we sailed into the traffic stream sliding into the space left in front of an old man in a gold lincoln town car who had hit the brakes in shock at the public display of affection we were already in the neighborhood so we swung by jerrys nugget to avail ourselves of the legendary eightdollar prime rib for his first lunch and my second one somehow we wound up going to the italian place instead and stewart stuffed garlic bread into his mouth and swallowed beer until the pizza and salad showed like id been keeping him on bread and water stewart wasnt big he was fairhaired wiry and he bit his thumbnail while he was thinking i liked watching him eat i liked his enthusiasm and flightiness and the fact that i knew it was all a pose how was church i asked when hed slowed down enough to answer questions he pushed a piece of pepperoni around with his fingertip then licked the grease off the nail boring we need cuter priests in this town they dont pick them for the way they fill out their trousers i answered complacently i assembled a forkful of lettuce onion and a bite of pizza with crushed reds and parmesan and stuffed it into my mouth no matter how many times i did that stewart still looked at me in disbelief hey it tasted good what do you want to do tonight dunno he said sunday night in vegas we could go to a movie we could go to a bar mmmph not such a bad idea though by the way he tilted his head and lifted an eyebrow what did you do today i shrugged hung out at the crown and anchor drove around the ghosts are back ah so he said and flicked beer at me i ducked laughing and the waiter shot us a dirty look didnt bother me service is always slow in there and stewart and i overtip sounds like a thrilling day i didnt decide not to tell stewart about ms bukvajova it just you knowcompletely slipped my mind it turned out that what we did that night was go to the circus i like circus folk and i love the circus so because stewart loves me we go to the circus every time its in town well vegas has its own local circuses a new cirque du soleil every couple of years and weve seen them all including the traveling shows the animal acts are being phased out after what happened to roy horn but its a big deal when an arena show comes through and an even bigger one when its a tent show call me oldfashioned but its not really a circus without a big top oestman brothers circus and traveling show had set up on the desert lot near sahara the one theyre always going to build a casino on any day now we arrived an hour and a half before showtime light still smeared across the sky holding the dark at bay not that darkness stood much chance against vegas night tried to fall as we wandered the side tentsviewing fortunetellers and caged tigers in their shaded enclosure munching on cotton candyand it only changed the quality of light neon saturated the atmosphere heavyhung so i expected to see it move in swirls with each current stewart and i walked through it as if it were a fog at one point he grabbed my hand and i turned to look at him and saw him crowned in ghostly radiance i ducked down and kissed him on the grin despite the sharp intake of breath from a scandalized matron on the far side of the candyapple booth i hoped the guy guessing her weight guessed high when i leaned back the light was still there and it buoyed me it has its own otherwise energy that light in vegas its as much me as my skin and fingers as much my partner as stewart isalien and presentso sometimes i feel it from the inside and sometimes i feel it like a caress somewhere between the rigged dart game and the crocodile boy we finished our junk food and joined the people moving inside under the big top it was sawdust and lights and collapsible bleachers and stewart and i clomped up them to find our seats he promptly got up again to fetch popcorn and cokesi have no idea where he puts itand was back before the seats finished filling up hes got a knack for picking the quick line just lucky like that i had my head craned back staring up at the highest point of the big top when he slid a bag of roasted chestnuts into my hand they call it the king pole i said the whole tent hangs off it that used to be one hell of a tree yeah he said so was the one odin hanged himself off of and look where that got himoverrun by christians blind and forgotten i said and touched my eyepatch stewart winked under blond bangs and stole a chestnut back it was a nice enough little circus they had a couple of elephants that came on toward the end of the show and as i sat there and ate chestnuts i wondered if they were abused not everybody treats their animals as well as siegfried and roy yeah i worry more about animals than people which is stupid some folks justify it by saying that animals dont make the choices that lead to their torment and destruction but its a bit facile to pretend people have any more autonomy in reality the rat race is a handicap except the previous winners start with less weight not as far to run and a better knowledge of the track and the more you fail to keep up the more weight gets piled on its a scary business life this was a threering circus where theres a big act in the center ringthats where the elephants wereand something smaller on either side because we got our tickets late we were over by the concurrent clowns and stewart seemed to be watching them more than the elephants he doesnt like animal acts i like watching the ringmaster when the elephants trouped out i knew it had to be time for the capper the man in the sequined red topcoat ran out to the middle of the center ring and gestured for his microphone which glided from the bigtop to be caught with a conjurors flair behind him trapezes snaked from the scaffolding running men brought out a pedestal the knotted shroud of the net rose and grew taut like an emerged moth plumping chrysalisrumpled wings while the ringmasters voice rang across the stands ladies and gentlemen children of all ages may i direct your attention to the center ring you have seen aerialists and acrobats you have seen wire dancers and tumblers funambulists and flyers but you have never seen anything like this all the way from the primeval forest of mysterious moravia i give youthe flying bukvajovas huh i said as the catcher was winched up to his trapeze and the first of the flyers began to ascend the platform i could swear ive heard that name stewart gave me a funny look theyve been through town before we saw them about ten years ago with a different circus then and i dont think that was the first time im pretty sure they were here when the dam was going in oh i said of course and ate another nut one of those multigenerational circus families the ringmasters microphone reeled back into the stratosphere he fled the ring in a scatter of sequin reflections something like an animate mirror ball i shrugged off a chill jackie somebody stepped on my grave stewart stole another nut maybe the ringmaster is evil i tried to steal it back resulting in a wrestling match that scattered popcorn across the floorboards and glares across nearby patrons casualties of war to add insult to injury stewart popped the kidnappee into his mouth before i managed to retrieve it no evil ringmasters i said i wont allow it screw ray bradbury that was a carny stewart said complacently defending what remained of his popcorn and anyway bradburys not my type later that night when the city glow was creeping around the edges of the hotelroom blackout curtains brightly enough to compete with my bedside lamp i lay staring at the ceiling i was supposed to be reading a book stewart was playing a gameboy but the beeps were intermittent i let the paperback fall across my chest hey stewart mm have you noticed yourself forgetting things like my car keys smart ass no like things you used to know street names your first girlfriends favorite color that sort of stuff i wonder how youd know if you forgot something he said hitting pause on his game i mean really forgot it do you ever think about alzheimers or a brain injury youd never know what you were missing would you no i said picking up my book i hadnt been paying enough attention to the last three pages and had to flip back until i found something i remembered reading or yes maybe i dont know i mean if you were losing time like not making new memories probably not but if you were forgetting things like your husbands or wifes name then probably and you might try to cover it up he looked at me suspiciously hey i said i told you i didnt remember where id heard the name he stared i stared back he glanced down at the gameboy with a rude noise hey i said to make him throw a pillow what was your name again nobody sleeps in las vegas and so neither do i but if i did i have to admit ghosts would have a pretty good means of waking you up nothing like a hovering cold spot on the back of your neck to get you out of bed in a hurry i managed not to shriek which was good because stewart was sort of curled up on my chest watching a burt reynolds moviei know but far be it from me to complain about my boyfriends tasteand i might have shocked him into apoplexy instead i sucked in a breath and disentangled myselfover his protestsbefore sliding out of bed to face my molester the ghost looked awfully familiar as if i had seen him somewhere before but he was just one of the little ghosts of the dam harmless and inoffensive by the rocking and beckoning he wanted something from me lassie wants something i said to stewart because the ghosts demeanor reminded me of a worried dog shh stewart said this is the good bit but the ghost i repeated wants something oh and im supposed to figure out what but he hit the mute button sat up and drawled hello sailor i winced mostly out of habit he wasnt actually camping it up all that much i feel like i know him i said while the ghost stared at me with hemorrhagespotted eyes jeff soble stewart stood of course hed know the guys name died on the dam people die all the time you know they get unlucky something random and stupid goes wrong i know i said we both knew you dont get to be a genius until youre buried and sung over stewart and me we died young looking at stewart i realized i didnt remember how id died i opened my mouth to ask scratching idly under my eye patch and realized something else that spacethat hollow place of just not knowingfelt like a cold shadow had slid off my soul whatever had happened it hadnt been pretty or pleasant and i breathed easier in its absence the ghost beckoned again i caught the motion in my peripheral vision i was still looking at stewart what do we do follow him stewart said so we did stewart grabbing his keys on the way out the door stewarts mode of transportation is inevitably some terrifying old beater replete with rust spotshard to come by here in the desertand hardlight peeling the nevada sun can fade even automobile paint to creamy yellow in a decade or two this old corolla had been red once about the color of tomato soup you could still see the color around the frame when you opened the doors the amazing thing was that it was in perfect working order which was the other inevitability about stewarts old cars he loved to tinker with them and if you ignored small inconveniences like the lack of modern safety features they ran like dreams he usually wound up reselling them for percent of book value to random people who needed them more than he did and then finding another old junker to fix up the next week i like stewart a lot i mean besides the obvious anyway i piled into the passenger seatthe desert night hadnt actually turned chill but by comparison with the day the mideighties felt on the cool sideand turned the radio off before he got the key into the ignition he shot me a dirty look but trust me stewarts taste in music isnt any better than his taste in movies or men the car started right up though he had to thump the dash to make the headlights glow we had been staying at the suncoast its a locals place lowkey and off the strip so we just headed back down the slope where the western side of the city rises toward the mountains its all indistinguishable interchangeable new construction up there and every year the cougars come back to their winter range to find houses have sprung up where there was nothing but cactus before and theres nothing for them to eat but bugeyed rat dogs unfortunately for the cougars people get upset when they behave in this perfectly understandable fashion even though the houses reach all the way up to the canyons now the ghost surfed in our headlights almost washed away by their glow and the light rising like steam from the valley we didnt have to descend far to lose the view once we were on the summerlin parkway the city dropped out of sight vanishing because we were now a part of it even this late there was still a steady stream of cars once we reached the the highways dont really grow quiet until after three decatur still had some traffic too but it wasnt anything like rush hour our gridlock isnt bad by west coast standards but people keep moving in and it keeps on getting worse it doesnt help that theres a shortage of streets that go all the way through either northsouth or eastwest a lot of them end mysteriously in a desert lot or the wall of a housing development only to pick up again as if nothing had intervened like a relationship on the other side of a secret affair by the time we turned onto carey i had a prickly feeling and the traffic had thinned to nothing i could still see the cars if i leaned over and glanced in the rearview mirror they flowed north and south on decatur in a soft intermittent stream red and white like signal fires i longed to be among them but stewart was driving and the ghost was leading us into darkness i settled back and crossed my arms over my seatbelt wondering why i felt the urge to strike out to escape oh god i said pull over pull over when stewart pulled off onto the crunching hardpan shoulder i bailed out of the little car and crouched in the shadow of the door vomiting the ghost hovered as if my illness concerned it or maybe i was slowing it down it didnt matter we were here the ghost led us down a gravel drive past a ranch sign and a mailbox adorned with the name bukvajova in reflective letters i feel like i should know that name i said and stewart looked at me funny he stopped the car well back from the house and touched the headlights off we opened the doors in unison like thugs in a tarantino movieyou ever stop to think how much hollywood has changed the way we perceive and pattern realityand slid out into the warm windy dark the breeze had risen i could hear howling and chiming from the bottom of the drive i bet the neighbors love that stewart said locking his door its a bottle tree i said how do you know that i checked to make sure my own door had latched its been here for years and you dont remember where youve heard the name bukvajova before should i oh jackjackie he said something is definitely up i should probably have understood what he was driving at but i just wound up shaking my head it was a funny sensation like when you know the answer to a question or the name of a thing youre pointing at and just cant pull it forward into the conscious part of your brain so who lives here a i started to say and realized i didnt know the answer to the question i dont know of course you know stewart said what were you just about to say a hedgewitch the bottle tree howled torment in the meandering wind shes a hedgewitch she drinks ghosts i was just here today vegas forgets things stewart said you had better not be picking up that particular power because im not going to visit you in the home the words were hard the voice fragile and tightstrung i reached out and squeezed stewarts hand you spend a hundred years with somebody you get to know their defense mechanisms well figure it out youre not going to argue with me i shrugged we were close enough to the house now that the light from the kitchen window washed his face what would arguing get me something is obviously weird around here and we have to figure it out right he said so the hedgewitch bukvajova lives here and you dont remember why you know that or why you know about her bottle tree and the ghost of jeff soble is leading you leading us leading you stewart said whose ear was it blowing in touchÃ© i let him lead me down the gravel drive to the covered patio and the door are we just going to knock are you afraid of a little hedgewitch yes why are we here stewart because something is happening to you and i want to find out what it is and make it stop and if it doesnt have something to do with a bukvajova ill eat the hat of your choice any hat at all jackie he said and squeezed my arm knock on the door but i didnt have to we must have made enough noise to wake the dead because first the interior door opened on a cascade of light and then the security door squeaked wide steel doesnt rust in the desert really not for a long time but it was pretty obvious that the hinges were full of grit and hadnt been oiled in thirty years i wondered if she kept meaning to get around to it and just forgot the spill of airconditioning past my hands and thighs could have pushed me back a step or maybe drawn me forward im jackie i said this is stewart of course you are jackie dear she said she held the door for us come inside i hesitated but stewart stepped up and i certainly wasnt letting him dance into the spiders web unsupervised she shut both doors but didnt latch them and i wondered if she worried about home invasions this far back from the street i set the dead bolt behind us no use tempting fate and i wasnt worried about being locked in when the lock didnt require a key she sat us down and made us tea boiling water in a proper brown pot i watched her pour it into three chipped mugs which she brought to the table touching and set down together stewart picked out the brown one i let the hedgewitch taste hers first and then stewarthes very hard to killbefore i touched mine there was a tannin ring around the cup halfway down i drank anyway looking around the kitchen it was a long narrow room with a table set broadside and a clock centered on the wall the hands were stopped a paler ring marked the brownandgold wallpaper where it had been pushed askew were you married i asked her she shook her head her hair hung lank the sour smell stirring around her when she moved i dont know i dont recall i was married i said and set my tea aside but i dont remember her name stewart gave me one of his unforthcoming looks anyway shes dead now lots of people are dead said ms bukvajova they live in memory i looked at the row of corked colorful bottles stacked on the granite pastry board and at the three or four empty ones racked up in the dish drain stewart raised his eyebrows sure i poked my spoon against the side of the sugar bowl the bottle tree howled loud enough to be heard through closed windows over the hum of the swamp cooler as long as somebody remembers is that what youre doing remembering them a tremendous clash rang from the bottle tree like a string of glass bells violently shaken i winced stewart started bukvajova perked up and peered out the kitchen windows caught one stewart asked what do you use them for memories she said he cant get them all if you keep topping it off if you fill it up fast enough he she poured herself more tea tilting the brown betty teapot with the skill of a practiced hand he eats memories stewart leaned forward over the table and took her scaly hands they get diluted mrs bukvajova you can only pour the water over the same leaves so many times and get she made a helpless gesture and tapped the pot get tea or whatever did you boys want something to eat jackie whats your friends name no thank you i said i couldnt imagine being hungry mrs bukvajovafollowing stewarts leadwhy did you leave the circus there were ponies she said and a cheetah named ralph he was friendly and you could play with him she looked down into her tea then up at stewart as if he had spoken im sorry dear what was i saying why you left the circus he said she shook her headbut i was never in the circusand frowned painfully was i another reason i like circus folk is that they have long memories the sorts of memories we all used to have when we lived in villages which is to say based more on an oralhistory sort of consensus version of events than on what really happened blow by blow its the folk process when something gets passed down hand to hand identifying details are shaved off idiosyncrasies smoothed away personality blurred until what remains is a refined core of agreement memories get conflated simplified it doesnt start off being the truth but because of the way the world works it becomes the truth before too long compromises become history become something everybody knows bloody old ballads are the handeddown tabloid tv of the thirteenth century it may not be what really happened but by the end its what happened after all as we got back into the car the sun was starting to creep up behind frenchman mountain we need to go see the flying bukvajovas stewart knuckled his eyes when he pulled his hands down the whites were bloodshot tell me its not an evil ringmaster okay i said its not an evil ringmaster you want to ask them about their lost sheep i shrugged i want to find out how the sheep got lost well i dont want you getting lost as well he patted my hand the aged toyota grumbled to life i dont suppose you know if this has just started happening no i said i didnt remember getting in to see bartolomÄj bukvajova was easier than it should have been the patriarch of the family was in his late fifties hair still black as a freshly inked brush wide shoulders rippling under his tshirt with every gesture he was the catcher and i wondered how it affected the family dynamic that they really did know he wouldnt let them fall there was a lot of bitterness in that thought when i thought it and i did not know why whoever my father was hed surely been dead for most of a century by now i looked at stewart and wondered if i should ask him my old mans name or if it would just freak him out unnecessarily but he was looking at bartolomÄj who had stood up from behind a folding card table in his rv to extend a hand youre the oneeyed jack he said and this must be the suicide king i shook and so did stewart youve heard of us show folk bend our luck a lot he said it pays to know who the intermediaries are have you come for a tithe i reached into my satchel and found a handful of thick poker chips the silver slipper ones were just collectors items now but the ones from the stratosphere had intrinsic value i laid three thousand dollars in stamped highimpact plastic on the card table and said actually weve come for information this is stewart call me jackie everybody else does and i want us to be friends he eyed the chips suspiciously did not touch them and sat back down information is not something im generally comfortable giving out he said especially when it commands that sort of price too many people think they can buy more than anybody ought to be able to buy for a couple thousand dollars mmm stewart said you have kids bartolomÄj grandkids they have health insurance take the money its nothing to us its useful to you he eyed the stack tell me what you want to know i looked at stewart stewart looked at me i shrugged and did the talking did you have an uncle or an older brother maybe who jumped ship here in vegas some time ago and married a local girl bartolomÄj did not look away from my face but his left hand crept out encompassed the chips and swept them to his side of the table that he said i dont mind talking about but you have the story backward we do stewart doing his best wideeyed innocent its amazing how people will rush to fill that perceived void absolutely bartolomÄj said you are thinking of my aunt branislava my fathers oldest sister i never knew her she left before i was born she was a flyer very beautiful im told i dont think it can be i said the woman im thinking of is about ten years older than you id guess but not well she looks her age are you sure he raised an eyebrow branka would be in her eighties maybe older of course we do tend to live a long time in my family he shrugged i put another thousand in chips on the table and he raised an eyebrow i told you i would help im helping too i said when he grinned he showed a gold tooth which made me realize he hadnt smiled before what would you say if i told you your aunt branka was still alive and needed your help this kind of help he tapped the chips i shrugged copying his gesture id say we look after our own he sucked on his teeth and pulled his hand back and id say she left us and it was up to her to come back and ask if she wants that changed i dont think she can ask i said and pulled out the chair across from him without actually ever being invited tell me all about it why dont you bartolomÄj gave me that look again and i pushed the chips toward him with a fingertip good faith gesture he swept them to him much less tentatively we came through when the dam was going up according to my father she met a man and she married out he said i dont know what else to tell you we never heard from her after stewart standing behind me cleared his throat who did she marry some guy bartolomÄj answered i can call my dad at the home and check hes still pretty sharp for a guy in his eighties hell remember thatd be great i said bartolomÄj can you answer me one more question maybe i can but try if she married out i asked why did she keep her own name she did i nodded he let his head linger in that tilted pose for a moment before he shook his head i cant say jackie it wasnt done in those days shes divorced stewart said in the car quite abruptly he always was the smart one blond or not we can pull the marriage license i said charleston boulevard runs west all the way to red rock and the mountains from which it takes its name stewart and i go up there when we need to think and we had planned to take our cell phones and wait for bartolomÄj bukvajova to call but stewart pulled a uturn right in the middle of charleston while i bent my luck hard to make sure that if there were any cops in the neighborhood they were distracted by a flock of passing teenagers it seemed like the least i could do twenty minutes later we had parked at a downtown casino and were crossing the street to the courthouse pulling the marriage license was easier than youd expect were not really big on the expectation of privacy around here and anyway it was a matter of public record the hardest part was figuring out the date but it was slowjust after lunchand we got a helpful clerk and i made sure she got lucky sure its abuse of power whats the point in power if you cant abuse it anyway it was in a good cause and its how i make my living you know its more honest than what a lot of guys do she brought the photocopy to the window of a waiting room where we sat side by side in scoopshaped plastic chairs me slumped and stewart kicked forward like a vulture on a bender stewart was on his feet first and so he paid the fee and collected the copy when he glanced at it the color faded from his cheeks he looked up at the clerk who was regarding him with raised eyebrows obviously waiting for some response she smiled when she got it thank you stewart said automatically then he caught my elbow and without explanation steered me toward the street when we passed outside the courthouse door into the wall of heat onto freshmown grass dotted with sleeping vagrants and fat palm trees i planted my feet and jerked him to a stop because he didnt let go of my arm he looked at me as if startled to realize i was still there and had opinions and then shook his head what still not a mind reader i answered and held out my left handthe one he wasnt using as a tiller and stewart blushed right up under his hairline and handed me the stillwarm photocopy sorry sokay the paper shook in my hand the day seemed very bright elijah powers eli powers babylon hotel and casino that eli powers shh he said he took the paper folded it onehanded and tucked it into his pocket but he was still looking at me and when i mouthed she married eli powers he nodded well shit just then my cell rang it was bartolomÄj bukvajova calling to tell us that his dad said his sister married some guy who ran a gambling hall in block the old redlight zonewhen the dam was going in over in boulder city and vegas was where the workers came to blow money and chase skirts on weekends he thought it had been annulled shortly after but he never spoke to her again elijah porter his father thought some biblical name like that stewart took me to the lucky s buffet at the plaza plunked me down in a corner and brought me a plate before he fetched his own i ordered him a sprite and a glass of the house redyou try to get ginger ale in vegas its worth your lifeand coffee and an ice water for me i waited to start eating the fried shrimp until he got back the second time so he said settling himself behind a plate of roast beef and cornbread how are we going to get at eli powers hes ninety years old and he owns half of las vegas why the hell would we want to get at him theres something about the way breaded fried shrimp crunch thats deeply satisfying the battered ones just arent as good please tell me youre kidding his cheap knife squeaked on the cheap plate as he cut his meat i winced kidding shit he said oh shit branislava bukvajova no nothing bukvajova i said i swear i know that name of course he said who can make a city forget like the guy who runs it jackie i think i know whats going on i think i know what the problem is good i said can you explain it to me drink your coffee and ill try but i wasnt finished with the food yet so i ate that and drank the ice water smushing armygreen peas between the tines of my fork they tasted more like porridge than like a vegetable powers wasnt anybody yet when he married bukvajova was he wait i said who did powers marry hes got a wife doesnt he his third one the brunette used to be an actress not a very good one stewart agreed thats beside the point shes his fourth wife according to this he married branka bukvajova in it seems like it was annulled less than a year later but she never went back to the circus like she was stuck here or she didnt remember that she could go home everybody forgets stuff in vegas i said and didnt understand why stewart would find it so troubling it was only true vegas forgets stuff imploded bulldozed blown away yeah stewart said and stole one of my shrimp almost makes you think somebodys stealing its memory doesnt it do you want some chocolate cake jackie jackie i said picking up the cooling coffee in its white institutional stoneware cup then who are you i didnt really believe him when he said i was jackieisnt that a girls namebut it didnt bother me it really did bother me that i didnt know who he was though that seemed really rude especially when he was apparently buying me dinner stewart he said and the strain on his voice cracked it clean across he rose to fetch me cake which made me feel bad that i couldnt remember how id met him surely i wasnt drunk surely i hadnt been that drunk am i drunk i asked as he put the cake down before me and waved our busser over to refill my coffee mug i wish he answered and patted my arm following the line of his motion i realized suddenly that there was an awful lot of ink on my arm i put down my fork a bite of cake still speared untasted on the tines and poked my bicep with a finger huh eat he said you need your strength and then were going back to visit ms bukvajova and were not leaving until we figure out whats going on i swallowed a mouthful of cake whos ms bukvajova the afternoon was full of light when we walked out onto a promenade covered by an arch that seemed to be made of millions of small lights hung from a lattice the day was like a kiln i deduced we must be in the desert stewart where are we his face very still he said fremont street fremont street isnt that in tombstone where the earps shot up the clantons familiarly called the gunfight at the ok corral as misrepresented in a star trek episode all right stewart said youre still jackie and we have seriously got to get this fixed i should probably have been scared standing on a strange street corner in a strange town with a strange man unable to remember my own name had i ever known my name but stewart was a soothing presence for all his twisted lips and wrinkled forehead i dont think this would bother me so much if you werent a walking encyclopedia of forgotten las vegas were in las vegas oh then this will all get pulled down in a couple of years anyway wont it i dont know why they even bother naming things his hand was hard on my shoulder as he pulled me along come on im not sure how to handle this jackie as long as ive known you as long as youve known me whatever happens in this place whatever falls down or gets buried or goes forgotten you always seem to remember that its here or that it was here he led me through crowds deftly and i let him he seemed to know where he was going and i had no idea all that dead history never dies in you and now he shrugged i put my hand over his fingers on my arm because it seemed like the thing to do and he smiled at me very briefly my heart jumped huh was he my boyfriend i thought that over it seemed appealing do you remember me he asked maybe i said a little are we together yes he said well only for the last hundred years but what i was trying to say was all that time ive had this idea that you were i dunno the memory of las vegas where all its ghosts went where they wound up and now if you cant remember anything do you think im going senile cities dont go senile he said we ducked between an arguing couple you talk like im somehow linked to the city jackie you are the city youre its genius its spirit one of them im the other one and you know that sounded right completely bizarre mind you but right so if im the citys memory i said and i cant remember anything yeah he said you see why im a little worried now well then i saidand there was no excuse for my tone because im sure he would have seen it if he wasnt too worried to think straightits obvious whats going on either somebody is using the city to get to me or me to get to the city the first thing i noticed about the battered old block house on the neglected ranch estate was a glorious bottle tree in the side yard moaning softly in the breeze it caught the sunlight in all colors cobalt and ruby and amber and emerald commonplace and lovely i imagine most of us never really look at glass but there it was sun stained through it i felt the whimpers of the ghosts trapped inside felt yes it wasnt exactly hearing i stepped away from the stillopen door of the parked car and the blond man caught my arm jackie he said dont go too close to that its pretty i know he said and gentled me with a hand on my hair come away we need to talk to ms bukvajova you know i said i swear ive heard that name i know his voice did something funny ive heard it too he lead me under the porch roof in out of the sunwe must be somewhere in the south for there to be bottle trees and the sun sure felt like itand thumped on the security door because the doorbell was busted or if it wasnt busted anyway you couldnt hear it chime from the outside so he knocked to be sure a moment later the inside door swung open a crack and bright cloudy eyes peered through the crevice half obscured by strings of yellowed hair boys the old woman said stewart jackie come in come in would you like an iced tea yes please ms bukvajova the blond man said and i gaped but miss bukvajova was suddenly young all auburn hair and sparkle and aerialist muscles power and grace the person overwhelmed by that memory was not me but for a moment i saw her as she had been a short hourglassshaped broadshouldered woman with a ballerina waddle and someone elses grief filled up my throat she lead us through a cluttered redflannel living room fussy and terrible every surface cluttered with dusty photographs and i could not hold her steady in my sight drink my elbows propped rudely on her kitchen table i sat in a creaking ladderback chair with my hands cupped loosely around a cold empty glass drink she said and poured more tea though it tasted of cement dust and brackish water i drank i saw her again and this time she swung with perfect grace on a flying trapeze as if she were dancing there she somersaulted through the air and a strong man caught her i stung my throat shouting stung my palms clapping felt fingers close on my wrists and pull my hands apart stewartand my blood was dripping over his nails you idiot he said you broke the glass stewart he met my eyes and his mouth went thin jackie sort of i said i felt thin as a watercolor of myself but i was there he looked down quickly holding my hand still he began to pick the slivers of broken glass out of the palm leaving the ice melting on the table miss bukvajova you remember me she said yes i said we do because it wasnt just me remembering her that was jeff soble i said and winced as stewart picked another shard of glass from my palm i turned away so i wouldnt have to watch him and watched the sun glint off the bottle tree on the other side of the slatted blinds in the tea it works she said and made a moue like a muchyounger woman he was a friend of mine he worked on the dam but you married powers she rose from the table fetched another blocky anchor hocking glass from the cabinet and plunked it to one side of the puddle of ice and broken glass she added ice with her fingers and poured the tea from a scarred yellow rubbermaid pitcher with a pushbutton top she said its like getting dehydrated you need more to catch up than you think you will keep drinking ill get a towel keep drinking the memory of her friend the one who brought me here to save her you married powers i said again and drank the tea with my left hand which was only cut a little the cold glass stung the scrapes on my palm not jeff i couldnt call him soble when i was drinking his memory wouldnt you she poured herself a glass too and drank not that eli was anything special then he owned a gambling hall downtown on fremont street and you all know where that led empire stewart said laying another piece of bloody glass in his pile i think thats all of it jackie so the marriage didnt work out she pushed a greasy lock out of the way with a spotted hand and finished her tea imploded like an outworn casino she said his other wives havent been so lucky she gestured around i got the marriage annulledunmadeand he hasnt been able to eat me up entire the bottle tree keeps me going las vegas is full of ghosts suicides mostly they taste all right stewart wrapped a paper towel around my palm to stanch the bleeding the fluid in my glass tasted like cement and nitro with too much sugar stewart said so why is he coming after jackie now she shrugged jackie came here jackie caught his attention jackies a better source of power than i ever was i can feel my head filling back up again i think he must be letting me alone you know the circus is in town it was mean of me to ask that way just drop it in her lap and see what she did what she did was blanch they dont want to hear from me if there was bad blood stewart said softly i think theyve forgotten it now why would all this start happening while your family is here jeff she said i think he was waiting to bring you to me because i couldnt have made much sense unless you caught me just at the right time you would have needed what my family could tell you and elielis used so many women up not just women stewart said with a sidelong glance at me i drank another swallow of sweet tea and jeff soble i wonder i said if hes using me to get to something in particular you wonder if vegas forgets stuff but i remember itwhat happens to the parts of vegas that i dont remember martin powers stewart said without hesitation i remembered the newspaper and nodded hes trying to protect his grandson i said martin powers is up on racketeering charges hell lose his gambling license but vegas is the city of second acts well forgive anything as long as you give us half a chance to forget it and he can make the city forget stewart said well i answered sipping my tea he can make me forget and vegas forgets easier than i do tires crunched on the gravel drive not just one set but many powerss men surrounded the house and knocked on the door branka and i both gulped down the last mouthfuls of our tea before we filed out and went quietly every bit helps right well maybe sometimes most of the cars waiting for us were black sedans but parked closest to the house was a limousine with babylon casino plates and a very polite driver who held the door wide the implied arrogance never changes no one can touch me here one of the gentlemen in black suits with an earpiece rode with us i noticed that the bulletproof glass was up between the passenger compartment and the cab a long ride through rush hour followed vegass gridlock starts in the afternoon and persists into evening and it seemed like we sat through most of it a tractor trailer had jackknifed in the spaghetti bowl i guess those effortless car rides only happen in movies the tower of babylon rose through a veil of transplanted jungle foliage and pipedin orchid scent to scrape a desert sky burned almost colorless by the nevada sun visible the entire length of the las vegas strip it collapsed in fire and fury six times daily six days a week wind conditions permitting for a premium you could ride it down goldglass ziggurats flanked it on either side shaded pathways led from the summerscorched sidewalk and the broiling asphalt of the strip through glades and grottoes beside a bubbling piped waterfall there was a slidewalk for those who found the hundred meters or so under misters and date palms too far to walk in the las vegas heat the chattering monkeys caged behind invisible fencing on either side of the path were new world varieties though most of the tourists could be counted on not to notice that and the mossy ruined temples they played amongst were more southeast asian than mesopotamian in character butauthenticity asidethe hanging gardens of babylon were a landscape designers masterpiece a bare few feet from the bustle of the strip the plants and animalsthe palm trees also teemed with brightly colored birdsand the chuckling water and the architectural sounddamping introduced a sort of mystic hush even the tourists walked through with lowered voices we didnt we came around the back in the smokedglass limousine through a concealed gate that opened to the flash of the telemetry device clipped to the sun visor i dont know if it chirped the bulletproof glass was up the limousine rolled silently into a tunnel jeweled with lanterns and the gate scrolled shut behind us branka made a noise like one of those monkeys in distress and stewart squeezed her arm i wished hed squeeze mine too but not enough to whimper for attention when the limo rolled to a halt i could fool myself that what i felt was relief but really it was a cold shallow kind of fear that sloshed over me like river water our silent wardenhe hadnt acknowledged anyones presence since he satreached for the door he rose and ushered us out we stepped onto plush carpet and stood blinking in the vip tunnel of the babylon hotel and casino ornate doors paneled with mock ivory relief swung wide branka squeezed my hand with her salamanderdamp one and drew me forward i shook my head i was the oneeyed jack genius of las vegas i could see magic and talk to ghosts the city of suicides was mine to protect i didnt need to be afraid of i leaned over and spoke into stewarts ear stewart shh he said and i dropped my voice as we walked forward escorted by more men with earpieces and dark suits i said what am i afraid of the look he gave me was sad and bottomless do you remember why were here i should i just had i knew it was on the tip of my tongue powers i said hes making me forget we three moved forward in the middle of a ring of security as they led us along the tunnel to an elevator i felt like a rock star on the way to the gallows what are we going to do about it stewart asked i looked down at my hands and shook my head not let him good plan stewart said as the doors chimed lets see what we can do about managing that in the tiny paneled elevator brankas sour sweat overpowered the pipedin aroma of gardenias and orchids some functionarys idea of how babylon smelled were there such things as scent designers our ridewhispersilent crowded tenseterminated in the penthouse where still ringed by all those refugees from the matrix we were herded forward onto oriental carpets myself in the middle and branka and stewart one to each side i thought i knew what to expect eli powers was as old as las vegas butin his rare television appearancesgetting around under his own power though wizened and leaning heavily on two crutches i thought i would find an old man relying on a mechanized chair in the comfort of his own home instead a man in his forties came forward to meet us hair just graying at the temples light eyes bright behind bifocals he extended his hand focusing a little behind me and i accepted the handshake martin powers he lied jackie i answered this is stewart branka you already know tell me your right name mr powers he glanced from me to stewart and then to the half dozen hotelsecurity operatives standing behind us whatever the gesture he made they understood it and withdrew to the edge of the thirtyfoot living room out of earshot but not out of range they wouldnt have done it if powers wasnt armed i will do you the honor of not pretending i dont understand you eli powers said through his grandsons mouth youre the genii of las vegas and you used to be eli powers stewart said and stuck his hand out with apparent equanimity powers shook it then let his own hand fall to his side for my own use later onwhat gave me away logic stewart answered he stepped forward not close enough to impinge on powerss personal space but close enough to demand his attention making himself the spokesperson taking the focus off me that meant that he expected me to figure out what to do about powers did i mention that stewart is the smart one he folded his hands in the small of his back tipped his head like a saucy girl and continued youre a mnemophage youve kept yourself alive all these years by eating up the memories of anyone you could trick into giving consentand the memories of the city itself wives childrenyou have a legal claim on them dont you eli its enough to get a grip on them with sorcery and las vegas itselfhow much of it do you own in your own name or through proxies enough eli said smiling tightly he looked interestedwouldnt any narcissist confronted with someone enumerating his accomplishmentsbut unconcerned i hoped that was dangerous arrogance on his part and not justified confidence stewart didnt glance at me he took a step to the left further dividing elis attention but i couldnt rush him nothing physical would work under these circumstances it would only earn us each a bullet stewart clicked his tongue his left hand as if without his attention made a dismissive flip he said so did you just eat up martin totally and move into his head like a hermit crab switching shells the turn of phrase conjured up a horrible image a pincered brain heaving itself from skull to skull slimed with cerebrospinal fluid i flinched hard and had to bite my cheek to get my face under control again i edged my head sideways to catch brankas eye hoping for inspiration but she had her hand pressed against her mouth gaze fixed on powers her lips moved shaping words i dont remember eli smiled it was a good smilehonest interested i would have voted for him martin made a very great sacrifice on my behalf he said making it sound for all the world as if his grandson had given him a kidney or something brankas hand reached out clutched on my wrist i cant remember anything i cleared my throat which was pretty dry right then and said let them go eli stewart started so caught up in his performance he had forgotten what he was stalling for he and powers both swiveled i squared my shoulders and said what you want from me is the city isnt it you want vegas to forget why its angry you want it to remember only whats best about you i breathed you want the love back dont you eli he stared for a moment and then his lips pressed thin and he nodded we only want the same thing he said whats best for vegas im glad you see that jackie let them go i said and ill let you have it all you have my word of honor he said but you give me what i want first i had to pull my hand out of brankas though she clutched at my fingers like a child despite the airconditioning i rubbed slick palms on my trouser legs before i came forward to meet powers jackie stewart said dont stewart i got this really he didnt want to back down branka rocked on her heels moaning softly but i couldnt help there was no way to give her back what shed lost no way to make it easier for her in the real world there are no reset buttons no epiphantic healings if i were a decent human being instead of a city id have noticed her pain and done something about it years ago but thats not the way i operate and im not sure theres anything anyone can do to make that change whats the deal powers asked i give you my memories of you i said and you let my friends go he wont stop branka insisted i put the back of my hand against her upper arm no tricks powers said no tricks i answered i have too much to lose odin got more for his eye than i did but i got more than i deserved i lifted my eye patch up he didnt recoil i guess eli powers had seen worse things than a selfinflicted gunshot wound he leaned forward staring into my eye socket i saw him doubled martins face overlaid by the ghostvisage of eli in my otherwise sight he reached out and laid fingertips against the side of my face like mr spock setting up for a mind meld branka pulled back two wobbling steps and i think stewart would have grabbed powerss wrist if i hadnt stopped him with an upraised hand take it i said and waited to see what would follow there was no sensation except where manicured fingernails scratched my cheek and the orbit of my eye he squinted at me and as he did so i thought of eli powers everything i knew about him the names of his wives and children and casinos the racketeering charges against martin the rumors of infidelity and mafia involvement the newspaper articles and photographs the dog he had back in the sixties with the one lop ear the dog the dog with the white patch on his head whose dog was that anyway and then the churn and bubble and i felt something else slip out of me jeff soble what was left of him jumped between us like a bridging spark when he hit i saw powers jerk start for half a second before he recovered himself and gagged soble down the babylon casino and then unrelated things the mirage tigers the zane floyd shooting endless construction airplanes stacked twelve deep across a fightnight sky a sting concert with threehundreddollar tickets whatshername the one who sang the theme from titanic i fed him everything everything i was everything i knew everything about las vegas city at the bottom a dead ordovician sea more than he could withstand more than anything mortal could withstand knowledge i had to die to contain a kind of metaphysical judo using his own strength against him until i felt him try to pull away and fail thrash like a gaffed fish eli powers was not used to fighting anything as old and deep and nasty as himself but holding the deed to a dragons cave is not the same as owning the dragon i clutched him and fed him my city until he choked on it i made him las vegas i made him me i fed him more and morea kind of spiral scraping dizzyingand then when he could swallow no more i reached down into him and made a fist and dragged it all back out again stewart grabbed powers by the hair and shoved him away stewart i moved to jump in front of him to get my body between the men with the bullets and stewarts body suicide by gunman might be far enough from the intent of his gift to kill him outright and im the one with the faultless luck if one of us was going to be shot i wanted it to be me he grabbed my shoulder and held me still shh he said look i looked there was a man i didnt recognize pushing himself off the expensive carpeting with rug burns on his hands branka arms wrapped over her cardigan was still swaying side to side and a whole bunch of security guys standing in a huddle one gesticulating while the others listened the quarterback glanced up cut himself off and at his gesture the rest broke away they approached sternly but a little sideways and i realized that they didnt know where we had come from im sorry sir the one in front of me said but you cant be here another man picked the strange guy up stared at him with furrowed brow for a moment and said excuse me may i see some identification please we caught a taxi in the horseshoe in front of babylon security escorted us out but were nice enough not to toss us so we bounced branka sat in the front seat beside the driver and stewart let me rest my head on his shoulder while the palm trees lining the driveway scrolled past on both sides like a greenscreen effect we stopped at the light at the bottom of the driveway while a flock of tourists stampeded across and stewart said you forgot about him stewart forgot about who he shook his head never mind i think id rather you didnt remember he bent down and kissed the top of my head i wondered if i was drunk i didnt like the way i felt the taxicab was spinning stewart at least was warm and solid even if he was raving i wish you were making sense i know he said i was just wondering what do you think happens to the stuff we forget you and me the bits of las vegas even we dont remember ive been forgetting things lately i said thats over with does it not exist anymore if ive forgotten it or is it still there just nobody notices he shrugged i bet its still there some guy lurched up the sidewalk outside looking roughed up his suit had been expensive his tie was silk they were both ripped now i wondered if hed gotten mugged or bounced by casino security nobody but me seemed to notice him i turned away not my job not my job to notice him or rescue him you cannot save everyone youll go mad trying and anyway its not what cities do i said why is it that we get so invested in our history anyway why do we fight to preserve those old photographs and ancient keepsakes just so our children can throw them away when they clear the house we could just let go blow wide be clean jackie i turned my face into stewarts shoulder and said i killed myself he nodded i know i closed my eyes it was nice not to remember it for a little while he rearranged us to put an arm around my shoulders and i leaned into the embrace memory is all we are
