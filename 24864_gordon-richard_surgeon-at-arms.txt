richard gordon surgeon at arms first published in he couldnt believe it it was outrageous ridiculous but frightening like finding the houses of parliament in the middle of salisbury plain stumbling into st peters square round a corner in wimbledon or coming across the taj mahal amid the alleys of the city the front was magnificent the portico presented a decorated frieze four stout pale columns of portland stone and all the exuberant selfconfidence of a victorian london railway terminus behind rose a flattish dome topped by four minarets two of them emitting smoke then the building seriously got down to business its slateroofed doublestoried meanwindowed blocks spread in a fan sticking their ugly fingers into an empty countryside wearing the ragged robes of autumn all round ran an eightfoothigh wall topped with unfriendlylooking broken glass everything was in yellow brick which in the pale afternoon sunshine gave the place the look of being constructed from a million bars of sunlight soap but the grounds were magnificent lawns shrubberies orchards flowerbeds and kitchen gardens were laid out neatly on each side of the long winding driveway all tended with care befitting a palace he supposed they must have had an embarrassing surplus of labour there was a gothic chapel with a magnificent clock which had scattered unnecessary hours for a century there were more modern outbuildings with larger windows and even more modern corrugated iron nissen huts with no windows at all there were signs everywhere one directed casualties to some more workmanlike entrance in the rear another shelter directly into the earth a smart new blueandgold board where he parked his car announced ministry of healthemergency medical servicesmithers botham sector hospital it still struck him as a most peculiar name the entrance hall beyond the portico was a disappointment dark and poky painted in official spinach green and mustard yellow behind a small counter sat an old man with a blue uniform and sadly drooping moustaches to whom he announced himself im mr graham trevose id like to see captain pile please the old man looked at graham trevose wearily for ten years he had sat behind that counter hardly molested from morning to night contemplating his pension but now there were changes everywhere hed hardly time to get through his daily mirror from blackfriars hospital sir he asked graham nodded have you an appointment for two oclock as the doorman turned to a small switchboard beside him graham unbuttoned his fawn overcoat felt for his gold case and lit a cigarette he noticed the hall led to a dim narrow concrete corridor stretching apparently to infinity his eye fell on two doors with big brass keyholes and bolts but no handles a terrible place to find yourself in mad or sane he shuddered smithers botham was a mental hospital the asylum to the villagers despite the term having been tactfully dropped about the time alienists mysteriously turned themselves into psychiatrists it sprawled across the sunward slopes of the downs south of london which in that autumn of had lost to the safety of the countryside everything the nation held most preciousthe schoolchildren the expectant mothers the contents of the national gallery the bbc and the admiralty the moment which had dominated british politics for five yearsthe arrival of the german air force to bomb the capitalseemed most regrettably at last about to occur the government confidently expected half a million airraid casualties in the first week of the war and something had to be done about patching them up so the great london hospitals too rose stiffly from sites they had occupied for centuries and shifted to the home counties in fleets of converted green line buses doctors nurses students instruments beds bedpans and all blackfriars hospital which had tended the sick beside the thames since the great plague was displaced to smithers botham the others found secure homes in similar nineteenthcentury mental institutions scattered so conveniently round the metropolis the government could never have kept londoners healthy through the blitz without these vast and ugly buildings the bread cast on the broad waters of victorian compassion was washed ashore in the nick of time the smithers botham mental doctors themselves dispatched with the rightful inmates to scotland had watched the war approach more bitterly than even mr chamberlain the upper reaches of prewar medicine had many agreeable backwaters none pleasanter than a job in such a place they enjoyed free houses in the grounds free vegetables piled daily on their kitchen tables even free laundrywhich was always beautifully turned out laundrywork being thought a useful occupation for madwomen their main vexations were their own colleagues who could be difficult many doctors of unreliable personality choosing to escape from the harsh world behind the same walls as their patients but their duties were delightfully light the treatment of mental illness at the time being as passive as the treatment of criminals consisting mainly in keeping both classes locked well away from public view now the smithers botham gymnasium was partitioned into a row of operating theatres where longestablished cats snoozed in the warmth of the sterilizers or disported themselves among the beams above new laboratories were fashioned from damp little outhouses where sometimes toads came hopping round the testtubes the long bleak wards reequipped and refilled with rows of empty beds after ten weeks of war still yawned hungrily for the halfmillion casualties while bats flicked up and down the corridors at dusk scaring the night nurses the evacuated blackfriars staff fitted in as best they could the matron numbering among the first horrors of war her charges having to sleep without their usual collective chastity belt of spiked railings but there were unlookedfor rural compensationsfresh air a croquet lawn tennis courts even a cricket pitch where the more athletic housemen took their exercise in the mornings and the more amorous ones took their girlfriends at night and everyone agreed the flap would be over by christmas in spring theyd be home again in london graham trevose looked at his wristwatch ten past two i suppose captain pile knows im waiting hes very busy just now sir my own times not exactly valueless you know graham told him not as unkindly as he might the old man looked wearier than ever theres a war on sir graham winced he always did at the expression which had come to excuse any incompetence or incivility instead of replying he sat resignedly on a short wooden bench eyeing a redandwhite poster telling him his cheerfulness his courage and his resolution would give them victory in a spot like smithers botham he felt he was going to need all three graham trevose was odd man out as usual the second world war found the british government prepared to take a more tolerant view of many things than during the first conscientious objectors were allowed to fight fires in preference to the enemy soldiers mistresses if reasonably permanent were given an allowance and where the cure for hysteria in british soldiers at ypres was a british bullet by dunkirk psychological exhaustion had become entirely respectable the government had a particular new enthusiasm for plastic surgery men with faces smashed on the somme were if lucky returned home looking grotesque and if unlucky either died or recovered so splendidly they were sent back to present another target then harold gillies created with the basic elements of surgery and the penetrating eye of an artist his brandnew science of facial repair though until the armistice his notion of returning casualties to the world looking roughly like human beings attracted derision from many senior officers to whom it was a matter of supreme indifference if a man got his face shot off or his backside but the governments enthusiasm outran its supply of trained plastic surgeons who were as scarce as trained pilots apart from graham trevose there were only four installed in special new units round london gillies being the senior man insisted on first choice and went to basingstoke in hampshire it was convenient for his flyfishing an unknown surgeon called archie mcindoe descended on the charming little local hospital at east grinstead in sussex but graham went nowhere he had been overlooked he assumed deliberately graham was a realist he knew he was dismissed by his profession as a beauty doctor a trivial practitioner a refurbisher of distraught d–πbutantes who had inherited daddys nose along with his money he had admittedly specialized in offering hope to young actresses who saw their names one day in lights or to old actresses for whom the lights were starting to dim he had erased the scars of hunting accidents from the cheeks as neatly as those of dissipation from below the eyes and the trevose nose was famous in london societya little too famous women were starting to recognize its distinctive handiwork across crowded cocktail parties perhaps he had made and spent too much money lived too fashionably perhaps his private life unfitted him for employment by his majesty he had recently had a close shave from the general medical council over the famous infamous conduct or perhaps he told himself wearily some stupid clerk in the ministry had simply mislaid his file when the war was a month old before he had set eyes on smithers botham graham was surprised by a telephone call inviting him to meet brigadier haileybury at his club the following evening before the war haileybury too had been a civilian plastic surgeon and the pair had for twenty years lived in mutual dislike it was a dignified but deadly feud and like all feuds afforded the onlookers much innocent amusement but graham accepted the invitation he had nothing else to do and it would be the first time that he could remember haileybury buying him a drink the newly created brigadier was already waiting of all the mans virtues graham found his strict punctuality the most regularly irritating well trevose youre looking fit thats very kind so are you im finding it difficult to get enough exercise sitting all day behind a desk haileybury held an administrative job in the army medical services he had a flair for organizing people shall we find a quiet corner in the morning room haileybury ordered sherry he was a tall thin bald graceless man with large red hands more fitting a stevedore than a surgeon wearing an immaculate uniform with red tabs ive just seen tom raleigh he stated oh tom tom raleigh was a young plastic surgeon grahams partner until the arrangement was disrupted through the trevose temperament which was almost as famous in london as the nose you know hes been called up for the ramc i could have had him left in civvy street had you wanted his services but youll remember when i enquired you turned the idea down very flatly indeed graham did remember hed learned tom had supplied evidence leading to that close shave with the general medical council a stroke of treachery he was disinclined to overlook but he said only his services no one seems to find any use for my own i assure you that youre misinformed trevose haileybury said hastily i admit there was some hesitation he stopped under the circumstances it seemed best not to recall the past anyway youll shortly have your chance to join the civilian emergency medical service i thought that something really should be done about you the condescension grated on graham but he said nothing he was adjusting himself to being a nonentity while haileybury was now one of the nations elite as you could tell from a glance at his clothes but i have something better to offer graham looked up i have never made a secret of my disagreement with you on many things trevose personal and professional no you havent graham concurred haileybury had passed his civilian years between the wars with a modesty indistinguishable from drabness his bachelor home in richmond as plain as his sisters cooking his few amusements harmless to the point of boredom where graham saw plastic surgery as an exciting art in the most rewarding medium of all human flesh and blood to haileybury it was a science the calculated repair of injuries and defects rather than interference with the endowments of nature he would have been almost as reluctant to reshape an actresss nose as to perform her abortion neither have i made a secret of my admiration for your workmanship haileybury went on your surgery on burns at blackfriars called for far wider recognition i found it a very interesting branch of plastics i supposed you didnt publish it because you found the surgery of pretty women even more interesting thats unfair it was simply because i hadnt the time forgive me perhaps its not the first occasion ive misconstrued your motives misconstrued graham smiled are you being honest with yourself i think that my next remarks will prove that i am going to offer you a responsibility which to be frank i would offer noone else the brigadier leaned back impressively the responsibility for all facial and related wounds in the army let your mind dwell on it a moment i can promise you a perfectly free hand within the usual limits you will be your own master i can promise you firstclass accommodation and equipment you can pick your own team you can organize your own training programme and choose whom you want to train no one will interfere i give you my guarantee come just think isnt it a splendid chance to make a second reputation graham said nothing his quick mind had fallen on the suggestion like a terrier worrying the different elements from it of course youre already famous haileybury conceded far more than myself everyone in london knows graham trevose by everyone in london graham suggested i presume you mean the few despised for regularly getting their names in the papers by the many who wish they could haileybury shrugged his shoulders im trying to say this would bring a different sort of fame its a chance to get yourself remembered as gillies was in the last war surely that would be reward enough the idea appealed to graham he would be making himself known to men who had at the most only seen his name in the gossip columns it suited his exhibitionism which had saddened his friends in the profession as much as it had enraged his enemies he would be running his own show pushing his own ideas moulding his own assistants haileybury would be as good as his wordthat was another of his infuriating virtues anyway it would be better than doing nothing a thought struck him you mean id have to join the army haileybury looked surprised that would be inescapable what rank lieutenantcolonel is that the best you can do graham asked crossly thats a very high rank haileybury was shocked quite a number of senior men are coming in as majors then its out of the question why he would be subordinate to haileybury even if he too became in time a brigadier the fellow would by then be a general or some such he would have to call the bloody man sir a grisly thought totally out of the question graham repeated i was a civilian in the last war and id best stay a civilian in this one im not the military type haileybury sipped his sherry with a pained look neither are most young men in the country but they are finding themselves obliged to be i hope youre not suggesting i lack a sense of duty i am suggesting nothing of the kind said haileybury patiently if anything i am suggesting you lack a sense of perspective i made my offer because i thought firstly it was in the best interests of the army and secondly it was in the best interests of yourself you turned it down with hardly a second thought graham sat looking surly haileybury saw the delicately builtup reconciliation was about to come down with a crash perhaps i am pressing you too severely he retreated i cannot expect you to decide on such a farreaching matter in a couple of minutes please excuse my unreasonableness he apologized with unexpected good grace perhaps you will accept it as evidence of my enthusiasm for your services telephone me in a day or two when youve mulled it over here is the number of my extension haileybury spent the rest of the meeting talking about the disastrous effect of the war on county cricket a topic graham found painfully boring trevose asked captain cuthbert pile of the royal army medical corps sitting in his office at smithers botham trevose never heard of him whats he want corporal hes from blackfriars sir said corporal honeyman captain pile groaned not another he doesnt need accommodation i hope im doing miracles as it is the ministry cant expect me to squeeze anyone else into the place whats his line he seems to be a plastic surgeon sir captain pile looked horrified the war had forced acquaintance with fellowdoctors in many outlandish specialities but the company of professional facelifters he felt outside the line of duty i dont want to see him you made an appointment sir for two this afternoon oh did i youll remember the ministry telephoned sir the gentleman has just joined the emergency medical service captain pile rummaged busily through the papers covering his broad desk which commanded a fine view of the sweeping front drive there was a fire flickering in the oversized marble grate and an overall glow of mahoganyandleather victorian comfort it had been the office of the smithers botham medical superintendent then a consultant psychiatrist in the army where he was in time to have greater influence and invoke more widespread exasperation than a good many generals where is this trevose in the hall yes sir he would have come to see annex d sir annex d observed captain pile sombrely very well corporal id better have a word with him you go back to your work corporal honeyman withdrew to a small adjacent office to continue reading lilliput which he kept in a desk drawer with his bars of chocolate he was a willowy young man with thinning dandruffladen hair glasses in circular steel frames and a battledress which chafed his long neck he was a sight which depressed captain pile deeply corporal honeyman had been a clerk in an estate agents before joining the army through love of his country and dislike of living with his mother the army found he could use a typewriter and sent him to smithers botham he felt he would have been tolerably happy there had it not been for captain pile whom he was coming to care for even less than his mother captain pile sat reading through some documents feeling a little wait would put his visitor in his place his own civilian career had been sadly frustrating an intolerance of sick humans had led him into various medical administrative jobs an intolerance of even healthy ones had made all of them short but in the army he felt he was fulfilling himself having command of all service patients finding themselves in smithers botham and charge of the general running of the place he rose and inspected himself carefully in the giltframed mirror over the mantelpiece redcheeked darkmoustached well built if inclined to be stoutish for the late thirties he felt he filled his new uniform stylishly he placed his cap on his wellbrilliantined head took his gloves leatherbound stick and greatcoat and opened the door on the hall mr trevose he found the caller slight pale and fortyish with large eyes in a large head wearing under his overcoat a doublebreasted chalkstriped grey flannel suit cut with smartnessflashiness the captain might have said i know nothing whatever about plastic surgery he told graham proudly and frankly im too busy to start learning such subjects now i suppose you make women new noses and that sort of thing that sort of thing said graham must be very profitable they went on to the broad front steps captain pile giving a quick glance up and down there might be a soldier or two about to award him a salute but there were no soldiers only a schizophrenic cutting the grass annex d has been empty for a while he explained its not one of the best wards but your other people from blackfriars have bagged those already im afraid youve rather missed the bus they started across the lawn captain pile unlocked a heavy teak door in another yellowbrick wall with more broken glass on top grahams spirits already sinking under the weight of smithers bothams massive ugliness plunged further the annex was ghastly it looked older and bleaker than the rest of the hospital it was as narrow as a ship two stories high a hundred yards long slates were missing from the roof a good many windows were broken and all of them were backed with stout iron bars a jumble of small buildings sprouting iron stovepipes were tacked on one end as an afterthought the garden had for some seasons clearly been left to its own devices even captain pile looked faintly apologetic inside was dark damp and empty on the bare floor were sheets of newspaper streaming toilet rolls a pile of blackchipped enamel mugs and other wreckage beyond grahams powers of identification something scampered in the corner the smell was strange but predominantly faecal do you mean human beings actually lived here graham exclaimed and not so very long ago its a bit musty captain pile agreed i gather they used to keep their senile dementias in the place you cant expect those sort of cases to take much notice of their surroundings graham eyed a wooden partition dividing the long room its door swinging ajar whats through there the night ward this would be the day room graham picked his way gloomily through the rubbish to the far end of the annex of the tackedon buildings one revealed itself as the kitchen with a stone floor and a black iron range the second contained some cracked washbasins and three large bathtubs raised proudly on pedestals in the middle in the third graham found himself facing what appeared to be a row of horseboxes he discovered the halfdoors opened inwards to disclose lavatories with no seats and the chains encased in lengths of pipe running from cistern to handle the patients have hanged themselves on the chains captain pile told him informatively graham stuck his hands in his pockets after turning down haileyburys offer he had signed a contract with the emergency medical service and was committed to install and run a plastic surgery unit at smithers botham though he was always able to see a new face in the battered and bleeding remains of an accident as a sculptor can in a lump of stone it was beyond him to depict the rotting building as a busy complex cheerful sterile centre for healing the wounded that day room would have to be my operating theatre he suggested glumly the place must be ripped apart replumbed fitted with sinks sterilizers electric points well have one ward in the night room and another upstairs god knows how well shift anaesthetized patients up therefiremans lift i suppose ill want partitions for the anaesthetic room the surgeons room the nurses roomand where am i supposed to fit the photographers studio xray somewhere for the dentists ill need extractor fans heating reinforced ceilings for the lights doors widening new windows made those horrible iron bars must come off for a start i want the whole place painted a bright pastel shade duckegg blue something like that ill have gay curtains white bedside lockers flowers everywhere comfortable chairs radios the prettiest nurses in the hospital my patients get depressed enough with themselves without any encouragement from their surroundings duckegg blue did you say murmured captain pile mystified i want those two far tubs in the awful washhouse partitioned off theyll have to do for the saline bath unit the kitchen well have to equip again from scratch well put locks on the lavatories im far more likely to hang myself on the chain than the patients are no no its all impossible he decided abruptly no one could turn this place into anything but a pigsty they can bum it to the ground as far as im concerned theyll have to send me somewhere else captain pile grunted where else had you in mind graham lit another cigarette the dreadful man was right of course hospital accommodation was as precious as antiaircraft guns it was smithers botham or nowhere well have to make the most of it i suppose he said resignedly baron larrey did wonders for napoleons wounded in cowsheds well its not my pigeon the captain was becoming impatient youll have to take up rebuilding problems direct with the ministry have you seen enough ive got to get back to the grindstone graham stopped halfway along the ward he noticed a door with a cracked glass panel leading to a veranda under a rusty greenpainted roof it reminded him of a similar one in the sanatorium where he had been sent to die as a young man a war ago he wondered if that verandah were still there and who was lying in his place to count the rivets of the roof in the feverish boredom of tuberculosis as he turned away another door with a small glass peephole caught his eye he swung it open a tiny high barred window disclosed a cubicle lined entirely with black padded leather even the floor a padded cell graham couldnt recall seeing one before i expect youll find a use for it captain pile suggested helpfully graham walked back across the lawn in silence it was all horribly depressing but he reminded himself it was better than having to say sir to haileybury by the first christmas the war was still a novelty something to expose the nations pettiness rather than its greatness olympia housed not bertram mills circus but germans nazis interned with antinazis in scrupulous british fairness d–πbutantes put their hands enthusiastically to driving ambulances and showgirls theirs slightly less so to the udders of cows royal academicians were painting trees to disguise factories and keepers at the london zoo were armed in case bombs sprung the cages to organize biggame hunting in regents park in bloomsbury the ministry of information was emitting propaganda of praiseworthy gentility and over westphalia the raf were dropping leaflets in impeccable good taste citizens were advised to walk in the blackout with white shirttails exposed behind lighting cigarettes in the street after dark attracted abuse and sometimes prosecution and for protection against motorists with two dim halfmoons for headlights the ponies of the new forest were striped with white paint like zebras the weather was more irksome than the war the countryside for most of the winter being covered thickly with snow a fact unmentionable in the papers lest it reach the attention of the enemy at smithers botham there was a wonderful houseparty atmosphere with snowballing skating on the pond and amateur theatricals like dingley dell the fighting in finland stimulated the students to inaugurate a sauna bath rushing naked from their steaming washhouse to roll with wild shouts in the snow in full view of any female who might be passing in the blackout an extraordinary number always were the vast wards stayed halfempty most civilians on the blackfriars waitinglist being required to hold on a little longer to their hernias and varicosities in contribution to the wareffort space must be kept for the halfmillion casualties enjoying a stay of execution trained hands remained idle the nurses occupied themselves making and remaking beds and the housemen occupied themselves making and remaking the nurses five miles away in the kentish market town of maiden cross the local hospital was overwhelmed with cases of meningitis of which there was an epidemic that winter with a befitting outbreak of german measles on christmas eve an old man was hit by a lorry in smithers botham village and rushed by ambulance to the splendid portico captain pile hastily redirected it to maiden cross admission of such cases to smithers botham being against the regulations the ambulance driver protested but set off along twisting and slippery roads and if the old man died on the way the coroner pronounced afterwards he would most likely have done so anyway something more horrifying happened on boxing day a lady visiting her sister hospitalized with a goitre was caught short by her pregnancy and enthusiastically delivered by an orthopaedic surgeon occupying the operating theatre at the time but smithers botham was not classified by the ministry for midwifery no one had the slightest right to be born there captain pile confessed himself greatly distressed by the irregularity the versatile orthopaedic surgeon apologized but found himself caught in a baffled correspondence with whitehall which continued on and off for the duration of the war new years eve fell on a sunday and graham had spent the day as usual at smithers botham there was so much to do he was astounded how the squad of builders were performing a workmanlike miracle in the annex huts were thrown up in the neglected garden pipes and wires sprouted everywhere they were even starting to apply the duckegg blue and if this turned out nearer royal purple the place was at least beginning to take something of its shape in his mind he began to gather staff tudor beverley a young plastic surgeon from canada whom graham had met on a lecturetour unexpectedly appeared on the smithers botham portico and was promptly pressganged as his first assistant he even had a few patients whom he was obliged to operate upon in the main theatres his first case was the removal of a soldiers tattoo a splendid emblazonment on his arm dedicated to florence who had apparently become unworthy of the honour graham pickled it in a jar of spirit and kept it on the desk of his hut office until the end of the war he treated a sailor with a jaw fractured while fighting regrettably not the enemy but another sailor in a pub off piccadilly there were a number of smashedup dispatch riders the motorbike at the time striking graham as the most dangerous weapon in the british army feeling he should prepare himself as well as the annex graham read as many textbooks and papers about wound surgery as he could lay hands on he listened to archie mcindoe at the royal society of medicine and to sir harold gillies more intimately at basingstokeand more exhaustingly gillies being a forceful and sometimes eccentric exponent of his genius graham had resigned himself to the annex being something of a sideshow the other four plastic units were better housed better equipped and better staffed destined to take most of the work if the war didnt fizzle out he even halfregretted not submitting himself to haileybury he would at least have had a uniform he had come to avoid his club in st jamess because he felt the members looked askance on his lack of it most seemed to possess one though whatever their martial duties these did not prevent their spending a good deal of time in its comfortable leather armchairs but he had made his decision and if it were the wrong one it unhappily wouldnt be his first on that new years eve he left his bentley in a mews garage off curzon street and walked the few yards to his house in fashionable queen street by the light of his pocket torch screened by law with two thicknesses of tissuepaper as he approached his front door he saw a girl standing on the step her identity solved by an invitation flashed at him by a torch through her mackintosh pocket do you want to come home with me darling she enquired im afraid this is my home here graham told her politely oh sorry i hope you dont mind he noticed she was young and very plain the regulations which forbade the lighting of shop windows threw a kindly shade on goods more immediately for sale and the west end of london was as alive with seductive murmurs as prosperos isle graham supposed the girls hadnt enjoyed such a busy time of it since the lightless days of boswell he entered the empty house reflecting sombrely that the difference between many women he knew of easygoing morals and these seedy and undoubtedly infected creatures was exactly the same as between haileybury and himself even haileybury had done the occasional beautifying job for guineas but graham had for the best part of fifteen years sold his services without question to all comers and what was left he had been dreadfully extravagant his contract at smithers botham had exchanged an income of thousands for one of hundreds and debarred him from private practiceif he could have found any plastic surgery suddenly being fashionable no longer perhaps because the possibility of having ones head blown off ousted any dissatisfaction with the look of it he was terribly in debt and the incometax inspector as always clanked across his life like marleys ghost he fixed the blackout in the upstairs drawingroom switched on the light and poured a whisky at the corner cocktail cabinet usually he drank only to relieve the tedium of other peoples company now he was drinking twice as much to relieve the tedium of his own his servants had left a genteel middleaged woman came in daily from finchley to clear up his mess which she referred to as her war work his son desmond was in his first year at cambridge reading medicine unlike the first world war which emptied the medical schools into the ranks of kitcheners army the second barred medical students from joining the colours as firmly as miners or middleaged ploughmen for safetys sake graham had sent desmond to spend christmas with his cousin alec also destined for medicine alecs mother edith then running a guest house for the better class of evacuee in devon graham swirled the whisky round his glass edith trevose had been successively his own fianc–πe his sisterinlaw his brothers widow and his mistress but despite these disturbing changes in status still his friend he wondered whether to ring her up but decided against it it might start new complications and anyway the longdistance telephones were becoming dreadfully unreliable he reflected again that he should give up his queen street home store the furniture and take a room at the oak inn on the village green at smithers botham he would exchange the bentley for a morris and be patriotic over petrol it was all an excuse to save money to live a simpler life until the fuss was overas everyone knew from the newspapers the germans were already short of everything from shells to shoeleather he poured himself another drink here was graham trevose he thought sadly the fashionable plastic surgeon the favourite guest of a thousand smart parties and nobody even wanted to talk to him he had always far keener pity for himself than for his patients he felt loneliness like pain to exist without a womans company struck him as hard as solitary confinement without the compensation of a caress he became as wretched as a stray dog to wake at night alone he felt a foretaste of the grave hed enjoyed affairs enough before the war but what was their lasting satisfaction he asked himself bitterly as little as a handshake now everyone he knew seemed to have disappeared and if the germans did arrive that night to blow him to pieces there was hardly anyone to care he had a wife of course but she was in a home in sussex mad for fifteen years the hurricane had two selfsealing petrol tanks in the wings and another in the fuselage directly in front of the pilot on the august sunday morning when a messerschmitt caught him over dungeness he calculated after a panicky moment wondering if he were alive at all that he still had a fair chance of eating his dinner that night as he jettisoned the cockpit hood a stench of petrol struck him in a second his world was alight he never remembered how he fell clear his next recollection was the petrol replaced by a smell even more pungent it reminded him of something it was the stink of burning wool which stuck in your nose when they cleared up after the clip back home he didnt remember getting clear of his parachute harness but he must have managed it somehow because he was free when they reached him his only worry was whether a mae west could really keep a man afloat the sea was dead calm he felt no pain no unusual sensation at all like everyone else hed been flying without goggles and gloves it made it easier to see the enemy and to handle the controls he watched with detached interest bits of skin and flesh come away from his hands and forearms like fragments of roast chicken and float in the water a civilian lifeboat picked him up as two men in black oilskins got him aboard he noticed their faces and wondered what the hell they were staring at it was the same expression on the face of the girl looking down at him she was in a white apron a nurse he supposed pain shock and morphine had by then turned him from a human being to a collection of organs struggling to function together as best they could he asked where he was but she didnt seem to understand he wondered suddenly if he were in france put in the bag by the germans then she said youre all right youre in hospital in kent not far from tunbridge wells hed heard of tunbridge wells it struck him as an odd sort of place to find himself in he floated on a cloud of euphoria as they were obliged continually to increase his dose of morphine he didnt know if hed been lying there for a couple of days or a week though it was in fact more than a month gradually his body seemed to grow some sort of skin against the painful world a variety of doctors in white coats came to see him and generally dug about with forceps and probes most painfully as he began to notice things again he saw when they changed his dressings his hands were black clawed and wizened they reminded him of the hands hed once seen on the body of an aboriginal brought into the sheep station after lying for months shrivelling in the sun of the outback he asked for a mirror but was told the hospital hadnt any to spare they had been broken by a freak of blast in the bombing they explained and glass was in short supply his room was small whitepainted and sunny looking on to a small garden he wondered what sort of hospital it was and if there were any other patients he certainly saw no sign of them over the next few weeks the pain began to ease and the needles became less frequent one afternoon he noticed there was a mirror right in the room it was over the washbasin though theyd covered it with flowered curtain material fixed by strips of stickingplaster he crawled out of bed staggered and fell he managed to struggle across the floor and to tug the flowered covering aside with the point of his elbow he wondered who he was looking at the face in the glass was swollen black and running with pus there was no nose and the eyes stared through a pair of encrusted lids the door opened and the young nurse came in scolding him like a naughty child for getting out of bed a few mornings later the blueuniformed sister a stout and kindly woman appeared at his bedside with a stranger he was a civilian thin pale weedylooking with a large head and eyes showing too much white bluey jardine isnt it began the visitor affably the australian ive heard a lot about you sorry to make your acquaintance in these particular circumstances the patient looked suspicious whenever anyone new appeared in the room it seemed to mean something unpleasant was going to happen my names trevose the civilian went on im a surgeon who specializes in your sort of trouble i suppose you know well enough you were pretty badly burnt am i going to live yes of course you are but itll take a good deal of treatment getting you into shape were going to see rather a lot of each other in the immediate future im afraid graham took a bundle of casenotes from the sister you werent wearing goggles and gloves i dont reckon so a sadly common omission murmured graham with sterile forceps and a kidneybowl he began picking away the dressings another case of airmans burn if only these chaps would keep their gloves and goggles on he thought theyd have at least some sort of protection in the cockpit the firstaid station had smeared tannic acid jelly all over the raw surfaces of course damnable stuff why couldnt the muttonheads at the top issue orders banning it it would take weeks for him to pick the dried tannic acid crust away before he could even think about skingrafting the hands were terrible the face was a pretty bad mess too but that didnt matter so much a face was a decoration but you needed hands to live right sister graham decided ill have this one he turned to the man in bed would you like a change of scene this hospital however excellent otherwise hasnt the facilities for the sort of surgery you need i run a little show nearer london where we can look after you properly bluey hesitated and said i reckon im in the hands of you quacks now arent i good ill send a car for you tomorrow morning do you like icecream i dont mind it vanilla or strawberry im afraid theres no chocolate vanilla will do me bluey was mystified bits of him were burnt to cinders and they talked about icecream this doctor whoever he was seemed an odd bloke well be feeding you it till youre sick graham told him cheerfully see you later in the corridor the sister chided graham with more severity than usual but mr trevose you did say you wouldnt kidnap any more patients this officer will be my lasthonestly it does make life so difficult for us you know of course i do but leaving bluey here will make life very much more difficult for him should the powers that be object but they will object mr trevose graham grinned just say i behaved in such an overbearing and arrogant manner you had no alternative but to give in say i threatened physical violence if you like with my reputation theyll believe you he patted her amiably on the arm dont worry sister ill see theres no trouble ill take full responsibility its really quite easy im one of the few people at the moment who dont have to give a twopenny damn for the grandest airmarshals generals admirals or anyone she hesitated she had quite taken to graham who had set himself to be resolutely charming towards her you do behave badly sometimes you know she told him gently i behave badly frequently but its a change doing so on someone elses behalf instead of my own the following morning bluey jardine arrived at smithers botham in grahams secondhand morris driven by a greenuniformed wvs worker with most of him hidden by a tartan rug it was then october and the population had found more to worry about than whether to wear their shirttails outside their trousers at night but it had been a lovely summer the cherry trees had flowered charmingly over the little gothic mortuary the patients were kept awake by owls serenading to the crickets violins the tomatoes ripened wonderfully along the sunny walls of the main operating theatres nourished by the unused offerings of patriotic blooddonors it was difficult at smithers botham to believe the germans might leap from the seas or the skies any moment the litter of old iron gathered from surrounding fields to make room for growing food was put back again to frustrate enemy gliders at the portico the words smithers botham were painted from the blueandgold notice to baffle nazi parachutists dropping on the lawn doubtless dressed as nuns the chapel clock was hushed chimes being classified with sirens whistles and footballrattles as the portents of varying sorts of doom the ldv crawled enthusiastically on their stomachs everywhere carrying shotguns and threatening with much ferocity anyone moving after dark they disliked the look or sound of the vast main wards of smithers botham remained almost empty people heard so often on the bbc of hospitals and churches being hit by bombing all over southern england that these seemed highly dangerous places to find yourself in whether there was a comparable decline in churchgoing no one bothered to find out the reluctance of these civilians to present themselves for longawaited treatment graham found a godsend after dunkirk the annex had been alarmingly overcrowded if he wanted to throw up more huts he was told they were unavailablean infuriatingly handy expression of rebuff if he wanted more beds he knew where to look with the amiable connivance of mr orory the blackfriars gynaecologist working at smithers botham graham sent tudor beverley and his houseman to shift some unoccupied ones from ororys wards when the traffic was interrupted angrily by captain pile in the middle of the lawn graham drove to maiden cross and bought camp beds in the sports shop captain pile appeared in the annex to object wrathfully but even he could hardly evict the sleeping patients its most irregular mr trevose you cant just increase the number of beds in the hospital like that but the men would be terribly uncomfortable on the floor graham pointed out mildly captain pile went redder than ever he was having a bad war his command was admittedly complete over the military patients at smithers botham who on his approach were expected with the difficulty of saluting smartly from the pillow to stiffen themselves under the sheets as though they were corpses already but the civilian doctors from blackfriars took no notice of him at all it was most frustrating the senior ones made clear that the possessors of fellowships from the grand royal colleges could hardly be bossed by a mere licentiate of the less exacting society of apothecaries the younger ones defaced his signed notices often quite obscenely predictably named him the haemorrhoid and made up rude songs about him which they sang outside his office window and trevose he found more maddening than the rest put together if i may say so your wards give me a great deal of unnecessary trouble he continued warmly to graham you make absolutely no attempt to maintain proper discipline in this annex why youre actually mixing officers with other ranks surely this is hardly the moment to insist on the niceties of military etiquette captain pile but it is against regulations what have you done with those board partitions i had them sent specially to divide up the wards officers one side men the other im keeping them handy theyll be essential if we get anyone from the womens services though i suppose it would be all right bedding them down among the men as long as the ladies werent officers captain pile decided to ignore the question you could never be quite sure with a man like trevose if he were being serious and what about all this icecream i gather youre getting it from some merchant in maiden cross i must insist the practice stops forthwith you must know its quite out of order for anyone except the catering officer to have foodstuffs sent to the hospital burned men lose protein from the raw surface of their bodies and graham had discovered sadly with his own palate that the smithers botham diet was miserably mean in such a costly essential the dishes consisted mostly of porridge stew and rice pudding which being boiled in the same vats had interchangeable tastes though like an oldfashioned christmas pudding they occasionally offered keepsakes a dirty bandage a broken tooth once even a wellworn rubber heel graham supposed that none of the original inmates was expected to notice what he ate anyway during the hot summer he had hit on the idea of icecream telling the manufacturer to cram in as many proteinrich eggs as he could find but all this seemed too complicated to explain to captain pile i eat it all myself he said incidentally i pay for it from my own pocket but you buy churns of the stuff i happen to be particularly fond of icecream captain pile looked baffled trevose was an eccentric quite off his head furthermore pile recalled you sent six shirts to the hospital laundry last week the maximum permitted number is three good god muttered graham when bluey arrived at the annex he had no idea what might be in store for him he had no imagination at all it was an essential ingredient of his limitless courage the ministry of information hungry for heroes had trumpeted him as the australian ace printing his photograph and his number of enemy kills in the newspapers he was a rewarding subject tall goodlooking with dark wavy hair unmarried a sportsman splendid at cricket swimming and tennis but a hero has no more likelihood of being pleasant than lesser men bluey was pushful overbearing and vain as malicious behind the backs of his superiors as into the faces of anyone unlucky enough to be set below him since puberty he had seduced as many girls as he could lay hands on regarding them all as the fortunate recipients of his passing favour in the air he would risk his neck for anyone on the ground he would lift a finger only for himself no one in the squadron had much time for bluey good morning flightlieutenant jardine a young nurse with a mature air holding a board with a clip of notes approached as he stood at the ward door trying to take it all in weve put you in the far end bed thats a bit of an honour you know its supposed to be quieter bluey looked round anxiously it was certainly a change from the last hospital the long narrow lower ward of the annex was crammed with beds though the patients were mostly dressed and lounging about smoking laughing or chatting noisily they struck him as an odd bunch the majority were bandaged heavily about the head some wore slings and plaster casts others had their hands in bulky dressings like boxinggloves the ward radio was at full blast it always was at smithers botham from early tea to lights out right through the war graham often idly wondered how many people died to the strains of geraldo do you want me to turn in bluey asked not unless youre tired in the annex we like to keep everyone up and about dr bickley thinks it stops you getting bad chests whos dr bickley asked bluey warily you never knew how many of these medical jokers were waiting to have a go at you im under dr trevose dr bickleys the gasman the anaesthetist youll meet him later you can smoke whenever you like there arent any rules have you got enough cigarettes the boysll help you light them im all right he wasnt going to feel gratitude towards anybody is there anything special you like to eat well try to get it but we cant guarantee results im not particular heres peter the nurse smiled hell look after you hes the oldest inhabitant the nurse left bluey with another man in flight lieutenants uniform his tunic hanging from his shoulders and his sleeves pinned to the pockets bluey inspected him with fascination his face was mostly hidden in crepe bandages but a strange yellowishpink sausage sprouted from the middle of it this was fixed to his left wrist held against his cheek by a plaster cast his hands were bandaged but his thumb was free enough to grasp a cigarette in a long holder im peter thomas announced the apparition amiably welcome to the mausoleum youre the australian arent you i remember seeing you in the daily mirror if i recollect aright you were sharing the page with jane what do they do to you in this place make you look like an advert for brylcreem bluey stared round how long before they let you out well its inclined to be a long job as possibly you can see for yourself the wizz doesnt believe in rushing things the wizz the wizard trevose he made this elephants trunk affair its a wrist pedicle it started life as a slice of skin from my belly the wizz kept my wrist attached to my navel for weeks before raising it to higher things its all a matter of reestablishing the blood supply before making the next move youll soon pick up the lingo we become very professional here you know the pedicles going to be part of my nose incidentally the two officers started walking along the line of beds its noisy observed bluey the place i came from they shut me up alone in a room life is very informal in annex d everyone mucks in together all services all ranks its the wizzs idea good for morale he says though i rather think he does it to annoy the brasshats we had an admiral in here last week he fell on his face down a ladder drunk doubtless i dont think he cared for the atmosphere much the only gentleman enjoying privacy at the moment is a german bastard shut in the padded cell as bluey stopped short his companion gave a laugh didnt you know this used to be a nuthouse the change isnt always apparent which part of australia do you come from outside of melbourne my people own a sheepstation i came over to join up before the war his nearlidless eyes stared round maybe all this means im on my way back again theyll notice a change in you said peter thomas crisply it was a remark in the spirit of annex d the men had grown a shell of arrogance towards the world which had brought them to such straits to be pitied was so unbearable any eye sensed to be softening with compassion fired only an explosion of rudeness the nurses got used to itif they didnt graham had them shifted to more conventional wards the elderly hospital padre found his attempts to cheer up the poor boys so unwelcome his christian fortitude collapsed beneath him and he avoided the place even wellmeaning ladies with baskets of gifts saw them accepted without a flicker of gratitude after all the patients felt the country owed them more for their pains than a few bars of chocolate i suppose ive caught it pretty badly bluey hazarded oh ive seen worse peter thomas told him with an air of authority when did they get you i was one of the earliest ive been in here so long im practically one of the staff whats happening outside nobodys told me any news the germans seem to be crying off in daylight at any rate thats funny i thought wed go on like that flying every day till the end of the war they stopped at blueys bed the last before the partition dividing off the operating theatre i was just starting to believe in my luck if you like ill see if i can find a newspaper peter thomas offered helpfully though the selection isnt very uplifting therell probably be a daily press which is good for at least one laugh thanks i reckon ive a lot to catch up bluey sat on his bed and inspected his surroundings there was no need for mirrors in annex d he could see himself in the monstrosities all round him he suddenly realized he was an outcast a frightening object something to make any man wince and any woman run away in horror for the first time the bitterness of his humiliation swept over him he wanted to cry in selfpity but his lachrymal glands were burnt and even to weep was impossible brigadier haileybury was a fairminded man he knew trevose was a prima donna unwilling or temperamentally unable to fit into any coordinated effort even to win a war and of course pile didnt help the fellow was unbelievably stupid but the line must be drawn somewhere authority must be established on the morning following blueys arrival he appeared at smithers botham to make his first inspection of the annex he could readily believe piles account of indiscipline among grahams patients he needed only to recall the notorious laxity of grahams own life before the war it would have to be checked even if it meant a row haileybury was aware that he and graham had quarrelled every second time they met and recalled uneasily that he himself generally got the worst of it trevose had a quick tongue and a slick way of putting things but now haileybury told himself he was dressed in authoritywhich was neither little nor in view of the summers military disasters likely to be brief he marched across the lawn with captain pile admiring the flowerbeds as the operating theatre now blocked one end of the annex entrance was between the horsebox lavatories and the kitchen where twice daily the nurses portioned out food dispatched from the central smithers botham kitchens in reputedly heatproof trolleys as the pair entered the door of the washroom opened and graham himself appeared he was wearing a surgeons green gown with a gauze mask dangling below his chin and seemed busy haileybury i was delighted to learn of your impending visit he began affably id been hoping youd look us up all summer im glad to find you so cheerful trevose no one knows better than myself the difficulties under which youve been obliged to work i agree we havent sufficient equipment sufficient room sufficient staff or a sufficient number of hours in the day but we manage id like you to see our star turn he invited nurse give these two gentlemen masks and gowns step inside its the saline bath unit in a partitioned corner of the washhouse one of the bathtubs was in use sitting up to his waist in water was a manor so it was to be assumed the creature being without hair eyebrows or nose the skin of his face and even his eyelids burnt away there were two nurses working on him in white gowns and rubber gloves one was moistening the mans head with a trickle of clear solution running from a glass vessel suspended near the ceiling the other was manipulating a pair of forceps in the stream picking away plaques of hard black material embedded in the pus and raw tissue captain pile whose eyes had become used to inspecting official rather than human material felt his stomach turn over very interesting said haileybury somewhat heath robinson but it works graham explained its got plenty of snags for one thing the saline solution in the carboy up there cools too quickly its a nuisance for the nurses to keep replacing it doubtless said haileybury they watched the operation in silence after a few minutes graham led them out why do you do it to them haileybury he demanded haileybury untied the tapes of his surgeons gown do what plaster those burns with tannic acid jelly do you know what i feel when i look round my wards no hatred of the germans their fellows are getting even worse treatment i know that well enough i lectured there before the war no i simply writhe with indignation over the stupidity of my own countrymen so you think tannic acid is stupid do you haileybury asked drily i think its criminal but you must know perfectly well trevose it happens to be the regulation treatment and what else would you suggest that the dressingstations do nothing in the way of firstaid at all thats exactly what i do suggest im charitably assuming you treat burns with the equivalent of grannies cold tea because one you cant think of anything better and two you want the casualties to feel somethings being done for them well somethings being done all right medieval mutilation i really dont think i need comment on that said haileybury wearily ever since ive known you youve ruined your advocacy of any cause worthy or not with the extravagance of your language graham suddenly felt angry this situation doesnt need any language at all he pointed to the closed door of the washhouse havent you eyes to see for yourself that patients a pilot officer observer in a blenheim which failed to take off properly for some reason or other the pilot was burnt to a cinder by the time that poor devil turned up here his head and neck had skin like an elephants you know what it was dont you congealed tannic acid his hands were worse where hed tried to pull his blazing clothes off the fingers were drawn into the palms webbed together one black horrible mess thats his real tragedy with time and luck i can give him a face which will pass without too much comment in a crowd but hell probably never feed or wash himself again even light his own cigarette hell be dependent on someone for the rest of his life an awful prospect for both parties haileybury decided to be firm but patient if the argument was to end in his favour trevose needed even more thoughtful handling than usual i can appreciate how you feel involved with these men trevose but you must try and see our arrangements as a whole the application of tannic acid as a firstaid measure to burns isnt some shot in the dark its been most carefully thought out it is the official procedure it is regulation treatment he emphasized then its got to be changed do you know the first cases i had in here a pair of naval ratings picked up after an hour in the sea at dunkirk both were badly burnt in the arms and legs both did splendidly no tannic acid just salt solution like im using here natures own now youre being fanciful haileybury started to sound irritated im certainly not going to let you rush all of us into something entirely new am i send me a lot more burns and make up your mind in six months id like you to pull a few strings for me by the way graham invited airily the units got to be expanded i shall have to squeeze a second operating table into the theatre somehow tudor beverley can run that himself hes good enough ill need more assistants and we want more huts desperately its like a slum in here you might reduce your difficulties if you ceased scouring the countryside for extra patients haileybury told him bleakly graham gave a grin you heard about that did you its the services own fault its weeks before i see some of the cases they go on a ghastly traipse all over the shop rotting for weeks in hospitals in scotland or wales miles away faulty organization thats the trouble id like you to do something about that too please and quickly haileybury became angry despite himself have you thought of making life easier for yourself and everyone else with some attempt to understand how service administration works the only administration i understand is the one which gets me my own way no ones yet signed for the extra beds shifted here sir interrupted captain pile who was feeling out of it oh do be quiet captain snapped haileybury listen trevose i know youre an enthusiast often enough ill admit in a perfectly good cause but you cant expect the services to make fundamental changes according to your whim of the moment please get that into your mind for a start do you imagine i havent thought about these problems just as carefully as you or anyone else you must issue instructions banning tannic acid are you giving me orders yes haileybury drew a breath you might have the courtesy to recognize my position even if you dont respect it why should i its i who have to handle the patients anyway i know far more about burns than you do you would seem to have lost nothing of your high opinion of yourself its a justifiable opinion graham told him offhandedly as far as i could make out before the war haileybury exclaimed your best skill was concentrated in your cock he stopped looking confused he could not remember using the expression before trevose always seemed to bring out vulgarity in him then do as you please graham said casually ill get the tannic acid banned by the raf at least you know a member of parliament called fergusson ive heard of him haileybury admitted surlily hes just collared a job in the air ministry have you met his wife sally wonderful pair of tits guaranteed to stop the conversation at a party well i made them the couple are pathetically grateful you mean you intend to go behind my back ive no inhibitions about going behind anyones back if i think its in a good cause haileybury said nothing it was all most frustrating you know ive made so many bad decisions in my life graham told him with returning cheerfulness its good to find once in a while ive hit on the right one i mean staying out of uniform i would offer no view on the lightness or wrongness of that haileybury looked at him sourly it seemed he had lost the argument as usual he vaguely wondered why as i am here perhaps you would invite me to look round your wards he added as sarcastically as possible of course graham smiled you know that i am always ready to oblige an old acquaintance in any professional matter whatever graham opened the door of the ward it was a terrible thought he told himself but he was really quite enjoying the war but why dont you divorce her graham asked denise bickley i cant understand why you dont divorce her it was a subject which graham chose to skip away from as quickly as possible i hate having truck with lawyers i suppose he told her they give me the creeps with their undertakers clothes and their undertakers faces burying all your hopes under a mound of stony possibilities but unfortunately not at undertakers rates smiled john bickley the anaesthetist across the log fire it was a sunday afternoon in the first week of when the luftwaffe was bombing the country nighty the onion had become a fragrant memory whisky and bananas had vanished with the other flavours of peace and the war was starting to change from a perilous adventure to a wearisome way of life but you can divorce her you know johns wife denise was chillingly well informed about everything to do with the married state you can these days the laws been changed why does the woman continually go paddling in the muddy waters of my soul graham asked himself so i understand he agreed a p herberts act altered everything marias been mad for over five years so im legally at liberty to rid myself of the encumbrance whenever i feel like it of course it was different when i first had her locked up graham had hoped that putting the situation so starkly might shame denise into changing the subject but she persisted id have thought it worth taking the trouble if only to get things straight but how could it make the slightest difference to my life supposing you wanted to get married again denise exclaimed graham laughed well you never know im fortysix hardly the romantic age anyway whos to be the bride how old must maria be now asked denise let me seeshes nine years older than me which makes her fiftyfive hows she bearing up physically i mean asked john it was an attempt to turn the conversation he knew grahams sensitivities far better than his wife did her bodys extremely well i went down with desmond to see her over christmas shes put on a lot of weightthey generally do i gather but her vital organs are functioning perfectly though admittedly her bloodpressures a bit up her minds quite unbalanced of course she doesnt know me sometimes she doesnt know her own nurses on good days she washes herself on bad days she wets the bed denise lit a cigarette and said it must be dreadfully upsetting seeing her like that not particularly i can hardly be expected to correlate her with the person i married she was what they called a society beauty you know the only daughter of our popular tubthumping millionaire lord cazalay a lot of things have happened since then graham reflected sombrely lord cazalays gone bust for a start graham may i ask you one thing denise puffed earnestly im only trying to help you do understand that dont you ask anything you like said graham resignedly do you still love her i never did but surely you must have done once i dont know i dont know if ive ever been in love with anybody i fancy i have some sort of inborn immunity to the condition like some people have for tuberculosis or perhaps i just expect too much but thats a tragedy graham a life without love is it arent people overobsessed with such attitudes its all the fault of the pictures and the wireless anyway ive enough satisfaction for one lifetime in my work that tannic acid row was fun laughed john grahams face lit up he developed an almost schoolboy eagerness when anyone started talking about the annex it was amusing wasnt it i told you if mcindoe and myself made enough fuss in the right places theyd ban it fergusson grasped the point at once luckily haileybury was so delightfully furious he suffers a terrible spasticity of ideas that man his minds as rigid as a plank in peacetime i never had much use for the bigwigs who impose their authority on the profession you know that john i never realized how gratifying it would be to extend my range in the war he looked at his wristwatch it was a wonderful lunch denise but i must go she looked disappointed and asked wont you stay for another cup of coffee she always did every sunday i promised to see peter thomas this afternoon a vital consultationhes bursting to go on leave then ive someone to interview for a job id like an early start in the theatre tomorrow john he added an awful list of oddments has piled up tim ororys sending us a newborn baby with a hare lip it ought to be done as soon as possible i think to give the poor little thing a chance to have a go at mothers milk ill have the case on the table at eight id be much obliged said graham when he had gone denise started clearing the dishes and declared i really cant understand about graham and maria her husband tall bony wearing an old jacket and chalkstriped flannels stretched himself in front of the fire perhaps he doesnt think a divorce would be in marias own interests i couldnt believe that for a moment she said impatiently grahams one of the most selfish men i know hes totally selfcentred about everything even the war john started refilling his pipe i imagined our graham had undergone something of a sea change this last year i certainly hadnt noticed it he stuck a spill of newspaper into the fire matches were becoming almost as precious as razorblades do you think he really is so selfish the plastic surgery racket was pretty tough in london before the war you know if a man didnt push himself nobody else would take the trouble now that it doesnt matter a damn to graham if he operates on three cases a week or thirty perhaps he can afford the luxury of indulging his better nature he hasnt been showing much of it to you lately has he in the annex i mean john shrugged never an easygoing colleague graham was becoming worsetempered in the theatre than ever with the amount of work were getting through some tension between surgeon and anaesthetist is inevitable denise picked up the tray if he did divorce the woman it would all be perfectly respectable he wouldnt have to take a girl for a weekend to brighton or anything like that i rather think you need a permit these days to pass a weekend in brighton john observed mildly oh you never take anything seriously she complained disappearing into the kitchen graham usually walked from the bickleys cottage back to smithers botham on the double assumption that it did him good and he ought to save his official petrol he started along the bare country lane wondering how he could get out of these sunday lunches denises insensitivity was deadly she had come into his life on the shoulders of john a friend of twenty years standing john bickley had given the anaesthetics since graham was a young housesurgeon making a false start on throat work in the days when children were submitted to the rape of their tonsils under the oblivion of asphyxia more than anaesthesia perhaps denise was jealous graham wondered the relationship of surgeon and anaesthetist had something in common with marriage he and john had half a lifetime of shared experience together having faced the triumphs failures and excitements concentrated in the few square feet round an operating table as graham had become a fashionable plastic surgeon so john bickley had become a fashionable doper or stuffist hurrying with his rubber tubes and cylinders from nursinghome to nursinghome on a timetable more complicated than bradshaws the surgeons allowed him ten per cent of the operating fee so he had to keep in with a good many to keep going the year before the war he had married denise whom he had met at a suburban golfclub she was tall slim blonde and athletic and had money it struck graham that ever afterwards john occupied himself by keeping in with her graham hadnt liked denise from the start she had taken him over as she had taken over everything else connected with her husband even his saturdays golf it was becoming a complication to their work in the theatre and graham wouldnt countenance any complication likely to affect his patients the bickleys had found a cottage near smithers bothamvery luckily the arrival of blackfriars having shifted most of the white elephants squatting on local estate agents books having neither children nor evacuees denise had first invited graham to live with them confessing her astonishment at his tolerating the pub but he was never a man to lack excuses she insisted he at least called for sunday lunch she had a pressing sense of social duty devoting much energy to organizing the wives of blackfriars consultants scattered round the countryside into cosy if meatless dinner parties into fours of bridge or sets of tennis and into the knitting of large quantities of balaclava helmets she loved quizzing him about maria it seemed to be her sunday treat graham could anyway hardly explain his motives for not divorcing his wife when he didnt know them himself perhaps he had no more than a vague reluctance to put down some decrepit animal which once strode vigorously in the sunshine of admiration or perhaps he thought more darkly his wife was a mothersubstitute his feelings towards her loaded with guiltbut one mustnt take too much notice of the psychiatrists they told a lot of fairytales somehow he must see less of denise particularly now it looked as though theyd be living in each others pockets at smithers botham for life only general wavell in the western desert was providing any encouraging sweeping black arrows on the frontpage maps of lord arlotts daily press graham wondered glumly if the ebullient australian newspaper proprietor whom he had known well enough in peacetime had foreseen that his task of chirpingly maintaining civilian morale every morning would have reached its present bleak severity reaching his office in the hut outside the annex graham changed his shoes pulled on a white coat and sent a nurse for peter thomas i hope im a specimen worthy of display to the outer world peter began cheerfully the patients flesh sausage was by then detached from his wrist and starting to turn into something like a nose the rest of his face was a patchwork of skin too yellow and too shiny graham thought cut from various bits of his body graham removed a dressing and saw with satisfaction that some sepsis in the corner of his last graft had healed the sulphanilamide powder seems to have done the trick he announced its saved me the necessity of having to use you as a guineapig for penicillin penny what oh its some stuff they invented at marys their prof fleming found a mould which kept killing off the bugs he was trying to grow in his lab it must have been very irritating until he put two and two together our medical unit are working on it its supposed to be secret though god knows why the stuffs as rare as hens teeth whats it look like asked peter with interest very yellow and sticky and personally i dont think its going to be the slightest use graham took the mans hands not much movement yet annoying is that physiotherapy girl bullying you to use your hands peter quite delightfully so i think we can risk doing without your company for a couple of months graham decided he turned to the folder of notes on his desk then im afraid its back for the next stage how long o wizz how long altogether the next step shouldnt be too bad ill make you some eyebrows from the hair on the nape of your neck but ive never made a secret that well be very old friends by the time we finally part youre a major construction job thats an interesting way of putting it im sorry it must make me sound dreadfully heartless but thats the secret of your success wizz youve got a ward full of monsters and you look on us as so many construction jobs exactly the right attitude surely you know how sickening it is to be pitied graham nodded yes of course i do but im not putting on an act you know ive always looked on my patients as construction jobs i could never have run the sort of practice i had before the war otherwise you must find us lot rather a comedown after remodelling film stars quite the opposite said graham warmly when i came out here i knew id have to remodel my operative techniqueafter all a land mine makes rather more mess than even the worst car smash what i didnt know was the extent to which id have to remodel myself what did i do before the war i lifted a face or reshaped a nose took out the stitches collected the fee and that was that but i live with you fellows day and night youve always got some interesting problem for me to solve psychological if it isnt surgical peter laughed you make us sound like a bunch of damn nuisances on the contrary youve presented me with an object in life you didnt seek out my service like my patients in peacetime youd no choice the war washed you up on my doorstep i feel i owe you something he laughed too its terribly stimulating and terribly gratifying this wizz stuff its stupid really im only doing my job but it means more to me than the most gushing praise i ever got for hanging a new pair of tits on an actress you boys are highly selective in your appreciation of anything were exposed to an awful lot of wellmeaning hypocrites we soon learn to pick out the genuine ones or perhaps its just a form of selfishness on my part graham philosophized i like to think of you as worthwhile memorials to my surgery ive reached a depressing age im beginning to realize im at the whim of any passing disease death hath ten thousand several doors for men to take their exitsa sobering reminder from webster but what am i complaining for he apologized youve been near enough to getting yourself killed yes and i was terrified ive vomited in the cockpit once though i kept pretty quiet about it i accomplished what you would refer to as defaecation youd no hopes of the life hereafter i preferred to wait and see i expect youre right i had a brother once a medical missionary he at least departed this life in a spirit of glowing optimism do you want some cigarettes graham felt suddenly the conversation was becoming too selfrevealing but now he never had a chance to reveal anything of himself to anybody theyre called sweet caporalscanadian it seems he had given up smoking mainly through the tediousness of queueing but scrounged what he could for his patients do you want another book he tossed a paperback on his desk alongside the unfamiliar white packet in peacetime he hardly got through a book a year now he spent most evenings in his room at the oak reading there was nothing like a world war to simplify your life its decline and fall by evelyn waugh very funny hows bluey getting on he added somewhat restless graham lit the cigarette in peters holder that was bad news bluey had to stand at least another dozen operations and needed all the patience he could muster though his morale has improved considerably peter added since getting his hands on a supply of rum god knows where from he keeps it in his locker which i presume is strictly against regulations the annex houses enough trouble without regulations graham said briefly he looked at his watch very well peter off you go on leave now there should be a female waiting for me i dont know what shes likeyoung old fat thin as ugly as sin or a goddess she wants to take over as ward sister god help her peter looked surprised the dragons going yes sister james has decided to join the qas and nurse the army you can hardly blame her after the annex shell find even a pitched battle a rest cure as the blackfriars matron has broken off diplomatic relations with me through the disgraceful behaviour of my patients he told peter with a grin i am obliged to find most of my own staff this ones been recommended by a surgeon i know in a childrens hospital just about the right background for handling you lot id imagine send her in will you the prospective sister struck graham as resembling a botticelli virgin with disastrous dresssense she was slight fair and transparentlooking wearing lisle stockings stout laced black shoes and a suit of green and very hairy tweed she had no hat her hair was in the usual pageboy bob big eyes graham noticed a pretty mouth if rather overlarge no trace of makeup but a good skin he decided she didnt look nearly tough enough its miss mills isnt it he asked as she sat with hands crossed demurely in her lap im afraid all i know about you is confined to a telephone conversation with mr cavill and the line was terrible yes clare mills im mr cavills staff nurse she had a soft voice speaking with great deliberation graham noticed she had a trick of emphasizing her last syllables probably nervousness he suspected how old are you twentythree how the nursing profession thrusts responsibility on its daughters graham reflected before the war they had to be twentyone and of unspotted character before being allowed to handle the blackfriars sick at all but perhaps women were built for it after all there was no responsibility like motherhood and that was liable to catch a girl unawares anytime id better make plain from the start that the work here isnt hard miss mills its exhausting im an impossible taskmaster im demanding boorish and usually most ungrateful i dont expect loyalty i expect devotion i tolerate incompetence badly and fools not at all its a mystery how i manage to keep any assistants in the place and the patients are much worse than i am life can be hell for nursing staff in the annex though to be fair most of them seem to find it an enjoyable hell graham smiled at her would you like to end our interview here and now i should very much like the post mr trevose why she hesitated ive always wanted to work on a plastic surgery unit a strange ambition she paused again and went on shyly you once operated on a friend of mine mr trevose she was a girlseventeen at the time she had a deformed lip her name was susan wright graham tried to remember it was impossible he had operated on so many girls i can only hope the operation was a success oh yes she suddenly became animated it made an enormous difference to her not only physically i mean but mentally she told me all about you mr trevosehow understanding you were how skilful perhaps it gave me the ambition of one day working for you graham folded his arms she was terribly young but old cavill had praised her warmly enough shed be pretty to have about the annex perhaps the boys would take pity on her delicate looks though he doubted it and she had a neat hand with flattery a sensible girl it was a talent which had taken him a long way at the beginning of his career can you start on wednesday he asked her bluey jardine bared the upper half of his left arm with an air of resignation he knew exactly what was coming to him it was a friday morning following the sunday when graham had sent peter thomas on leave which gave bluey the dubious honour of being the wards oldest inhabitant he had then been in the annex four months and into the theatre eight times like everyone else he had developed a keen interest in the science which was bedevilling him the routine of an operation had become as familiar to him as the routine of flying the injection about to enter his arm was his premedication and he even knew the names of the drugs there was one hundredandfiftieth of a grain of scopolamine which dried up your mouth and lungs and stopped you bubbling and drowning yourself once you were under there was a third of a grain of omnopon which was just another name for morphia and gave you guts he twitched as the staff nurse punctured his skin with the syringe the more needles they stuck into you the more you came to hate them he lay back in bed wearing long white knitted socks and a short overlaundered cotton nightshirt which fastened with rubber buttons at the back he didnt seem to be growing as drowsy as usual perhaps the injection was losing effect only to be expected he told himself once he could get drunk on a bottle of beer now it needed a couple of crates he wondered how many more operations the wizz had in store for him it never occurred to bluey that he might ask graham to stop to leave him with a halfpatched face and makeshift hands but in peace he accepted his treatment as something which went on until it reached its natural end like the war as they wheeled him the few yards from the ward to the operating theatre on a trolley he searched the ceiling for a peculiar starshaped crack as he always touched the dried kangaroo paw in his tunic pocket before flying sometimes when they trundled you out you were dead scared others you didnt give a damn he supposed it depended how rough they were on your last visit anyway the operation today was kids stuff hed soon get over it with luck hed be out on the grog again on saturday night as usual the anaesthetic room improvised out of flimsy partitions was hardly big enough to hold the patient the ward nurse accompanying him the tall frame of john bickley and the anaesthetic trolley gleaming with dials bottles piping and coloured cylinders bluey raised his head from the pillow the gasman his long green gown pushed up to his elbows was holding a large syringe not another bloody needle youre a favoured customer bluey no gas this time im sending you off with an injection go on this was an interesting departure something to tell the ward afterwards the anaesthetist rubbed a swab of cold antiseptic on the crook of blueys left arm whats the stuff called evipan john drew back the plunger of his syringe a swirl of blood telling him the needle lay safely inside the vein if the injection went by error into the skin of blueys elbow there would be an abscess and a terrible row with graham there you didnt even feel the needle did you now count out loud bluey reached fifteen yawned deeply and fell asleep john plucked out the syringe simultaneously freeing blueys breathing by holding up his chin this stuff was invented by our friends the germans he told the nurse i ought to use it as a routine the boys get pretty browned off being suffocated every time with gas that cant be much fun when you have to face a dozen operations on the trot like all specialist anaesthetists john bickley brought to his work the artistic touch of an experienced chef first he held a triangular padded mask tight to blueys patchwork face and concocted a delicately proportioned mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide gas then he moved a lever on a bottle of blue liquid to add a trace of trichlorethylene vapoura more powerful anaesthetic to deepen blueys unconsciousness john edged across the lever on another bottle to admit the pungent vapour of ether the main ingredient of the dish bluey coughed fiercely he always did john reflected he should insist that graham stop his patients smoking for at least a week before their operations but graham objected that would be bad for morale and theyd smoke in the lavatories anyway graham objected to almost everything he suggested it struck john wearily ever since he had started calling for sunday lunch two coloured bobbins already danced up thin vertical glass tubes on johns anaesthetic trolley indicating the volume of oxygen and nitrous oxide flowing to his patient when he judged the anaesthesia deep enough he sent a third bobbin spinning by adding carbon dioxide to the mixture this stimulated blueys breathing until he was heaving away as though finishing some desperate race in his sleep with economical movements john laid aside the facemask reached for a narrow stiff greased redrubber tube and inserted it into the remains of blueys right nostril he edged it inwards gentlyan unsuspected nasal polyp would bring blood all over the shop and an even worse row with grahamlistening to the breathsounds as it slipped behind blueys flaccid tongue then finally through his widely open larynx into his windpipe it was a technique invented by harold gillies own anaesthetist ivan magill to deliver the anaesthetic directly into the patients lungs while leaving his face and mouth as a sterile unoccupied battlefield for the plastic surgeon that looked pretty easy i must say observed the nurse who like all nurses had long ago ceased to be impressed by her medical overlords but her remark pleased john the trick was rather like playing darts in the dark not easy at all only the experience of twenty years made it seem so as bluey himself knew the operation was to be a simple affair graham cut a thin graft of skin from blueys thigh with a thiersch knife like an oversized razor then stitched it along his chin where a former one had failed to take bluey was back in bed within the half hour struggling to consciousness through dreams about flying which were always unpleasant but soon forgotten he woke up deciding he didnt feel as bad as usual the gasmans injection was a winner the next night hed be fit enough to finish the bottle of rum in his locker then slip out with half a dozen others to the oak knowing the habits of his patients graham made a point on saturday nights of taking a bus to the pictures in maiden cross that saturday he queued to see an american film about the war in which all the germans conversed in villainous guttural undertones all the british officers had oxford accents and all their men talked like sam weller the star was stella garrod the woman graham had made a fool of himself with before the war he wondered wryly if she ever bothered to think of him in fact she spoke fondly and often of her affair with the little london surgeon immorality with englishmen having after dunkirk considerable kudos in hollywood when graham reached home on the last bus the pub was already closed but bluey and his companions had been disinclined to finish the evening they had staggered down the smithers botham drive singing cats on the rooftops and the night being moonlit someone noticed a collection of builders materials stacked outside captain piles office under the gleaming portico bluey gave a whoop as he found a tin of paint and a brush a porter appeared through the complicated blackout screening the front door to investigate but identifying denizens of the annex retreated instantly bluey painted across the portico a single word in large letters one on each of the four columns then they went singing and laughing back to the annex and bed the night nurses were used to it early the next morning mrs sedgewicksmith came down the hospital drive hurrying to a longstanding appointment with the elderly padre mrs sedgewicksmith was the wife of a stockbroker who commanded the local home guard and before the war had filled the vacuum of her life by fussing over the mental patients at smithers botham or as many of them as remained socially presentable she had organized whist drives jumble sales demure dances and extremely amateur theatricals invited the inmates for tea or for outings in her rolls all of which she bracketed as giving the poor things a nice little break the war presented even more poor things as targets for her deadly solicitude she had installed herself as unofficial welfare officer at smithers botham and was beginning to hope the war would go on long enough for somebody to give her a medal for it she saw the word she was horribly shocked it was not a word which could possibly appear in print but she had of course overheard it from workmen soldiers lunatics and the like she had always imagined it spelt with a ph like phutt to see it splashed in black paint across the portico was absolutely outrageous and on a sunday morning too she would have to find captain pile captain pile occupied a comfortable villa in the grounds where he managed to live in unmilitary domesticity with his wife and two children he was in his braces enjoying his breakfast he put on his tunic and inspected the word officially though he used it frequently himself he had to affect an air of disgust as pained as his informants mrs sedgewicksmith must be humoured at all costs she was a powerful lady at smithers botham the dispenser of valuable grace and favours mostly unobtainable off the ration when graham arrived at the annex at nine for an informal sunday wardround with his new sister his spirits fell as he noticed miss mills in close conversation at the ward door with captain pile he caught sight of mrs sedgewicksmith and they dropped further he had often noticed her fluttering in and out of the tudor house across the village green but hearing she was a professional busybody had taken pains to avoid her besides she was thick with denise bickley and probably knew far more about his personal affairs than she deserved good morning graham greeted the visitors politely anything i can do for you im afraid a most serious matter has arisen mr trevose captain pile told him solemnly oh god this is going to be a bore graham thought i expect youve seen the main entrance this morning the captain added no i came here direct through the orchard a worda most offensive wordhas been written across it in paint mrs sedgewicksmith was most disturbed to see it im sorry about that buti know the annex has a bad namewhy hold my patients responsible for the simple reason they were seen by the nightporter flight lieutenant jardine and some others graham nodded slowly thats encouraging he thought blueys getting enough function in his hands to wield a paint brush then i can only apologize most sincerely to both you and mrs sedgewicksmith you realize theyd been drinking had they i dont mind that i even encourage it graham explained mildly its a matter of pride to my anaesthetist if they feel capable of taking a few drinks after his attentions seeing the captains irritated expression he continued you see i want these men to live a normal life or as normal as they can manage i want them to think of an operation as something as casual as a visit to the dentist not the upheaval of a lifetime thats all very well the captain told him testily but you have to maintain discipline ill talk to them said graham firmly i promise isnt that enough it wont happen again no that is not enough mr trevose you cannot simply take the affair into your own hands it is my duty to see that appropriate action is taken listen captain said graham briskly i alone am responsible for these patients neither you nor the army nor anyone else has the first idea how to cope with them will you kindly understand that his patience suddenly broke and he felt angry in peacetime he had been a somebody the friend of rich and influential men a doctor with a name almost as familiar to the general public as lord horders now he was being lectured by some hack in a uniform which passed as a substitute for intelligence cant you see these men arent invalids grahams outstretched arm indicated the ward where the patients were lying in bed reading the sunday papers trying hard to give the impression they werent listening bluey himself was asleep at the end snoring loudly underneath their wounds and scars theyre full of life fit and lusty they were youngsters with charm and sexappeal and what happened in a few seconds they were turned into objects of horror then they were locked up in this converted madhouse and thats not to be their fate for a week or a month or even a year when the wars over and everyones back in their comfortable little slots these patients of mine will still be coming up for another graft another pedicle another operation of some sort how are they going to face that miserable prospect if they cant run wild now and then captain pile tried to say something but graham went on do you know what happened in the last war when i first heard of plastic surgery i was a patient myself in a sanatorium there was a plastic unit billeted in half the wards every afternoon under kings regulations the men had to be marched by an nco round the countryside for exercise you can imagine the effect people werent so well educated then were more superstitious youd have thought an army of ghouls was advancing on them they locked their doors covered their windows and hid their children so the army confined the poor fellows to hospital with nothing to look at but each otheran inspired piece of moralebuilding i dont want any of that nonsense in this war theres one thing my patients ask from the world and only one to be treated as normal individuals oh i know its difficult theyre freaks but the effort isnt much to ask i think mr trevose is perfectly right announced mrs sedgewicksmith captain pile spun round the unexpected desertion of his ally appalled him trevose was a difficult customer at the best of times and that morning he needed all the support he could muster she stood tugging the hem of her tweed jacket and staring at graham with large grey eyes she must have been quite a goodlooking girl graham thought even now i could do her face a power of good after all continued mrs sedgewicksmith crisply there are no children roaming the hospital and the rest of us surely know that expression exists exactly said graham mrs sedgewicksmith had undergone a change of heart she had been dying to meet graham for eighteen months he was the graham trevose the man you once saw in the tatler the surgeon one or two of her friends could talk about quite breathlessly now she saw him at close quarters she realized he had a distinction a dignity an authority an air about him which captain pile despite his uniform so sadly lacked in short graham trevose was a gentleman and war or no war the ladies and gentlemen of england had to stand shoulder to shoulder together we mustnt wallow in our indignation she continued calmly and im sure the paint can very easily be cleaned off mr trevose i appreciate every word that you have said isnt there anything i can do for your patients to give them a nice little break there most certainly is and it isnt very much just ask them to tea invite along some girls and talk about the weather this is nothing to do with a breach of discipline captain pile broke in furiously surely captain if nelson could turn a blind eye you can asked mrs sedgewicksmith tartly there are so many regulations these days none of us can avoid breaking one or two can we captain pile fell silent he had been rather afraid of this turn in the conversation regularly every friday mrs sedgewicksmith brought him half a dozen eggs from her hens in a cardboard box labelled as red cross library books a side of bacon had once been smuggled into his house wrapped in a sheet to resemble the laundry there had been pots of gooseberry jam pounds of sugar even a few ounces of butter it would be sad if the flow ceased captain pile was extremely fond of egg and bacon for his breakfast it was a testing decision should he pawn his military honour for a handful of eggs i suppose if you dont feel inclined to press the matter mrs sedgewicksmith i extremely sensible of you she said quickly she turned to graham with a smile mr trevose i do hope you can drop in for a little drink some evening im sure my husband can find something in the cupboard graham promised the bargain struck him as cheap at the price when graham finally started his wardround he said to sister mills im sorry about that it doesnt happen every sunday morning oh what a pity she smiled i thought you were terribly impressive mr trevose though i cant for the life of me see what all the fuss was about neither can i said graham it suddenly occurred to him he didnt even know what the word was the hostess opened her own front door in peacetime as she was halftempted to explain there would have been a maid in a lace apron im so glad you could come mrs sedgewicksmith greeted them brightly bluey and the halfdozen others who had courted disgrace on the saturday night found themselves standing on mrs sedgewicksmiths doorstep the following monday afternoon graham had conscripted them as a punishment the outing had not struck them as at all attractive tea didnt promise much fun and an invitation from the local grand lady had an intolerable air of condescension about it but if the wizz told them to go go they must even bluey agreed a bloke would do anything to please the wizz hello missus announced bluey heres the home for the sick and crippled frankensteins monsters annual outing mrs sedgewicksmith gave an uncertain smile but years of intense social struggle with the wives of other stockbrokers had tempered her conviviality like steel she hesitated only a second before continuing but do come in quite a charming afternoon for the time of year isnt it bluey led his companions into the hall he stared round graham had warned him to be on his best behaviour but he was determined to keep the social balance tilted in his favour old place youve got here missus oh yes parts of it go back to henry the eighth bluey sniffed smells like it there was an awkward silence as the patients stood grinning at their hostess like mischievous children with halloween masks i must treat them as normal people she reminded herself as perfectly normal people like the charming young men who used to call before the war for tennis and surely if they were officers they must also be gentlemen even the one with sergeants stripes on his sleeve was aircrew and as things went at the time socially acceptable her loss for something to say was relieved by the oak door of the sittingroom opening to emit a slight girl in a yellowandwhite flowered dress with rigidly outstretched hand and a rigidly fixed smile my youngest daughter stephanie said mrs sedgewicksmith on a note of enthusiasm spiffing to meet you said stephanie hand still outstretched stephanie was at an age which should have changed her from a grub in boardingschool uniform to flutter gaily amid the dances and parties of the season as it was she was trying to decide whether to start as a probationer nurse at smithers botham or to make sten guns in the shadow factory at maiden cross but graham had prescribed girls and girls being like everything else in short supply mrs sedgewicksmith had patriotically concluded that stephanie must do you should have warned us missus youd a houseful of beautiful women said bluey sarcastically you mustnt say things like that smiled her mother youll turn her head stephanie went pink oh mummy you must forgive my daughter for being a little shy mrs sedgewicksmith apologized uneasily you see she doesnt have much chance to meet young men these days the war has quite ruined our social life its ruined a lot of things said bluey they went into the timbered drawingroom there was a small fire an eggless cake and meatpaste sandwiches spread with margarinemrs sedgewicksmith considered raiding the butterration as carrying compassion too far she fiddled anxiously amid the teacups aware that her guests were going to be terribly difficult to entertain of course one couldntor at least mustntblame the poor things for being rather peculiar she hoped it wouldnt have any lasting effect on stephanie who was sitting on a low chair with the arresting habit of repeatedly crossing her legs then nervously tugging her hem over the knee of her lisle stockings her mother had instructed her sternly to treat the guests as perfectly normal her boardingschool had instructed her even more sternly how to carry such things through as she chatted haltingly it amused bluey to see her struggling to pretend they were ordinarylooking individuals shed be a virgin for sure he decided though might make a satisfactory bang if touched up enough first why dont you come back to australia with me after the war stephanie id love to really honestly i would ive heard its a super place its not bad all the good things are freesurfing lying on the beach sunday picnics riding round the station australias got space you can get lost in it theres no one to bother you no one to stare at you he stopped realizing he had unthinkingly let show the raw edge of his feelings the sergeant whom bluey always irritated took advantage of the silence to compliment mrs sedgewicksmith on the sandwiches im so glad you like them i made the paste myself you know from leftovers i got the recipe from a magazinethe food facts are so helpful these days arent they i would have done you a carrot flan as well but of course that needs a lemon jelly for the glazing and there just isnt one in the shops food at the time was starting to replace sex as the basis of most adult conversation youre quite right about your daughter the sergeant continued its hard to miss the enjoyments of youth you cant store them away like your pretty frocks for use after the war they wont fit any more mrs sedgewicksmith gave a faintly puzzled smile behind the bandages was he young or old serious or mocking just a sergeant or a gentleman theres an exact moment in life for your first taste of wine and of love the sergeant went on youll always remember it and never succeed in recapturing the flavour of either you know i think i read something like that in a book exclaimed mrs sedgewicksmith probably one of mine said the sergeant who had been desperate to make some such remark before the war he had written a couple of novels which though noticed kindly by james agate had not been noticed by his present companions at all mrs sedgewicksmith a threevolumeaweek woman with boots became agreeably flustered to find herself in the company of a man of letters it also kept bluey out of the conversation which continued at a genteel literary level until they had finished the last pale dry crumbs of the tasteless cake then bluey resentful at his ousting from the centre of attention demanded abruptly where is it i beg your pardon said mrs sedgewicksmith the doings i want to go tea runs through me like a dose of salts you mean the smallest room his hostess interpreted coyly she rose helpfully ill show you the way ill need some assistance with the buttons oh said mrs sedgewicksmith bluey fixed stephanie with his eye perhaps the young lady will oblige the young lady will certainly not oblige snapped her mother didnt she say she was thinking of being a nurse asked bluey innocently the nurses do it for us in the annex mrs sedgewicksmith looked round desperately none of the others gave any indication of volunteering they found the situation only something to grin about the literary sergeant might have saved her embarrassment but he was damned if he were going to handle blueys private parts mrs sedgewicksmith drew herself up it was too bad even the lunatics hadnt offered such problems if you will come with me i shall do all that is necessary good on you said bluey amiably he hadnt really expected to get away with stephanie well it might be funny watching the old bag fumbling with him she didnt look as if anyone had put a prick in her hand for a good many years it was only the embarrassment he could provoke in others which made bearable his humiliation at needing such attention at all im sorry but its a social disability i rather overlooked graham laughed when mrs sedgewicksmith explained the predicament the next morning those buttons are a terrible obstacle for the boys hands but i really cant think what to do apart from sending them out in kilts mrs sedgewicksmith hesitated she wanted to edge away from the subject as soon as possible but persevered bravely i dont know if you would welcome a suggestion mr trevose but when my husband came home from america before the war he was wearing a suitequipped with a zipfastener yes of course graham snapped his fingers i remember seeing them there myself its a sound idea if only of course i can get a supply of zips it struck him that a beleaguered country could hardly be expected to continue manufacturing such metallic frivolities there were certainly none in the shops at maiden cross you probably needed as much influence to lay your hands on some zipfasteners as to lay them on a case of scotch or a few gallons of petrol but he had still one friend who might be expected to perform miracles and the provision of patients flies was a minor miracle indeed graham telephoned the daily press office in fleet street and found himself asked up to lunch graham had a standing invitation to visit lord arlott but hadnt taken advantage of it partly because he was too busy at the annex and partly because of a vague desire to keep his prewar life disconnected from his new one at seventy valentine arlott continued to conduct his newspaper with undiminished energy and interference he was a small lively man in rimless glasses the fiery red hair which graham well remembered long ago turned grey but his australian accent was as fierce as ever to be dimmed or intensified according to how it suited to illuminate a particular argument the press was continuing in the second war its policy of the first bringing the exploits of lord arlotts countrymen repeatedly and enthusiastically to the attention of the british public its office was by then more or less roofless weatherproofed by tarpaulins standing amid buildings apparently gnawed by giant rats or simply replaced by holes in the ground or revealing themselves on a second glance as blackened shells like burntout fireworks graham found lord arlott had installed himself in a shoredup room in the basement which he had fitted out like a military headquarters with telephones of various colours charts and large maps all of great complexity val arlott liked to spread the notion that the press could manipulate any national movement of importance from which he saw no reason to exclude the war zipfasteners val exclaimed graham coming to the point of his visit at once his thick grey eyebrows shot up what the hell would you want those for graham explained sounds like a good cause said val fix it up geoff will you certainly val there was a third person in the basement room who from the humility with which he conducted himself graham passed off as some sort of secretary he was startled to discover a little later that the man was the papers editor well grahamhow are you going along val arlott leaned back in his swivelchair smiling but eyeing graham with a shrewdness he turned impartially on prime ministers and messenger boys by god youre looking fit and ten years younger graham laughed its the simple country life think what a fortune it would have cost to enjoy before the war dont you get bored not much i just work and sleep you must notice the changepatching up our national heroes instead of our national beauties i do its much more gratifying i suppose it should be gratifying to me too im the one who gave you your start arent i of courseno val arlott no graham trevose in the nineteentwenties val had run a crusade in the press to install not only londons first plastic surgery unit in nearby blackfriars hospital but its first plastic surgeon embodied in graham trevose grahams fatherinlaw had owned half the paper which stimulated the benevolence but vals interest had quickly turned to some other campaign for lightening the burden of humanitythe opening of cinemas on sundays if graham remembered aright making much money asked val no but theres nothing to spend it on thats true not these days you must have had a pretty bad time of it up here in london observed graham it certainly hasnt been a picnic any bombing down your way our only casualty has been a cow i think they mistook us for biggin hill now the bastards are turning their attention to the provinces swansea had a nasty time of it last night is the damage serious it warmed graham to talk again to someone important a man who not only knew the inside story of the war but who from the look of the room at least might even affect the turn of the plot i mean taking the country as a whole it could be worse they get the railways running again pretty smartly and production all round has been hit much less than we feared the uboats are a stickier problem between you and me but civilian morale has stood up to it it might have gone the other way you know could have been panic demands for peace he confided in me hes genuinely relieved about that who is asked graham val arlott seemed surprised at the question churchill his look turned to annoyance as graham gave a laugh whats funny nothing val nothing the captain piles and mrs sedgewicksmiths of grahams new world shrank into their true inconsequence i dont move in such circles im afraid geoff fix up some drinks will you ordered val arlott certainly val when they were alone val asked graham hows your wife taking the war maria wouldnt begin to understand the clock of her mind stopped somewhere in the thirties i ran into her brother the other day the second lord cazalay yes god help us there was some unpleasantness between the pair of you i gather yes cazalay and that fellow haileybury were in it together trying to get me struck off you mean about the actress whats her namestella garrod graham nodded ill concede that haileybury moved against me through his usual highmindedness or his hypocrisyive never really decided which it is but i cant understand why cazalay started him off through spite i suppose did you know hes got himself some sort of job in the censorship through the title doubtless i cant think of any other qualifications i wouldnt trust him even to deliver the morning post graham said sourly yes theyre twisters the cazalays all of them val said amiably though it was sad about the father to be reviled and ruined after enjoying power is bad enough to face death in exile is heartbreaking even the sick rabbit can crawl back to its own burrow i suppose it can all be forgotten now even the muddiest little eddies in our history have been submerged by the tidal wave not that i came out of the cazalay crash badly he continued more cheerfully i picked up his share of this paper dirt cheap i suppose youve some pretty little girl tucked away there in the country he added no youve turned over a new leaf i dont believe it lets say i havent time im worked off my feet you know ive a hell of a lot of worry particularly over one of your compatriotsbluey jardine val frowned i wondered what had happened to him he just dropped out of the news badly smashed up with patience on both sides and a couple of years ill get him looking human poor bastard val rubbed his chin how about our doing a story on your little show id like to remind people about bluey graham looked doubtful would anyone be interested plenty of men have suffered worse and my boys arent particularly pretty objects to come across in your morning paper yes people would be interested said val decisively we could send down martha raymond do you know martha she wrote a bitterly unkind story about me and stella garrod in your gossip column before the war val shrugged his shoulders these things happen shes a game kid martha raymonds physical courage matching the flintiness of her mind she was then scaling cliffs with the newly raised commandos defusing unexploded parachute mines with the royal engineers flying in the empty bombbay of wellingtons with the raf or diving into the waters of weymouth harbour with the navy all for the enlightenment and entertainment of val arlotts readers but graham wondered if even she would be game enough to drag a story from his patients geoff whats martha doing val asked as the editor reappeared on an army cookery course val fix her to meet graham when shes free certainly val i hope my boys wont resent her said graham doubtfully they can be prickly with strangers marthas a real professional graham she can get round anyone like you then i only hope the zips arrive first graham added otherwise bluey might feel inclined to provide the girl with rather too colourful copy i see grahams getting up to his old tricks again remarked denise bickley putting down her coffee cup eh whats that old tricks what old tricks her host mr claude cramphorn frcs paused in lighting his pipe he had plenty of them as far as my memory serves didnt you see this mornings press crampers mr cramphorn shook his head there was an enormous article by some woman about the annex pictures and all as a matter of fact she added casually i happened to cut it out denise felt in her handbag and produced a strip of grey wartime newsprint which she handed to her husband beside her on the sofa its wildly inaccurate of course smiled john bickley passing the cutting on the newspapers never seem to get anything right mr cramphorn took it with a grunt he was a fiery little surgeon given to pepperandsalt suits brown boots halfmoon glasses briskly puffed pipes and clipped sentences a bachelor who had retired from the consultant staff of blackfriars before the war to a farm which by chance lay within sight of the minarets of smithers botham nobody seemed to know how old he was but no ageing general dug out to sit behind a ministry desk accepted his invitation to reactivity as eagerly as mr cramphornif he had ever been invited at all when overlooked by the authorities at the beginning of the war unlike graham who was inclined to take a neurotic view of everything mr cramphorn had simply ignored the slight he had appeared on the smithers botham portico puffing his pipe rubbing his hands and declaring work to do im willing and ready boys to teach ill teach em he marched in discovered his old ward sister herself recalled from helping a cousin run a boarding house at bexhill appropriated a dozen of the empty beds and set up shop mr cramphorn did teach very well the surgery of the first world war he had lived through all the fashions from the twenties with short skirts and the surgical vogue of removing as many internal organs as possible compatible with the continuance of life through the thirties with their padded shoulders and the enthusiastic tacking of floating kidneys spleens colons and the like the more firmly into place to the forties with their slacks and headscarves and septic foci nobody knew exactly what these malevolent foci did nor even what they were but mr cramphorn removed them just the same it never crossed his mind to explain his methods to his patients whom he treated as a wellmannered squire his tenants to mr cramphorn a hospital was a charitable institution and a man begging bread at your door had no business enquiring the ability of your baker for a disgruntled sufferer to threaten litigation was to him as unthinkable as for his gardener to threaten joining his dinnertable he was an individualist and like the british generals facing up to the aeroplane distrustful of such comparatively newfangled devices as asepsis coming between himself and the pure exercise of his art his gloved fingers often strayed absently during operations to the pocket of his pepperandsalt trousers under his gown to produce a large yellow handkerchief on which he would blow his nose he frequently puffed his pipe over the scrubbingup basin laying it aside with his freshly sterilized hand but whatever operation he performed whatever its chances of doing good or ill they stood about fiftyfifty it was a superb piece of surgical handicraft mr cramphorn was a real professional hm said mr cramphorn finishing reading the cutting he liked the company of goodlooking women and had asked the bickleys across that april evening for dinner he had bagged a couple of precious rabbits though he often complained the war had quite ruined the shooting what dyou think of that pomfrey he passed the cutting to the fourth sharer of the feast a blackfriars physician at smithers botham dr paul pomfrey who observed mildly i do hope its nothing disgraceful dr pomfrey was a distinguished elderly neurologist a collector of butterflies a player of the cello an addict of crossword puzzles his mind too fine a key to unlock such current mysteries as ration books identity cards and stirruppumps he was under mr cramphorns thumb through living with him when the war started mr cramphorn instructed his housekeeper to open his doors to the expectant mothers who arrived from london much fortified by vicars and vitamins but his brisk behaviour so induced fears of premature labour the women were replaced by evacuee childrenaccording to himself the nastiest available through the billeting officers personal spite these guests too mr cramphorn was shortly relieved of after insisting on treating their nits in the sheepdip dr pomfrey was conscripted to fill the spare room and so put an end to such rude intrusions into a professional mans privacy oh dear added dr pomfrey reading we did have so much trouble with young trevose at blackfriars before the war he always seemed to be getting into the papers people must have gained the impression that plastic surgery was the only work our hospital was capable of it doesnt actually mention graham by name said john coming to his surgeons defence hed be much too fly for that laughed mr cramphorn puffing briskly this wonderful work dr pomfrey read out hollowly is being performed by the brilliant plastic surgery expert who gave hope and beauty to stage and society in london before the war i suppose that would sink in with a good many peopleeh crampers of course graham is doing wonderful work admitted denise but i dont see why he should take all the credit john comes home utterly exhausted most nights dont you darling and tudor beverleys rushed off his feet besides therere plenty of others in the hospital who deserve being taken notice of quite as much as graham they havent his flair for publicity thats all i met babs twelvetrees while i was buying the rations this morning and she was dreadfully upset she was the wife of mr alan twelvetrees a young blackfriars consultant surgeon who had been invalided out of the royal army medical corps he had expected to be treated at smithers botham as a returning hero but was disconcerted to find himself resented as an intruder who hadnt suffered the earlier disorganization and inconveniences to be given the worst wards the surliest sisters and the most awkward hours for operating graham didnt instigate the article john pointed out the paper suggested it theyre always looking for odd corners of the war to write up its good for morale i suppose the more people read of whats being done you know perfectly well graham would go to any lengths to get himself known his wife told him briskly mustnt give a dog a bad name my dear mr cramphorn told her otherwise you cant blame him if he bites you i dont think graham would bite anyone crampers she said of course hes utterly charming and such fun and john and i love him but he is so dreadfully weak look at those awful women who had him round their little fingers what do you think i should do crampers asked dr pomfrey helplessly he asked mr cramphorns opinion on everything he was more under his thumb than ever at the time through the surgeon teaching him to drive which he performed as he operated very fast and impatient of obstacles after dr pomfreys chauffeur had been called up the motorcar presented him with severer difficulties than the most elusive neurological diagnosis the physician driving across lawns and flowerbeds on the wrong side of the road and frequently within inches of captain pile perhaps youd care to take it up with graham he suggested hopefully not me said mr cramphorn he disliked being drawn into the animosities of others he had enough in the hospital of his own complaining almost daily to captain pile about the quality of everything from the operating equipment to the food and appearing regularly in his office with the shepherds pie why dont you have a friendly word in his ear john youre nearest to him john bickley tried to find an excuse but dr pomfrey looked at his watch and hastily switched on the wireless the nine oclock news brought an end to the conversation as it did to almost every other in the country john had his friendly word with graham in the annex the following morning his wife had insisted on it but graham only laughed and said well i half expected something like this whos kicking up the fuss pomfrey in his own sort of way and a few of the others twelvetrees ill bet john said nothing will they never learn things are so different now theres no one to benefit except the boys it cheered them up someone taking an interest in them particularly a pretty girl though god knows i deserve some sort of encouragement i havent had much since the war started i know all that of course graham but you must be aware how sticky the others can be about publicity i dont give a damn they were standing outside the washhouse and graham started towards the ward i cared little enough in peacetime what my professional brethren thought of me now i dont care at all anyway theyve a nice surprise in store as a result of the article that american fellows coming downwhats his name always being photographed in a tin hat coming out of shelters hugo kirkham his stuffs syndicated right across the states and they arent coy over there about hushing up the doctors names a nice little flutter thatll cause when the cuttings get back here graham began to sound annoyed im not trying to attract attention to myself im trying to attract attention to the annex which is quite a different thing anxious to change the conversation john asked are you going to have a look at that fellow with the postoperative chest later old man if thats all right graham excused himself hastily ive got to have a word with sister sister mills occupied a partitioned office the size of a largish cupboard beside the ward door she had been on the unit for three months and graham was astounded at her success she seemed to have the right touch with unruly patients there was less drunkenness less swearing fewer nurses asking for transfers even bluey seemed to be behaving himself graham felt smugly gratified at the perspicacity of his choice on the mornings when he wasnt operating he exercised his prerogative as the chief by taking with her a cup of the tasteless khaki liquid passing at smithers botham for coffee he was not usually one for fraternizing with his nursing staff he generally treated them brusquely partly through fussiness over the smallest details of treatment and partly as a defence reaction for the sake of his patients he tried to fill his wards with the prettiest girls going and though some of them fired his imagination particularly in his present monkish existence he was careful to avoid any entanglements he didnt care to foul his own doorstep besides he was something of a sexual snob the man who before the war had got himself into bed with stella garrod might find the joys of commonorgarden girls something of a comedown and anyway he told himself sharply he was getting far too old for them you look in a mood sister mills smiled as graham squeezed himself into the spare chair its a passing irritation some of the others are grousing about that article yesterday they still cant forgive me for getting my name in the papers before the war she handed him a thick chipped cup and said yes i remember reading some of the things they said about you i hope they were nice things many of them werent but you must have been only an impressionable schoolgirl at the time it always put him in a better humour talking to sister mills and he noticed she had become less solemn less nervous of him a sympathetic ear was a luxury when he was expected to bear the troubles of everyone in the annex my father was always interested in your activities she told him is he a doctor he had never asked about her background before no hes a commercial artist not a particularly successful one im afraid to say now hes working for the ministry of aircraft production i used to paint at weekends before the war i dont think i was much good at it i used to delude myself it was based on the same principles as my surgery but it isnt my jobs more like plumbing really whatever the look of the result everythings got to join up the right way underneath your own father was at blackfriars wasnt he yes the formidable old boy was the professor of anatomy graham said fondly he wrote an erudite volume about the synovial membranes so erudite that only about fifty people in the country understood it weve always been doctors of a sort my grandfather was a semieducated bonesetter my greatgrandfather wasnt educated at all but an outandout quack he left a fortune he could diagnose everything known to medical science and a good deal that wasnt by merely inspecting the patients urine in a flask whats called a pissprophet she smiled quite a weight of medical tradition to carry the family business i suppose my son desmonds going in for it you must meet him when he comes down from cambridge he stays with me at the pub and i let him mess about here trying his hand at being anything from assistant anaesthetist to theatre porter youll like him hes a charmer im sure i shall ill look forward to it graham fell silent he had a vague uneasiness about mentioning desmond the fuss about the newspaper will soon blow over he went on were proud of you on the unit anyway the wizz he laughed and got up if im making a reputation id better live up to it by doing some work ive got to see a pneumonia john bickleys inflicted the fellow uses far too much ether despite his protestations the realist in graham admitted readily enough that he enjoyed recapturing the glory of print he was an exhibitionist in a neurotically selfeffacing profession and finding himself so long in a surgical backwater where nobody was inclined to wander had been galling but it was more gratifying still to find the article reviving val arlotts twentyyearsold interest in plastic surgery he telephoned asking if graham lacked equipment promising to jolt action out of the authorities the longedfor extra huts seemed at last likely to appear val even suggested a fund to provide the annex with comfortsan excellent idea graham thought it would keep the place in the public eye for months but the best news of all was peter thomas becoming engaged to marry one of the nurses he still looked a mess but there he was to marry in the merry month of may it put up morale in the annex wonderfully if a girl could sleep with peter thomas looking like that bluey declared then he was off to pick up a bloody harem the wedding was to be at chelsea registry office on may the twelfth a monday on the saturday night london had its last bad raid of the war and an unexpected guest rudolph hess floated by parachute into scotland while the deputy fuhrers fractured ankle was being attended by a british military doctor a younger german flier steadfastly doing his duty above the thames made a mistake in his bombaiming and blew most of blackfriars hospital to pieces luckily the casualties were light the patients being at smithers botham and the wooden props in the basement being stronger than everyone gloomily believed but the firemen were still working thirtysix hours later when graham stood with a carnation in his buttonhole soulfully inspecting the wreckage before making across battered london to the registry office the arlott wing where he had worked before the war had simply disappeared the rest of the building which he could remember standing in apparently unshakeable dignity when his father had shown it off as a childhood treat was a hardly recognizable ruin but the pavements were still busy the bowler hat was still worn the tramlines still ran down the embankment london had shrugged off fire and plague before the smashed eighteenthcentury masonry was a shame but what was the loss of the most splendid building he asked himself compared with that of the most miserable of lives graham he turned he didnt recognize her for a moment she was small and gingery with a scarf round her head staring at him sheila raleigh he held out his hand smiling hows tom didnt you hear he was killed he looked blank hand outstretched and untaken she bit her lip in greece he was one of the last sheila what can i say dont say anything graham please dont but sheila im so dreadfully sorry its a terrible shock i mean tom was my houseman my registrar my partner we worked together for ten years he was such a wonderful chap then why didnt you keep him she demanded savagely if youd wanted hed be safe with you now in the country but you didnt you rejected him because you really hated him because you were jealous of him because he wasnt of use to you any more thats the truth isnt it now you know exactly what youve done for a moment graham could say nothing how can you accuse me of that he managed to ask weakly it isnt right you know it just isnt true at all honestly im heartbroken at the news surely theres something i can do to help for the children isnt there anything if theres some sort of assistance i can give financial assistance i wouldnt take a penny from a murderer she shrugged her shoulders turned and abruptly walked off graham watched her disappear picking her way among the firehoses the wedding was to graham as joyless as a funeral he found it impossible to be even faintly amiable afterwards he pleaded work and drove straight back to smithers botham he knew that everything sheila said was perfectly correct to come face to face with his old self was harrowing things had so changed or had they his egotism and jealousy which had cost poor tom his partnership and then his life he supposed must still be in his system somewhere perhaps he was merely redirecting them to temporarily more acceptable ends like some thug given a rifle and praised for killing germans was it too much to hope he really was becoming a better sort of man how could he tell there was no one near enough to ask at smithers botham he made for his office he had to find some work anything to occupy himself to stop his selfinflicted mental wounds he paused in the doorway surprised to find sister mills at his desk then he remembered hed asked her to collect case reports of somethingwhat was it maxillary fractures he was about to ask her to go when she noticed his face and jumped up exclaiming whats the matter was it something in the blitz he shut the door behind him i killed a man he said wearily unwittingly and indirectly but i killed him tom raleighdid i ever mention him he was my partner we had a row he should have been working with me out here on the unit i wouldnt take him so instead he was killed in greece he sat in a chair by the desk im so sorry said sister mills quietly it must have been terrible news particularly as i got it from his widow who knew exactly what the facts were he stretched out his legs she told me what she thought of me she was perfectly right to her i couldnt be anything but the vilest and wickedest creature in the world shed be feeling emotional she let her tongue run away with her id like to think so but my whole life before the war doesnt stand much examination doesnt it you brought a lot of happiness to people at a price well why not she asked simply what is the price of happiness anyway i didnt give a damn about the happiness only the guineas thats quite impossible to believe not after all ive seen here he sat staring in front of him then he noticed she was crying i must apologize he got up abruptly all these troubles ive brought back are upsetting you i shouldnt have mentioned them ive no right asking you to share them im crying for you she told him youre so much the nicest person in the world and you fight so terribly hard against it then he had her in his arms and she was kissing him with a passion even he found exciting meanwhile mrs sedgewicksmith was holding another of her regular monday afternoon teaparties she had told stephanie severely that she mustnt keep crossing her legs like that after all she was really getting quite a big girl on sunday mornings graham would lie in bed reading the papers picture post the strand magazine a novel anything unconnected with the annex it was only the bad doctor he reflected who killed himself to cure his patients by that november sunday of the posters in the smithers botham entrance hall had changed from the ringing warning your freedom is in peril to the more sophisticated coughs and sneezes spread diseases and is your journey really necessary the place was by then more than simply a hospital it was another of the countless closed communities stretching across the globe from spitzbergen to the falklands all more interested in themselves than in the war which had fathered them there was always something going on there the fashion of the times provided the staff with bountiful opportunity for selfexpression selfexamination and selfinstruction with dramatics and debating brains trusts of varying trustworthiness lectures on everything from britains war aims to milk production plus ensa abca and itma conversation in the long corridors never lacked an interesting case or an interesting scandal the housemen continued to entertain the nurses the matron continued to entertain doubts the war had swept a remarkable assortment of illnesses and injuries into the vast wards it was an aladdins cave of clinical medicine if only the students had bothered to rub the lamp of learning there were special units for surgery of the head the chest the limbs and the arteries created not through the benevolence of some millionaire but through the malevolence of adolf hitler its beds contained free french free poles free norwegians free dutch free czechs and unfree germans who made model patients there being nothing like several years nazi indoctrination for fitting in with the ideas of an oldfashioned british ward sister captain pile was still there and still a captain corporal honeyman was still there and still a corporal dr pomfrey after a baffled halfhour with his car at full throttle unaware that his rear bumper was enmeshed in the stout railings of the coal store had decided to settle for a secondhand bicycle but to anyone who read the newspapers smithers botham in was the place where a man called graham trevose performed his miracles the annex was no longer a sideshow but one of the busiest surgical units in the country the huts in the grounds had doubled and the staff had trebled graham was receiving more patients from the raf than he could handle his work had attracted surgeonsand journalists with their photographersfrom every allied nation even the russians women in fishqueues could talk to each other about graham trevose every morning brought a letter or two generally badly written and spelt with a few shillings towards the comforts fund graham thought this the most rewarding recognition of all and it had all started because he had gone to val arlott seeking some zips for trousers an unaccustomed sound crept across the misty morning church bells in the distance for more than two years these accompaniments of christian joys and sorrows had been silenced reserved by the government to herald not the coming of the lord but of the german armies listen graham slipped his hands between his head and the pillow i remember in the last war they rang the bells after cambrai it was when we used tanks for the first time and broke the german lines in a week or two we were back where we started of course it always seemed the case in those days lets hope this alamein affair is more permanent clare mills slipped her hand into the jacket of his pyjamas which were pure silk prewar made to measure in jermyn street the poor lamb really was terribly thin it was like being in bed with a skeleton beside you happy this is probably a terrible confession but the wars been the happiest time of my life is it so terrible she asked gently surely the misery neednt go undiluted i suppose happiness is a wellinsulated state of mind most of the boys are perfectly happy and god knows they havent got much to justify it even bluey seems happy enough these days perhaps hes found a new girlfriend she ran her hand down grahams chest it was so smooth the ribs standing out like the black notes on a piano no wonder hed once suffered from tuberculosis why do i attract you he asked she pouted thoughtfully youre different from any other surgeon different from old cramphorn you mean clare laughed youre gentle youre amusing youre kind you understand women and i love you besides you had a tremendous buildup id read so much about you its like being with a star youve only seen on the flicks dont tell me ive got to match up to clark gable he asked though feeling flattered she touched his small hard nipple with the dp of her forefinger tell me why i attract you youre a good housewife i thought that was it do you realize darling this is the first time in my life ive had a home i could call my own i mean a place where i could do as i pleased without it being run by a lot of servants where i didnt feel i had to put on a show to impress the world with my importance he looked round the room which was hardly big enough to take the bed the beige wallpaper had galleons sailing across it a fumedoak dressing table was squeezed into a corner there were faded pink curtains an angular hanging mirror and a coloured print of tower bridge preblitz they lived in a bungalow rented furnished in the country some ten miles from smithers botham with four small rooms and a kitchen a bath with an alarming geyser and the name of cosy cot graham felt he would have been happy with clare even living in a nissen hut she shared his new liking for books and for the concerts on the wireless she cooked agreeably and mended his clothes with her painstaking nurses stitches he had enjoyed himself teaching her to dress properly pulling her out of those awful tweeds and putting her into frocks though the fun had been officially dimmed by the coming of clothes rationing she was the most adoring woman he had known which he sometimes wryly reflected accounted for their harmony they had always the annex to fall back on as a common interest graham insisting she continued with her job declaring the ward would fall into anarchy otherwise as for their other common interest graham decided she enjoyed a greater talent than any woman he had met for copulation with all its ancillaries which he was apt to describe as novelties as the church bells died away he said youve given me something to live for darling a unique gift you always had your work only a fool or a saint lives for his vocation do you know before you came along i was the prey to horrible and gloomy thoughts doom impending death extinction most uncomfortable such things dont even enter my mind now youve exorcised the ghosts perhaps the magic charm is finding myself with a girl of your age or perhaps its just the flattery she gently kissed his unshaven cheek it isnt flattery is the distinction important at my age flatterys a workable substitute for love now youre being silly yes i hope i am he looked up at the ceiling which had a large crack running across it do you think we should have another week at that place in wales they were awfully awkward about our identity cards they might have grown more accustomed to such irregularities by now he had taken her to a village hotel remembered from before the war for what he liked to remember as their honeymoon their first sudden contact in the office the day he had met sheila raleigh he told himself was like the unexpected symptom of some smouldering disease he had been attracted to clare almost since setting eyes on her but he was immediately disconcerted to discover there was anothera royal marine lieutenant stationed in india to whom she was unofficially pledged graham declared to himself hastily that any monkey business was out of the question her lieutenant was abroad in the service of his country like the crusades exactly the same principle a man of his own standing couldnt possibly stoop to such things but he wondered how strong the psychological chastity belt was it might be fun to try the lock in the end it sprang open with an ease which surprised both of them the severest difficulty being the locale his house in mayfair was bombdamaged beyond habitation and he could hardly smuggle clare upstairs in the pub like one of the students it occurred to him he hadnt taken a holiday since the war started afterwards she declared she couldnt possibly go back to the nurses home in a place like smithers botham everyone would know of their adventure the other sisters were unkindly enough already and anyway had a tendency to kiss each other goodnight they moved into cosy cot and she wrote to her royal marine a dreaded epistle known as a dear john the rest of the smithers botham staff thought sharing a bungalow with your ward sister rather rich even for graham he didnt care it never occurred to him to ask if clare did denise bickley was particularly outraged about which graham cared even less in peacetime grahams goodwill represented a large slice of her husbands income and graham reflected grimly the war couldnt go on for ever as for clares parents who lived in bristol they were gratified to learn from her letters that their daughter had moved from the hospital to comfortable and apparently altogether satisfactory lodgings why dont we have our own celebration of the victory in the desert graham asked her from the pillow were alone in the house no ones likely to call and disturb us clare laughed and got out of bed throwing back her blonde hair and starting to take off her redandyellow spotted cotton pyjamas she really had an admirable figure graham reflected her breasts were wonderful he couldnt have made anything better himself must i keep using this toothpaste stuff she asked squatting to insert her diaphragm my god yes said graham hastily its terribly risky without the spermicidal jelly all that cap does is to hold it round the cervix its awfully messy you cant have everything my love he told her a shade primly and i shall have to keep it in half the day wont i itll give me backache ill sit rubbing it with sloans liniment she laughed again and came back to him in the sexual line graham was as haileybury would have put it an enthusiast after all he told himself he had a deep knowledge of the apparatus concerned and he might as well put the information to fullest use he often recalled with satisfaction balzacs exhortation for no man to marry before dissecting at least one female pelvis but he could never bring himself to feel the business more than a sneeze in the loins it was only a reflex centred in the humblest lower segments of the spinal cord transmitted across the pelvic basin by fibres hiding under their latinized name the nerve of shame even a real sneeze was a more cerebral occurrence conducted by finesounding aristocratic nerves springing out of the brain itself of course women took a different view however many men sneezed in their loins they invested it with some mystical significance he supposed it was mainly through their fear of appearing tarts you look sad she said teasingly afterwards do i its physiological after an orgasm isnt there a classical tag though the single one i can remember is calor rubor tumor dolor and thats only inflammation she ran the tip of her finger round his umbilicus thats a strange thing we have its only a cicatrix a scar whats inside it nothing the remains of the bloodvessels which fed us before we were born its quite pretty really like a flower a budding rose most are like cabbages her hand slipped down to his penis off duty in the atease position its full of tissue like a sponge isnt it i remember from our anatomy lectures it was awfully funny the sistertutor was a terribly driedup old thing she told us all about an erection with diagrams on the blackboard as though she was talking about the moon she could never have seen one in her life its a really most interesting organ the arteries dilate enormously quite unlike any others in the body it must be fascinating to have one according to the psychiatrists all women think so penisenvy though quite where that interesting discovery gets us i dont know did all your women want one he felt this reference under the circumstances in rather bad taste and said nothing have you had an awful lot of women graham you know im a married man as she gave a small pout he went on my sex life with maria pretty well ended with the honeymoon you could hardly blame me for seeking out others particularly when she went off her head but none of them meant anything not one not even stella garrod particularly stella garrod how about edith thats rather going into ancient history he said quickly graham darling perhaps id better give up the annex unthinkable staffnurse jones could easily take over shes awfully good with the boys but why this sudden change of heart i thought you liked the work youd get bored all day here i havent used the toothpaste once or twice i didnt think it would matter i havent seen anything now for a fortnight of course it may be perfectly all right just a delayed period his large eyes stared at her across the pillow if it isnt all right will you be pleased she asked timidly no dont answer wait till we know she kissed him and got out of bed abruptly its sunday that means fried eggs for lunch something lovely to look forward to isnt it to find himself confronted with fatherhood on a second occasion filled graham with the same numb shock as on the first almost exactly twentytwo years previously with maria their sexual endeavours were so beset with difficulties he somehow felt her reproductive system too inefficient for conception with clare he had put a touching faith in science as usual the human element had let him down it was the same in the annex when they got a run of infection after the nurses forgot to sterilize the needles properly in carbolic monday was mr tim ororys day at smithers botham graham caught the gynaecologist at lunch in the medical officers mess and invited him for a stroll on the lawn its clare he said once out of earshot i think shes pregnant well now said mr orory a thickset darkhaired redfaced humorous irishman he looked kindly on feminine failings through his heavily rimmed glasses and seemed to find them an endless source of innocent merriment and what gives rise to this little suspicion shes a fortnight overdue shes always been as regular as clockwork before of course it might be a chill something like that mightnt it sitting on a damp park bench doctor mr orory chuckled maybe so you dont think thats a possibility you know my low mind graham any woman outside a nunnery who misses a period between the ages of fifteen and fifty must be assumed pregnant until proved otherwise and im not so sure about the nunnery these days either graham was in no mood for professional pleasantries can you do a test in the lab he asked irritatedly i will certainly invoke the assistance of a small frog graham if you want ill be needing a specimen of the ladys urine ive got one in the car but dont get too alarmed mr orory added amiably the lady may have made a mistake in her dates its remarkable how unreliable the feminine gender is at its fundamental calculations the telephone at cosy cot rang the following evening that was tim said graham putting down the receiver its on clare turned her eyes back to her sewing graham stuck his hands in his pockets and stood in the middle of the small sittingroom which was filled with books medical journals files of notes photographs of his patients and had a coloured picture of bubbles over the fireplace its wonderful news isnt it he declared she looked up again are you sure you want it but of course i do as long as you do more than anything graham perched on the edge of her chair and put his arm round her tightly so he thought one of my wriggling little spermatozoa has threshed with its hairlike tail across the black mucoid depths of clares pelvis to sink itself joyfully into the speck of jelly comprising her ovum the stark object of the most fashionable wedding with all its elaborate trimmings of an ecclesiastical legal floral and emotional nature had been simply achieved no trouble at all the human race really did surround itself with a lot of fuss over its reproduction clare wondered what he was going to say at least hed declared he wanted the child she thought she didnt dare to question whether he really meant it living with graham she rarely dared to question whether he really meant anything therell be a terrible lot of practical details to settle graham announced he immediately threw himself vigorously into solving the varied problems set by the new pregnancy he decided clare must leave the annex at once staffnurse jones could enjoy unexpected promotion he must find someone to succeed the girl as staffnurse appointments must be made with mr orory specimens must be collected a woman must be sought to help in the bungalow they would go away for the holiday in wales it would do clare good her rationbook must be exchanged at the food office for a pregnant womans green one extra milk and vitamins must be applied for with a dozen government forms pregnancy struck graham as a highly complicated item of official business it had been so much simpler last time which reminded him he really must do something about maria graham had been meaning to do something about maria for over a year but there had always seemed a lastminute snag whenever he steeled himself to start instructing his lawyers there was somehow a rush of work in the annex keeping his mind occupied for weeks the solicitors had anyway been bombed out of the city and reestablished themselves at some inaccessible address near southendonsea there seemed then no urgency clare appeared perfectly content with their arrangement graham couldnt see how ten minutes in a registry office would make the slightest difference to the pair of them or perhaps he sometimes suspected he still had his fingering reluctance about disowning maria for good or perhapsperhaps he was afraid of committing himself wholly to clare it was too difficult to think about and the problems of the annex came first clare certainly raised the topic of a divorce he felt it only to be expected but she never harped on it for long it never occurred to graham that she saw how much it distressed him nor that her silence was the expression of her terror of losing him but now the solicitors were written to a divorce was imperative the wheels of the law must be geared to the rapid process of reproductive physiology the solicitors wrote back with a promise of doing their best explaining the court would doubtless be sympathetic but there were innumerable difficulties in wartime he fixed a visit to southend for the end of the month he also agreed at last to see clares parents in bristol it was a glum prospect even his charm might not prove an antidote to all unpleasantness particularly as mr mills was hardly older than himself besides a journey in the crowded slow and foodless wartime trains would be terrible first of all he must put matters to his son desmond something seemed to have gone wrong with desmond at cambridge he had taken a fair degree in part i of his tripos stayed on a year to breathe the rarefied academic atmosphere of the part ii and done rather badly from a gay if selfcentred schoolboy he was turning into a reticent and solemn young man wearing a dignity as unfitting for his years as a middleage spread he was even something of a prig when he had left cambridge that summer to start his three years clinical course at smithers botham graham had assumed he would move in with them at cosy cot but desmond was reluctant he suggested it might somehow hold him up to ridicule particularly in the eyes of his cousin alec ediths child who was arriving to study at smithers botham the same autumn desmond arranged to live in the hospital itself as one of the dozenstrong students emergency squad under the direct orders of captain pilethough for what emergency this squad was held in readiness and how it would tackle it when it arose everyone had long ago forgotten graham dismissed all this as the selfdramatization to which the young were so distressingly liable desmond had probably been mixing with the wrong sort of people at college though perhaps the sons disinterest was partly the fathers fault graham admitted he had never taken overmuch care in desmonds upbringing before the war he was too busy making money and amusing himself during it he was too busy with the annex anyway the lad seemed to step along confidently enough by himself but now there was another factor the war would certainly be grinding along in when desmond was due to qualify to sweep him with the others into the medical branches of the forces why he might even find himself under the orders of haileybury somehow graham determined he must get the young man into the navy graham set the scene of desmonds enlightenment carefully he had anyway been remiss about standing the boy treats he made the effort of booking a couple of stalls for blithe spiritas russians were then being bombed instead of britons a seat in a london theatre was as hard to come by as a seat in a longdistance express after the show they went to an italian restaurant in soho in the first black nights of the war graham had sometimes cheered himself up there by toasting allied victory in chianti at the insistence of the proprietor who by had been caged up for a couple of years in the isle of man but the elderly head waiter remembered him and even laid the establishment open to immediate prosecution by letting them consume not only soup and chicken but a slice of fish as well over the meal they talked about their work now desmond was growing up in medicine graham could enjoy the singular satisfaction of a medical parent in watching his child emerge as a professional colleague they met often enough at smithers botham on perfectly easy terms though coming to talk less of personal things than their cases or to dissect the characters abilities and errors of the other consultants anything interesting in the annex at the moment dad desmond asked across their corner table in the restaurant a lot of oddments the byproducts of the war mostly theres a man from the desert who gave himself a rubdown with petroltheyre short of water you understand then the idiot lit a cigarette he was an awful mess theres a naval rating who was working in the engineroom of a destroyer when some fool turned on the superheated steam tragic cases theres not much glory in being run over by your own tank anyway wars a horrible business are you getting sick of it ive never had time to pause and think i suppose when i get back to bobbing noses itll be a relief knowing the patients real suffering is only in the pocket graham added after a moment sometimes its difficult for me to realize our present highly abnormal form of life wont go on for ever i suppose the same goes for all our generals do you expect a lot of changes after the war i can tell you one graham picked up his small glass of sloe gin doing wartime duty for cognac im going to obtain a divorce from your mother desmond considered this for some moments that comes as something of a surprise i must say after all this time but surely my decision doesnt mean much to you does it graham asked rather overanxiously your mothers been ill for so long you were only a child when she first had to go into hospital you can hardly remember her when she waswell as she used to be desmond said nothing graham wondered what maria would be like had she kept her wits and her money doing something energetic in the war doubtless she was always the busy type shes a complete wreck of her former self graham added only i can appreciate the change shes not in very good shape admittedly thats a mild way of putting it desmond i assure you it makes not the slightest difference to your mother if i remain her husband or not the whole conception of marriage is far beyond her ability to grasp shes certified you understandcertified as insane of course ill see shes looked after just as i do now shell stay in that home in comfort until the end of her days but why dad desmond looked more solemn than ever why this sudden decision because im going to marry clare surely you must have expected that no not really i didnt think you felt it necessary its decidedly necessary said graham nettled by the remark clares pregnant desmond stared at him its going to call for a measure of mental readjustment in both of us graham continued but its a demonstrable fact the embryo has been created your baby halfbrother or sister already exists ectoderm endoderm mesoderm yolksac amnion the lot two or three millimetres long snug in the mucosa of clares uterus we cant get away from that whats alec going to say why do you always bother what alecs going to say graham asked irritably hes always trying to get some sort of hold over me hes got a nasty tongue when he likes im sure you can cope with alec its bad enough his taking my money im certainly not going into that again now graham told him promptly if the cost of his education is coming from your trust fund it was the least i could do for both the family and for aunt edith alecs father the medical missionary had maintained that the rewards of his vocation were to be found not in this world but the next where presumably he had been enjoying them for seven years since dying flat broke in malaya anyway its only a loan graham pointed out alecs supposed to pay it all back once hes qualified in the end youll be no worse off what do you suppose aunt edith is going to say about your marrying again graham raised his eyebrows that delicate little complication hadnt occurred to him desmond im afraid ive got to go ahead with this divorce i hope youll come to see it as the right step i only see it as being rather hard on mother thats ridiculous graham became angry you know perfectly well most of the time your mother hasnt even the first idea who i am still she is my mother i feel sorry for her he really had little affection for his mother but he was desperately frightened about doing the wrong thing he was becoming aware of inner forces which could drive him along the same devious paths as his father and that must be avoided at all costs grahams life had already made his son an easy target for ridicule not only from alec but from any of the other students disposed to a bit of ragging for security he must fly into conventionality now youre just being pompous said graham curtly desmond turned red and graham rebuked himself hed been too savage desmond was really very young and confused with the ways of the world just as he had been himself at the same age come desmond he added more kindly try and adjust yourself clare wont be more to you than a stepmother in name shell be terribly tactful i promise you that youll come to like her tremendously desmond hesitated and said i think i prefer to make up my own mind about people dad graham called for the bill desmond really could be terribly difficult when he wanted just like maria everyone at smithers botham seemed to know about the baby from its conception graham had confided in john bickley and he supposed denise had spread the news with enthusiasm crampers had grunted something at himcongratulatory graham hoped even captain pile had made the point of repeating that no woman whatever was permitted to give birth within the hospitals glasstopped walls graham didnt care about the notoriety he rather enjoyed it he told himself more forcibly every day he was delighted with their child a young life something to perpetuate himself right to the end of the century was an anodyne for any painfully intruding ideas about death and extinction he could have no possible reservations about it whatever he decided and it would be wonderful for clare he treated her with the greatest tenderness physical and mental as for the effect on the mothertobe of her circumstances in general and her standing in the eyes of everybody at smithers botham in particular it never crossed his mind to enquire all this happened in the busy fortnight following the sunday when they rang the church bells then he had a letter from the ministry terminating his contract at the annex i want to see brigadier haileybury said graham to the sergeant in the hall my names trevose im a surgeon the brigadier knows me well have you an appointment sir no but im aware that hes in the building and i dont intend to leave until he gives me an interview the sergeant looked uneasy the wildeyed civilian seemed an unlikely crony of the austere brigadier if youll wait here sir i can but pass on your message please do he left graham alone in the hall which like the inside of all requisitioned houses had bare walls and floor was furnished with trestletables and fireextinguishers and had the decorations badly knocked about haileybury now held sway in a country mansion fronting the river itchen south of winchester in preparation for the second front graham supposed whenever that might be established within a minute the sergeant came clattering down the oak staircase announcing that the brigadier would be delighted to receive his visitor at once the office upstairs was large warm and bright overlooking the river where in season haileybury amused himself fishing for trout there was a neat busylooking desk filing cabinets maps and charts on the wall a lieutenant with twinedserpent ramc badges who hovered in attendance was gently waved from the presence haileybury extended his large red hand an unexpected pleasure trevose is it so unexpected the brigadier pursed his lips wont you sit down graham took a small hard chair and began haileybury do you know the one thing the powersthatbe in this war could do with me they couldnt courtmartial me they couldnt put me in jail they couldnt even tell me off the only way they could save themselves the nuisance of my existence was to sack me they have haileybury put his fingertips together and blew on them rather noisily youre perfectly aware of that of course graham added accusingly it has come to my ears why did you do it why did you throw me out haileybury looked shocked i ive a certain right to know you must admit but my dear fellow i couldnt possibly be responsible for your dismissal that would be a civilian matter quite outside my province in all the years weve been squabbling haileybury youve invariably done two things that i often enough have not told the truth and been honest there was a silence i see said haileybury he got up crossed silently to a filing cabinet and still without speaking removed a folder your suspicions are correct trevose i must agree he admitted sitting down though only partly correct i certainly made representations to the proper authorities and i can hardly pretend otherwise than that my views were bound to carry some weight he opened the file my god thought graham hes more of my cuttings than ive collected myself he imagined haileybury painstakingly snipping each one out muttering to himself and shaking his head sorrowfully very well the annex has been getting some publicity said graham and what of it its cheered the patients up its encouraged my staff to keep working flat out its given the civilian population something to feel proud of hasnt it put up the morale of your own men at least they know theres a unit to look after them efficiently if they get their faces smashed up its made a hell of a difference in the raf i happen to know for a fact that isnt the point said haileybury you dont imagine its done me any personal good do you demanded graham irritably ive neither the desire nor the need to push my own interests im only concerned with those of my patients i think we know each others views on these matters too well for the need of repetition i will only emphasize that mine have remained quite unchanged by the war oh youre stupid ridiculous blind smug of course i cant help getting into the papers im part of the scene nobody objects if general montgomery or vera lynn or whoever you like gets photographed for the front pages do they i think youre putting it rather extravagantly trevose then tell me why youre getting me kicked out no dont bother i know through spite thats all haileybury drew a deep breath you must be perfectly aware he said calmly that there has been a great weight of complaint however understandable your enthusiasmperhaps even commendableyou have rather created the impressionwell the impression that nobody else in our profession is doing anything for the war at all it has all been brought very sharply to the notice of the ministry and the service departments and to myself personally by whom twelvetrees at smithers botham graham thought perhaps even crampers you might prefer me not to name names the last time i unwittingly did so i understand it led to a good deal of remorse on your part the reference to tom raleigh made graham shift uneasily in the chair he continued in a more subdued voice you might at least tell me why the ministry should have chosen this particular moment to pounce it couldnt have come at a more awkward time for me personally haileybury reflected that most times were awkward for trevose personally i fancy people had to decide when matters had gone a little too far he declared he paused and added as i have been frank will you perhaps let me make my motives clear graham nodded curtly i assure you there was no suggestion of spite on my part surely you dont really think that of me not in your heart there was no spite on anybodys part but medicine is entering upon difficult times you must know that if only from the newspapers when we raise our eyes from the war what do we see the future of our profession is in the balance the politicos are concocting a large number of recipes for cooking our goose believe you me theres talk of forcing us into some sort of state health schemepure socialism haileybury seemed to shudder that would never do we should lose our professional freedom we should become mere civil servants with the government our taskmaster the doctorpatient relationship as we have known it for centuries would be lost for ever all thats nothing to do with me but it is haileybury leaned forward earnestly his eyes shining we shall have to fight these people fight them at every turn and what shall be our weapons we shall need every scrap of dignity of integrity of professional correctitude that we can muster we must make it plain to the public that we stand above the ordinary commercial motives of life that we seek no vainglory for ourselves that we have no thought but for the welfare of our patients none of us must falteror appear to falterfrom the rigorous discipline we have imposed on ourselves none of us we must fight not as individuals but as a profession oh politicians are slippery people trevose i know ive had dealings with plenty of them we mustnt give them the smallest stick to beat us with graham replied by holding his hands before his face so that is why these must be lost to the country like a torpedoed munition ship youre taking too dramatic a view as usual said haileybury shortly your unit will continue as before that canadian tudor beverley is a perfectly sound man you should be the first to admit that none of us are indispensable if i may say so in peacetime you had rather a procession of assistants anyway you remain on the staff of blackfriars some beds will be found for you either at smithers botham or elsewhere perhaps the ministry of pensions would have something to offer you might like to know that i have made a point of assuring myself you wouldnt be left in the cold i am not going to treat a single casualty outside the unit that i have built up then i fear you will find little else to do women are not given much to having their faces remodelled these days youre wrong graham got up once released from my contract im allowed to take on as much private practice as i can handle right well women are continuing to give a great deal of thought to the new area im treating ive been working with orory at smithers botham on a reconstruction procedure for congenital absence of the vagina it isnt a particularly unusual condition you know the operations extremely interesting you dissect the pelvic tissues from below then put in a skingraft on a mould sometimes it takes sometimes it doesnt you have to cut the graft extra thin or youll get a crop of hair which would be highly uncomfortable for all concerned so haileybury you dont want me nobody does i shall therefore spend the rest of the war making new pussies without another word he clattered down the oak staircase and out to his morris the sergeant stared after him anxiously whatever had happened it seemed likely to put the brigadier in one of his moods graham wanted to leave the annex as soon as possible tudor beverley and his staff offered to resign en bloc but graham wouldnt hear of it desmond who seemed more shocked by his fathers dismissal than by his second stab at paternity suggested he withdraw from the blackfriars medical schoolthe ridicule was liable to break out afresh he suspected inwardly graham told him not to be stupid his patients suggested getting up a petition but graham knew that official minds couldnt be swayed by even a snowstorm of paper anyway he was suddenly weary of battling with authority hed lost and he wanted to leave the field just as soon as he could tidy up his work clare was wonderful her practical mind stood rocklike amid their sea of troubles she decided they would move somewhere for the span of her pregnancy perhaps up to scotland they could enjoy a wonderful holiday until the baby was borngraham had no need to start work theyd saved a bit and shed a little money of her own the divorce could surely be left in the hands of the solicitors graham agreed with everything he felt he wanted the child desperately it would be an achievement a symbol of defiance something to show for his existence without a regular achievement of some sort he doubted if he could live at all then they killed bluey it was stupid unnecessary almost criminal a couple of years of grahams surgery had the australian looking more or less like a human being better still his hands were mending splendidly he had a pair of new thumbs made from chips of his hipbone he could light cigarettes hold a tankard even fondle a girl a small operation was still needed to trim the inside of his lip john bickley again gave an injection and slipped the rubber tube into his windpipe to stop the blood from grahams incision trickling into his patients lungs john packed the back of blueys throat with a length of oiled bandage it was common practice performed on the patients every operating day afterwards john drew out the tube and forgot the bandage they wheeled bluey back to bed the nurse who found him dusky and straining to breathe wasted away his life trying artificial respiration john was summoned and instantly ripped out the bandage which was suffocating him but it was too late two years in hospital had so enfeebled bluey that the survivor of a blazing hurricane succumbed to lack of oxygen as readily as a baby john went back to the theatre and told graham the surgeon dropped his instruments left the operation to tudor beverley and strode out to sit alone in his office john hesitated he had better face him at the end of the case he followed graham to the hut and found him in tears it was a terrible mistake john admitted at once i just dont know how it happened graham said nothing im always so careful about the throatpacks grahamyou know i am ive had nightmares about leaving one in ive been half afraid something like this might come about ever since the unit started graham wearily moved the glass bottle containing the soldiers tattoo and after all the poor devil went through he muttered i cant begin to say how sorry i am graham again made no response but its awfully difficult you know with two tables in the theatre without any proper assistants ive told the nurses time and time again to feel for the throatpack at the first sign of trouble afterwards the nurse in charge of bluey was new she let us down if youre going to make excuses dont shift the blame on to some poor girl who at the moment is too frightened to speak im not making excuses said john patiently im only putting the facts whose responsibility is it john shrugged of course mine ultimately as the anaesthetist in charge of the case im not denying that of course youre making excuses graham told him angrily youre always making excuses whenever you make a mess of it with a patient if you give a perivenal injection the vein was abnormal if you break a needle it was a faulty one if your oxygen cylinder runs out you told the orderly to change it i only hope youll find the coroner a more sympathetic listener im perfectly prepared to answer whatever the coroner feels like asking me john retaliated ive nothing to hide graham made an impatient gesture oh youll come out of the inquest with your skin unavoidable mistake pressure of work patients difficult airway youll continue with your job here as though nothing had happened i shant even be here to inconvenience you you and denise can go on putting out poisonous gossip about me as much as you care that probably helped to get me sacked if you looked into it its not fair to say that graham john told him patiently it may not be but its the truth and you know it denise doesnt like me she never has if denise has sometimes beenwell indiscreet john admitted shes been careful nothing could go further not outside the hospital but now youre talking as if we were sworn enemies of course were not youre imagining things havent we been friends you and i close friends for years ever since the ent days weve been through enough together god knows weve lost patients before he hesitated weve even covered up for each other before i wouldnt like to think that however tragic this incident meant the end of our personal relationship be that as it may but never in your life will you give another anaesthetic for me graham told him angrily at this particular moment i doubt if that strikes you as much of a penalty im down i know it but i wont stay down when the wars over therell be fifty anaesthetists in london breaking their necks chasing after my work im going to make my fortune again and this time you wont get ten per cent of it now please leave me in peace that night clare woke with pain in her back when she looked she saw there was some vaginal bleeding graham telephoned mr orory then he carried her outside in a blanket tucked her into the back of the morris and drove the ten miles to smithers botham the gynaecologist was already waiting greeting them with some mild joke about plastic surgeons working at the right end to avoid calls from their sleep he put clare into his ward tipping up the foot of her bed on wooden blocks he surrounded her with hotwater bottles ordered an injection of morphine prescribed doses of bromide and added wellpolished reassurance is she aborting asked graham outside the ward well now its a threatened abortion mr orory said amiably its just eight weeks since the end of the ladys last menstrual period so it wouldnt be an unheardof occurrence at such a time would it could anything have caused it graham asked anxiously mental distress that sort of thing you know what worry weve been having oh these things happen they just happen to tell the truth none of us knows really why whats the chance of saving the foetus id say quite good yes quite good though the lady will have to take life with queenly ease for quite a while afterwards thats nothing to bother about nothing at all and anyway smiled the gynaecologist the lady isnt necessarily destined to repeat the performance on a second occasion is she if all is lost theres plenty more where that one came from eh graham graham began to wonder if he really liked tim orory after all the bleeding went on the following day mr orory shook his head and said he feared the lady must visit his operating theatre they gave clare another dose of morphine and wheeled her along the cold concrete corridor mr ororys anaesthetist administered gas and trichorethylene they stuck her legs in the air mr orory settled himself comfortably on a metal stool between them and with a curette removed grahams latest achievement for good graham spent the night alone in the bungalow depression was no stranger at his side but he had never known such misery before everything was running against him when he told john bickley that he wouldnt stay down hed meant it but for the first time he now sensed he was finished for good hed never recover professionally not when everyone could point to him as the man who was sacked in the war the child was lost and in such straits theyd be insane to start another he wondered if clare would stay with him he had really little to offer her and at her age she must surely expect something rewarding from life it never occurred to graham how much she might love him for himself he always expected to take so much from others he sometimes felt obliged to offer more than he possibly could haileybury would not have been surprised at this mental turmoil he knew grahams moods well enough he was unaware of the pregnancy and only faintly aware of clare whom he had dismissed as another of grahams pickups the following morning a car arrived at his mansion containing a general haileybury knew the general well they had been to the same public school they belonged to the same london club before the war they had been off golfing and mountaineering together the general marched up to his office saying nothing he laid on haileyburys desk a slip of typewritten paper which declared simply pray why has one of our most famous and able doctors been dismissed his post the news of his work has vastly heartened men and women in all the allied services he will be reinstated immediately i wish to know who is responsible haileybury gave a deep sigh it was useless to fight trevose when they both got to heaven he was bound to get god on his side abortion said mr cramphorn to denise bickley at smithers botham ill bet graham did it himself with a knittingneedle it was a glorious afternoon the sun streaked the water with gold and warmed the grassy slope where twentytwoyearold alec trevose lay with his face roofed by sir robert muirs textbook of pathology all pages of it the slope ran down to a whitepainted hotel which had once housed holidaymakers at southsea near portsmouth but was now a makeshift hospital both sea and sky were for once free of men and their machinery except for an approaching landingcraft its silver balloon floating nonchalantly overhead bringing smashed vehicles and possibly smashed humans back from normandy by midjuly both the weather and the progress of the invasion had improved noticeably montgomery had liberated caen the americans had started moving down the eastward side of the cherbourg peninsula and the colouredheaded pins stuck into maps on the walls of homes all over the country began to lose their faintly worrying immobility beside alec on the grass was his sports jacket with leather patches on the elbows a frayed blackfriars tie and a semistiff collar he had cast off his shoes and his big toes poked through the holes in his socks his striped shirt was open to display his thin chesthe suffered from asthma an awkward complaint liable to grip him in moments of emotion sexual or otherwise alec often put down the asthma to some obscure psychological effect of having been delivered by his own father the medical missionary in the malayan jungle several hundred miles from alternative professional attention it was the first of many uncomfortable things which seemed to happen to him while his cousin desmond had gone to a splendid public school he had attended an odd establishment for the education of the sons of other missionaries to be reared in a strong atmosphere of piety chastisement and carbolic soap even the cost of his education was being met by his uncle graham or his cousin desmond however you looked at it though his bills were thankfully met by anonymous lawyers he had started the telescoped medical course at cambridge when the war was a year old it wasnt much fun he reflected with no one to talk to except potential doctors engineers and clergymen all three professions being thought essential by the government to ensure eventual victory but he had seen cambridge as it should be seen with kings chapel shining in the pure moonlight like an iceberg great court at trinity a mystery of stones and shadows clare college running lightless to the river as a silver screen the alleys returned to their rightful medieval blackness it was cambridge as newton and milton had seen it his tutor was an ancient cleric in a purple stock encrusted with the memorials to countless college soups who wore both gown and airraid wardens helmet during alerts taking seriously his responsibility for the physical as well as the moral safety of his pupils the science dons had mostly disappeared to concoct new devilment for the enemy on the whole alec thought the university rather superior about the war it had lived through plenty before with fitting scientific detachment the church clock still stood at ten to three and for most of the time honey was off the ration that sunny afternoon by the sea he was still officially studying clinical medicine at smithers botham where he had occupied almost a dozen lodgings in the surrounding countryside however agreeable his hosts however tasty the woolton pie however hot the officially permitted few inches of bathwater alec was always convinced of being happier at the next stop it was a strange restlessness which applied to his hobbies his friends his enthusiasm for the various subjects he studied and his views of life in general he had finally asked his uncle graham to get him into the emergency squad he felt he got on rather well with his uncle graham physically they were much alike alec supposed when the family genes had been shuffled at their separate conceptions they had drawn much the same hand the emergency squad at smithers botham occupied a low twostorey block which in peacetime had housed the betterclass lunatic who could afford to pay for his own incarceration it was comfortable enough it saved paying rent and you could always risk smuggling in a girl the squads existence was at last justified on dday when they were abruptly dispatched by lorry across the face of signpostless england to the converted hotel at southsea which they found in charge of a polish civilian doctor who was unable to speak much english and who seemed uncertain if they were a party of topflight specialists from london or the men come to mend the boiler no one knew what cases the hospital was created to take because none ever appeared everyone seemed to have forgotten about them their only contact with authority was brigadier haileybury who one afternoon had arrived unheralded to inspect them i believe i know you dont i he had asked desmond yes sir we met once before the war in my fathers place in london my names trevose haileybury nodded your father is certainly making a name for himself deservedly i hope sir of that i have no doubt i hope you inherit a share of his remarkable talents young man you could look forward to a brilliant career the brigadier disappeared they all noticed he had a wonderfully pretty ats driver alec slid the pathology textbook from his nose aware that someone was approaching up the slope it was desmond dressed in a grey flannel suit his cousin sat down silently beside him picked a stalk of grass and stuck the end between his teeth anything doing in the wards alec asked no what are you reading muir i mean this other book desmond picked up an open volume from the grass he turned the pages frowning and after a moment read aloud behold me waitingwaiting for the knife a little while and at a leap i storm the thick sweet mystery of chloroform the drunken dark the little deathinlife he tossed the book down and asked what are you reading that sort of stuff for its too hot for pathology its a rather flamboyant bit of verse isnt it no i dont think so doesnt it put a patients feelings well god knows how many think the same thing they arent articulate enough to express themselves thats all nobody uses chloroform any more said desmond briefly who wrote it henley when he was in edinburgh infirmary waiting for them to chop his foot off why have you taken to poetry why not dont you realize were totally uneducated all of us at blackfriars they simply drown us intellectually in a torrent of facts mostly extremely dull what chance have we got to equip ourselves with some knowledge of literature the arts philosophy he added grandly i daresay desmond bit a piece of grass then spat it away unfortunately they dont ask questions on those subjects in the finals i think we should be more interested in being welleducated doctors than getting through our finals oh this is just another of your crazes desmond dismissed his cousins cultural ambitions ive got to go back to london this evening whats this a night out no its my mother desmond told him with careful casualness ive just heard shes had a stroke quite a severe one i gather i say im sorry so am i but these vascular accidents happen desmond got up shouldnt you try and find someone to mend your socks it would never do to display emotion or even concern especially in front of alec the news telephoned from sussex that morning was hardly a surprise to graham for a year marias bloodpressure had been steadily mounting as she became fatter than ever he still hadnt divorced her the plan had somehow been overlooked in the flurry of his reinstatement at the annex he told clareas he told himselfthe episode of his sacking must be taken as a warning for the patients to continue benefiting from his abilities he must be careful about publicity in the future a divorce case in the papers certainly wouldnt help his standing in the eyes of the ministry such distressing tangles were perhaps best unravelled after the war when he was his own master again clare agreed the subject was dropped so was that of a second excursion into pregnancy among any affectionate couple the matters never mentioned are generally the important ones their domestic bliss at cosy cot continued clare didnt go back to her work at the annex but stayed at home to look after the house grow radishes and lettuces in the garden and cook the rations they were frequently indebted to mr cramphorn who seemed to have taken to them after grahams brush with authority and would appear at the door with a rabbit he had shot or a pigeon or a rook or even a squirrel which he proclaimed excellent eating if roasted with a strip of bacon as inclined to be rather dry the food situation was trying graham himself sometimes guiltily brought liquid paraffin from the hospital to eke out the cooking fat until the ministry tumbled to this regrettably widespread practice and added the chemical phenolphthalein which turned the fried fish bright pink whats marias prognosis graham clare asked they were sitting on the handkerchief of a lawn in the garden that evening waiting for desmond graham had managed to buy a bottle of pimms no which he prepared with great enthusiasm adding bits of apple cucumber rind mint and even carrot its difficult to say she may recover more or less completely she may end up with a hemiplegia halfparalyzedand dumb of course if her speech centres gone she may go on having small strokes for months even years on the other hand she may develop bronchopneumonia and die in a week these patients get bedsores sepsis you know sometimes they just fade out clare said nothing if maria died the last obstacle to their marriage would die with her well the last excuse anyway sensing her thoughts graham added i should have gone ahead with that divorce he reached out and took her hand i know how you feel and it must be awful stepping into a dead womans shoes no i dont feel that at all darling marias never been more than an abstract quality to me you should have made me do something about those lawyers youd have said i was nagging she laughed you might have left me he squeezed her hand and said dont be silly you know perfectly well he broke off a noise a motor bike in the sky coming nearer is that one he asked anxiously yes i rather think it is crampers told me the one which fell in maiden cross yesterday killed about twenty people the engine stopped its a long way off he said still sounding uncomfortable they stared at each other the silence seemed to last for an age finally there was an explosion far in the distance some of them glide on for miles graham observed the flyingbombs had taken on an illnatured personality of their own they were malevolent winged firespitting beasts no impossible to relate to the busy greyuniformed squads dispatching them i hope desmonds all right he added in a worried voice but desmond arrived unaware of his peril he spent the night in the bungalow setting off early the next morning with graham in the morris the nursinghome where maria lay ill catered for a more genteel mental sufferer than once found themselves in smithers botham it was a manor house providing seclusion fresh vegetables from the garden and nursing which was unfailingly kindly if not particularly skilful they were received by the matron a stout blueuniformed northcountrywoman radiating cheerfulness the poor souls poorly of that theres no doubt she greeted graham if she went wed quite miss her you know shes been with us longer than anyone graham was familiar enough with marias room she had occupied the same one since he had her shut up in the place ten years ago it was small bright in the sunshine with a vase of pink roses beside the bed maria was unconscious breathing noisily it was too soon after the haemorrhage which had sprung from a brittle artery amid the microscopic telephonecables of her brain to tell the extent of her coming paralysis graham noticed she suffered the indignity of a large fly crawling unmolested across her cheek her grey hair lay neatly on the pillow in two plaits each tied with a pink bow like a schoolgirls desmond stood in the background looking solemn however much he had prepared himself however often he had observed the same clinical state in others however little he felt for his insane mother it was a shock to see her like that graham went to the bed and felt her pulse his fingers slipped down to take her flaccid hand it reminded him of the night when her troubles had started when she tried to kill herself with an overdose of sleepingdraught and had been saved by the skill of john bickley he suddenly felt himself touched now his wife lay under his eyes as a dying wreck he felt a surge of love for her it was stronger than any he could remember in his life even before he had married her isnt her breathing rather obstructed he complained mildly the doctor will be along by and by the matron told him comfortably doubtless hell deal with it graham nodded he supposed at that stage it didnt make twopence worth of difference perhaps youll ring me at smithers botham matron if she takes a turn for the worse i will that mr trevose in the corridor outside she went on cheerfully its sad isnt it your poor wife should be smitten when therere such good news on the wireless this morning as graham looked at her blankly she explained havent you heard theyve tried to blow up hitler with a bomb the germans themselves it wont be long now till its all over and done with you mark my words as they drove away graham said to desmond i suppose therere people who ought to know youd better try and get hold of your uncle charles you can probably find his whereabouts if you telephone val arlotts office at the press say its on my behalf god knows where her other brothers got to do you want to speak to uncle charles yourself dad i most certainly do not graham drove in silence for a mile so they tried to liquidate der f—åhrer did they perhaps theyll end up with a revolution in berlin like last time it could all be over by christmas graham hardly said anything for the rest of the journey the shadow of death that hung over both hitler and maria was bringing to the front of his mind difficult problems marias funeral caused a frightful fuss she lingered a week regaining consciousness her hand groping the air her eyes askew speechless during the days she was passive enough but at nights she grew restless clawing at her sheets trying to get out of bed the nurses were perfectly used to such behaviour they brought long boards to slot along the sides of her bed as though she were in her coffin already on the thursday morning she had another cerebral haemorrhage and left life as she had entered it with a gasp when they telephoned graham at smithers botham he shrugged his shoulders but he was surprised at his inner distress it is a merciful quality of the human mind never completely to expect the inevitable there were practical details again he knew his wife wished to be buried at biddenden in more glorious days the cazalay familys country place she had told him as much when her life was in danger once before at the stormy birth of desmond but biddenden was in kent and since the opening of the second front a military area graham seemed to remember that permits were needed to venture there he approached captain pile who confessed it outside his authoritythough he had taken to graham since the surgeon had become a national figure often boasting to his cronies of association with this wonderful work the undertakers finally sorted things out and the following wednesday morning graham set off in the morris again with desmond they started late graham having been called to a soldier brought into the annex from a bad road smash in an age infested with priorities he supposed that the dying could claim precedence over the already dead graham remembered the cazalays old house well enough it was a mile or two from biddenden near another village with a few houses a pub and the church you first caught sight of it as the road turned on the hill through a gap in the treesbut the trees had grown graham tried to remember the last time hed been invited to spend a night in its spacious and chilly bedrooms it was not really an old house its twisted chimneys leaded windows and timbered gables going no farther back than the reign of king edward the seventh it was rather vulgar really like the late lord cazalay himself he wondered how the famous glasshouses were the airfields in the area having been plastered by the germans generously as he drove past the lodge gates he saw a notice announcing headquartersforces and workers entertainment service well he supposed that was carrying on the first lord cazalays tradition did you ever visit the place graham asked desmond i dont know i could hardly remember could i i was too young before the family disgrace graham grunted he disliked to think of the disgrace spilling on to his own family he had brought nothing but honour to the cazalay tree were late he said as the church came in sight everyones gone in they hurried inside making for the front pew graham found himself beside a fat man with the bar of a black moustache across his red facemarias brother charles the second lord cazalay they inclined their heads gravely the elderly clergyman rose a familiar noise intruded into the church a phutphutphut coming steadily nearer graham shifted his feet uncomfortably now they had moved the antiaircraft guns to the coast and left the spitfires and hurricanes to prowl inshore most of the flyingbombs were being shot down it occurred to him they were standing in the middle of the area proscribed by the air ministry for exactly this purpose the noise grew closer the clergyman stood with his mouth open graham noticed the church windows had already been blown out and boarded up it would be a strange end to be buried alive at his wifes funeral the engine cut out silence then an explosion which shook the earth under them the clergyman started the burial service in a tone of deep relief it was all mumbojumbo graham thought the only difference between a human body alive and a human body dead was that between an engine running and switched off though the stopped engine didnt inconveniently rot to pieces there were a surprising number of people in the church twenty or thirty old friends of marias he supposed living ghosts come to clank the rusty chains of their memories in his ears he hoped the old clergyman would get it all over quickly he probably would there was always the chance of another flyingbomb as they wheeled maria out graham noticed the route to the graveside passed a row of elaborate memorials to others of the cazalay family though not her father and mother who had died in the arid air of venezuela a destination recommending itself for lord cazalays retirement through its lack of an extradition treaty with great britain as marias remains were lowered from sight another flyingbomb came out of the distance as the engine stopped heads turned heavenwards in anxiety rather than supplication it exploded with a distant thump graham wondered idly who was unfortunate enough to be underneath it mr trevose you must remember me said an old lady in a velvet hat voice conscientiously hushed of course i do graham lied i was on the committee of the sunshine league and the free medicine club with your dear wife you know the sunshine league well the war had relieved the rich of the painful necessity of lightening the burdens of the poor graham found himself facing a thin old man with two sticks whom he recognized after a moment as sir john blazey hed been chairman of the small hospital at uxbridge which graham had used as his first step to success in plastic surgeryrather unscrupulously he supposed he thought the fellow had died long ago your wife was a great woman trevose the old man shook his head reflectively she was quite unsparing in her sense of duty to others we shall never know how many unfortunate people have had cause to be grateful to her graham thanked him he had almost forgotten the maria of the busy committees with her picture in the illustrated london news and the bystander now the glories of her past began to draw his eye from the shadows of her later poverty and insanity well its good to know she died a credit to me he thought he found himself shaking hands with val arlott why did you come graham asked looking surprised i didnt notice you in the church have you a moment for a stroll they walked together in the country lane outside the churchyard i cant say why i came exactly val told him ive been wondering perhaps its to make up for missing the burial of her father i was fond of old cazalay in some measure i suppose i was responsible for his plight graham made an unbelieving gesture its difficult to know there are things i might have said or done to check his recklessness perhaps im suffering unconscious feelings of guilt towards the family this is my penance youd know about such matters wouldnt you how are things going at the annex were still busy though the excitements gone were an institution now like all institutions weve lost the fun of getting greater and grander weve only the worry of seeing ourselves slipping i wish id done more for you medical people particularly now im getting so old and infirm look at nuffieldgiven millions set up professors all manner of things you know they tried to sack me yes i got the pm to scotch it graham looked faintly put out he had imagined the intervention a tribute to his own personality after the war youll have plenty of room for your charity i should imagine val these ideas about state medicine and so on nothing will come of them surely dont you believe it when the fighting stops well get a socialist government surely youre not telling me the countrys going to reject churchill why not what stopped us giving in after dunkirk our national streak of perversity graham looked glum thatll make it tough for me trying to build up again youve got a wonderful reputation i cant eat it no but it helps therell be a lot of goodies and gongs going after the war graham i dont see why you should be passed by i take it youd be agreeable if i put you in for something graham gave a faint smile havent i been too gay a dog to be given an official collar the wars altered a lot of that after all if youre brave enough to win the vc nobody gives a damn how many women youve screwed its certainly an attractive proposition he broke off listening no its only a motorbike somewhere those doodlebugs are damn scaring i thought that one in church was going to blow the lot of us up corpse and all dont worry duncan sandys says weve got them licked only about one in five get through now whens the war going to be over against the germans by christmas against the japs in a couple of years against the russians god knows with this deep and disquieting observation val arlott shook hands entered his chauffeurdriven car and made off graham felt he needed a drink the other mourners were cramming themselves with some agitation into three or four taxis parked off the lane his son was standing alone looking awkward by the lych gate i expect you could do with a stiff one desmond couldnt you yes it wouldnt come amiss well try our luck in the pub they walked a quartermile down the lane in silence the funeral had already been displaced from grahams mind by his talk with val some sort of gong what sort they could hardly hand him the obe like some zealous food official a kbe would make him sir graham which would sound very pretty but he doubted if even val could push him into the pure light of official favour the bigwigs in the medical profession would certainly have a say in it and they had always mistrusted him someone would be resentful he won his fight over the sacking and eager to express it practically and haileybury would be against him no not haileybury graham decided after a moments thought haileybury was far too stupidly righteous to take the chance of such easy revenge anyway he didnt care he had never let official honours flicker among the varied ambitions which had burned inside him he knew medical knights enough and he thought most of them horribly dreary they pushed open the door of the little saloon bar to hear a loud voice declaring but of course you must have some whisky come along be a good fellow look out a bottle from under the counter dont you understand ive just been to a funeral graham hesitated but it was too late to withdraw he had never liked marias brother the man had laughed at him as her suitor paining young graham with the discovery that in society medical people were seen with the eye of fifty years previously when the healer was admitted only via the tradesmens entrancethough graham had acted afterwards on this brutal realization most profitably he was also rather afraid of charles cazalay he had the unscrupulousness of his father if not the intelligence which made the most of it he had tried to damage graham once and wouldnt hesitate to try again if it suited him dont you know who i am lord cazalay continued to the landlord halfchaffing and halfhectoring you should you know im lord cazalay i used to live in the house before your day i remember the fellow who kept this place man called greensmith greensmith would have found something for me i dont mind telling you now run along and see what you can do overcome either by the materialization of the local legend or the solemnity of his errand the landlord departed anxiously to search his cellar graham approached and said it must be twenty years since we met graham im delighted to see you again lord cazalay greeted him affably im sorry it should be on such a sad occasion graham introduced his son you cant have set eyes on desmond since he was a baby lord cazalay briskly brushed his moustache and remarked hes grown into a fine lad as you know i decided to make my home for some years in france he lowered his voice respectfully it was very distressing about maria graham i know how you must feel her life was such a waste shut out of the world so long it was always a comfort to me that my sister had you to care for hera medical man thank you said graham shortly well grahamyouve become more famous than ever i always seem to be reading about you in the papers im only doing my job like a lot of others who dont get noticed im with security you know i thought you were censoring civilian letters its the same thing said lord cazalay looking put out the landlord reappeared holding an unopened bottle of haig like a newborn baby as he poured three measures lord cazalay went on what are your plans for after the war graham i think its only courting disappointment making any i wouldnt say that itll be every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost like last time the thing is to get in early before the mugs therell be pickings enough for the right people where precisely do you intend to pick if i may ask travel lord cazalay swallowed his whisky and demanded another people have been cooped up here all the war theyll be bursting to get out and about therell be plenty of spare shipping space army buses that sort of thing if you know where to put your hands on them ive plenty of valuable contacts in france i doubt whether theyve got into any trouble with the germans he looked at his glass reflectively and added as a matter of fact im starting a small company if youre interested i could let you have a piece of it graham thought this brazen even for his brotherinlaw youre asking me for money after having tried to get me publicly disgraced as a professional man lord cazalay looked serious then said graham im glad you raised that business its been on my conscience id been meaning to have a word with you but with the war of course everythings been difficult it was all a tragic misunderstanding surely i was simply wrongly advised it was a relief to me nothing came of it it was to me too dont you trust me he asked part humorously and part aggressively i dont think this is quite the occasion to conduct commercial affairs no no perhaps youre right lord cazalay said quickly now we must be going desmond has to catch a train for portsmouth well keep in touch lord cazalay promised yes very much in touch they left him with the bottle of whisky which he seemed about to settle down and finish on the estimable principle that unexpected blessings needed exploiting to the full what was it like asked clare as graham got back to the bungalow having left desmond at the station in maiden cross more harrowing than i imagined do you want some tea darling you cant have had anything to eat i dont think im hungry really he sat in an armchair in the sittingroom and picked up the daily press he hadnt seen a paper that morning the russians seem to be doing well he observed he wondered what val arlott had meant about a war with the soviets they seemed prickly customers but at least they were on our side and putting up a far better showing than last time did you see the brother yes any trouble no he tried to borrow some money off me clare sat on the arm of his chair i can see its upset you graham it was all the paraphernaliadirges gloomy incantations that sort of thing why should i be disturbed by her death in itself it was a merciful release overdue if anything i never met her of course but i thought i knew her ive so often imagined her lying beside you that was never particularly successful or pleasurable what was she like in her prime graham tossed the paper down active always busy a great dogooder on dozens of committees she was an intelligent woman before her brain gave way we had a rather cerebral relationship i suppose she was dreadfully afraid of her own emotions the only thing in the world she was afraid of what made you marry her who knows at such distance why they married anyone after a pause she asked when are we going to be married ourselves graham therell have to be a decent interval naturally of course i appreciate that ive got to take some account of the world in general however much i despise it thered be gossip if we got married tomorrowcrampers the bickleys everyone at smithers botham it would probably get into the papers certainly into the press i dont want to invite maliciousness god knows ive had to suffer enough of it recently she noticed it didnt occur to graham even to ask her own sentiments clare was used to his selfcentredness she had decided there was nothing unkind or even unattractive about it in some ways it was a virtue his egotism more than anything else had made the annex what it was if graham could think of nobody but himself she felt resignedly it was perhaps because there was nobody in his acquaintance half as interesting how long she asked i really cant say offhand clare ive had no experience of the situation do you mean six weeks or six months a year two years for the first time she resolved to press him we must allow the corpse to grow cold well thensix months say i should think that would strike everyone as respectable shall we decide on january yes in january the war will be over by then the sittingroom window was open and a breeze blew some sheets of casenotes from grahams table on to the floor she rose to gather them well be back in london then as likely as not he told her mightnt this be the moment to start looking for a flat my house in mayfair would cost a fortune to put into shape ill need new consulting rooms too we might be able to combine both harley street isnt a bad area to live its near regents park and not far from the west end she smiled and said its difficult to imagine myself living in london at all itll be wonderful once things get back to normal wonderful for both of us theres scores of places im longing to take yourestaurants theatres little clubs i remember not all of them can have disappeared in the blitz theres hundreds of people i want you to meet this time theyll come back thank god it was different after the last war with those awful bloodbaths you wont do anything like that at all graham she chided him gently youll be too busy working ive worked hard enough during the war i deserve a bit of relaxation its been five years out of my life do you realize that by christmas in ill be sixty thats a long way off anyway ill be almost forty of course i shall have to make a living build up from scratch he gave a grin ill have a new wife to impress i dont really believe these wild schemes for putting doctors under the state will come to anything supposing we all went on strike thats a chilling prospect for the politicians things will go on much the same if you ask me you cant change england but what about the annex i suppose it will cease to exist or become totally unimportant again like the raf itself i dont know its no concern of mine my job there finishes with the war but graham she exclaimed i cant believe you could give up the annex just like that you created it its filled your thoughts day and night youd be aimless without it you cant have just lost interest in it but its a phase in my life dont you see clare weve all grown so used to the war weve forgotten its a highly abnormal form of existence ive been lotuseating down here ive had no worries about making money nor about what to spend it on a lot of the others at smithers botham havent the sense to see it the same way theyre stuck in a rut youd imagine they thought the war was continuing for ever he swept his hand round the sittingroom my god im longing to live in a proper house somewhere with my own furniture decent pictures eating off plates without cracks in them none of this bloody rationing servants to do the dirty work a bit of style again oh ill admit it the wars been stimulating rewarding often amusing but when its over i want to forget it like an illness i want to pick up my career again as far as surgery goes im only approaching my prime she was facing him leaning against the table and he saw she had started to cry women were unaccountable whats the matter he asked not particularly kindly i havent said anything wrong surely i thought the annex meant everything to you graham its something ill look back on with considerable affection like me why do you say that he asked irritably youre being fanciful im not its perfectly true im just part of the annex as far as youre concerned now youre being downright silly you dont want to marry me do you you dont want to at all she advanced on him angrily graham was startled all his life he had surrounded himself with submissive people and it was always unsettling when they turned on him clare youre simply saying a lot of irresponsible things which are making you overwrought im saying things which i should have said months ago years ago my god ive been a fool do you imagine all this hasnt been boiling in my mind since i came here of course you dont want to marry me youve always had some excuse something to put it off even when you got me pregnant you didnt want me as your wife you were scared stiff at the thought you didnt want that child either you were as pleased as punch when i aborted thats the truth isnt it he stood up of course it wasnt the truth he told her crossly i did everything i could to save it didnt i i was upset when we lost it dreadfully upset do you think i dont know my own mind no you dont know it at all graham thats your trouble therere plenty of wonderful things about you and you dont recognize them there are plenty of horrible things about you too and you dont recognize those either or you wont bring yourself to face them which is the worse for you so youre suggesting im going to turn you out after the war like some campfollower it wont come to that we cant go on with this playacting any longer weve got to split up you cant mean that he was alarmed at this practical turn in the conversation itll only get worse if i stay she looked down at the threadbare carpet and went on more calmly i havent made up my mind just this minute graham i decidedoh months ago i dont know when perhaps i didnt decide at all it just crept up on me clare he approached her but she pushed him away supposing i said id marry you tomorrow no it wouldnt do it wouldnt work wed be in a worse mess than ever once you got back to london youd want to be rid of me im not your type you dont love me i dont think you could love anyone your attitude to women is like your attitude to the boys in the annex so many construction jobs as you say you overlook that ive got the right to any feelings at all graham stuck his hands in his pockets it was all most distressing he hated emotional scenes perhaps they were both upset with the business of maria clare would be over it tomorrow why did you take up with me in the first place he asked a shade resentfully you knew enough about me about my past affairs every womans a heroine i suppose she expects to succeed where others have succumbed possibly they stood looking at each other you cant mean it he asked more quietly about going away yes i do ill get a job somewhere lets discuss it again tomorrow when were ourselves no she told him theres nothing else to say a week later clare left the bungalow and graham took a room in a london hotel explaining to everyone at smithers botham that this temporary change in domestic arrangements was necessitated by his searching for a flat the pair had parted politely even amicably a continued emotional tempest would have worn out both of them and they were old enough to take such things sensibly in the end graham was rather pleased he would miss clare of course but she was right she was a simple kindly girl but not at all the sort to stand beside the fashionable plastic surgeon graham trevose now returning like the exiled european governments to his rightful dominions a marriage would have been a disaster and supposing this gong materialized lady trevose decidedly not to fill that role he wanted someone far more intelligent more versed in the ways of the world more socially adept someone of better family than the seedy commercial artists someone like maria he thought yes someone like maria maria in death like maria in life always came out top in the end by christmas when the fighting should have been over the german armies broke through at the ardennes for the second time in the war luckily for the allies the weather cleared and they could bomb them to pieces on the twisting hilly roadswhich they would have saved themselves a great deal of trouble by doing in if only theyd had any aeroplanes in london the flyingbombs were replaced by rockets which perplexed and affronted the government as lord cherwell had worked out most carefully they were too expensive for the germans to use the rockets particularly harassed alec trevose who was doing his two months midwifery training at a sandbagged lyingin hospital in north london every time one fell the noise sent half a dozen local women into labour and it was no fun finding your way through blackedout back streets on a bicycle loaded like a mule with bags of instruments and dressings suspected by policemen of being some sort of saboteur and wondering if the next unheralded missile had your number on it alec didnt like midwifery he was beginning to see himself as an intellectual a man of culture and childbirth was an extremely uncultured pursuit tor all concerned alec hated the babies he hated the midwife in charge of him a sparsebosomed scotswoman with a vinegary tongue she in turn seemed to hate him and indeed men in general which he felt was reasonable from her toilsome occupation only the jovial mr orory brought levity to the solemn reproductive circus with his visits twice a week he was a catholic and therefore unable to perform abortionsthough he stretched a point when they were natural like clares miscarriage and passed the others to his houseman backseat driving over his right shoulder female sterilization was for him he confessed quite out of the question he would perform the operation to the crucial point then demand genially of his assistant just tie a a knot in those two ligatures round the fallopian tubes my boy theres a good fellow my religion doesnt allow me to do that sort of thing at all alec rather took to mr orory he felt he had the cultured approach in the spring the nazi magnificos suddenly appeared in the papers as haggard and anxious old men shuffling about in baggy civilian suits it induced feelings of freakishness rather than triumph to anyone of alec trevoses age a world empty of hitler and mussolini was as strange as one without mickey mouse and donald duck himmler bit the cyanide capsule in his tooth and vomited himself to death over the trousers of a british officer if nobody really knew what had happened to hitler nobody really cared there were rejoicings in british streets of a seemly nature the government in a burst of official relaxation allowed the citizenry to use binoculars again if the population were restrained by the scarcity of hard liquor from getting lit up when the lights went up in london at least they had some sort of fling before the authorities switched them off again through shortage of fuel on the june day when the world inaugurated the united nations in san francisco and so abolished war for everfor the second occasion in a quarter of a centuryboth alec and desmond found they had qualified as doctors alec quickly found that qualification like marriage brought more problems than it settled his first difficulty was to win a resident post at smithers botham failing to get a house job in your mother hospital was like being expelled from school it stuck for life besides he was going to specialize all the students were going to specialize their teachers who were specialists having freely laced their instruction with their opinion of family doctors as dangerous fumbling ignoramuses but specialize in what psychiatry alec decided it was intellectual and you never got your hands messy there was no psychiatric houseman so as a first step he must land a house physicians appointment but unfortunately for alec the jobs had come to be decided solely by mr cramphorn who dominated the selection committee his methods were simple he would look through the list of applicants grunting and strike out with his gold pencil all coloured students jews those with unenglish sounding names any he had taken a dislike to and any he had for some reason never heard of and mr cramphorn had taken a fierce dislike to the trevose family he thought grahams treatment of clare outrageous and after he had lavished his rabbits on her too desmond he admitted grudgingly must be given a job as the son of a blackfriars consultant if that unspoken rule lapsed the whole structure of the hospital might tumble and there were changes enough in the wind already but alec could be sacrificed in the end mr cramphorn compromised by making alec the resident anaesthetist this speciality mr cramphorn believed being reserved for those unfitted for the practice of medicine at all alec had never administered an anaesthetic in his life but luckily john bickley was an indulgent master he was used to getting the duds john had been working for mr cramphorn and mr twelvetrees in the general theatres of smithers botham itself since his row with graham who often enough had wished him back but he was not a man to relent on his own rashness alec was scared of mr cramphorn but discovered that he treated his anaesthetist exactly as he treated his prewar chauffeur an underling expected to do his job and keep out of the conversation otherwise his new occupation seemed like the war ninety per cent boredom and ten per cent panic he started bringing books into the theatre reading them hidden in the sterile towels screening the unconscious patients head having a quick mind he could demolish even a victorian novel in two or three operating sessions alec was never sure of the effect of his anaesthetics on his patients but he felt they were improving his own mind considerably he was becoming more intellectual and cultured than ever desmond meanwhile performed the duties of a housesurgeon with much correctitude and distinction alecs second problem was his political allegiance the general election of july was a nervous experience for the medical profession like henry the eighths monks the doctors quivered half in indignation and half in fright as schemes for their official disposal reached their ears the hospitals were apparently to be grabbed not only inefficient little institutions maintained by ladies selling paper flags but those as proud as blackfriars itself even though it most regrettably existed at the time only as a pile of rubble with pretty wild flowers growing on it it would all wreck the doctorpatient relationship everyone declared at smithers botham and though nobody knew exactly what this meant it was a telling phrase with a ringing note to it and anyway a substitute for whistling to keep your spirits up how should he cast the first vote of his life alec wondered the newspapers seemed poor instruments of political education the cartoons at least made the issue simple between bad bald men in top hats and good cleancut ones in overalls the people came into it a good deal alec rather distrusted the people who were sadly unintellectual indeed somewhat dim sensitive to the doctors vote the local candidates presented themselves on successive nights in the smithers botham assembly hall the conservative was plump and confident and based his persuasion on the fact that the cabinet were a very decent set of chaps he had been to school with many of them the labour man was hollowchested and nervously respectful and based his persuasion on the fact that someone was rude to him in a labour exchange during the thirties mr cramphorn clapped the first oration to the echo and walked out of the second alec decided to support labour because he learned desmond was voting tory in the end he was too busy in the operating theatre to reach the polls and the hollowchested man won handsomely mr cramphorn stayed at home for a weeks sulk but worse was in store he appeared in the theatre at the beginning of august white and trembling they sang the red flag he muttered actually in the house of commons good god some woman danced in the benches its the end but it wasnt the next day a patient addressed him as mate mate to mr cramphorn who had given a lifetime to the curing of the poor who felt the deepest concern for their ills and pains just like the old tsars of russia for their serfs social order and sanity were sliding everywhere they would be swinging from the lampposts next he stayed at home for a month and his housekeeper sent a message to say he was very poorly alecs next concern was finding his mother about to become a gi bride edith trevose had spent the war in a small devon seaside town in a guesthouse whose rooms were furnished for a fortnights summer endurance at the most but had been occupied since by elderly middleclass guests from london who complained increasingly about the food the cooking the war in general and each other edith had been a typist with a grays inn solicitor but decided to help a friend run the place as her war work she was still pretty and the sun of her affections which had dawned upon graham and shone through the noonday of her life on his brother now glowed upon her son alec and was crossed by the first long restful shadows of the menopause edith had a split social position in the town however much she tried to disguise it from herself in the boardinghouse she was taken as a servant when twice a week she lent a hand in the small local hospital she was respected by everyone as the widow of a medical missionary and the sisterinlaw of graham trevose himself edith bore the discrepancy cheerfully she had put up with more disagreeable places in life than the guesthouse and always reflected that the irritations of others like their illnesses though painful to witness could hardly kill her in the summer of something happened to change the towns face more alarmingly than the war itself strange uniforms strange vehicles and strange habits became evident everywhere the americans poured from a nearby camp to amuse themselves having to draw less on their supplies of cash which were said to be limitless than on those of their native enthusiasm and optimism strange softpackaged cigarettes chocolate bars chewinggum and tinned beer circulated everywhere and the girls hairstyles improved sensationally the americans had glamour in a land which was short of it outside the overpacked cinemas all were assumed to come from spacious and laboursaving apartments in manhattan though most lived in towns even sleepier than a devon village and knew of their hosts only from their official guidebook which told them not to say bloody that the british could take any amount of aerial bombardment and were deeply grateful for all the dried egg edith met hal white at the hospital he was a doctor a captain about her own age thin with a large adams apple glasses like glenn millers and given to long periods of deliberation before opening his mouth about anything he offered her a packet of life savers and asked her to a dance edith hesitated jennifer the girl who helped in the kitchen might be there hal explained it was an officers only affair and she accepted she loved dancing it would be really quite fun to be taken out by a man again and of course he was a doctor and therefore a gentleman the dance was exactly like a thousand others in the kingdom that saturday night the local recreation hall was crowded dirty and illkept with french chalk sprinkled hopefully over a rough floor with painted fines for badminton courts the decorations were posters urging the merrymakers to dig or save for victory and that careless talk cost lives at one end was a trestle table where for half an hour or so they sold gin and lime and afterwards beer which everyone hoped would last the evening half a dozen gis on the stage were playing with startling professionalism hal and edith danced to paper doll and sentimental journey and she thought him amazingly light on his feet he said he lived in yonkers and was a widower they tried to hokeycokey which edith thought silly really but quite fun hal explained he had knocked around the world a good deal mostly doing medical jobs with construction companies for a long stretch in singapore edith exclaimed she knew singapore well they cheerfully explored the graveyards of their memories exhuming a body or two to see if it were a mutual friend for the last year of the war they saw each other regularly hal brought her a good deal of spam life magazine and some nylonsher eyes shone as she smoothed the wonderfully sheer material with her fingers when he asked her to marry him she was amazed marriage simply hadnt entered into her scheme of things illness and death yes but widowhood had become a settled way of life to be borne as patiently as residence in the malayan jungle or in the devon guesthouse yet she realized that she belonged to the dread class of distressed gentlefolk what would she do after the war she was frightfully poor she would have to go typing for solicitors until her fingers became too infirm for the keyboard hal was really very kind and he was a doctor the emotions of her life had been entwined round doctors as pliantly as the serpents round aesculapius staff she would have to live in america but america was the place for selfbetterment everyone said so the ideal of selfbetterment had driven her as a girl from her fathers butchers shop in ramsgateto where after a quarter of a century to running a boardinghouse it was a chance only one thing could she be certain of it would be her last that summer the inhabitants of two japanese cities were offhandedly incinerated and the war was over a week later lease lend was cut off equally offhandedly it occurred only to lord keynes that the country was broke and the millennium which so agitated mr cramphorn would have to be financed by a loan of american money so the country like edith escaped from the possibility of german mastership to the certainty of american with as much excitement and less thought edith hal and alec met for the first time in the basement restaurant of the criterion in piccadilly it was a disturbing gathering alec seemed to find ediths lover only funny she had been worried for months at the peculiar excited flippancy in her son quite unlike the stolid outlook of his father she gave him a cheque for a hundred pounds explaining it was all she could afford and he must save it to visit her in america once she was married and transported by the united states government with eighty thousand other british women alec decided to spend it on a car the medical profession lived at the time in a weird intimacy with the motor trade though the petrol ration was small increased by the new government so meanly as to arouse the irritation of even the new statesman doctors who went on errands of mercy were allowed more or less as much as they could use with a bit of fiddling hed raise the fare to see his mother when the time came he decided he was never able to give a serious thought to the future of anything particularly when there was fun to be found in the present during the rest of the hot summer of the war began to run down at smithers botham as gaily as everywhere else there still wasnt much to drink but there was afn munich on the radio the jam ration was said to be going up incorrectly and the place was enlivened by the first demobilized medical officers sent on a sixmonth course to refit them for gentler practice captain pile was finally demobilized he went to olympia for his new suit and at once returned to smithers botham he had grown to like the country hospital and the future medical world was filled with halfglimpsed hazards he had taken the post of medical officer to smithers botham as a mental institution and was charged with preparing its return to normal function whenever blackfriars could be evicted as he walked up the long drive from the bus once again mere dr pile he saw the portico had for a second time been decorated a union jack was spread across the columns and a painted banner announced welcome home our heroic cuthbert the first annual dinner of the annex club at the beginning of was predictably a noisy affair it was held at a restaurant frustrated like all others from doing its best for its diners by the government order that only three courses might be served including the soup the law took itself seriously an establishment serving asparagus on a separate plate instead of accompanying the sliver of meat having already incurred prosecution but the millennium had arrived the coal mines had been nationalized the railways and the doctors were next the rations were reduced coupons were needed for bread and cigarettes were as hard to come by as ever the club was peter thomass idea military units seemed hardly able to await their dispersal before arranging their reunions so why not the patients who had passed through the annex besides some sort of society was needed to help those who suffered from disability official meanness or bad luck and it would be tragic for the buoyant comradeship of smithers botham to be lost without trace in the rough waters of the postwar world the annex itself still existed almost as busily as ever with tudor beverley in charge graham had left as he had promised himself with the end of the war his status as a blackfriars consultant entitled him to half a dozen beds in the main wards at smithers botham for civilian cases the arrangement to which haileybury had tried to condemn him in but the time for selfsacrifice was past graham thought personal and financial one day the annex would have to close and smithers botham evacuated hed be back in the bright new wards of blackfriars again beside the thamesthough from the permanent look of the hospitals rubble that day seemed as unlikely to dawn as the one of settled amity across the split face of europe graham was naturally the clubs president it still gave him a feeling of smugness to see himself described on the printed menu as sir graham trevose kbe dsc frcs the goodies had been delivered as val arlott had promised and the doctorate of science had been conferred on him at the same time by a provincial university keen on entering into the spirit of the times he had found himself more proud of the knighthood than he had expected it was an emblem of something he sought all his lifea recognition that his work was far from trivial but on a par with that of general surgeons majestically toiling among their sausagechains of guts besides everyone was terribly nice about it haileybury had called specially to congratulate him almost with tears in his eyes it was a welldeserved honour he explained not only for the surgeon and for the annex but for the speciality of plastic surgery to which he was himself about to return graham knew that haileybury of all his wellwishers meant every word he also knew the intense selfdiscipline which had brought the man to face him for the first time since their meeting beside the river itchen he would know graham well enough to sense the risk of a cutting rebuff but graham told himself the time for wounding was over and reconciliation was in fashion thank you graham said solemnly shaking hands thank youeric haileybury swallowed it is a real pleasure to congratulate yougraham it was the first time they had used each others christian names in a world which could address old cramphorn as mate reflected graham such relaxations were plainly overdue at the dinner peter thomas proposed a toast to the wizz graham replied shortly afterwards the patients started singing something innocuous at first macnamaras band moving on to cats on the rooftops an enduring favourite then the ball of kirriemuir graham knew this always ended in argument and sometimes in fisticuffs over such points as the ministers wife who felt unweel coming before the swishing of the pricks in the haystacks or the other way round when peter thomas put a glass of beer on his head to play the muffin man graham thought it time to withdraw he leant over to touch john bickley two places away i fancy were a little old for this old man he smiled shall we see if theres the chance of a taxi the two stood in dinner jackets and overcoats surveying the illlit street from the door of the restaurant without much hope it was bitterly cold and snow had paralyzed the country more effectively than the luftwaffe there was a scarcity of coal new shoes were on the ration a warming tot of whisky was a luxury and the government had banned even greyhound racing to save electricity on the hares what a bloody night muttered graham i should have brought the car what are you driving now they had spoken little since the incident of bluey and since graham had left the annex hardly met at all ive got a prewar bentley a peculiar beast with a fabric body but it goes like a clock i bought it from some spiv in the street who wanted spot cash god knows where the thing came from probably stolen for all i know they found a taxi and graham asked john back for a nightcap he had a large flat in the marylebone road convenient for his new consulting room in wimpole street john found it furnished stylishly with grahams stored belongings there was brandy on the sideboard a bowl of fruit even a box of chocolates graham seemed to have climbed back on to the lap of luxury i suppose im allowed to switch on the electric fire graham removed his overcoat i can never remember what the permitted hours are dont they just cut your current off graham grinned im on the same cable as the welbeck hospital so im spared you always did have all the luck as graham poured him a drink john added it was quite a party tonight its good to find the boys enjoying themselves though i could see that tudor beverleys got a deal of work to do on some of them but at least its a club where we can feel glad the membership wont be increasing it was good of you to ask me along graham looked surprised but of course you had to be there we couldnt do without the gasman surely the gasman if youll recall graham was requested not to call graham gave a short laugh the famous trevose temperament do you still hold it against me i was upset at the time all sorts of things were pressing on me after all they were trying to get rid of me and damn near succeeded they took the comfortable armchairs on each side of the fire the three bars gave a welcome glow the central heating was off and the block of flats as inhospitable as an iceberg i know ive been a bastard often enough in my life graham continued as you get older you begin to see yourself properly it was my temperament which wrecked our partnership it wrecked my partnership with tom raleigh it wrecked a lot of other relationships in my life but i couldnt help it if id managed psychologically to emasculate myself id have had no drive to achieve anything at all graham sipped his drink in silence the reference to tempestuous partnerships set john wondering about his hosts present arrangements for sexual relaxation he generally had some of a sort though john had picked up no gossip round the nursinghomes of the west end he wondered if the fellow were getting past it by way of a probe he asked do you live in this palace all alone graham nodded its too big but i had to take what i could the squatters were in downstairs you know you were lucky to get your hands on it londons a peculiar place just now everyone knows someone who can obtain the unobtainable this austeritys a bore isnt it i certainly didnt expect it after the war i thought everything would more or less click back into place again i must have been mad you werent the only one the tory party suffered the same insanity i suppose im amusing myself though the people you meet are peculiar not at all like before the war i wonder what happened to them all havent they gone to kenya and rhodesia and such places id rather put up with things here im not doing badly you know graham told him defiantly the plastic games as tough as ever if not tougher but im well and truly inside the magic circle now he smiled the new handle helps i suppose sir graham and all that the outsiders have a thin time of it trying to break in im certainly not going to help them i suffered enough myself and nobody was inclined to give me a legup arent you afraid of what bevans going to do not really the scheme wont touch us consultants much we might even be better offafter all well get paid for the work we do free in hospital the gps will get the dirty end of the stick and thats too bad the bma have spotted that of course thats why theyre kicking up such a shindy theyre the gps trade union the royal colleges who represent people like me are coming round to bevans line of thinking the letter from the three presidents last month certainly seemed to indicate something like that you see bevans split the profession cunning blighter i rather admire the man if id gone into politics which god forbid i should have modelled myself on him he knows what he wants and can be perfectly charming as he invariably gets it how are you doing john very busy ive smithers botham the cavendish clinic half a dozen hospitals scattered round london id almost forgotten i was on the staff of half of them i missed you badly at the annex i dont mind admitting it nice of you to do so now john said drily that australian we got was all right as a stuffist but the anaesthetists the stagemanager of the operating unit with you everything went so smoothly the vague idea of staging a reconciliation with john already in grahams mind before the dinner now struck him as urgent after all he had a real affection for the man they had been professional brothersinarms for the best part of thirty years hows denise he asked shes been a bit off colour recently nothing definite one of the physicians had a look at her trying to run a home these days is enough to get any woman down graham hesitated and added if youd like to get away ive a villa you could borrow in the south of france at roquebrune up above monte carlo john raised his eyebrows how on earth did you get the currency graham laughed oh there are ways and means i bought it a month agovery reasonably once i got hold of the francs i dont think one should take these restrictions too seriously after all there are so many of them if we observed the letter of all the laws we wouldnt be able to stray from our front doors its a very kind offer graham but i dont know when well have a chance to take you up on it ive hardly had a chance myself im sending sheila raleigh down there next monthyou know tom raleighs widow she needs a holiday ive given her the job of secretary to this annex club theres an awful lot of work to do quite a lot of money in the kitty its a way for me to make amends if i have any amends to make graham finished his drink it was sad about tom it shook me badly at the time too much so perhaps i felt somehow i was responsible but how could i have been i must have been feeling oversensitive in those days anyway sheilas getting married again this summer some fellow out of the navy do you want another drink no i must get home im afraid john rose i promised denise i wouldnt arrive back in too alarming a condition do you think youll find a taxi ill walk were not far away across the park john i wonder if youd like to take over my anaesthetic work again john paused getting into his overcoat this will prove graham thought if he holds everything against me still its good of you graham but im afraid my time for private work is absolutely booked too bad murmured graham he does hold it against me graham told himself and quite badly probably denise is behind it perhaps when things become more organized we can team up again graham suggested vaguely yes perhaps we can said john graham closed the door behind his guest he stood alone in the middle of the room something was disturbing him he looked round then sprang towards the mantelpiece and seized the ornamental clock he looked at it foolishly for a moment and carried it out to the kitchen he had let it run down and the woman who cleaned the flat must have rewound it he hated clocks tick tock tick tock every one a click along the ratchet towards extinction such thoughts came upon him often now that he lived alone he sat down heavily in the armchair telling himself he was really becoming dreadfully neurotic perhaps it was all to do with the symptoms of the male menopause the party was in grosvenor square in a block of flats occupied mainly by americans left over from the war the only class of people in the country who could afford the rent lord cazalay occupied the penthouse which covered most of the top floor graham admitted that his brotherinlaw seemed to be making a success of his life despite the currency restrictions the travel business appeared to be prospering and he claimed to have his fingers in all manner of tasty pies he always treated graham with the warmest affability graham did not deceive himself this was through fraternal love or remorse for past malevolence sir graham trevose was a useful name to keep around him graham didnt object overmuch if you wanted such things as whisky beefsteaks suit lengths or villas on the riviera you couldnt be squeamish over the company you kept graham im delighted you could come lord cazalay pushed his way through the noisy crowd of guests i hope you got over that dinner last night i read about it in the papers i left before they started breaking the place up very wise it must be gratifying to know youve got these young men in such good spirits again i only did my best graham told him modestly some of them would still give a girl a nasty scare on a dark night champagne i was rather lucky to get this consignment across the channel theres someone id like you to meet lord cazalay led graham across the room putting his arm round his shoulders to demonstrate either affection or possession graham wasnt sure fred this is sir graham i know youll be glad to meet him graham found himself facing a short square man with a leathery face smoking a pipe this is fred butcher lord cazalay introduced him you know from the war office graham recognized one of the ministers who had been swept to breathtaking heights by the flood of electoral popularity to be left sitting forlornly on his isolated peak as the tide abruptly turned he was a rather colourless public figure a fairminded hardworking trade union official with a valuable flair for bedding down lambs with lions graham wondered how he got on with the more peppery generals glad to meet you sir graham heard a lot about you during the war of course perhaps too much graham asked thats some peoples view every word was deserved im sure of that he relit his pipe and added you know a surgeon called mr haileybury i believe extremely well he got me to speak at a luncheon the other week about this burns hospital and that he seems a great one for the idea does mr haileybury personally i think hes got something of a bee in his bonnet about it maybe so said the politician guardedly graham had heard of haileyburys plan only secondhand it seemed that haileybury once reconciled to the governments cossetting the nations health to a greater extent than providing clean water and drains had turned himself into a crusader for the new scheme he suddenly woke up to its offering an outlet for his qualities of administration sadly frustrated once he put away his uniform he was particularly taken with the idea of establishing a hospital in london for burns and accidents arguing that the experience gained during the war should not be dispersed but concentrated under one roof and passed to visiting surgeons from countries which had regrettably been spared the opportunity for such practice the ministry of health was sympathetic to haileybury but doubtful they had to find the money to put roofs on the old hospitals before digging the foundations of new ones graham had a dozen questions he would like to have asked the minister about the fuel crisis but politicians like medical men must learn to keep their counsel and he found himself talking instead about the restarting of international football then lord cazalay reappeared and said fred i must tear sir graham away theres someone else id particularly like him to have a word with as graham allowed himself to be led across the room lord cazalay asked isnt liz coming i thought you were giving us the pleasure of looking at her shes meeting me here the curtain at her show doesnt ring down till after ten thats splendid news graham this is arthur king a very close friend of mine arthur king struck graham as resembling a worried ferret he was a youngish man certainly not over thirty with thinning fair hair and sidewhiskers he wore a smart blue doublebreasted suit with overemphasis on the lapels a dark striped shirt and a plain grey tie with a diamond pin stuck in it his green eyes had an expression of continual anxiety in them and if he had ever learned to smile he seemed to have forgotten the knack pleased to meet you said arthur king of course youll know all about sir grahams work in the war lord cazalay said affably yes i read about it in the papers he inspected graham anxiously you fixed all them pilots up with new faces didnt you must be a clever feller graham nodded to have his work praised by a minister of the crown was one thing approbation from a man who might have left his fruitbarrow at the door was less welcome still he told himself society was changing you had to take people as they came if you played the snob you got nowhere youll remember arthur that sir graham has an interest in our travel business smart lad going like a bomb that little company its only the beginning mind once these bloody restrictions come off the marketll be wide open i hope ill see something back for my money said graham for the sake of making conversation it isnt much fun paying it all away in taxes oh taxes said arthur king contemptuously theres another little idea of ours shall we tell him charles television said lord cazalay theres not much future in that surely graham looked surprised nobody will be able to afford the sets another ten years and therell be one in every home said arthur king confidently just like the toilet grahams instruction in the mysteries of commerce was interrupted by the arrival of liz liz was an actress not a particularly wellknown oneindeed discovery of her name generally called for a fairly close reading of the programme she was in one of the postwar revues with a small part which hardly justified her style of living she had an enviable knack of getting to know the people who mattered and an even more valuable one of dropping them before they ceased to she was a big woman redhaired with enormous teeth graham supposed she must be well past forty he had met her a few weeks before in the dressingroom of an actor whose noble features had illuminated the musicalcomedy stage for some decades and now with his assistance seemed likely to continue lightening it for some decades more graham had begun to move among theatrical people even adopting some of their little affectations it pleased him to see himself as part of their scene to understand their momentously whispered trivial gossip he found liz heavy going but a man must have a companion and he was never one to play the monk graham darling how wonderful liz embraced him warmly simultaneously managing to take a glass from her host and arthur bless you how nice thank you so much for all those lovely nylons you are clever theyre divine glad you liked them said arthur briefly graham tell me all youve been up to she invited though they had parted less than fortyeight hours before i went to a party with a lot of my old patients those poor boys they must look so peculiar all together they do but theyve given up thinking about it which was the object of the exercise how on earth could they manage to give up thinking about themselves i should feel dreadful quite an outcast if i had the merest scar they manage it because i always made the effort of having people treat them like normal human beings not as something out of a circus liz gave a faint smile he looked in danger of being serious again he really was a dreadful bore when he got serious if he went on mixing with all these awful deformed creatures he really shouldnt bother everyone by insisting on talking about them in quite repulsive detail lets go and grab something to eat liz suggested i think theyve even got lobster after ten minutes she said to him you are grumpy tonight i must say whats the matter oh nothing an uneasiness had settled on him these people really were rather dreadful he told himself though why should he complain there was wine lobster and bright company all hard to come by shall we go on he asked her abruptly to a nightclub or somewhere but darling ive only just arrived im feeling restless oh all right then you do carry on peculiarly sometimes darling dont you yes i know i do very peculiarly all my life its a bit late in the day to change my habits im afraid i see youre in your interesting mood she told him it was too bad but she had to put up with it he seemed very wealthy the nightclub like a dozen others sprouting after the war was in a basement near piccadilly graham signed an order for a bottle of gin which was supposed to be sealed and reproduced at the guests next visit but somehow never was there was a rumba band and they danced for a few minutes on the overcrowded floor lets go home said graham this place is suffocating darling whats wrong with you tonight you can hardly wait to get at it youre right i cant i feel like it i dont know she laughed youre worse than any of the young ones the young ones dont need consoling she ruffled the hair in the nape of his neck which he was allowing to grow rather long what do you need consoling about youve got everything ive got nothing nothing that counts now you are being interesting i cant see anything you lack a human being the most precious commodity of all what about me arent i human shall we go oh all right darling though dont rush at me like a bull when we get in will you when they reached the flat she insisted on taking her time to put him in his place cant we have a drink yes of course as he poured out the gin she took a cigarette and remarked thats a pretty picture yes it is pretty thats its trouble theres no feeling underneath who did it i did before the war really she looked surprised i didnt know you were an artist i mean apart from making people faces i suppose thats much the same thing isnt it i am an artist rather than a surgeon i am an artist obliged to conform with the discipline of a surgeons life that doesnt seem to worry you she laughed it does quite often for most of my life ive fought against the rigidity and stuffiness of the medical profession now im not so sure its rewarding being set apart being someone special even if its only through your own rules many of which can be extremely silly i suppose it was the war which changed my mind though i didnt realize it at the time please darling dont go on about the war again im sorry im really trying to forget it but it keeps coming back more and more he sipped his drink and reflected it was really the only worthwhile time in my life out at that annex place she stubbed out her fresh cigarette come along darling shall we get on with it she invited anything to stop him talking about the war graham had taken to copulating with the light on he found it more amusing and anyway had read somewhere that turning out the light was a suburban habit liz possibly worn out by her exertions on the stage fell asleep almost immediately afterwards he lay for a long time looking up at the ceiling she really was a ghastly female she was fat and her breasts fell away to the sides of her chest like a pair of halffilled sandbags still she had a kind heart and she was always available valuable and infrequent attributes in any female he would be generous writing her cheque in the morning he must have been rather difficult to tolerate that evening his life was all wrong all completely wrong but he didnt see much prospect of setting it right even if he had the remotest idea what the right sort of life for himself should be the same evening desmond trevose was entertaining his cousin alec to dinner at high table in his cambridge college desmond had spent six months at smithers botham as mr twelvetrees housesurgeon and a further year as his registrar which substituted for service in the thinning ranks of the army he was a good housesurgeon competent and thoughtful skilful enough with his hands as assistant in the theatre but he was not really a success he was too cold too brusque with the patients he had no sense of human relationships this was admittedly not a necessity for the effective or even successful medical man many renowned surgeons have been abominably rude others like mr cramphorn regarded hospital patients as simpleminded supplicants unable to grasp such intellectual matters as the nature of the disease which irked them which having a latin name could only be discussed if at all by educated gentlemen but the mood of the patients like the mood of the nation was becoming restless with smug authority medicine had advanced during the war as strikingly as aeronautics the hospital doctor found himself turning into an applied scientist yet the more he could do for his patients the less they seemed to regard him it was baffling not only for mr cramphorn but the patients were only daring to express what they had expected from their medical attendants all alongto be their friend in health their ally in sickness and their companion in death a relationship previously accorded only to those among them with a fee in their pockets early in desmond applied for a research scholarship at his old college to study anatomy it was in the blood the synovial membranes the anatomical thesis by his grandfather the professor published in the year of desmonds birth lay on the desk in his college rooms the old boy had a few sound ideas desmond decided though the bulk of the book was nonsense but the synovial membranes lining the joints of the body might be worth a second look and he had decided to spend a year taking it he had asked alec to dinner through no feelings of duty or affection after living with him for a year in the medical officers mess at smithers botham desmond had allowed the lifelong tepidity of his feelings towards his cousin to cool into frosty dislike but having him up for the night seemed the only way to pin him down desmond wanted his money back and alec showed reluctance even to discuss such ungentlemanly a subject i hope you wont find that guest room too chilly said desmond standing before dinner amid the beams of his own sittingroom did my gyp light a fire i expect hell give you a hotwater bottle dont i need a gown or something guests at dinner arent required to wear them desmond told him solemnly what have you got there gin alec produced the bottle from inside his jacket a brand ive never heard of its probably full of methyl alcohol enough to turn you blind not to worry i was damn lucky to get it i thought it would be an acceptable present id rather not risk it if you dont mind said desmond warily ive got some reasonable college sherry you wont mind if i drink the stuff alec had brought the bottle only with this intention desmond was a mean host do you remember the trouble we had buying booze at smithers botham that ghastly grocer with his wine counter alec poured half a tumbler of gin which he started to sip neat it was a kindly act of god which landed him on us with a strangulated hernia afterwards i believe he genuinely tried to do his best for his medical customers he was dead scared he might find himself in our hands again everyone drank far too much at smithers botham you know i loved the place a lot of people were browned off with it but not me i suppose it was because you could get away with anything no stuffiness do you remember that party when some fellow kept insisting on lighting his own flatus with a match it was quite sensational amused the girls terribly arent you drinking rather a lot yourself alec i expect im an alcoholic my present employment is enough to make me one alec had left smithers botham for a hospital in the north of england where he was anaesthetic registrar its a ghastly hole the towns all trains they seem to go clanking and hooting everywhere into tunnels across viaducts holding up all the traffic at level crossings the hospitals dreadful not a gentleman in the place all the residents are irishmen indians scotsmen those sort of people no intellectual conversation anyway drinking seems to do my asthma good desmond put his hands behind his back and pursed his lips i thought you might have given conventional treatment a chance first but i did alec finished his gin and poured himself another desmond began to feel worried his cousin had become dreadfully unreliable socially and it would never do upsetting the dignity of the dons dining table i was skintested and they told me i was allergic to grassescrested dogstail sheeps fescue birds foot trefoil whoever could imagine things with such lovely names doing anyone the slightest harm its ridiculous thats not a very reasonable attitude towards medicine is it well medicines only a branch of zoology we mustnt take ourselves too seriously but i let them fill me up with grass extracts they didnt do the slightest good did you know i went to a psychiatrist at smithers botham there was a rumour to that effect desmond gave a faint smile nobody seemed to think it particularly surprising of course i kept quiet about it for a blackfriars houseman visiting a psychiatrist would be far more shameful than visiting a prostitute i went to see old dency he said i suffered from haltlosigkeit desmond frowned it means an irresponsible aimless personality with no perseverance no willpower no concentration and no particular interests an optimistic hysteric who lives for the present and refuses to learn from experience i looked it all up possibly hes right its apparently due to maternal overindulgence in early childhood how is your mother desmond asked she seems happy enough in the states i suppose its nice to warm your feet on the small of a mans back again even at her age and even with a cold fish like her husband i always thought americans noisy and funloving like the ones we used to see lounging about piccadilly and spitting on the pavement shes a peculiar woman my mother its odd the particular severity one judges ones parents with as one grows up must be fundamental some species eat theirs dency looked after your mother didnt he desmond nodded he supposed the reminder was vaguely illintentioned do you think hes a pansy alec asked he kept patting me like the geography master at school hes got a certain effeminacy of manner admitted desmond awkwardly homosexuality was not a subject to be mentioned even in private are you a pansy desmond desmond went red how dare you ask such a thing ive often wondered youre not particularly interested in girls i dont believe youve ever had one have you even at a smithers botham party where maidenheads popped like the balloons i can hardly afford to get involved with women said desmond defensively ill be here for a year maybe two hardly paid at all only my keep and an honorarium i cant expect to sponge on my father at my age you asked me here to get your money back didnt you yes said desmond you havent got a hope old cock desmond stuck his hands in his pockets and asked angrily why dont you make some attempt to behave honourably about it its a debt its on paper youd never have qualified at all without it in good time all in good time said alec amiably at the moment ive rather a lot of expenses im going to get married desmond stared at him to felicity only daughter of air marshal sir giles perrins kcb dso dfg and bar very grand you see i dont believe you come desmond the only asset ive got is a strange sex appeal dont deny me that i still dont believe you how on earth would you meet her at some sort of social to do with my present hospital she was a waaf i asked her and she said yes remarkably straightforward im seeing her in town tomorrow shes just been demobbed desmond digested this what can i say i hope youll be very happy thank you a bell started to ring desmond picked up his gown its time for hall so you see desmond i shall shortly be in a position to pay you off i should imagine the dowry will be considerable theyre stinking rich for the moment patience as alec reached for his ginbottle again desmond said testily you havent time for another but i must desmond i must i have a pathological fear of meeting strangers dont worry i shant be sick into the soup or anything like that alec was not sick into the soup but he broke a wine glass talked continuously and extremely loudly and told obscene stories desmond recognized his invitation as a terrible mistake he wondered for the first time if his cousin really were a psychopath a manicdepressive something like that he certainly suffered the most alarming swings of mood at other times he could be solitary silent gloomy and savage the only course was to get him safely to bed in the colleges guestroom further discussion about the money must wait until the morning but in the morning alec had gone he woke in the dark had no notion of the time found his watch was stopped and felt possessed with the idea of going down to london the college porter let him out and he started his car he hadnt even shaved it was light when he reached felicitys house in chelsea there were few people about he remembered it was sunday he rang the bell nothing happened he stood back from the door and started to shout a grizzled head appeared at an upstairs window he recognized air marshal sir giles perrins kcb dso dfc and bar what the hell do you think youre up to demanded the householder ive come to see felicity oh its you well clear off neither felicity nor anyone here wants to set eyes on you again i demand to see my future wife for gods sake man get away will you you know perfectly well my daughter wishes to have nothing whatever to do with you felicity agreed to marry me please please be reasonable youre just causing trouble for yourself and all of us felicity never said anything of the kind you know that as well as i do youre deliberately keeping her from me do go away theres a good chap youre disturbing the neighbourhood its terribly early i demand admittance oh clear off you stupid little bastard how dare you speak to me like that i am a healer i demand the respect to which i am entitled there was a milkbottle on the step alec picked it up and threw it into the closed downstairs window he thought the crash sounded very satisfactory the rest of his morning was confused there were policemen the air marshal even felicity in the background in her dressinggown people kept holding him down they were persecuting him terribly they wouldnt listen however much he tried to explain there was another man very worried he was a doctor he explained now calm down old man calm down he implored look what a mess youve made of this sittingroom i didnt make the mess alec protested violently they made it theyre trying to discredit me its all a plot whats that he demanded its only a syringe i think youd benefit from a sedative youre trying to poison me no im not youll recognize the need for it yourself when you recover recover im not ill everyones against me oh god everyones always against me alec suddenly felt he couldnt be bothered with these unpleasant persons any longer drowsiness overcame him hed had a tiring few hours he had to agree people seemed to be moving him he let them have their way hed let them persecute him hed lost the will to resist he was lying on his back moving along in something a car surely not an ambulance he wasnt in the slightest ill he was still on his back in the fresh air again his surroundings struck him as familiar the flat dome the smokebelching minarets the magnificent portico smithers botham they wheeled him to the block which had quartered the emergency squad one of the first sections of the hospital returned to rightful use hello alec he looked up it was dr dency long fingers playing with the little gold bars of his watchchain as usual dont worry alec well look after you youll be all right here home again said alec simply yes i always liked this place im sorry im late graham apologized i had to go out to smithers botham my nephew alec was admitted there yesterday im sorry to hear that said haileybury nothing serious i hope no not too alarming hes in the psychiatric block as a voluntary patient dencys looking after him alecs landed himself in a bit of trouble hes been behaving rather oddly recently i must say i expect theyll get him straightened out i gather theyve some new drugs coming in for this manicdepressive business which should help the poor fellow nevertheless it must be very disturbing for you it is graham sat down i thought we had enough mental illness in the family with my wife god knows where alec inherited it from though his father could be peculiar enough when he liked missionary or not there were one or two stories about him i shouldnt care to repeat no no of course not said haileybury hastily anyway every familys got one or two mad ones in it if you look closely enough not that alecs certifiable anything like that he just needs watching for a while hes grown into a peculiar young man all round and im more or less responsible for him with his mother in america at least i promised her as much shes a pleasant woman youve never met her haileybury gave a faint smile indeed i have graham you seem to forget she was our secretary at the plastic hospital near ramsgate in graham laughed i could be forgiven for the lapse surely water has poured over the dam with frightening speed since then then youll also remember i was having a violent love affair with her at the time i dont think we need go into that now said haileybury amiably hes mellowing pleasantly with the years graham thought in those days of faroff passion he tried to lose me my first chance of a decent job over it he isnt a bad fellow really at least he isnt a hypocrite as most doctors are obliged to behalf the time for the good of their patients and the other half for the good of themselves what can i do for you eric he asked they were sitting in haileyburys club in the same corner of the morningroom as at the beginning of the war haileybury was wearing his usual plain blue suit graham could never remember him in anything else it was early evening and haileybury signalled the club waiter to buy graham a drink for the second time in his life i gather you met butcher the other evening haileybury asked i bumped into him at a party i also gather he said something to you about my scheme for a national burns unit graham nodded would you like to hear more about it if you dont if you think it might bore you if its a notion you couldnt feel interested in do please say so well just drop the subject have a gossip instead i shant be in the slightest offended ive talked about it to so many people i cant expect all of them to share my enthusiasm i should be very interested indeed i suppose i must by now have handled more burns than most people haileybury nodded slowly to grahams surprise he produced a briefcase and laid it on the table a man like haileybury would not encumber himself with a showy accessory unless he felt most strongly about its contents haileybury extracted some papers these are my ideas reduced to writing you may like to take them and study them at leisure graham found himself with a thick bundle of closely typed foolscap since i first talked to butcher i have raised my sights somewhat with the government the more you ask for the more you get i see it as a centre devoted to the surgery of accidents in its widest sense motor accidents accidents in the home industrial accidents this last i think gives me the most confidence of success it strongly appeals to the tradeunion element in the government nobodys really bothered to specialize in the surgery of industry before to my mind the need is just as pressing as specializing in the surgery of war im sure youre right i understand that bevan himself is very keen on the idea but whens it all going to materialize graham asked after all the governments already committed to taking the profession by the ears and shaking it out of all recognition in the next few months its supposed to be building health centres everywhere like luxury cinemas its got half the hospitals in the country damaged by airraids and the other half falling to bits anyway when are they going to create your shining new palace im sure the idea will come to something one fine day eric but im afraid you and nye bevan and i shant be here to attend the opening ceremony it already exists said haileybury quietly the waiter brought their drinks as he retired haileybury added it exists less than twenty miles from where we are sitting to be precise near iver in buckinghamshire extremely convenient for london graham frowned he couldnt recall such a place has some genie waved the magic wand no but the americans have they built a hospital there during the war it took them i believe a matter of some weeks they are not a people for procrastination now the americans are going home the building stands there stripped and empty there seems no obstacle to our taking it over it is a perfectly adequate structure singlestorey wards room for five hundred beds the design of the operating theatres is quite remarkable there are one or two peculiar featuresa sodafountain for instancewhich can easily be removed i gather the price will be nominal particularly if we call it the franklin d roosevelt hospital something of that nature that sounds a pleasant windfall said graham thoughtfully what would you want me to do serve on some committee to raise funds for the equipment i would want you to head the staff graham looked up he had imagined that haileyburys interest in the hospital came at least partly from the glory of running it himself but what about you haileybury shrugged his shoulders you would be the better man arent you rather carrying modesty to extremes graham found himself faintly irritated by haileyburys honesty it was something of an affront youre the one whos preached for years that plastic surgery was essentially the surgery of repair as for me im a beautydoctor a facefaker and that if i may say so is a rather overmodest view of your work during the war i thought you imagined my work during the war was grabbing publicity i did imagine it at the time haileybury told him frankly but i was wrong i didnt understand the importance of the cosmetic work you were doing i make all the apologies you feel you deserve it was difficult confined to administrative tasks i was too far from individual patients i came to appreciate only late in the war how much you did for morale he tapped the table with his long forefinger and that is what we need in this new place of mine someone to make plain that those mutilated by the hazards of peace can be treated as effectively as those mutilated by the hazards of war but eric this is an enormous job youre asking me to take on therere all manner of questions for me to decide first at least the financial question will decide itself as director you would draw the appropriate consultants salary in the new health service plus a merit award doubtiess if that part of the scheme goes through but what time have i for such responsibilities dont forget ive a busy private practice i regret that private practice would not enter into it the post would be fulltime you know how strongly the government feels on such points then im afraid its out of the question do you know graham its the second time you have used that expression to me sitting exactly in this spot graham smiled im sorry i much appreciate the honour youve paid me but i must look to my own interests ive landed myself with a hell of a lot of debts to be paid off somehow before im too old to work at all id love to accept eric the ideas got tremendous attraction it would be like the annex all over again but im afraid its just not on last time i made the mistake of pressing you for a decision i shall not repeat it there is plenty of timemonths perhaps a year perhaps two any moment you feel inclined to discuss the matter further lift a telephone will you promise very well graham told him amicably ill keep it constantly before me should i undergo a change of heart youll hear at once excellent now let us drop the subject and talk about something else very sad dont you think graham the prospects for the coming county cricket season graham quickly put the offer out of mind a salaried post he decided would be far more suitable for a man of modest tastes like haileybury himself but even haileybury indulged in a little private practice he did operations every saturday morning in a small hospital near the crystal palace which during the war had somehow fallen under the domination of his own in london king alfreds and afterwards never escaped it had few private beds the theatres were antiquated but the nursing was sound and the general atmosphere haileybury found agreeably modest john bickley was a consultant to the hospital and generally gave haileyburys anaesthetics though regretting that haileybury didnt take the same wide view of operating fees as graham the following saturday as haileybury was finishing the repair of a childs cleft palate he observed to john i saw trevose the other day yes i ran into him only last week he seems to be doing as well as ever hes full of bounce certainly with trevose that generally indicates a stuffed wallet did you think him cheerful i felt he was rather miserable with himself haileybury inserted the final stitches in the childs mouth hes a man of moods he observed drily and that nephew of his has gone off his head john frowned under his surgical cap alec was my junior assistant he was something of a queer fish i must say that goes for all the trevose family doesnt it they dont make life easy for themselves perhaps youre right john disconnected the long corrugated rubber tube of his anaesthetic apparatus alecs mother will be upset she had high hopes for him saw him as a second horder i believe well he might achieve it yet some of our most eminent breathren have been somewhat unbalanced its a matter of survival until they reach the position where nobody dare mention it john removed the throatpack and the thin wirestiffened armoured magill tube from the childs windpipe i think ill go back to the ward with this one all is well i trust asked haileybury sharply yes perfectly but you can never be sure of anything at all in this game in the childrens ward at the end of the corridor he passed his patient to the care of the staffnurse and asked wheres sister in her office dr bickley john knocked on the door by the ward entrance and went in clare mills looked up from her desk hello she smiled quite a stranger i was bringing back that palate he popped a cigarette over his sagging mask and lit it i had a chat with graham last saturday night clare raised her eyebrows at first she said nothing but moved some notes on her desk and how is he hes wearing well and he seemed to be enjoying life or trying to convince himself that he was im glad hes all right do you ever hear from him oh no i would never have expected that not with graham he didnt mention you at all john volunteered i wouldnt have expected that either once anyones left his orbit he likes to cut them out completely to forget about them as though theyd never existed even you who tried to save him from himself i wasnt conscious of doing so at the time but i suppose thats true its all part of his selfishness i suppose rejecting even those whove helped him once theyre no more use i dont think so not entirely we can understand his trying to spare himself the pain of sad memories he inflicts enough on himself anyway he doesnt know where i am she added more briskly he doesnt even know if im still in the country do you want to see him again she looked at him hard for a moment and said whats the point john nodded understandingly and asked have you any plansfor getting married that sort of thing anyone in mind i hope you dont mind my asking clare ive come to feel something of an uncle to you she smiled again a very useful uncle you found me this job i felt i wanted to do something for you if you remember we were both suffering from the trevose temperament rather severely at the time perhaps it was all something to do with warweariness you havent answered my question no i havent anyone in mind i dont suppose i shall ive got my work at which youre extremely efficient thank you everyone regards me as a dedicated and completely sexless ward sister therere plenty of them about the backbone of any hospital the whole system would fall to bits without such women when i was in training i often wondered exactly what created them now i know that sounds a gloomy prognosis for yourself perhaps someone will turn up you never know otherwise i shall sister on until im pensioned off and go to live in a seaside boardinghouse but dont you bear any resentment towards graham how can one bear any resentment towards a maladjusted child i daresay youre right john told her the government was out of luck the worst snowfall of the century was followed by the worst floods that could be remembered at all the cascade began in the middle of march the rivers spilt disastrously across the countryside swamping the roads and railways drowning the sheep ruining the potato crop and countless carpets two years after victory the people who had given blood toil tears and sweat were left standing in queues holding damp rationbooks the postwar disgruntlement which affected everyone began to depress graham he was starting to confess himself bored and disgusted with his brotherinlaw and his cronies the girl liz was really a shocking creature though he felt disinclined to ditch her with no replacement in sight perhaps there never would be he reflected he was becoming a shade elderly to play the rake he would have liked to stay at the villa after sheila raleigh came home he craved for luxury and sunshine but he had too much private work in london there seemed to be a dammedup demand for plastic surgery as for other prewar luxuries like chocolates and cars and plastic surgery was readily obtainable for your money and at least he reflected he passed most of his time in hospitals and nursing homes where it was warm and there was plenty of hot water he was still living alone and trying to reconcile himself to it to make his evenings more bearable he started to write a textbook on the surgery of burns he had never written much before though he felt that if he could paint he was equipped with the right sort of mental muscles for selfexpression he turned out a trunkful of notes from the annex sorted them into bundles and started work with his portable typewriter progress was slow as he read his scribbled pages he found himself drawn back to the atmosphere of the bungalow where he had jotted most of them down he found the composition becoming dominated by clare he remembered exactly what she was saying or doing when he had drawn up some particular account of a patient or an operation it disturbed him he had thought about her often enough since they separated but he told himself she was in the past finished and done with like edith he determined to put her resolutely out of his mind it was the only way anyway if he didnt the book would never be finished he was working alone one evening towards the end of march when the telephone rang it was lord cazalay i say graham are you still at home we were expecting you tonight im sorry but i couldnt make it another one of his damn parties didnt you get the message i asked the clinic to phone you some signal got through to me but i didnt take it seriously lord cazalay sounded offended you remember you particularly promised to come ive got an urgent case coming in im afraid youll have to excuse me this pretext being unanswerable lord cazalay added i wonder if i could have a word with you fairly soon its a matter of some importance graham gave a grunt he probably wants more money out of me he thought money is the only matter of importance that he knows im dreadfully booked up this week charles professionally surely you can spare a moment its rather pressing how about lunch tomorrow at my club its a miserable confession but my lunch is always a sandwich between cases cant i call tomorrow evening about seven all right ill make a point of being here graham told him giving in im much obliged by the way youll make sure were undisturbed i take it its extremely confidential im nearly always on my own graham assured him in the next mornings paper he saw that fred butcher had resigned from the government he wondered why he had seemed from brief acquaintance a likeable downtoearth sort of fellow he couldnt be bothered to read the story running down the column politics was a bore and the newspapers only made tip fairystories when someone mentioned the incident in the theatre of the cavendish clinic during grahams first case he said yes i met the chap the other day seemed a very solid citizen did you asked his young assistant looking up whats the matter graham was surprised at the tone is he in disgrace or something i supposed hed resigned on some lofty point of political principle reading between the lines hes in the cart something very peculiar about army contracts a number of old army wireless sets seem to have gone sadly astray who on earth would want an old army wireless set people want anything these days in germany you could refurnish your house with a few hundred cigarettes i suppose so said graham sombrely everyone seems to be on the make theres a spiv in all of us lord cazalay arrived promptly at seven with him was the ferretfaced arthur graham invited them in cordially if they had some proposition for him he had already decided to reject it but at least he could politely offer them a whisky after all it had come via lord cazalay for a while lord cazalay talked about the obstacles to making money in the postwar world a subject he seemed inclined to leave with more impatience than usual arthur sat sipping whisky nervously and said nothing after a few minutes lord cazalay declared graham ive found you a new patient he inclined his head arthur here graham looked at the ferrety man with mild interest whats the trouble he asked id like you to fix my face up sir graham but you havent any scars or blemishes that i can see id just like you to change it a bit like you did to the pilots during the war lord cazalay gave a harsh laugh plenty of room for improvement eh graham graham put his fingertips together and gave the proffered features a more careful inspection it wasnt a bad face the nose was too pointed and the jaw underslung but not to the point of unsightliness but he appreciated even if he still never understood the psychological forces urging patients towards him a crooked nose or a dropping eyelid passing more or less unnoticed by the world could incite any amount of selftorture he remembered a youth during the war with a leg withered from polio all the frustrations of his life were ascribed to his leg he implored one of the general surgeons to chop it off to cast it from his life altogether replace it with one of the splendid artificial ones they were designing for the wounded the surgeon obliged six months later the young man committed suicide we must all find something to blame graham thought even if its a bit of ourselves of course you realize that a cosmetic operation like any operation carries a risk graham explained as he did to every patient arthur nodded nor is it free from pain and bother some can be distinctly uncomfortable for weeks afterwards and even i cant guarantee a perfectly successful result the bill will be rather painful too i fancy said lord cazalay laughing again i wouldnt conceal that either said graham youd be looked after sir graham arthur assured him solemnly rely on me for that as this is turning into a consultation ill have to ask you to leave us charles graham explained to his brotherinlaw its rather irregular to conduct one with an audience arthur looked at graham imploringly and asked cant he stay hes a friend oh very well if you wish graham conceded testily in what particular way do you want your appearance changed i just want it changed im not fussy graham frowned but whats the object what is it that distresses you about your looks i want it changed for business reasons graham looked at lord cazalay whats going on graham do you have to ask so many questions graham paused im sorry mr king but im afraid i cant take you as my patient lord cazalay glared angrily look here graham youre being ridiculous i apologize if it strikes you that way but i couldnt possibly operate on a patient without satisfying myself over the reasons some of them are pretty obscure admittedly but at least they hold water im inclined to think theres something behind all this id prefer not to ask about it therere plenty of other plastic surgeons in london you can always try your luck elsewhere lord cazalay brushed his moustache im sorry youre being so uncooperative perhaps youll think again why dont we tell him the truth suggested arthur as if struck by a novel thought as lord cazalay made no reply he went on look sir grahamim in a bit of trouble were all in a bit of trouble muttered lord cazalay you saw in the papers this morning about fred butcher arthur continued its the beginning of something people have been nosing about where they shouldnt making trouble mind ive always acted in good faith always but youve got to cut a few corners these days ill have to lie low for a bit i thought if you changed my face it would all be a bit easier to avoid the publicity graham sat staring at him you mean youre a crook and you want me to alter your appearance to escape your just deserts as neither visitor said anything he continued well i shant play the outraged citizen ive had a few requests of a similar nature in my time ill only tell you the whole idea is reprehensible and ask you to leave at once ill make it well worth your while honest i will arthur repeated hopefully graham got up you could never do that mr king just a moment lord cazalay interrupted were none of us shining with innocence you seem to have forgotten the few favours ive done you that foreign currency for your villa it would look pretty nasty if it came into court wouldnt it theyd hand out a stiff sentence for a fiddle on that scale youd go to jail wouldnt you and your medical authorities would have a few words to say about the matter too theyd hardly let you go on practising after that you mean youre blackmailing me demanded graham blackmail i dont know what that means business is run on a system of favours done and granted persuasion is necessary from time to time get out im not going to let you take this highandmighty line lord cazalay continued more confidently for your own good graham you wont do yourself any harm tidying up arthur you get dozens of people coming to have their faces altered you said so yourself you arent to know hes in any trouble not yet in a week or two itll be a different matter youre going to do this my boy im not given to idle threats youve known my family long enough to realize that we get what we want either you do something for arthur or the details of your little currency transactions end up on the desk of the director of public prosecutions get out graham repeated no i shant get out sit down and think it over ill give you five minutes graham was startled how old denise looked then he remembered she had been ill as she opened the front door she stared at him with surprise quickly trying to find a smile could i see john graham asked at once the clinic told me hed gone home yes of course graham come in how are you keeping oh pretty well the weathers ghastly isnt it yes ghastly and all this dreadful austerity were supposed to put up with yes yes said graham he came into the cold hall of the bickleys flat overlooking regents park it was barely an hour since his confrontation with lord cazalay john was in the sittingroom reading the evening paper and tickling the dog he stood up as graham entered saying amiably enough an unexpected pleasure or have you come for a contribution towards the damage the boys did to that restaurant i wont stay a moment still in his overcoat graham looked pointedly at denise would you like a cup of coffee or something she asked with great reluctance please that would be very kind as the door shut he turned to john and said i wonder if youd stuff a case for me tomorrow morning john knocked his pipe on the fireplace i expect i could squeeze it in if its early enough has everyone else let you down its a special case graham hesitated it calls for a great deal of discretion im going to do it at that little nursinghome place out at ealing graham john laughed dont tell me youre branching into the abortion racket seeing grahams troubled expression he added seriously but what is it some actress with a secret scar stella garrod all over again oh its a much nastier business than the stella garrod affair ive got myself in a bit of a mess john raised his eyebrows hardly the first time at grahams age he really should start to learn perhaps clare was right about the maladjusted child a woman you mean no not this time graham explained about arthur king i see said john calmly when he had finished so youre going to do the case ive no alternative have i i was a fool having anything to do with that cazalay bastard he tried to bring me down once before this time hes going to make a proper job of it but if you do it and the fact comes out in the papers its going to look pretty nasty for you perhaps nothing will come out these things generally do graham looked more uneasy and said it isnt the first time you know before the war i did a couple of patients like this i had my doubts about them but didnt delve very deeply i just blinded myself to the fact they were a pair of crooks i was disgusted at myself afterwards i dont want to repeat the experience quite apart from risking my neck but if i dontwhy the hell did i buy that villa anyway ive never had a chance to use it i dont think i can really give the anaesthetic for you graham no i didnt expect you would it was selfish of me to ask i wanted the moral support i think thats all ill see what i can do under local probably i can manage more than i expect we get spoiled with good general anaesthetics always available from experts like you some of our more unfortunate brethren manage to run a flourishing practice in cosmetic work under locals the ones who get themselves struck off for advertising wont you take my advice and not touch this case graham you mean to substitute the certainty of trouble with the law for the possibility its two sorts of trouble the operation would spoil everything you gained for yourself during the war what did i gain a knighthood for services to publicity you know thats not true not completely so perhaps but its near enough to the mark i was speaking to clare about you two or three weeks ago john remarked unexpectedly graham looked at him sharply i thought shed disappeared off the face of the earth shes at the kenworth childrens ward sister i do a list there once a week graham made a wry expression how is she very well she likes her job john paused and added do you want to see her again shed hardly want to set eyes on me graham told him impatiently im certain she would no thats ridiculous not after the way i treated her is it ridiculous youd know youve had more experience of women than me graham stuck his hands in his trouser pockets and started pacing the room everythings wrong isnt it you see things differently as you go through life and often enough you realize all the time youve been seeing them wrong when i was young i could view the way ahead and i tramped up it not caring overmuch how i muddied my boots things didnt go all that smoothlymaria all that fuss but i got where i wanted in the war i didnt really want anything for myself and i was happy now im trying to worship my old gods but they dont represent anything any more theyre like native idols discovered in some jungle incomprehensible frightening to look at make you wonder at the simplicity of the people who venerated them id got no proper sense of values the war imposed one on me graham youre making yourself sound a horrible type smiled john well i am though lets hope its not because i cant help it but because i try to be because you think its smart graham shrugged i cant even contemplate meeting clare again not at this particular crisis in my life she might be glad to help you she did during several others i suppose she loved me you loved her surely deep down i told myself i didnt it was the same with every woman ive got mixed up with i never wanted to give myself to them completely at the age when you can face these things its too late to rectify them denise appeared with the coffee graham wanted to discuss a case hes doing tomorrow darling john explained im not doing it said graham briefly ive decided its inoperable hed forgotten about denise and her coffee he then had to sit down and make conversation of some sort while he drank it and she always made dreadful coffee anyway haileybury had hardly shaved when graham arrived the next morning at his house in richmond his sister who had seen six years service in the ats had returned to offer the same dutiful devotion to her brother as to her king she showed graham in to the cold sittingroom which was filled with models of railway engines graham sat in his overcoat looking at them in puzzlement he supposed haileybury had constructed them all with his own hands a strange secret for a man to have im sorry to keep you waiting graham haileybury appeared in his usual blue suit and im sorry to have telephoned for an appointment so early but i have some news i have decided to accept your kind offer of a job haileybury inclined his head silently that is good news indeed it is all i will say but i think you will understand how i feel the new project is very near to my heart on one condition im sure any reasonable condition can easily be met i dont know if this one can the condition is that i stay out of jail haileybury looked at him blankly wondering if he were joking ive been involved in some currency deals about five thousand pounds worth of french francs if it comes to light ive had it ive reason to expect it might haileybury put the tips of his fingers together and blew on them the noise still irritated graham i see its all mixed up with cazalay and your unfortunate friend fred butcher you know a fine rumpus is blowing up i see haileybury repeated of course the very fact ive misbehaved might be enough for you to withdraw your offer id quite understand that could you explain the details i gave cazalay a cheque for five thousand pounds and he gave me the francs he wants me to do a job on one of his little crooks to stop the police recognizing him i wont its as simple as that so cazalay will cook my goose but what on earth were you doing with all this foreign money oh i havent it hidden in a biscuittin bricked up in the chimney anything like that i never actually handled it cazalay bought me a house in france i see said haileybury again graham rose thats the situation eric if i dont land in abject disgrace over the next few weeks i presume youll take me on haileybury made an accommodating gesture im only sorry you should find yourself in such a predicament it isnt my first graham told him but whichever way it goes it will be my last he couldnt face operating or seeing patients he rang smithers botham and a couple of nursinghomes putting his days work off excusing himself with illness he walked the shabby streets of london hardly noticing where his feet took him he found himself in piccadilly not far from half moon street and turned towards the cazalay familys old town house a hole in the ground as he started walking northwards the rain began to fall it was the same route he had taken thirty years before tramping home through a thunderstorm to his fathers home in hampstead after he had first met maria on that walk he had decided three thingsto become a plastic surgeon to grow rich and more immediately to ditch his fianc–πe edith he had done all three and ended up with nothing but the prospect of prison he plodded on it wasnt so easy to walk these days well your arteries and joints had to grow stiff some time it was inevitable at least you were saved the effort of struggling against it as hed had to struggle against tuberculosis in his youth he decided to make for the house in hampstead it was still standing but horribly dilapidated it had been turned into flats before the war now there seemed to be a dozen families living in it with washing forgotten and soaking in the front garden the professor would hardly have countenanced that graham told himself he wondered what his father would have to say of his misdeeds personal and professional perhaps the old boy would have the chance to give him a celestial wigging soon he had rather let down the family even the pissprophet didnt get himself locked up he looked at his watch and was surprised to find it almost six in the evening he made for hampstead tube station where he bought an evening paper the storm had broken the police were looking for arthur and for lord cazalay neither of whom could be found graham wondered if cazalay had gone to venezuela too but the stop press revealed he had gone no farther than newhaven where he was assisting the police with their enquiries graham stuffed the paper in his overcoat pocket he would have to face the music and the grisly concert had begun in the hallway of his block of flats a woman approached him graham im sorry to sit on your doorstep but ive been trying to get you all day theres something terribly important you really ought to know graham recognized sheila raleigh she must have just returned from france i must apologize he told her absently ive had rather a lot of things occupying me its about the annex club i suppose no it isnt she looked round could we have a moment alone yes of course they said nothing until he let her into his flat he felt she had chosen a damn inconsiderate moment to call i hope youre liking the job yes its wonderful i cant thank you enough particularly after i said such bitter things to you once i deserved them no you didnt but you can understand how i felt at the time i had to blame someone it all seemed so pointless otherwise impatient to get rid of her graham asked what can i do for you now its about your house graham in france she sat down frowning theres something fishy about it there was a man who came to look at it just before i left yesterday a frenchman a very nasty piece of work he arrived in a citro–ªn with two others who looked like thugs apparentlywell apparently you dont own the place at all lord cazalay does hes been selling it to a dozen different people oh graham im so sorry it must be awful to have lost all that money for a week graham read the morning and evening papers with eagerness and apprehension but the press stayed infuriatingly bare of facts reassuring or deadly lord cazalay and ferretyfaced arthur were remanded in custody by the bow street magistrate on some comparatively trivial charge a detectivesuperintendent implying from the witness box that all hell was in store for them once it could be properly documented the disgraced fred butcher was announced by his distraught secretary as having entered an unnamed nursinghome for nerves he had sent his passport to scotland yard though purely as a matter of courtesy the tory party squashed for a couple of years under mr attlees majority fell like bluebottles on the festering wound in the purewhite body of socialism they even stripped the friable wrappings from the mummified first lord cazalay recalling with glee that his disgrace had occurred under the sway of ramsay macdonald there was a dreadful fuss in the house of commons the speaker twice suspended the sitting leaving the chamber like a despairing headmaster shaming his boys with a display of dignity two more ministers resigned but kept their passports then the government neatly announced an investigatory tribunal to be established under a judge of unassailable wisdom and impartiality the matter was henceforward sub judice and could not with propriety be raised in public at all the house simmered down the legislators turning their vigilance to the raising of the schoolleaving age to fifteen after ten days of uncertainty paralysing all his activities and most of his thoughts outside his professional ones graham ran into john bickley in the cavendish clinic he had just finished his last case of the afternoon loosening a dupuytrens contracture in the palm of a stockbroker the deformity interfered badly with his shooting as he pushed open the door of the surgeons room to change he found the anaesthetist in his long green theatre gown packing away rubber masks tubing swabs syringes and other tools of oblivion into a square blackleather bag that was the best advice anyones given me in my life graham said at once john looked up about not operating on that spiv fellow he gave a smile you know i hadnt the slightest expectation that youd take it if i had id be well and truly up the creek by now wouldnt i with all this fuss all these political people getting interested trying to outdo each other scratching up the dirt the ridiculous aspect of the whole affair is that id nothing to worry about from cazalay nothing at all he simply swindled me out of my money he didnt even buy those pernicious francs in the first place how much did you lose five thousand quid johns eyebrows shot up yes im a mug graham admitted cazalay might as well have sold me a gold brick or the eiffel towerdidnt some bright frenchman flog it to the germans for scrap during the war he undid a length of bandage round his waist and slipped the white linen operating trousers from his spindly legs but perhaps it was a reasonable fee to pay for the shock treatment ive learnt my lesson henceforward trevose sticks to the straight and narrow path oh come graham youre making yourself sound like an old lag not an ornament to one of our orders of chivalry graham threw his trousers into the corner with an impatient gesture you know what i mean well you ought to you dont imagine im unaware of your going about referring to me as flash harry john laughed by the way im giving up my private practice graham added the anaesthetist paused in packing away his apparatus and stared at him youre not serious im perfectly serious im abandoning the private racket for a fulltime job on the new unit haileyburys always talking about im to be its first director but grahamyour whole lifes been built round your private work everyone in london is green with envy at your reputation you already get patients sent to you from all over the country once things get really back to normal youll be getting them from all over the bloody world surely you cant throw all that away my life wasnt built round private work during the war and that was the only time i was happy he pulled on his grey suit in silence as john snapped the two catches of his leather case graham continued perhaps the government are right to set themselves against feepaying medicine its immoral really if you look at it carefully it didnt matter so much even thirty years ago when the doctor could generally do damn all whether you paid him or not besides i want to think perhaps to write rushing round nursing homes chasing guineas you havent a chance to do either perhaps ive an academic streak in me somewheredont forget my father was a professor he left a massive volume on the synovial membranes as his tombstone which is more than i shall ever achieve i still cant take you seriously graham then wait and see you wont even have to wait long the appointments being announced by the ministry at the beginning of next month ill have to resign from blackfriars of course which will be a wrench though mainly a sentimental one there doesnt seem the slightest prospect of the place being rebuilt in my own lifetime and the staff there will all be working for the government anyway whether they like it or not im giving up my flative got to economize and i want something smaller nearer the site to organize things grahams face suddenly lit up itll be like those early days at the annex all over again except this time everyone will be on my side ill only have to snap my fingers for equipment to arrive by the lorryload john stood looking at him his bony longfingered hands resting on the top of his case it must have been a sacrifice or at least a horribly difficult decision not really like most of the big steps in my life i didnt think twice about it as john slipped the green gown from his shirt graham added as offhandedly as possible you know i really would rather like to see clare again thats the best news youve given me today graham felt this sounded vaguely condescending but asked do you think shed respond to some sort of social invitation to dinner a show something like that why dont you come and find out im just off to the kenworth to do a case i know for a fact shes on duty are you free graham hesitated then his natural impulsiveness made him say all right you can give me a lift as john picked up his instrumentcase he added after all ive nothing to lose have i if i admit to you now that i treated clare quite disgustingly its something which i have only just come to admit to myself quite so said john it suddenly struck him how much graham was starting to sound like haileybury it was fortunate for the reputation of sister mills at the kenworth hospital that she had charge of a childrens ward unlike the adult patients who had little to do except listen to workers playtime through the headphones and intensely observe the personal behaviour of the staff the youngsters saw nothing remarkableonly some welcome entertainmentin a wideeyed little man bursting among them a startled cry from sister a whispered conversation glances between bewildered nurses a brisk retreat to sisters office a slamming of the door graham reflected afterwards he could as well have telephoned but his unexpected appearance was much more dramatic and much more satisfying in the office they were far too confused and embarrassed to say very much nor even to approach within arms length of each other graham told her he must see her it was desperatecouldnt he even take her to dinner she demurred trying to adjust her mind to the situation but he was never a man to lose the advantage of a womans hesitation all right clare agreed doubtfully all right graham for old times sake thats wonderful well have so much to talk about its almost three whole years since we he wondered how to put it went our separate ways she couldnt prevent herself asking did you miss me like an amputated limb you know how the patients get pain in them dont you a phantom limb it hurts worse than ever even if it isnt there she gave a nervous smile and said you mustnt forget the limbs always amputated for the patients own good there was a pause neither of them felt entirely sure where the conversation was leading both were relieved for it to be frustrated by a knock on the door and the news that a child due for release overcome by excitement had vomited copiously over the newly cleaned floor two evenings later they met graham had chosen a restaurant in soho whispered among a small and knowing circle as providing with its generous portions not only butter but crisp white mysteriously unrationed bread by then both he and clare had found time to adjust themselves and were perfectly charming to each other they sat in the corner of the small roselighted room chatting gaily of pointedly inconsequential generalities graham had really no precise idea what he was going to propose to her and hoped he could rely on her delicacy to raise nothing that would make him feel too uncomfortable he picked up the winelist and suggested champagne adding halfhumorously this place is terribly black market oh everyone these days knows someone who can get them something clare smiled our theatre porter finds us the most lovely nylonsthey dropped off a lorry is the story it must have been an extremely large pantechnicon im growing rather tired of all that you know ive had some sort of moral conversion and like most converts i was scared into it he picked up the evening paper beside them on the table lord cazalay and arthur had been charged that morning with a number of offences from bribery of government officials to possessing unauthorized sweet coupons to grahams relief there was still no mention of currency transactions youve read all about this i suppose is there anyone who hasnt but i think i can entertain you with some unpublished details over dinner he gave a frank account of his life since she had walked out of cosy cot with the exception of liz in his penitent mood he was halfinclined to throw her in too but consoled himself that clare would certainly suspect he had been mixed up with a woman or two and through natural female pride and vanity imagine them goddesses if she became increasingly serious and sympathetic graham had been smugly confident of as much his moral weaknesses had always been of as much concern to her as his physical ones he reflected and she accepted both with the same resignation she hadnt changed he told himself though if she had changed towards him was a separate question when he finished the tale she held his hand under the table and said poor graham you did get yourself in a mess didnt you i didnt have you to keep me out of it he started to talk about his new job a conversation which drifted naturally back to the annex and smithers botham her eyes began to sparkle she gripped his hand tighter than ever and he felt a sudden glow of relief it was going to be all right she had forgiven him they could pick up neatly where they had left off except this time he really would marry her just as soon as the little formality could be arranged he was starting to believe she would go that very night with him to the flat when she said graham its been simply lovely meeting you we must have another reunion one day mustnt we perhaps when all this blackmarket and rationing nonsense is over he looked blank but clare arent you coming back to me dont be silly graham but this time i meanwed be married it would be different it wouldnt be different in the slightest as i told you once before it wouldnt work youre being ridiculous he sounded quite cross everything was abnormal in those days yes there was a war on i mean everything about me i was selfish then foolish chasing all the wrong things ive changed i know ive changed ive got my sense of values straight i dont give a damn for the fripperies of life any more you sound like sir stafford cripps she told him by the time he reached home graham was furious it was beyond him why clare had refused to fall gratefully into his arms all this effort to turn himself into a decent human being he reflected petulantly would be absolutely wasted if nobody was going to take it seriously he poured himself a whisky and sat in the armchair for the first time there stole upon him the black realization that he had lost clare for good a solitary life stretched ahead as bleakly as the concrete corridors at smithers botham and at fiftyone you needed someone beside you much more desperately than at twentyone but there was nobody who cared a damn about him only his son desmond at least he presumed so the young man had more or less given up speaking to him the next morning graham had a letter from haileybury confirming his new appointment and inviting him to lunch with some political figures who were enthusiastic over the new hospital mr bevan himself he added might possibly be joining them for the coffee graham wrote resigning his post as consultant surgeon to blackfriars he would devote himself wholly to his new interest he would have the best part of fifteen years in the place before he retired and he would leave it as a splendid monument to himself he would meanwhile live alone and put up with it after all he was a widower not some crabby neverloved bachelor like old crampers he wondered vaguely if crampers were still alive he doubted it the welfare state seemed to have been the death of him the politicians lunch was held in the house of commons a fair proportion of which like a fair proportion of the capital itself lay in apparently permanent ruins graham was interested to see for the first time the inside of the place though confessing as he was escorted rapidly through the corridors and stairways a feeling of disappointment the marble floors the vulgar murals the pillared corners and vaulted ceilings the solemn dresssuited attendants reminded him of somewhereyes it was the casino at monte carlo he supposed that both structures had been raised about the same time and had much in common in their function the party gathered in a smallish upstairs room with mullioned leaded windows and an overabundance of carved pale oak overlooking the river graham at once realized the importance of the affair of the thirtyodd men in the room about half he recognized as top medical people including haileybury clearly the government had taken the new hospital to its heart never a martyr to the selfinflicted tortures of modesty graham was flattered to notice the stir his arrival made among the politicos they would have heard enough of him during the war he supposed or perhaps he reflected wryly they were aware of his having married the daughter of the first lord cazalay and his kinship to the rogue at the seat of their present troubles graham was coming to detach himself from the man in brixton prison with more assurance every day he decided his brotherinlaw had enough on his hands without dragging him into the messthough with a man like that you never could tell but if anything about himself was exposed by the promised radical surgery of the tribunal he fancied even the memory of the present feast would induce in his hosts an attack of acute dyspepsia graham found himself sitting next to a young member of parliament with junior rank in the government though he was vague what and felt it would be discourteous to reveal such ignorance graham was far too selfcentred to have much interest in politics a quality which combined with his exhibitionism might have made him a successful politician he had troubled neither to vote in the recent election nor even to hear churchills broadcast speeches during the war like most medical people he saw mankind less as noble sufferers in adversity than as sadly muddleheaded ignoramuses to be saved from themselves by welleducated ladies and gentlemen as kindly as possible with a lazy if reasonable oversimplification graham wrote off the tories as appealing to the populaces natural greed and the socialists to its natural envy if the government were now trying to organize everyones life from the cradle to the grave he felt it probably a sound idea most inhabitants of a growingly complicated world apparently being incapable of even crossing the road with impunity long ago in the days of the first lord cazalay he had grasped that politicians ran to their own rules as detached from those of everyday life as the rules of some game of cards you had to let them get up to whatever they wished running your life as best you could and allowing for their existence like the bacteria contaminating every article you touched the young mp revealed himself over the soup as a strong enthusiast for the coming national health service my father he explained forcefully to graham suffered from bad eyes he couldnt afford to attend a doctor or an optician or anyone qualified for the job do you know what he was obliged to do go to one of the cheap sixpenny stores where they had a card affair with those differentsized letters on it right on the counter among all the tubes of toothpaste hed pick up lenses and try them till he found the right ones thousands of sufferers from bad eyesight had to do exactly the same those cheap stores were providing a valuable social service on behalf of their shareholders if they but knew it but its disgraceful isnt it sir graham in future every citizen will be entitled to a properly fitted pair of spectacles as a right just as hes entitled to clean water or the protection of the law itll probably be equally expensive graham demurred mildly the politicians gesture brushed this aside impatiently naturally therell be a pentup demand but the whole point of a proper health service is that it gets progressively cheaper when people are given the proper treatment theyve been denied through povertynot to mention given better working conditions better houses and a higher standard of living from decent wagesthe need for medicines and doctors will simply diminish well all live healthier and longer eh sir graham he grinned as a medical man mustnt you agree but if we all live longer well simply suffer more intractable ailments and need even more doctors sir graham youre belittling your profession what about the inevitable great advances in curative medicine and the inevitable increases in expensive drugs penicillins a dreadful price as it is graham felt uneasy entering in an argument with a professional debater but to his relief the waiter interrupted by serving the main course what on earths this he exclaimed in surprise whale steak the mp told him proudly were importing tons of it to eke out the meat ration i assure you its absolutely delicious then the young man began talking equally energetically about india a subject which bored graham even more than cricket it was clear that haileybury was enjoying the occasion immensely he rose to make a short if wholly unmemorable speech and as they prepared to break up graham noticed with amusement he was noticeably flushed with official port graham old fellow if youre going my way perhaps we can stroll together haileybury suggested with an unknown heartiness im not going anywhere in particular shall we take a turn round st jamess park weve plenty to talk about as they walked round the lake the chilly spring air restored haileybury to his usual oppressive sobriety they talked animatedly for half an hour about the first steps for bringing the new unit into being until graham broke off unexpectedly you know eric this new task youve saddled me with has saved my life literally i mean ive never thought of suicideand i know a surprising number of ones acquaintances have at least once quite seriously but i wouldnt have been too sure of myself not at this stage of my life without some fresh interest youre being fanciful again haileybury told him with a thin smile i suppose youre entitled to think so you know me better than almost anybody but i mean it without something big to tackle some worthwhile achievement to make id get depressed dreadfully depressed it seems to get worse with age and when a patients depressed you know well enough theyve a different personality theres no knowing what they might do its as dangerous as walking along the edge of a cliff haileybury nodded slowly as they walked what makes you imagine i havent suffered myself graham looked at him sharply he had imagined haileyburys personality breasting the tides of life with the unexciting stability of a coalbarge on the thames it struck him that although haileybury had grown to understand a good deal of his own inner workings he knew absolutely nothing of haileyburys i hope the intolerable amount of work you are about to undertake will put such unpleasant notions from your mind haileybury added im safe as long as im occupied every minute of the day i hate living alone graham hesitated but decided to go on haileybury of all people had become his only confessor id hoped to cure that particular deficiency but im afraid its not to be youre thinking of taking a companion i notice you avoid the word wife and i cant blame you for that either graham sounded a shade weary you know i lived with a girl during the war she was my ward sister from the annex weve met up again i want to marry her i cant live without her thats a stupid expression much overused but as i explained a moment ago it might have been quite literally true but she doesnt want to take the same risk with me twice and i can hardly object to her point of view who might this lady be would i have met her i should imagine so shes the childrens ward sister at the kenworth haileybury stopped dead sister mills but what an amazing coincidence it isnt at all john bickley got her the job after i kicked her out in i see said haileybury he put his fingers together and blew on them i do wish you wouldnt do that graham burst out its irritated me for years haileybury hastily thrust his hands in his pockets im sorry theres a difficulty between you he sympathized she cant understand that i dont want to go back to my old waysbecause of the war or old age graham ended gloomily or perhaps just disgust with myself in general i suppose to some extent the seven ages of man are all strangers to each other haileybury observed just look at those ducks said graham pointing across the lake they must run up a tremendous oxygen debt keeping their beaks under water as long as that he didnt care to reveal more of himself to haileybury he had said too much as it was he had written clare a long and thoughtful letter uncloyed with passion there had been no reply it seemed best to forget about her as deliberately as he had once forgotten about edith as the two surgeons resumed their walk graham began with growing disquiet to hope that haileybury would forget about her too haileybury had been his enemy once and in this shifting and faithless world who knew when he might be again but haileybury did not forget about clare at all he had heard some rumour during the war of graham living in sin at smithers botham but had vaguely imagined his consort some painted and skittish female of the type portrayed on his rare visits to the cinema by dorothy lamour haileybury suffered a guilty affection for the comedies starring bing crosby and bob hope that she was the quiet and efficient sister mills whom he had encountered almost weekly for a year seemed inconceivable but haileybury decided he had never been able to comprehend the powerful mysteries of sexual attraction no more than he could grasp those of the atomic physics you were beginning to read so much about in the newspapers he had never felt drawn to one woman rather than another in his life he felt annoyed that john bickley had kept sister mills relationship from himbut he supposed it wasnt a matter you wanted revealed in such a gossipridden place as a hospital he anxiously tried to recall if he had made any particularly uncharitable remarks about graham in her presence haileybury thought about it all the weekend he kept shaking his head and chuckling faintly to himself much alarming his sister it certainly took him back the only other of grahams women he had met was that girl edith secretary on his plastic surgery unit in he had taken a distinctly dim view of that connection haileybury remembered but that was long ago now they were growing into old dogs and learning not to bark and bite so much he began to wonder if he might say something on grahams behalf to sister mills an outrageous idea of course but haileybury was a fair man and felt the lady was perhaps being unjust as for the injustice he had himself done graham in he felt it more keenly than graham now did himself sister mills might make the man a good wife haileybury speculated graham had sobered down there was no doubt about that for him to have thrown away his profitable private practice would before the war have been as inconceivable as his entering a monastery but no haileybury finally decided he had no right to intervene it was a personal matter for the pair of them besides he was still not entirely certain how much in these strange postwar years he had come to like or even to tolerate graham on the monday haileybury was visiting the kenworth hospital to see his patients he had two cases of cleft palate recovering in the childrens ward which he usually visited ceremonially escorted by his housesurgeon but this young man whose services he shared with the throat department was occupied in the theatre with the emergency of a postoperative bleeding tonsil haileybury found himself alone with sister mills in a small room off the ward known as the nursery which contained a slide a rocking horse and various toys all of which some halfdozen small children were enjoying with an amazing amount of noise i believe you know graham trevose haileybury asked her suddenly above the din yes thats quite correct clare told him calmly i was one of his ward sisters during the war how very strange haileybury looked uneasy i have enjoyed his acquaintance for years you know yes he used to talk a lot about you particularly when there was that fuss in clare noticed haileybury had the grace to turn pink i think we have made all that up between us sister i hope so mr haileybury he was very upset at the time almost out of his mind haileybury made no reply he had long ago ceased caring what graham said to him but the cloaked rebuke from sister mills was surprisingly wounding a shocking illogical thought crept upon himperhaps it was he who had behaved so badly over the years of their acquaintance rather than graham i hope i have undone any damage by arranging to some extent his appointment to our fine new accident hospital you must have seen the place mentioned in the papers surely i dont think anything could compensate him for those few terrible weeks he had built up the annex at smithers botham and it was to be taken away from him she paused and added it was like a mother losing a child haileybury didnt know what to say so he put his fingertips together and blew on them i saw graham just before the weekend he admitted naturally with the new project we shall be thrown on each others company a good deal he hesitated and added i understand he wishes to marry you sister he could not remember uttering anything making him feel more uncomfortable in his life that is correct mr haileybury clare leant down to pick up a crying child who had tripped over a pile of wooden bricks forgive methis is really nothing to do with mebut i gather you are not agreeable that too is correct mr haileybury i am not agreeable haileybury hesitated again he decided that having got this far he would charge bravely on in he may not have been motivated by spite as graham suggested but he had found the delicate negotiations leading to the mans dismissal from the annex not wholly unpleasurable yes he must make amends it was his duty the new job was not enough after all graham could have earned that easily on his own merits it was only a matter of his stooping to take it im sorry to hear that he said quite sternly i hope you appreciate the extent of his emotional disturbance i have known him for yearssince before you were bornand i can appreciate it very keenly myself quite frankly he talked to me of suicide oh i know its a common enough threat in such circumstances from a boy of twenty perhaps but not from a mature man and a man of the world like graham he saw she looked alarmed and went on perhaps i can see your point of view he would never conceal from society that he was lavish in his affections but hes a better man it was a process which probably started during the war when he had no alternative but to follow his natural instinct and devote himself to others i fancy his life in the world of fashion merely expressed his taste for selfindulgence pursued with the energy which he devotes to everything there was a pause filled with the screaming of children perhaps so was all clare said haileybury shrugged his shoulders he felt no need to say more he had done the duty he made a peculiar jerky bow and sidled away he sincerely hoped the girl would take up with graham again and marry him after that conversation it would be outrageously embarrassing always meeting her in the hospital clare went to her small office and sat at her desk it was all dreadfully confusing of course she still loved graham of course she would happily marry him had she been five years younger she wouldnt have hesitated but the lesson of cosy cot was not one she was anxious to learn over againunless that funny old stick haileybury was right and graham had really shed his old habits when they had lived together she had seen mostly grahams best side and that was certainly something worth taking a risk for on the other hand with graham you could never tell how he was going to behave about anything even the way he liked his shirts ironed there was a knock a cheerful curlyheaded young man in a white coat the thoracic surgeons houseman put his head inside all right if we have a look at that patent ductus sister yes of course mr cooper clare got up the surgeons were daringly starting to operate in the area of the heart itself and had tied off an abnormal bloodvessel in a little girl suffering this congenital defect she gathered up the notes the patients doing very well im glad to say thats splendid then well have another one for you to nurse next month im afraid i shant be here by then mr cooper im leaving to get married clare stood looking at him still wondering why she had said it graham found a wedding in middle life a surprisingly agreeable experience though after all he told himself unlike most bridegrooms he wasnt marrying an almost total stranger grahams first marriage had been one of the social landmarks of maria had worn a train twelve feet long there had been a shoal of expensively outfitted bridesmaids all of whose names and faces he had long ago forgotten and the first lord cazalay had driven her up in a brandnew rolls royce the young john bickley had been his best man and the second lord cazalay now calculating his chances in a remand cell had become embarrassingly drunk the reception had been in some official building though graham had gathered the brides father would have preferred buckingham palace could he have arranged it as graham had expected nobody had taken much notice of himself he had later come to appreciate this was true of even the humblest marriages which he supposed were largely occasions for the parents to entertain their friends and show off without risk of later backbiting his own wedding was the first graham had attended since the miserable afternoon at the marriage of peter thomaswho graham was delighted to find from the newspapers seemed to be making a fortune with some sort of crosscountry air service there were to be only four onlookers at the registry office clares mother and father appeared from bristol to grahams relief too flattered by their daughters unexpectedly turning herself into lady trevose to utter anything but the platitudes of the occasion he asked john bickley to repeat his role of best man denise had to be invited as well of course but to grahams intense joy was too ill on the day to go out afterwards graham stood them all lunch in a hotel where they had champagne and snoek piquante there was a weddingcake with an iced covering made in the way of the times from detachable white cardboard there were no speeches though grahams new fatherinlaw had by then so fallen under the influence of his charm and his tide that he had to be restrained from making one they caught the train for a weekends honeymoon at bognor regis everything was punctiliously correct the rushed two weeks since clare had accepted him were too occupied with her work in hospital and her visits to bristol to give them more than a moment or two together over lunch in claridges graham mounted to their seaside bedroom reflecting with amusement that he was facing his bride like the most moral of newly wedded husbandsif one overlooked a year or two during the war he got into bed making jokes about consummations and such other horribly dignified words festooning the sexual relationship this time he put out the light feeling he wanted to be as respectable about everything as possible then suddenly he broke into tears clare held him tight in the darkness darling what is it weeping was something she had never known in him before what is it whats upsetting you i dont know i dont know graham told her for once i just cant express myself any other way thats all her hand under the bedclothes stroked his penis that organ of superb anatomical ingenuity i thought id lost you for good clarei really did i could have taken it a few years ago but not now not any longer she said nothing for a minute then confessed we have a fairy godfather someone who came and changed my mind oh and who might that be mr haileybury she told him cheerfully graham sat bolt upright haileybury my god that piefaced fossil haileybury he told me you could be relied upon to be a good boy in future she added teasingly and of course nobody could possibly doubt the good word of mr haileybury good god muttered graham but the news was too much for almost the first time in his life when in bed with a woman graham was put off his stroke at the beginning of june in the hot and thundery summer of it was starting to sink into the british public that of all the shortages bedevilling the country which ran from electricitygenerating stations to milk chocolate a lack of united states dollars was the most serious intractable and baffling after all general marshall was proposing to give dollars away by the shipload to european countries who had spent the war defeating one anothereven to germany or the bits that the russians had left of it and we were the victors we had fought the war from the first shot we had won it admittedly with a little american assistance we had paid our whack of it it was most frustrating why the government were even contemplating an unbelievable economyof denying the twenty million weekly cinemagoers their accustomed hollywood films graham then had a letter from edith demurely congratulating him on his marriage he supposed she had learnt of it from some regular bundle of english newspapers dispatched to soften her exile but most of the halfdozen pages in her large round hand concerned her son alec she was dreadfully worried about him he had written early in the year explaining he was in hospital with some mild psychological disturbance she just couldnt understand it alec had been a highly strung child of course and was still inclined to be excitable but he was perfectly normal and very clever really there was certainly no madness on their side of the family graham felt slightly irritated at the barb but supposed it unintentional edith hadnt heard from alec since she has no idea if he were still under treatment or where he was she hesitated troubling graham who must be terribly busy but she was becoming desperate it seemed such an awful pity that all alecs splendid education should go to waste graham tossed the letter on to the desk in his marylebone flat edith was always a great admirer of education he reflected even as a girl she placed it among the noblest of human qualities when it was only another pair of hands to be used for good or evil but mostly for feeding yourself but he supposed he had better do something about alec he knew the young man had been discharged from smithers botham taking some new drug which dr dency assured graham would have a tranquillizing effect rather than a soporific one like the barbiturates graham telephoned the psychiatrists consulting room to learn that dr dency had left for a sixmonths lectureship in the union of south africa where he was doubtless enjoying steaks and as many eggs as he cared to eat for his breakfast he telephoned smithers botham but could get no sense from anybody the next afternoon he was himself delivering a lecture at addenbrooks hospital at cambridge and had arranged to dine in hall afterwards with his son perhaps desmond might be able to help graham wondered he had more reason for keeping track of alec than anyone how did the lecture go asked desmond welcoming his father amiably enough with a glass of sherry in his rooms i dont really know it was my standard one ive delivered it so often it comes out automatically its a useful opportunity for me to think about other matters desmond gave a faint smile now that hes started wearing his hair long thought graham he really does look tremendously like maria hows clare desmond asked shes splendid you didnt particularly want to attend the wedding i suppose id have come if youd asked me then perhaps i saved you some embarrassment by omitting to by the way you dont happen to know where alecs got to i suppose his mothers worried stiff about him desmond looked surprised i was going to ask you the same thing i heard some sort of rumour that he was doing anaesthetic locums round london then perhaps john bickley might have a clue graham suggested hopefully im not going to let him get away with it you know said desmond more severely the moneys mine and hes showing absolutely no inclination to pay it back whatever its just as if hed put his hand in my pocket and stolen it my dear desmond graham leant back in his armchair one of the things you should now be learning in life is the right moment to cut your losses with either bad debts bad women or bad operating techniques enjoy your mistakes but dont lose sleep over them i didnt want to pay for his bloody upbringing it was you who took it on i agree but anyway the unpleasant experience will do you good graham sipped the sherry which was really rather good it was stupid to worry about grabbing money all the time he told himself one of the more depressing of the herd instincts a wonder he had fallen for the idea for so long since marrying clare he was becoming quite righteous if im going to start making selfimproving donations to charity i certainly wouldnt begin with alec desmond declared crossly youve got paranoia about him havent you thats a waste of time too old haileybury and i were daggers drawn for years and it didnt get us very far only recently ive realized that everyone was killing themselves laughing behind our backs id forget alec if i were you as desmond continued looking disagreeable graham added all right all right once ive got my affairs straight ill make up the sum to you does that make you feel better count your blessings youre set for a brilliant academic career while alec will never come to anything desmond seemed to consider this proposition for some moments then announced you know ive decided to prepare a new edition of grandfathers book theres a tremendous amount of work involved but i think it will be worth while thats excellent news graham felt deeply gratified trevose on the synovial membranes i remember the old boy writing it donkeys years ago when id escaped with my life from that sanatorium hed be pleased to think the family were keeping it going theres a weight of medical tradition on your shoulders you know desmond it gets heavier every generation like our debts perhaps thats why i decided on the task said desmond solemnly its something for posterity it doesnt seem i shall father another generation of trevoses our branch of the family will die out oh i dont know graham told him cheerfully youve forgotten about clare and myself good god murmured desmond looking thoroughly alarmed graham decided to take desmonds guess about alecs whereabouts as fact and wrote edith a consoling letter saying her son was making his way in the newly flourishing specialty of anaesthetics he supposed he could have made more energetic enquiries but he was tremendously busy with plans and committees for the new hospital for the third time in his life he was starting a new unit from scratchfirst at blackfriars in the twenties backed by val arlott secondly at smithers botham discouraged by everybody and now in the abandoned american building with the full resources of the welfare state at his elbow it was the most exciting if the most exhausting of all he could hardly be expected to play alecs nursemaid at the same time anyway the man was in his middle twenties a qualified doctor and should be able to look after himself edith wrote again rather pathetically graham finished her long letter with a deep sigh the woman really was rather a nuisance shed never missed a chance to make use of him never since hed deflowered her in a seaside summerhouse during the warmer months of graham let young alec drop from his mind then one afternoon in november he was hurrying along shaftesbury avenue from a lunch appointment in soho and saw the name alec trevose facing him from a placard outside a theatre graham stopped frowning he felt for his newly prescribed glasses the announcement not being in particularly large type the name was among three others claiming authorship of a revue which graham vaguely remembered as wringing amiable notices from the critics he had turned his back on the theatre of late lower down there was alec trevose again in even smaller letters among the cast well it was not an uncommon name graham reflected and sounded well enough for any player to sport there was no immediate way of telling if the actordramatist might be his own nephew the simplest course seemed to buy a couple of tickets for the show which he obtained for the following evening with the greatest difficulty a glance at clares programme as they took their seats told graham it was alec right enough the sketch he had written and in which he was about to display himself was entitled simply at the doctors the pair of them sat through the foregoing scenes which struck graham as exactly like every other revue he had seen with mounting impatience and foreboding then alec finally appeared he acted a patient subjected to an ingenious variety of indignities and discomforts by a dozen whitecoated doctors the audience bellowed once recovering from the shock of his nephews entrance graham had to admit it was well put together and surprisingly funny perhaps because every line that alec had written and every situation he had depicted occurred often enough in a real hospital he turned his head to see clare dabbing away tears of laughter with her handkerchief he wondered what edith would have thought after the final curtain graham said without enthusiasm wed better go round and have a word with him i suppose yes id love to agreed clare eagerly ive never been behind the scenes before graham gave his name to the stagedoor keeper who directed them down a flight of stone stairs leading to a narrow greenpainted illlit passage smelling strongly of disinfectant the dressingrooms that graham had visited during his theatrical phase had been spacious flowerfilled apartments but alecs seemed hardly bigger than a railway compartment with a wooden stand in the middle for the mirrors fringed with electric bulbs at which three other young men were busy wiping away their makeup why its uncle graham alec leapt up a scrap of filthy towelling in his hand but what a lovely surprise and auntie clare i say i should have congratulated you or something shouldnt i im dreadfully sorry lifes been an absolute rush ive had hardly a moment to think of my nearest and dearest perhaps it is we who should congratulate you remarked graham rather drily shaking hands did you enjoy the show asked alec with a pressing eagerness he shared with even the greatest actors id hoped we clapped loudly enough to make that an unnecessary question alec lit a cigarette i expect it shattered you a bit seeing me from out front its admittedly an unexpected talent brought to light it all started in smithers botham dency thought it would help if i tried some form of selfexpression he knows someone in the management here and sent the sketch along at first i was only supposed to help out with the technical detailsyou know wearing your stethoscope the right way round putting on gloves the regulation way that sort of thing after id been fooling about at rehearsals one of the cast went sick so they gave me a chance success story one of the other young men none of whom alec had introduced picked up his jacket and with a call of goodnight darlings left them graham noticed with amusement clare looked shocked he himself had come to learn the endearing expression was merely the equivalent of the communists comrade in an evershifting and commendably classless society a success story so far graham agreed nodding now uncle youre being damping but ive half another show written im getting work on broadcastingive even got an agent oh i know it isnt a solid job like medicine but you cant imagine how much better ive been feeling since i tried my hand at it and this poisonous underground atmosphere has absolutely cured my asthma the pollens cant get at you a girl who seemed to graham to be wearing only her underclothes put her head round the dressingroom door said oh sorry and disappeared again i was a misfit in medicine alec continued cheerfully wiping off the remains of his greasepaint god knows why i started it in the first place mother i suppose weight of family tradition or perhaps you think ive let the side down he asked genuinely concerned not entirely i was something of a misfit myself well im not the first doctor to make an exhibition of myself in public the great charles wyndham was qualified he ended up a grand actormanager with a knighthood and a theatre called after him i dont think wyndham ever played in revue graham observed with the vague feeling that alec was probably starving in some attic he added an invitation to supper but his nephew declined graciously explaining he was already engaged to sup with some important director who thought highly of his work graham imagined the girl in the underclothes his more likely companion but was glad enough to accept the refusal you really ought to send some sort of word to your mother he finally admonished him shes written saying how disturbed she is about you dear mother alec started putting on his shirt she always did fuss so yes i really must send her a line or perhaps youd prefer me to write graham saw alec in his present mood as a doubtful correspondent alec turned with a bright smile just do that little thing for me will you uncle in the taxi going home graham said god knows what will come of alecs wild ideas it is a bit of a letdown for the family however broadminded you try to seem about it a hell of a lot of people took enormous trouble teaching him medicine now he throws it all away to become a professional buffoon havent you said often enough darling you cant suppress a true artist even if he can only chalk sunsets on the pavements you never let them suppress you perhaps so he admitted perhaps alec and i are the same thing really he took her hand and stared gloomily out of the cab window it would all be intolerably difficult to describe to edith but his thoughts as usual turned back to the new hospital and he said remind me ive got to go to the board of trade tomorrow afternoon something about importing american equipment im seeing the new ministerfellow called harold wilson one of attlees bright boys clare said tomorrow im going to listen to the wedding on the radio wedding what wedding oh graham princess elizabeths wedding of course im sorry it was out of my mind for the moment after another long silence he said its odd to think that one day we shall have a queen on the throne again though i shant be alive to see it i just remember when the last queen died at least i imagine i do i have a mental picture of my mother telling me the news in fathers old study in hampstead i could only have been seven years old at the time it was just before my mother died herself of tb and i remember that well enough queen elizabeth has a fine ring about it hasnt it he began to sound more cheerful as the problem of alec settled into its true insignificance the countrys having a pretty thin time of it at the moment but perhaps a new elizabethan age will dawn upon us oh well end up top dogs again sooner or later like we were before the war that so many fellowcountrymen imagined the same as graham trevose at the time was the great midtwentiethcentury british tragedy or perhaps comedy they are only two ways of looking at the same thing when their trident landed at heathrow there was a reporter and a photographer waiting graham had lost nothing of his attraction for the press how kind of you to come along he smiled he had also lost nothing of his touch with newspapermen good evening sir graham i hope you had a good trip splendid thank you splendid aeroplanes make everything so convenient these days i still havent quite got used to them all that messing about one used to do with trains and boats was quite exhausting yes rome was wonderful in september i think the light is just right in summer the suns too strong and the shadows are the most intriguing part of any buildingor of any human face i gather you made a quite sensational speech to the plastic surgery congress sir graham he chuckled hardly sensational my days for making sensations are past but i put over a few of my old ideas which still hold good the basic principles have been rather swamped by the enormous advances in surgical technique and technology but to my mind its as important to grasp them as firmly in as it was in when i took over the directorship of the national accident hospital in fact these basic principles havent changed since when i was proud of being in a position to put them to good use he always referred to in front of the press i hope youve managed to get some holiday in italy at the same time lady trevose the reporter asked clare yes we had an absolutely wonderful fortnight in positano despite the continuing currency restrictions grinned the reporter we are extremely modest abroad graham told the man quite sharply it was nine oclock before they emerged from the customs into the bright and confusing concourse its strange how this place always looks entirely different depending on whether youre going or coming graham observed its the difference between hope and anticlimax i suppose a common enough sequence in my own experience youve nothing to complain about this trip darling perhaps a little they didnt take my speech seriously at the congress you know not entirely but they were absolutely charming clare protested particularly the russians yes but they think im old hat perhaps theyre right im a realist anyway i livened them up well see how the americans take to me in baltimore next spring graham looked round hopefully for the chauffeur booked to drive them into london he felt that at his age the shunning of airport buses was a luxury worth indulging in he was spry and as thin as ever he let his wispy hair grow overlong and strands of it poked under his hat he wore glasses all the time large and round making his eyes look more owlish than ever he had grown rather untidy in his clothes presenting an amiably donnish look to the world clare thought fondly he resembled an elderly elf the car had hardly reached the m before graham fell asleep clare picked up the tartan rug provided by the hire firm and carefully laid it over him this was less to prevent any malevolent chill taking advantage of his unguardednessher nursing training enabled her to take a strictly scientific view of grahams managementbut an indulgence on her part an expression of the steadfast tenderness she had shown towards him in their twentyone years of marriage she settled back in her corner looking at the street lights trying to correlate them with the necklaces she had admired from the air she had grown fatter but kept her pale good looks and with assistance her fair hair graham tended to drop off to sleep rather often these days she reflected perhaps he shouldnt gad about the world so much but seventythree though a respectable age was hardly over the threshold of senility if she remembered churchill was rather older when he became prime minister through the persuasion of the ballotbox rather than the approaching muzzles of the german guns they had a small flat in chelsea and an unimposing house in the country on the way to oxford past the national accident hospital graham had worked there almost a dozen years until his retirement in they had been the happiest of his life happier even than at the annex it was mainly because nothing had happened to him he sometimes wondered if it were the security of a settled job or the fires of his personality dimming to a comfortable glow or simply clare keeping a firm hand on him he had busied himself with his work developed a relish for committees lectured enthusiastically and drew veneration from the world as effortlessly as a wellestablished oak draws moisture from the soil he enjoyed the respect though it amused him it was not so much the poacher turning gamekeeper as the swashbuckling pirate becoming admiral of the fleet perhaps he possessed the same luck as his seafaring cornish ancestors he wondered who had never turned from a chance of smuggling and generally ended clothed with gold lace and dignity there was a pile of letters inside the door i cant face that lot at this hour of the night graham said as clare started gathering them ill have a go at them in the morning anything from dick their nineteenyearold son was on holiday in spain with graham suspected the girl he had met at the university well it would be a bit of fun he wished hed had the chance to do the same at dicks age but then trips to spain were only for the rich and venturesome and the sunshine would do the girl good he thought she had struck him as a dismally anaemic young woman theres a letter he seems to have sent from malaga read it to me darling will you graham sat in the armchair im rather tired and his handwritings dreadful and theres something from blackfriars she tore open a large envelope theyve made it at last she exclaimed theyre actually going to open the new arlott wing by christmas of course they want you to perform the ceremony graham laughed the rebuilding of blackfriars beside the thames had long ago become a harmless joke when the war had ended the staff imagined they would quit smithers botham in a year or two but the volume of hospital work so increased with the national health service and the volume of hospital building so diminished with the national bankruptcy the country was several times on the brink of another war before they finally parted company i think weve beaten st thomass to it havent we he asked or is it more or less a dead heat he opened and closed his hands perhaps they might ask me to perform an inaugural operation on some unlucky fellow its an amusing thought i wouldnt mind having a knife in my hands again after all john bickleys still giving anaesthetics for private cases all over london though perhaps he only does it to get away from denise john had worked for graham again grahams private practice had in fact continued almost as busily as ever through an interesting fraction written into the health service known as nineelevenths the consultants were paid for the nineelevenths of their time spent in the service the other twoelevenths being free to extract money from those members of the public feeling disinclined to accept its benefits and twoelevenths of a consultants time with evenings early mornings and weekends was a handsome period for profits without this concession the consultants would have dug in their toes and there would have been no health service at all but nye bevan was an even more penetrating realist than graham clare read their sons letter which said a lot about the sunshine wine beaches and bullfights but nothing about girls the omission confirmed grahams suspicion he got up to pour himself a drink and said i suppose hell get married pretty soon i dont know hes no one in mind but they all seem to get married these days as soon as theyre legally entitled to perhaps they look upon it in the same light as learning to drive a car once the obstacle to any enjoyments removed you indulge yourself automatically hell wait until hes qualified surely in my day even in desmonds day that seemed to be the rule but of course we lived on our parents or our wits now they live on everyone elses parents doubtless its all a good idea hell wait till he finds the right girl hes terribly sensible graham smiled i had to wait a very long time till i found the right girl even then i didnt realize it did i she said nothing he seldom brought up their times at cosy cot she felt he liked to imagine the episode had never happened that he had met her for the first time when he had entered extremely dramatically her childrens ward one wet march morning in it was a forbidden topic just like marias divorce graham sipped his whisky do you know clare im beginning to think that life resembles something i havent experienced for donkeys yearsits like saturday night in an oldfashioned public house as she looked puzzled he gave a grin and said it gets better towards closingtime when they went to bed he lay reading for halfanhour he snapped the book shut and said birth and copulation and death thats all the facts when you come to brass tacks strange how those lines of eliots keep coming back to me i must have read them years ago when i first started at the annex but its right isnt it everything else is the trimmings its the most useful thing you can learn from medicine how to sort the two out whats the time halfpast midnight graham turned over for gods sake remind me in the morning im due to see a fellow at the royal college of surgeons he wants to touch me for some charity i imagine he turned out the light at twenty to four he woke switched on the light gasped at the pain exploding from his throat into his left arm and died clare had rather hoped for something at the abbey but whoever invisibly decides such delicate questions demurred official memories are long and not subject to the mellowing of human ones a knighthood for graham trevose had been acceptable in times when a mans merit mattered more than the man himself but a memorial service at the abbeythe doctor though distinguished was far from impeccable someone in some small quiet office remembered there was really a bad scandalhe had lived openly with a mistress during the war in the end the final pageant was held in st pancras church a frequent choice for such affairs in memory of medical men possibly because of its nearness to the redbrick ramparts of the british medical association in bloomsbury it was a befittingly miserable day in late september with cold wet winds from the north blowing down the railway lines to the termini which dominate that depressing area of london haileybury stumped along a thick overcoat over his blue suit wondering if it were going to trigger off his bronchitis again it was becoming increasingly burdensome to run the laps of the years it occurred to him to list mentally his own infirmities apart from the chest there was presbyopia ptosis arthritis of the left hip a bilateral hallux valgus a small inguinal hernia he ought to have something done about and of course the piles but a man was as old as his arteries as the physicians kept saying when everything else was falling to bits he supposed if his number didnt come up in the cancer lottery a good surgeon and antibiotics would keep him going a while at least that morning he was alive while trevose was dead to haileyburys mind death restored the formality of surnames excuse me sir eric haileybury paused on the pavement outside the church staring blankly at a young man in a raincoat im from the daily press said the young man graham deceased had the news value of graham alive the london evening placards had announced famous surgeon dead and middleaged men in crowded trains heard the echo of churchills funeral drums sir graham trevose was part of the legend and if young pilots in spitfires and hurricanes had shot out of the sky only half the enemy aeroplanes they thought they did the legend could shine when required as brightly as ever it seemed about the only thing the country had got out of the war do you think the young man continued that sir graham deserved his distinction as the wizard of plastic surgery i dont know how could i know haileybury started edging away wasnt the term invented by you people in fleet street i understand you had certain differences with sir graham i was never aware of any haileybury muttered do you think it morally wrong using surgery to construct new noses and such things for people who can afford it haileybury sniffed i have never given the matter any thought perhaps sir eric you have a comment on sir grahams great work in the war but haileybury had escaped into the sanctuary of a holy place like a medieval criminal the church was crowded and warm and smelt of damp overcoats reminding haileybury of the outpatients clinic he was shown to a pew at the front he decided his arthritis put even a perfunctory kneel on the hassock out of the question at least the service would be short and businesslike services for dead doctors generally were medical men live in far too close intimacy with death to regard its arrival as other than an unexpected stroke of treachery and at his age haileybury reflected such functions become occasions less of pain than foreboding he adjusted his glasses and reached for the folded sheet of printed paper set before him experience told him they would have o god our help in ages past he found he was right he felt pleased with his little guess it brightened his morning considerably he folded his arms and stared along the pews the widow of course rum sort of business really all over and done with now her son the first son now an academic he believed hed forgotten what line these days they made professors in all sorts of peculiar little subjects woman doubtless his wife been trouble there in the past too he seemed to remember trust the trevose family to make fools of themselves when a female came into it other man the nephew alec always seeing him on the television looked damned prosperous needed a haircut the other people around him were elderly men of washedout military appearance and of course the surgical big wigs the biggest wig was giving the address wouldnt say anything about trevose really of course at least haileybury reflected he sincerely hoped not odd chap trevose neurotic of course but he supposed all medical men were to some degree you must be to pick such a strange occupation as slippery as a snake unreliable abominably selfcentred fond of fame money and women the first two failings didnt matter much but the last did women were human beings trevose always seemed to forget that little fact of course it all changed in the last twenty years of his life i always rather liked trevose haileybury decided even when i didnt care to admit it to myself he livened things up didnt take life too solemnly i rather wish id had the courage to be more like him myself haileybury looked behind him full of trevoses patients it suddenly struck him these men had hardly aged over twentyfive years ago they had been dragged from blazing aeroplanes shattered tanks and ships scalding engine rooms now the skin collected in bits from all over their bodies had frozen on their faces in unwrinkled youth he supposed it was some compensation for having your features ravaged by a shellsplinter at twenty if you were immune from the ravages of time at fortyfive he searched for some more delicate examples of trevoses reconstructive art but all the worldly and often charming men and women who had besought trevose at considerable discomfort and expense to make them new faces seemed disinclined to show them in public a fitting epitaph haileybury thought dragging himself to his feet as they began
