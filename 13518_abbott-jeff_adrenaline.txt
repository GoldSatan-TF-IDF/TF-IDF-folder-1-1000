jeff abbott adrenaline part one november april in the flux that defines the world of the illegal beginnings are often endings and vice versa trillions of dollars move around the world outside of legal channels they ruin the lives of some and create vast empires of profit for others carolyn nordstrom global outlaws once my wife asked me if you knew this was our final day together what would you say to me wed been married for all of a year we were lying in bed watching the sun begin to shine through the heavy curtains and i answered her with the truth anything but goodbye i cant ever say goodbye to you two years later that final day started as most of my days did up at five i drove and parked near the tube station at vauxhall i like to use the public housing a few blocks away for my little adventures i started the run with a long warmup in the open exposed concrete courtyard of the old public building slowrunning in place gathering pace elevating my body temperature by a few critical degrees then took off you want your muscles and ligaments hot a brick wall lay directly ahead of me three feet taller than me i hit it with a step that launched me upward my fingers closing on the edge of its top i pulled myself up with one fluid movement id practiced a thousand times before no hard breathing no creaking of joints i tried to move in silence silence shows that youre in control over the edge of the wall running across the ground and then a vault over a much shorter wall onehanded my legs clearing the bricks into the main building a stairwell smelling of piss and decorated with a finger of blackandwhite graffiti lay ahead of me i hit the painted wall with my left foot in a careful jump using the energy to launch me rightward to the railing at the turn of the stair a hard move where id fallen before but today sweet i landed with care onto the railing holding my balance heart pounding mind calm adrenaline thump i jumped from the railing to an extended steel bar that stretched into the construction site used the momentum to swing myself over to a gutted floor the building was being torn apart and redone i would damage nothing leave no sign of passage i might be a trespasser but im not a jerk i ran to the opposite side of the floor launched into the air caught another bar of steel swung let go and hit the ground in a careful roll the energy from the fall spread across my back and butt rather than jamming in my knees and i was up and running again back into the building looking for a new more efficient way to enter its spaces parkour the art of moving gets my adrenaline going while at the same time a slow calm creeps over me make a misstep and i fall down the brick walls it is exhilarating and settling all at once i made another three passes through the buildings interesting web of spacebroken floors gaping stairwells equipmentusing a mix of runs vaults jumps and drops to find the linethe simplest and most straightforward path through the halfruined walls the low brick rises the empty staircases energy burned my muscles my heart pounded but the whole time i tried to maintain a distinct and separate calm find the line always the line around me in the distance i could hear traffic beginning to build the sky lightening for the new day people think that what the british call council housing is an eyesore its all in how you look at it to a parkour runner the old square buildings are beautiful full of planes and walls to run up and bounce off railings and ledges to walk and jump from neighbors who dont call the police at the merest noise the last route i dropped from the second story to the first grabbing a bar swinging letting go in a controlled fall hey a voice yelled at me as i slammed through the air i hit rolled let the energy of impact bleed nicely through my shoulders and bottom i ended up on my feet and took three steps and stopped not a guard a teenager watching me a morning cigarette perched on his lip how do you do that man practice i said long boring hours of practice like a spider he said smiling my mum and i been watching she wanted to call the old bill i said no thank you i really didnt need the police in my life time to find a new place to practice i waved at my benefactor and decided to cool down with a long straightforward run twenty minutes in a long looping circle a normal jogger out for his paces and i jumped back into my car to drive home most americans living in london dont have cars you dont need them i have one for security i headed up to our apartment off charlotte street not far from the british museum i slipped inside trying to be quiet hoping that lucy was still asleep she was up drinking juice at the small kitchen table frowning at an open laptop she glanced at me good morning monkey she said putting her gaze back to the laptop out making mischief id forgotten to take off the hand coverings i wore to protect my palms on the parkour runs i could hear the disappointment in her voice hi you didnt fall off a building she said no lucy i poured a glass of juice what a relief when you miss grabbing the edge of a wall and plummet to an untimely end i can tell the baby you died getting your morning fix of crazy the walls arent high i dont take stupid chances defensive when im expecting sam any chance is a stupid one sorry mostly it was a normal jog i took off the palm protectors stuffed them in my pocket i went to the fridge and found a cold bottle of water i took refuge in it drinking slowly and steadily shower coffee then a long day at the office the adrenaline rush was gone for the day sam yeah i love you i want you to know that i know that i love you too i turned from the refrigerator looked at her she was still studying her laptop her hand perched on the soft fullness of her belly the baby was seven months along and i suppose with the imminence of parenthood lucy and i were both more serious these days well she was i hadnt yet been able to give up parkour runs interspersed with my regular miles i wonder if you might find a less dangerous hobby my job is more dangerous than my hobby dont joke she said now she looked at me in her morning rumple she was beautiful to me brown hair with auburn highlights serious brown eyes a heartshaped face with a full red mouth i loved her eyes the most i know you can do your job better than anyone im scared youll take a stupid fall doing these runs i dont need you with a broken neck with a baby about to be born okay ill learn golf she made a face that told me she didnt take my promise seriously but she said thank you remember tonight we have dinner with the carstairs and the johnsons i smiled they were her friends not mine but they were all nice people and i knew our regular dinners out in london would become much rarer once the baby arrived and maybe they knew a golf instructor okay ill be home by five then were meeting them at six at the tapas bar in shoreditch do you have a big morning a powerpointheavy one i said briefings all day with brandon and the suits from back home i looked at her as she stood to stretch her hands on the swell of her belly but i could cancel go to the doctors with you no save me from the powerpoint let me go with you and the bundle we kept skirting the discussion of names so id given our imminent child a pseudonym the bundle she patted the top of her swell actually i may have to meet you at the restaurant i might have to go drink a quick pint with the suits after the meetings she laughed and smiled and said oh such a tough job you have i thought thank god i dont have my parents marriage lucy and i didnt fight didnt glare didnt inflict long painful silences go and barhop without your pregnant wife she smiled and closed her laptop but not quite yet she came to me and slid her hands up my back pregnant women are full of surprises its like living with a breeze that cant settle on its direction i loved it she kissed me with a surprising hunger almost a ferocity her belly big between us im hot and sweaty and gross i said im a yucky husband yes she said yes you are monkey and im enormous yes i said yes you are and i kissed her when we were done the sweetest start to that final day i made us a breakfast of toast coffee and juice then showered dressed and went to our office before i walked out i looked back at her at the breakfast table and i said i love you and she said i love you famous last words londons skies that day shone blue as a bright eye a rare sunny day for november after two weeks of gray looming clouds i had been in london for nearly a year that final morning in my somber suit taking the tube to holborn i might have looked like one of the young lawyers heading for a firm or for court except my briefcase carried a glock mm a laptop full of financial information on suspected criminal networks and a hamandcheese sandwich lucy is sentimental she liked to make my lunch for me because i made breakfast for her she would be in the office later when her doctors appointment was done wed worked together for nearly three years first back in virginia where wed met and married and then here i liked london liked my work liked the idea of the bundle being born here and spending his early years settled in one of the worlds great cities not jumping latitudes like i had some kids start each year in a different school id often started in a different hemisphere holborn is a mix of new and old our office building was close to where the street goes from being high holborn to plain holborn it was a contemporary glassandchrome creation that i dont doubt irritated architectural purists next to it was a building undergoing a major refurbishment scaffolding studded its facade in front a walkway funneled pedestrians into two lines and i avoided it when i could the space opened up in front of our building and i worked my way through the spilling crowd the office building was mostly occupied by small firmssolicitors and marketing consultants and a temp agencyexcept for the top floor the sign on the elevator read cvx consulting the initials had been picked by the throws of a dart at a newspaper stuck to a dartboard one night i joked with lucy and my boss brandon that cvx stood for cant vanish exactly i stepped into a bare room where a guard named john a thicknecked brooklyn expatriate sat at a desk with enough firepower in his drawer to blow several holes in me john was reading a book on cricket and frowning me id long given up on deciphering that game i walked to the door facing me scanned my id card the door unlocked and i walked inside the cvx offices were deceptively spare the walls and windows were reinforced steel and bulletproof glass the computer networks were moated with the strongest firewalls available offices and a few cubicles a staff of eight people total it smelled like all offices a bit like ink burned coffee and dryerase and the meeting i thought started at ten was apparently already under way brandon was sitting in the conference room with three other suits from langley frowning at a powerpoint display that was three days out of date oh hell i stepped inside not at ten eight youre twenty minutes late brandon gave me a forced smile my apologies two of the suits were older than me and already looked doubtful the other was younger than me and he had a page filled with scribbled notes an eager type if lucys in labor youre forgiven brandon said he was originally from south carolina and hed kept the slow cadence of his speech during all his years abroad i have no baby and no coffee i said but i have a more uptodate presentation give me five minutes the suits nodded and all stood and introduced themselves shook my hand and went out to refill their cups with bad americangovernmentapproved coffee and i set up the laptop i dont like late sam brandon said but not with anger i dont either sir im sorry i hope you have good news for us these guys are from the budget office they think we might be wasting time convince them were not nothing so concentrates the mind as the possibility of the job being scrubbed when the suits returned with their bad coffee i had jumped past the insomniainducing series of bulleted slides and stopped on a blurry photo that filled the presentation screen the mans face was florid a bit heavy with small ears his hair was dark and curling as though it had just been ruffled gentlemen we are hunters our game is international crime rings operating with impunity across borders because they have managed to get their fingers deep into governments around the world i pointed at the photo think of us as lions chasing antelope this man is the weakest one in the herd were closing in on him he might be the cias most important target who is he one of the suits asked hes what we call a clear skinno name no confirmed nationality although i believe he is russian due to other evidence weve received we believe he moves and handles large amounts of cleaned cash to these global criminal networks i call him the money czar brandon said tell us about the networks sam sure the mafia is an oldschool criminal networka distinct leader a bureaucracy of muscle and money cleaners that support him newschool networks are highly specialized each partwhether muscle to enforce security or to intimidate or kill or financial to clean money or logistics to smuggle goodsis autonomous each is brought in only for specific jobs and each time it may be a different set of people to do the work its therefore much harder to break the network down to get any detailed information on how it works as a whole i know weve been paying particular attention to certain networks that might have government ties the youngest suit said theres a croatian gunrunner network we might infiltrate the ling smuggling family in holland the barnhill network in edinburgh the young suit was on my side i took that as a good sign the feds were able to break the mafia because it was a hierarchylowerlevel thugs could testify against the big guys but the only weak links here are the common elements that move from network to network i tapped the money czars ugly face on the screen this guy is the glue between some very bad people it goes beyond crime it moves into threats not only to our allies but to the united states this man may represent our best hope of uncovering some of the biggest threats to western security he doesnt look that scary brandon said and everyone laughed except me i was prepared to scare the hell out of them when i told them what i knew so the question is how do we find this money czar and my phone beeped when your wife is seven months pregnant you get a free pass on taking calls in meetings sorry i mouthed to brandon pregnant wife i said to the suits i stepped out into the hallway i didnt recognize the number hello monkey lucy said i need you to meet me outside um im in a meeting i need you to step outside now sam then i heard it an awful undercurrent in her words like a shadow eddying under summer water i started to walk to the door did you get a new phone i lost my old one this morning just bought a new one its been a rotten morning i heard the shaky tension in her voice you sick please just come outside bad news then to be delivered facetoface not in the office where emotion might be seen a coldness gripped my heart the bundle she had gone to the doctor something was wrong with the baby i hurried out of our offices past john the guard who had abandoned his cricket book for a british tabloid down the hallway where are you out on holborn are you okay no just come find me outside please i raced down the stairs six flights not waiting for the elevator i came out into the lobby no sign of lucy come out into the street she said please sam please whats the matter i headed out onto the busy street it offered a steady stream of pedestriansoffice workers couriers shoppers the inevitable london tourists two young women leaned against the building in fashionable coats smoking sipping tea from plussized paper cups between gossipy laughs i scanned the street no lucy where are you sam now please run i ran even before lucy said to because it was all so wrong i could feel it in every cell of my body i headed under the covered scaffolding of the building next door hurrying along the steady march of people finally i pushed past a man in a suit past a woman in a hooded sweatshirt i stopped when i stepped back out of the temporary tunnel there was no sign of lucy on the sidewalks in the herkyjerk of london traffic none i turned looked every way i heard my pregnant wife crying on the phone lucy lucy i gripped the phone so hard the edges bit into my fingers now i heard her sobbing let me go my eyes darted everywhere and i heard a car honk i turned and saw a truck whip around an idling audi thirty feet away the car facing me on the opposite side of the road lucy in the passenger seat my office building stood between me and the audi my first thought was no one stops on holborn the car was silver gray like the sky in the moments before rain a man sat in the drivers seat bent toward lucy then he straightened and i could see him better late twenties dark hair dark glasses square jaw i saw a flash of white as he turned his head the pale curve of a scar marring his temple like a sideways question mark lucy looked right at me then the blast hit a roar an eclipse of the sun like god stuck his hand between me and the sky i turned and the top floor of our building was shattering flame spouting out reinforced glass and ash and steel carving and falling through the air the ground shook a person halved burning fell to the street right by the pretty tea drinkers who cowered and staggered for the doorways cover as debris rained down my office of fake consultants was gone brandon the visiting suits the scribbling rookie my friends and colleagues gone rubble covered the street people landing on cars cabs and buses and london itself seemed to give out a scream formed of the thundering blasts echo against glass tower and stone courts the keen of car horns and the rising cry and stampede of the bystanders i couldnt see the audi anymore and holborn was a mad jumble of stopped buses and cars and chunks of concrete stone and steel i couldnt see i didnt think i vaulted onto the construction tunnel roof monkeyed up the bars i had to get above the haze i climbed fast then i saw the flash of steel gray the audi with my wife in it revved forward i saw the back of lucys head bent slightly as though to catch the breeze in the window driving with the window down helped her cope with her morning sickness i remembered it was a crazy thought lucy i screamed lucy i scrambled up the scaffold i had to keep her in sight find her above the cloud of grit below me was chaos i had to keep the car in sight i hurried up the scaffolding found the audi again the traffic thickened like smoke from a fire everyone trying to flee the blast i saw the audi turn right onto a side street revving onto the sidewalk to escape the impassable jam in the road nearly running down two women the scaffolding moaned heat surging through its joints i heard a massive roar turned saw that the edge of the scaffolding closest to my office building had been savaged by falling debris it was collapsing thundering down onto the pavement i vaulted from the railing bursting through the sheeted plastic onto a reconstructed floor i hit concrete coughing tried to roll i wasnt in the right shoes for this and my roll was rough i ran across the empty concrete glanced back to see the scaffolding twist and shred and tumble into the street the building shuddered and i thought its next i ran across the unwalled floor to the back of the buildingit cut all the way to a parallel streetand looked down past a web of scaffolding on the north side of the building that was intact i saw the audi forcing its way onto the narrow sidewalk a man in a suit kicking at the door in fury as it nearly ran him and a woman down it was thirty feet below me my wife looked up through the sunroof she saw me her eyes wide and her mouth a perfect little shock of o she started to reach upward her jaw moving and then the scarred man hit her with a solid punch across her mouth she slammed into the door i dropped down through the web of the scaffolding my blood turning to adrenaline i broke my descent with grabs but i let gravity do the pulling and i had never been so afraid in my life not for myself but for lucy and the bundle i couldnt lose the car he was taking my wife he had killed innocent people then i was on the ground and i dashed into the traffic a mini cooper barreled into the street right into my path and i wasnt even thinking i was only running for all i was worth i timed it going over the roof when i should have been run down by the car sliding with purpose and then i hit the street rolled down to my shoulders back onto my feet not crippled by the impact or the force the pain came later i didnt even know i was hurt the audi surged ahead into the crowd and i ran hard and saw it turn a corner i couldnt fight my way through the thickened crowd driven out from offices and shops the jam of cars and two buses paralyzing the traffic between me and the audi i saw the audi make another right i ran my foot a hot bright glow of pain i made it to the corner in the distance the audi inched past a delivery truck tires exhaling smoke for a moment in the tightness of its turn and then it surged forward i ran down the block and when i reached the intersection the car was gone the scarred driver had found an empty side street one empty of panicked traffic with shaking hands i tried to redial the number shed called me from there was no answer lucy was gone my office was gone everything was gone training bubbled to the surface in place of thought my fingers dialed an emergency number in langley words came to my mouth but i couldnt remember what they were help me my mouth moved shed gone everyone had gone in the heart of london the smoke rising like a pyres cloud of a life ended the sirens starting their mad keekaw blare a thousand people rushing past me i was completely alone ihad been in the cold dank prison for over a week when a new man sat across from me in the cell fresh talent to try and break me fine i was bored with the last guy my name is howell i have a question to ask you mr capra are you a traitor or a fool asked and answered i mumbled through the desert of my mouth i need an explanation mr capra the new interrogator leaned back in the chair he crossed his legs but first he gave his perfectly creased pants the slightest yank so they wouldnt wrinkle i hated that little yank it was like a razor against my skin it told me who had all the power in the room i had had no real sleep for three days i reeked of sweat if grief has a stench that was what i smelled like the new interrogator was fortyish african american with gray spiraling in his goatee and stylish steelframed glasses i told him what i told interrogator one and interrogator two i told the truth i am not a traitor i dont believe my wife is a traitor either howell took off his glasses he reminded me of one of my old history professors back at harvard a calm coolness surrounded him i think i believe you was this a trick no one else does howell rested the end of the glasses earpiece against his lip he studied me for a long uncomfortable silence i liked the silences no one called me names or accused me of treason he opened a file and he started the old litany again as if any of my answers might change he would keep asking me the same questions to wear me down to wait for my mistake your full name is samuel clemens capra yes he raised an eyebrow samuel clemens was mark twain hes my dads favorite author and my mother vetoed huckleberry and tom sawyer as choices normally that story would make me laugh but nothing was normal anymore i want to call my father before i answer your questions i said i hadnt asked for this in the past three days of questioning what would i say to him but now i wanted to hear the tobaccoflecked warmth of my dads voice i wanted to find my wife i wanted to be out of this awful dark stone room that had no windows it was stupid to ask but it felt like fighting back after the endless questions making my own modest stand i didnt think you got along at all well with your parents i said nothing the company knew everything about me as they should your parents didnt even know you and lucy were expecting did they no it seemed a shameful admission family strains should stay private you havent spoken to your parents for three years except for a brief phone call at christmas none of the calls lasted more than two minutes thats correct three years some have suggested thats how long youve been working against us you cut off your parents so they wouldnt be suspicious of your activities would not be involved in your treason you just said you believed i wasnt a traitor im telling you what others in the company are saying about you he leaned forward a classic sign of treason is emotional distance from extended family and friends i didnt cut my family off my parents stopped talking to me it wasnt my choice and i wasnt going to use my own child to get back in their good graces can i call my father will you let me do that no sam howell tapped the earpiece against his bottom lip and considered my file as though mining it for further pain i wondered what else was inside those few sheets of paper your wife called you and warned you to get out of the office before the bomb exploded she was being kidnapped i saw her struck by a man and why would her kidnapper allow her to call you i dont know maybe he wasnt in the car then maybe she had a phone but she didnt say she was being kidnapped she was trying to save me to get me out but not the rest of the office she didnt say evacuate sam did she i closed my eyes the stone of the cell floor chilled my bare feet no i was sure i was no longer in the united kingdom back in london the companythe term used for the cia by me and my colleaguesand british intelligence had heard my story and questioned me for three days i was given no advocate or lawyer then four thicknecked men came with a syringe held me still and i woke up on a plane i was in a company prison i guessed in eastern europe most likely poland these secret prisons were supposedly closed ages ago she got you and only you to safety you see thats our problem you walked out alone and then the office was destroyed maybe lucy didnt know about the bomb then the scarred man must have told her to call to get me out i had described the scarred man in detail but no one had brought me photos to look at a suspect to identify that scared me more than their questions and their needles why spare you howell asked i dont know then he surprised me the next question should have been about the briefing on the man with no name that id been giving brandon and the suits that had been the pattern of the first two interrogators tell me about the money what money he slid paper toward me an account number at a bank in england where lucy and i didnt have an account i studied the transaction history it included transfers to a bank in grand cayman a quartermillion dollars this is not our money this cayman account was used in a company operation last year lucy was the operations tech she was supposed to close the account when the job was over she didnt money was parked in this supposedly dead company account and then moved into this uk account with both your names on it and then moved out to a numbered account in switzerland where it was transferred to private bonds now we dont know where it is this is why people are having a hard time believing you sam i have no idea about this money this was bad very bad i didnt have access to or knowledge of these accounts conventional wisdom says the spouse always knows when the other is a traitor sam always howell said quietly he sounded like a teacher one with patience to burn no need to raise his voice the last two interrogators screamed at me howells calm was scarier like a still blade held an inch above the throat you dont know when the cut will be made always usually its the husband who turns traitor and the wife learns about it and then keeps her mouth shut either because she likes the money or because she doesnt want to see her husband go to jail was lucy recruited first or you or did they hook you together neither neither of us is a traitor i couldnt believe this of lucy i couldnt not my wife i didnt care what evidence they showed me it could not be real to believe it was to commit treason against the woman i loved my brain pounded with exhaustion my chest felt thick air in my lungs felt coarse as sand beyond hope do you know that term sam no its whats used to describe the state of being a traitors spouse we want to hope that the spouse is innocent that they dont know that their loved one has betrayed their country but we know realistically that they probably know about the treason they are therefore beyond hope right now sam that is you only i can help you tell me the truth i did nothing wrong i knew nothing about this money ive made it easy sam he held up a slip of paper a confession short and to the point you only need to fill in who you worked for sign it and were done i wont ever he lowered the paper one of you is a traitor sam either her or you tell me about this money sam the money i dont know the coldness spread to my skin you and lucy are both alive and everyone in your office is dead and she warned you out the scarred man hit her she hadnt gone willingly i could tell whos the money from the chinese or the russians a crime network like the ones you were investigating did you get turned while you were undercover who are you working for no one no one you were giving a presentation to a team from langley on the work you were doing yes tell me about it i tried not to laugh my notes for my talk were still vivid in my mind because of the terrible thought that maybe my work had gotten our office targeted were looking for a russian criminal i call the money czar he cleans funds for various networks i worked undercover for a few months last year making contacts in these networks mostly posing as an excanadian soldier based in prague who could provide smuggling routes for everything from knockoff cigarettes to guns bound for warlords in africa an informant in our employ in budapest got the job to courier cash and gold from the money czar to a russian scientist five million equivalent what was the scientist being paid for we dont know this scientist was kicked out of the russian militarys research programs because of his heroin addiction he set up shop as a brain for hire in budapest doing contract work the informant was the one who told us that this money czar had a russian accent i paused the informant and the scientist were both found dead a week later what kind of scientist was this man he used to work on nanotechnology nanotechnology yes the study of the control of matter on an atomic or molecular level most of the research today has beneficial commercial applicationssuch as more effective means of delivering medicines into the body or to specific organs it could have huge implications for instance in the fight against breast cancer or brain tumors or we could create medicines geared to specific peoples dna or much more sophisticated sensors to detect serious illnesses in our bodies or we could vastly expand the number of hours a computer battery can be charged and there are military and weapons applications to this absolutely i answered nanotech builds machines or materials on an incredibly small level and makes them powerful theoretically creating new kinds of armor to repel bullets or much stronger tanks or much more efficient guns creating bullets that could selfcorrect on a course once fired smaller nuclear weapons that have incredible guidance systems and produce virtually no fallout or imagine a bomb that releases a swarm of miniaturized robots that aim for human flesh or body temperature and inject a fatal toxin into every person in a twomile radius howell swallowed and his throat made a dry click so this money czar could have been financing weapons research yes and maybe whoever killed the scientist and the informant to protect your money czar came after you yes or more likely you got turned by the people you were chasing youre good at your job sam you could have found this money czar and maybe he offered you and lucy all that cash in this caymans account no they didnt want you and lucy talking and theyve taken her and you decided to keep your mouth shut maybe to protect her i can see the thoughts going across your tired beatass face sam no i wanted to drive howell and his insane theories through the stone wall your only hope sam is to deal with me tell me everything howell leaned in close to me and he put a large hand on my shoulder think how easy it will be all the weight will be gone sam and then we can work on finding your wife your child you want to be there when your child is born dont you lucys due date is in six weeks time tell me where we can find the people you work for and well find lucy you can see your wife hold your child he leaned back we checked with her doctor you and lucy didnt want to know what youre having but i know its a boy sam dont you want to see your son my son i was going to have a son if lucy was still alive howell was laying brutal trumps on the table one after another this unknown money my child maybe lucy no i could not believe it of her each word felt like a pebble in my mouth spit out one by one i cant tell you anything because i am not a traitor howell studied me in the long silence then youre a fool because your wife is the traitor and shes left you to take the blame no no she wouldnt she loves me the words sounded weak in my throat but i remembered that last morning with my lucy her shuddering atop me my hands on the curve on her bottom her breath warm against my throat talking to me about not taking chances running parkour and telling me she loved me and reminding me of dinner with the nice couples calling me monkey to soften her criticism of my running that was not a woman preparing to vanish from her own life he looked at me as though he were a teacher disappointed with his students performance she doesnt love you she left you holding the bag happy thanksgiving howell got up and left the lights went out and i sat in total blackness timeunmeasured passed my throat was molten parched like id reached in and raked the flesh with my own fingernails a knot of hunger tangled my stomach and i felt like i had fever i slid from the chair and lay on the cold floor i ate bread and water when it was brought to me i slept and i awoke unsure if minutes or hours had passed shivered against the stone i dreamed i was running parkour vaulting over walls flying between buildings every muscle afire with glory my mind clear and clean and precise then the wall where i was to land was gone and i plummeted toward a pavement covered with burning wreckage helpless out of control the lights snapped back on and howell was sitting in his chair as though hed been there the entire time in the dark but the suit was different i looked to see if he had any water for me to drink he didnt help me sam i looked at him how help me understand this most interesting information ive come across he said did you find lucy confusion clogged my brain my head felt thick with sleep the baby lucy is due soon you have to find her my voice grated like rock against sand the bomb howell said as though i hadnt spoken i have the forensic analysis of the blast pattern sam he pulled out a photo of the london office after the explosion the desk arrangement had our names on it s capra brandon gomez mcgill the conference room with the names of the three suits in the computer room a desk labeled l capra lucys desk my dead friends the photo painted a horror the smears of gore viscera blasted and cooked on the walls the blackened gaping holes in the floor in the center the smallest circle painted in red marked my desk in the center of the office the bomb was planted right under your desk it was disguised to look like a small external hard drive plugged into your system i stared at the map of destruction lucy handled all the hard drive installs in the office no how easy it must have been for her did she set up the bomb right under your bosss nose jamess nose victorias nose your nose each word felt like a knife sliding under my skin the bomb is placed where lucy can most easily hide it without anyone noticing did she feel some guilt sentencing her husband the father of her child to death so she warns you you walk out right before the explosion in case i didnt understand the implication shut up i said i had not snapped or growled at anyone i had focused and kept my calm while pleading my innocence but this now i couldnt take it shut up shut up shut the hell up help me prove this woman a traitor think think of what you must have known try to remember this woman not calling her lucy not calling her my wife trying to establish an otherness for her a separation between us no lucy is innocent my voice wasnt calm the bomb being planted under my desk unnerved me then maybe youre the one whos the bad guy he said maybe youre framing her maybe you planted the bomb did you have someone take her away kill her and your own child the rage buried in me surged like a killing fever i wanted to strangle the lies out of his throat i am starting to crack i saw my hands start to shake i felt heat rise in my eyes but i couldnt break he wanted me to surrender control i wouldnt there has to be another explanation i said that explanation is lucy the money the bomb it points to lucy she had the access to the account she could have smuggled in the bomb his voice slid low and soft howell had the barest southern accent i am your only friend left sam the rest of the company and our british friends want to see you burn i will help you but not unless you help me i saw how damned i was in their narrow gaze the evidence of the financial account the bomb hidden in a way that lucy or i could have done it that was all they needed i was screwed even being innocent you will never see the outside of this prison again if you dont tell me what you know stop protecting lucy or stop protecting what you thought she was he wanted me to call lucy a traitor to agree with him to accept this impossible possibility no shes innocent that man took her she got you out of there and then she left you behind she betrayed her country and then she betrayed you no howell slapped me hard i didnt expect it because he looked like a professor and professors dont slap thats reality coming and waking you up sam tell me what you know dont be an idiot if i wanted to bomb the building i wouldnt have been there i would have been long gone you know im innocent and youre just going through the motions because its easier to lean on me than to go find the real bad guys i have no deal to make because i have nothing to give then you are a prize fool he left and then he came back five minutes later with a cold bottle of water beads crowned the plastic and i wanted it so badly he set it down in front of me but i didnt reach for it i want you he said to entertain the possibility that nothing you knew about lucy capra was true tears welled at the back of my eyes i wont let him see i thought but cameras were pointed at me all the time he would see me weep on tape i kept my face still kept the tears inside for now i would wait for the darkness for the safety of the crook of my elbow i would not let them see me hurt he watched me like hed trumped my hand i know youre thirsty you havent had water in three days did you know it had been that long drink up sam i want your throat working you have things to tell me i took the water i drank it and as i finished he pulled out the earphones the eye covers two women wheeled in the cart with the meds sodium thiopental scopolamine experimentals say hello to my blood maybe they gave me all of themi felt more than one needle slide under my skin howell asked his soft questions again and this time i heard other voices asking me the same and i told them the bonemarrow truth i do not know i am not a traitor i never did anything wrong i babbled answers to every question about my life with lucy i told them about our lovemaking our friends in london our trips back home any times she went to the continent to explore on her own i didnt know what she did in those weeks i was undercover playing a role in prague pretending to be a smuggler looking for illicit goods to ship i told them whatever was in my brain i became an oil spill of words but there was the bomb and there was the caymans account and that was enough i must have known more they decided i must have had suspicions howell kept saying he wanted to believe me like that belief topped his christmas list i said i knew nothing so they moved on past the chemicals the eye coverswhich completely cut off my visionmade me feel like id been dropped into a hole that never ended the earphones blasted music into my head a hells jukebox of saccharine ballads braincrushing psychedelic rock i didnt recognize teethrattling rap the rest of the time the sound was this highpitched noise that made every nerve feel like it was sparking like a broken cable i lost all track of time of place of any sense that i remained tethered to the world the cure for that was pain howell wasnt there when guards came in and they beat me for a solid ten minutes fists and feet it was an expert asskicking they didnt mar my face but the rest of me purpled into a bruise i curled into a ball they gave me water let me spit out a gob of blood they looked at the gob as though gauging how much more i could take before passing a limit then they beat me again kicking me harder my spine and my legs felt on the verge of breaking they were delightfully precise careful not to break my ribs or my chin or my spine they asked the same questions i gave the same answers i dont know how long i resisted the sensory deprivation treatments minutes under the noise and the blackness can feel like endless hours lucy the bundle that was a boy that was the thread i seized the scant hope that i would be believed they had to be searching for her desperately they would find her and when they did they would find the answers the explanation as to why lucy and i were framed why they took lucy why they destroyed the holborn office find the line just like on the parkour runs there was a line to the truth i just had to find it they left me alone with my pain for a few hours and then they returned and they dragged me into another room they strapped me to a flat piece of wood it moved i felt my feet rise my head descended toward the stone floor no no no i fought against the straps the sensory deprivation was allowed it remained legal this no it wasnt howell standing above me a cloth in one hand a bucket in the other the man wore a hood i didnt know his voice i screamed for howell mr howell isnt here the hooded man said please dont please id been through this before in training i knew what horror was coming and i struggled against the bonds panic exploding in my chest like a mine because with the water on your face you say what you have to and if you know nothing you truly know nothing you will babble any torrent of words to get it to stop you will tell any lie the truth of my life was about to die in this room weve reached a moment of true unpleasantness sam he waited for me to answer all i could say in a broken voice i didnt recognize was please dont do this please for your sake i didnt know where the last words came from like i cared about this stupid heartless bastard who was nothing but a tool i didnt care if i could have got off that board id have strangled him with my own hands tell us who did you and lucy work for the company no one else he shifted the words who gave you the money that lucy moved through the accounts i didnt know about the money why did you bomb the office who was threatened by the offices work i thought of all the networks we tried to study the money czar who had no name his face displayed on the presentation screen in the final moments before the office was destroyed i didnt do it i didnt where is your wife start with any of those questions and we dont have to dance this dance i dont know please i hated myself for that please why was the holborn office a threat to your employers i have no employers jesus please believe me please my voice told him he was so close to breaking me so close he draped the cloth over my face youre not going to make it out of here to see your kid capra no i yelled no he gushed the water over my face i felt the water closing in on my lungs i writhed against the straps trying to move away from the awful steady flow the gush surged into what felt like a river i was drowning i started to babble nonsense random words lucy the bundle god no the scarred man innocent innocent i knocked myself nearly unconscious slamming my head against the waterboard he hadnt secured me correctly he slowly dragged the wet fabric off my face i begged for air then he put the soaked shroud back over my nose and mouth and then he started again i resumed screaming and babbling i was glad when they kicked me to the cold embrace of the cell floor that i could not hear or remember what i said some things are best lost to memory december came one of the guards mentioned to me that it was christmas day he did not use the word merry then january marched by me the babys due date january came and passed maybe my son was born now drawing his sharp breaths needing me and i was stuck in a rocky hellhole that day howell came into my cell your child was due today i looked up from the black bread and the potato soup i was having for lunch cooperate and maybe we can find her we have every hospital in europe on alert for her you could see your son sam dont you want to see your boy my face set into steel no matter how torn my heart felt yes but ive told you everything let me go howell let me go let me help you find her what would you have named him i didnt want to talk to howell about my lost son i didnt want to talk to howell period screw you i said what the hell would you care what we wanted to name our kid youre really angry today sam im sick of you of all of you of your utter stupidity howell studied me and then he stood heres the thing ive fought for you i believed you when you said you knew nothing i think you are an innocent man for what thats worth he dropped a piece of paper on the stone floor a photo of one of the ultrasounds the bundle in all his glory howell walked out i studied the picture my child am i a father has he been born i have to get out of here my kid needs me but i stayed sitting on the cold stone floor thinking a winter spent with cheek against stone i kept insisting on my innocence into february every day every aspect of my life was questioned dissected dissolved every day i was doubted do you know what that is like to not be believed to not be believed by the people who are your peers your friends your sole support when your family has gone missing to have your colleagues sure that you are capable of treason and murder you cannot build a crueler jail march came howell was gone there was no more waterboarding four different interrogators asked the same questions and listened to my litany of innocence one morning two thicknecked exmarines came in and held me down and slid a needle into my skin and part of me hoped this is it the forever dark the end now theyre done with me i woke up back in america the television mounted in the corner played comedy central i jerked around to look at the walls no window just white walls the hospital bed a chair the television with a standup comic roaming the stage screaming into a microphone making fun of newlywed guys for being lame and uncool restraints bound my arms to the bed the room smelled of disinfectant and lavender air freshener i was washed and clean for the first time in weeks cold against my butt i felt a bedpan and poking into my flesh i felt a catheter in my arm was an iv drip i stayed very still but all i heard was the soft dreamy hum of hospital equipment and airconditioning i didnt call out for the nurse i was clean and in a bed and not in a dank forgotten cell and no one was kicking me the comedian on the tv bitched about his wife he poked fun at the insane demands of his kids i wanted to strangle him for his blind ingratitude he didnt know how lucky he was then i just closed my eyes and i slept again clean and comfortable on sheets instead of stone when i woke my mouth tasted sour with sleep still bound bedpan and catheter a nurse entered the room and inspected me she didnt let her eyes meet my gaze hello i said she didnt answer where am i i croaked she still didnt answer she checked my vitals and made her notes and then she left i tested the strength of the restraints i wouldnt be breaking loose on the table now pushed to the side stood a green bottle of boylan bottleworks ginger ale my alltime favorite soda its made in new jersey and you cant get it everywhere and a bottle of heineken although since id taken up parkour i didnt drink very often both bottles glistened with beads of cold stacked next to it were books by my favorite authors pecan pralines my favorite candy a hubigs fried pie from new orleans a childhood treat from one of the few times when my folks lived in the states when i was a kid a prickle of sweat formed on my back this was some new torture then a man stepped into my room broadshouldered dressed in a neat bland gray suit gray tie blue shirt his hair cut down to a burr slices of gray in the goatee howell hello sam how are you today youve slept quite a bit which is just what you need to get back on your feet his voice sounded kind like he really cared how i was soft quiet and immediately i hated him again the past months had taught me that i had no friends and no patience with those who pretended to be my friend he saw the fire in my eyes and for a moment he glanced away where am i i said youre in new york city i will be your liaison what do you mean liaison youre being released he flinched a smile at me i didnt believe it it must be a trick i made myself breathe you found my wife no then why your innocence has been established now howells voice stiffened and the words felt a shade rehearsed we regret the inconvenience i could neither laugh nor howl at the four small words their pitiful sentiment their complete inadequacy to the hell i had endured when i found my voice it sounded cracked established how it doesnt matter sam we know youre innocent i closed my eyes then youre lying to me you must have found lucy no he said i swear to you we do not know where she is the silence between us broken by the comics rantings in the background i reached for the remote and my fingers fumbled for a grip howell picked it up and turned off the television i dont believe you now this is no trick sam howell said we know youre innocent just be grateful for your freedom grateful freedom the words sanded against each other in my brain you people tortured me you held me prisoner without a lawyer without cause it didnt happen sam slowly howell unbuckled the straps binding my legs to the bed he moved with caution like he was removing the top of a basket holding a cobra he looked up to catch my stare and swallowed as though realizing he should not show fear you will be integrated back into civilian life sam think of me as a parole officer innocent people arent on parole the company asked me to serve in this role im the only one who believed you do you remember i said i thought you were innocent i was your only advocate sam you were a pisspoor one howell gave a long low sigh and sat on the side of the bed i told the directors i thought you were telling the truth finally they believed me when when what i leaned forward i cant discuss it you owe me no we dont owe you a thing howell said you were too blind to see what was in front of you you know lucy is guilty tell me oh god confirmation of the impossible that my wife was a traitor do you want your freedom back sam yes then shut up swallow down every question and dont ask me about lucy he cleared his throat we need to talk about your immediate future though i sat up slowly my future is im going to find my wife and my child you are not she remains a national security matter as do you you will do as youre told and i would until i did what i wanted i could play the game i swallowed my questions my parents your parents think you want nothing to do with them sam lets keep it that way i was silent this was my shame normal people had normal relations with their parents mine werent quite normal at least where i was concerned of course your parents were thoroughly investigated they are a bit unconventional stay away from them oh that would be a loss for me i find them charming we like to sit in the garden and drink tea ive visited with them several times special projects branch at the company bought the house next to theirs in new orleans im their manufacturingrepresentative neighbor who travels a great deal weve had their house bugged for months tapped their phones watched them just in case their pregnant daughterinlaw contacted them or they attempted to make inquiries about you but only silence since they didnt hear from you at christmas they are a bit worried that the gulf between you cannot be bridged he shrugged dont take it hard we sometimes dont like the people we love he told me this like he was handing me a gift my parentsjust leave them alone then do as i say and the surveillance the investigation of them will end he raised his hands palms toward me i dont want to involve your parents theyre fine people sam i was being bribed fine i would protect my parents deal i cleared my throat its your lucky day you were never technically fired you are still under company command you have been assigned to my group i am your boss i wanted to say i resign but then let me help you look for her howell raised an eyebrow do you really want your job with us sam yes it was the first rational lie id told in months i didnt count any lies i had screamed during the waterboarding apparently none of my false information worked out for the company then here are your orders you stay put here in new york there is an account at a bank that has been opened in your name with a sizeable initial deposit enough to live on although i suggest you find work if only to keep your mind and hands occupied work but you said you remain on our payroll but your clearances are gone sam so find a job to keep you busy one that requires no travel and is not demanding i cant sit still not with my family in trouble howell rode right over that speed bump you want to help find lucy then do what youre told sit tight get a job a simple one ive only ever worked for the company i started straight out of college you tended bar in college though pour beers mix martinis the jobs are easy to find he shrugged as though all my training all my field experience in company work meant nothing i steadied my voice i was caught between rage and knowing that if i throttled howell id be back in the cell slowly unbound now i got off the bed howell steadied me i felt woozy from the drugs from inactivity i cannot put this more plainly i am going to find my wife my child you are going to follow orders or you will regret it mr capra you cant keep me if you break parole you will be back in prison facing charges ranging from money laundering to treason any proof of your innocence will be eliminated and you will be prosecuted it was a nasty bit of leverage anger colored his voice and i shut up so i could hear the deal the rest of my life hinged on what he offered you hunker down you dont let yourself get bored and you dont go to the press you dont go to your friends in the companynot that you have any left not everyone knows that your name has been cleared you let us look for lucy and you dont get in our way so what am i now worthless for the first time i saw in that horrible flinch in his eyes what i had never seen in the past months pity how are you worth anything to us sam you either knew she was a traitor and did nothing which makes you pure evil in the companys eyes or you didnt know she was a traitor and that makes you a pure fool i looked at him and then i looked at the spotless tile floor we were back to his original question to me after all my pain youll recuperate here gain your strength before we send you out into the world you lost a bit too much weight howell said lets go see what clothes we have to fit you then ill take you downstairs he got up and opened the cold beer for me he handed me the icy bottle weve made all your favorites spicy corn soup salad with blue cheese roast beef with horseradish mashed potatoes asparagus key lime pie coffee doesnt that dinner sound good my mouth watered to my shame i hoped the food would taste like ashes it sounds like a last supper now howell risked another very slight smile just do as we ask and forgive the months you made me suffer lets all just pretend it didnt happen it didnt happen god they needed me out in the world why there are clothes for you in the closet ill ask the nurse to get you all disconnected if you like and ill let you get dressed i started to pull off the medical sensor glued to my chest i do have one question for you sam he said i left the sensors alone what novem soles he said the words so softly i wasnt sure i heard what have you heard that term before novem soles sounds latin novem is nine what is soles suns nine suns did lucy ever use those words with you ever mention them this wasnt a casual question i stopped and i considered he watched me no what does it mean it sounded silly but the company gave computerselected codes to every job operation or project and this sounded like one of those code names nine suns it meant nothing to me he studied me and i wondered if the sensors on my chest were being monitored to see if i was lying howell smiled it means lets go eat that good dinner he went to the door and the nurse came in she removed the catheter and the sensors and put the iv on a trolley she helped me into a robe i was weak and now starving and i shuddered at the thought of accepting these bastards kindnesses food on a plate edible food not the slop theyd given me id eat it i needed my strength i stood up from the bed howell offered a steadying arm and i shook it away fine i would take their food and their clothes and their false solicitude and i would get back on my feet but i had no illusions i was not howells friend or someone that he wanted to help who might ever get his life or his job back his words it didnt happen rankled in my ear they hadnt found lucy in these long months or the man with the questionmark scar so they still needed me howell and his superiors had found something called novem soles whatever that was and they thought putting me back out in the real world might lead them to it i knew the truth i was bait bait for whoever set up me and lucy august holdwine drained the trace of whisky from the glass in front of him centered the glass back on the napkin on the oaken bar and studied me im not here to spy on you he said in case i need to state the obvious i know i said howell has people to follow me and make sure i look both ways before i cross the street they have a van and i think they call their moms three times a day you want another no i have to work tomorrow but he didnt stand up to rise august was a big guy about sixsix old college muscle that hadnt morphed all the way into fat but was considering the option he had blondish hair and apple cheeks and heavy muscles under the shirt he said uh maybe i shouldnt say anything about work im not bothered that you still have a job and im serving drinks i said bartending is honorable i think i would rather be serving drinks less stress want to trade august and i had gone through training together at the company me straight from harvard him fresh from the university of minnesota he was my opposite a farm boy whod spent most of his life in one place on land that had been in his family for seven generations i couldnt imagine such stability he had a broad open face the kind decent people trusted and a gravelly baritone voice he worked stateside in a satellite office in manhattan hed landed me the bartending job at ollies the company manufactured a resume for me as a bartender whod worked at decent joints in chicago and new orleans i hadnt lost my bartending skills from working through college and i liked being back with the glasses and the taps i could be around people but the bar separated us i was grateful none of my other friends in the company had bothered to call or express condolences i was tainted like howell said conventional wisdom dictates the spouse always knows treason is under the roof so i was beyond hope as howell put it suspect irreparably damaged goods except to august but that was fine august was the perfect friend to sit with in a bar you could talk to him about your darkest secret and know he wouldnt judge you or you could be silent with him and just watch sports and never share a thought either was cool with august i wanted to trust august but i couldnt either he was under orders to be howells tool or he wasnt and if he knew anything he would get in trouble once i put my plan into motion so early morning tomorrow he said i should go you got cows to milk i enjoyed teasing him about his farming past he didnt stand up from the bar do you want another drink i waited he looked up at me with his watery blue eyes what are you doing sam pouring beer mostly i glanced down the bar no other customers it was a monday night always the slowest at ollies odd because mondays sucked so bad that youd think most people would want a drink to wash the beginning of the week out of their mouths youre very quiet i dont have a lot to say august i dont know what you were told but not everyone at the company believes you turned most of your friends are still your friends most that warms the heart he shrugged he meant well but i guess he just didnt know what to say thousands upon thousands of people work for the company the traitors in its history are very very few and rightly unforgiven and yet theres no crowd here tonight what with my many friends i wiped down the already clean bar august picked up his glass and set it down when he remembered it was empty are you being brave in staying my friend august or are you just doing your job id intended not to push the subject but my patience was thinning im not here because anyone told me to be howell said you were cleared but you couldnt go back to work not yet im a lure to draw out whoever took lucy the idea being that i wasnt supposed to survive the explosion and she messed up that plan august said i know all that be bait then but dont think youre alone youre not we stirred up a pot august the office in london on this money czar guy on a bunch of criminal networks if you could help me find out if theres been any new evidence come to light on who was behind the bombing sam i cant i dont have that clearance but you could access the files he held up a hand i cannot end of discussion let them investigate be glad theyve cleared your name if they have he cleared his throat you have to consider the possibility lucy set you up for three years no maybe she wasnt dirty three years ago maybe she turned much more recently its very twilight zone to have a talk with your oldest friend from work that revolves around the theme my wife is not a traitor because pregnant women are notable for wanting to put themselves at risk of arrest and imprisonment august turned the glass in his hands im just saying then why save me i couldnt let the argument go dont be an idiot sam youre alive the sole survivor the company focuses on you not her youre in their grip it gave her a chance to run i cant think that because youre being a good husband i stared into his watery blue eyes because if she was dirty she still lived with me for three years and she knows that if she betrayed me and killed our friends and im alive to come after her i will so if she was dirty shed want me dead i kept my voice steady and calm so all this energy and youre still sitting here in brooklyn if i run they grab me and im back in a jail cell unless youre smart about how you run august i just got out of a company prison im not risking a return ticket we are not having this conversation august put his money on the table and said dont worry about the change okay i watched him leave its awkward to tip a friend and i didnt want him to but i slid the change into the tip jar i got back to work which involved making a pot of decaf for ollie and serving a group of wannabe artists who came in five minutes later for a round of pabst blue ribbon beers most people at ollies bar drank beer and wine but at least six times a day i made vodka martinis five times a day i poured whisky and now and then i made a margarita on the rocks there wasnt a frozen margarita machine it wasnt that kind of bar usually a couple of early customers at the lunchtime opening wanted bloody marys and i made them extra spicy and got bigger tips i made drinks and kept quiet and gained back weight id lost and slept a lot august came and drank during my evening shifts a few questions to my fellow barkeeps told me that he didnt come in on my days off i felt myself getting stronger but i was only running very basic parkour vaults onto railings and low walls because i was too out of practice and i didnt want to risk an injury i pretended not to notice the surveillance howell had put on me three rookies two on foot one in a van were nearly constant whenever i left the bar or my apartment they were testing me seeing what i might do how close to their orders i would stay or conversely waiting for someone to kill me i like bars i dont drink a lot but i like the air of a good barthe ripe wisdom of animated conversation the cutting smell of fine liquor the sound of laughter among friends ollies was a good simple bar quiet most nights a wide oaken bar surface stools topped with leather that bore the imprints of loyal and regular customers not a lot of kitsch on the wallsjust mirrors from the beer companies and framed photos of ollies father the original owner with many of his longtime customers the regulars were a bit of a mix older folks whod been in the neighborhood a long while younger folks with a bohemian bent who might be borrowing money from parents to pursue art or internships now and then the manhattancommuting professionals would slum at ollies and they tipped well and drank imports and more lavish cocktails but the people most of them were nice no one asked me questions i just served the drinks made idle talk when required and no one knew my hell the company got me an apartment three streets over from ollies on the edge of williamsburg in brooklyn it wasnt cheap but i wasnt paying the rent and the building i was in was seeing several units remodeled so i didnt have many neighbors howell no doubt liked my isolation i assumed that ollies and my place were being bugged perhaps even with cameras hidden inside probably installed by august i found the bugs four of them and the next morning i walked straight to the van and as they stared at me in surprise i laid the bugs on the van roof in a nice straight line then i walked away the next day they had a new car to follow me in and i didnt find any replacement bugs didnt mean they werent there though it was like life in a cage but it wasnt the stone prison cell i wondered how long howells men would keep an eye on me and if i didnt draw out lucys kidnappers if theyd shutter me back behind bars i thought about how to escape i would do myself no favors by rushing i was still in a cage but a cage where i could move i did not want to be back in the polish prison and when i wasnt serving drinks i thought about lucy and the bundle one day in late march i arrived a bit hurt a bicycle courier had sideswiped me while crossing a street and id fallen scraping my forearm my shadows did nothing to help me i rolled up my sleeve to keep the shirt clean and went into the front it was early afternoon on a saturday and only one customer sat along the bar she was a few years older than me maybe thirty pretty but with eyes of hard quartz a slash of a mouth her cheekbones would have made a photographer contemplate a next great shot she wore black slacks and a dark sweater her hair was blondish the color of fresh straw and cut to just above her shoulders she picked up her neat whisky drank it carefully she moved with precision she was not looking at me but i thought she was entirely aware of me my first thought was shes major trouble do you have a firstaid kit i asked ollie yes in my office ollie sounded irritated id interrupted a discussion between him and the woman he jabbed a thumb at me this one runs like a maniac bouncing off stairs and buildings and such hell fall and break his neck and then ill be out a halfway decent bartender ollie felt selfesteem to be overrated the woman surveyed me lart du deplacement her voice was low and cool like a summer breeze coming out of a trees shadow and she had an odd accent i couldnt quite decipher she was beautiful to look atalthough i had no real eye for any woman but lucybut i did not like her but shed used the original french name for parkour running i nodded are you a traceur i asked a term for parkour runners drawn from the french term for a special kind of bullet that leaves a trail oh no i used to live in paris i used to watch the kids trying parkour running along the edges of buildings throwing themselves from rooftop to rooftop amazed that they didnt break their legs she smiled the slashsmile again i wished i had their nerve their fleetness i say if you want to run an obstacle course get on a track ollie poured more whisky in the womans glass although she hadnt asked but lifes an obstacle course the woman said the runners run in the world we live in not an artificial one she turned back to me i always thought they looked like animals i raised an eyebrow in their grace wolves on the street hunters the runners looked to me like a pack closing on prey the woman sipped her whisky i have a fondness for wolves it was exactly the sort of bizarre comment you hear in a bar that would make no sense anywhere else but seems reasonable in dim light with the sting of booze on your lips ollie stared at the woman auditioned an unsure smile and decided to end the discussion of wolves with introductions hey sam this is mila mila offered a hand i shook it are you a regular mila im still learning whos who in ollies kingdom shes a wandering regular stops in when shes in town which is only like three times a year and then i cant get rid of her for a week ollie grinned she keeps wanting to buy the bar from me but you know i will never sell i can work on him for you i said with a polite bartender smile im sure he wants to retire to florida oh god no ollie said new york till i die he wont sell but he listens to my proposals because he sells me a bottles worth of glenfiddich during that week mila kept her hands folded on the bar in front of her primly nice to be able to travel i said the world is a smaller place these days much smaller mila shruggeda small elegant gesture be careful on your parkour runs sam ollie will not spare the whip if youre on crutches sam i dont need to whip the others jesus mila you cant believe it how hard is it to pour neatly and quickly and accurately into a glass to pour gravity does the work this is not surgery i tell you that dayshift guy he sloshes my profit margin onto the floor and i mop it up i raised my arm i better bandage this i found the firstaid kit in ollies cramped office there was a desk with scatterings of papers an ancient grinding pc ollie had never quite mastered id had to help him do searches on the web and also recover a lost spreadsheet and a safe the safe would not be difficult to crack it had a keypad and considering ollies general loathing of technology i suspected the pass code would be a simple one to guess arm tightly bandaged and dressed to work i went back out to the bar mila was gone bills tucked under her glass she was an excellent tipper she completes me ollie said damn i like her but theres no hope wheres she from everywhere if howell wanted to have me followed by someone other than his normal teams or wanted to insert someone into my life he might pick a person like mila or if the money czar was coming after me he might send someone like her but but she had a history with ollie unless ollie was lying about that and was in howells pay hello madness you see how your mind starts to twist you suspect everyone i went back to wiping down the bar trying to blank my mind hey i got this for you ollie pushed a thick book at me i looked at the cover a bartenders guide i opened it to the end to see how many pages it was very comprehensive preparation is key so you dont mix drinks wrong and waste liquor ollie said take it home i will never make most of these drinks you strike me as a guy who likes to be prepared ollie was right the week inched past dave with his budweiser meg with her pinot grigio the alton brothers with their pints of guinness every friday night theyd watch the pour you did as though you were splitting a diamond i worked i ran and howells two shadows followed me everywhere i went at night i lay in bed and i flicked through the fivehundredpage bartenders guide it relaxed my mind to consider the thousands of cocktails crafted by humanity each a perfect little mix of what was at hand to produce a desired result that was the pattern of thinking i needed to solve my own problem what elements mixed together in what order to create a sublime result how to get a gun how to get documentation to get overseas how to escape howells constant watch during the next week ollie fired a bartender he didnt like hired a new one so hed have a fresh face to bitch about august only showed up twice watched part of a basketball game didnt have much to say to me i felt he was trying to summon the courage to broach a topic but didnt know how to start then there was the lovely mila she came in for four more nights discussed world politics with ollie and asked me about my parkour runs and nothing else but i felt her watching me as i worked as though taking my measure ollies mother in new jersey got sick and he had me manage the bar for two days one night i lifted prints off the safes keypad found prints on only four keys same four numbers as the bars street address i tested the code the safe opened inside was a cash bag a glock with three rounds of ammo and ollies passport used once three years ago to visit ireland i left everything where it was cleaned off the keypad and felt relief i could get to a gun when i needed one because i thought the time had come to move howells followers had been a bit lazy not coming up on me when the bicyclist hit me they were slacking or howell was loosening the leash on me theyd convinced themselves that i was willing to sit still that was the key to escape now i knew where i could steal a gun but i had no passport and i needed to get back to europe lucys trail started there but i didnt know where i could obtain fake documentation in new york passports now have digital watermarks and subtle chips and they cant be forged as easily as they used to be you need someone who can acquire the special paper used in the passportsusually by bribing someone who might send documents in a diplomatic pouch or works in government printing it didnt have to be an american passport in fact it would be easier for me to have one from belgium or the uk or canada belgian papers particularly are known for being easy to forge so i had to find a way to find a contact who could get me a passport that could pass muster i knew the street value of a false passport was around eight thousand dollars i would have to either save or steal the money and id have to lose my tails to find a seller i bought a cellular phone prepaid close to the local brooklyn flea market using the crowds to lose howells shadows for a few minutes to make the buy i made some discreet ventures calling my noncia contacts in prague and paris and london looking for someone who could help me get back to europe no one i called knew i was part of the company i used an old identity from the prague sting a former canadian soldier named samsonclose enough to sam so i wouldnt ever tonguestumble using itwho operated as a smuggler and hired gun i got stonewalled for three days until a friend in london mentioned a broker in new jersey named kitter who could set me up with belgian papers i called kitter to arrange a meet in bryant park in midtown manhattan the next day i dodged my shadows by going into olliesthe tails did not sit in the bar they watched from outsideand then heading out the back of the building down a side alley through a deli if a shadow there saw me and i had to assume they would it made sense to dodge into a department store and exit out the back hurrying into a hotel across the street i watched for familiar facesits easy to dump out of a suit into casual wear you cant rely on clothes as identifiers you can only rely on the face i felt clean and i grabbed a taxi to manhattan an hour early got off at grand central felt i was still walking clean i kept scanning the patterns of peoples movements for any followers as i walked through building lobbies and hotel lobbies in and out cutting through doubling back not spotting howell or any of his regulars following me the man fitting kitters description sat on the edge of a bench ipod earphones in place wires trailing inside his jacket he was reading the wall street journal thin blue jeans flannel shirt i sat on the other edge of the bench he pulled out his earphones but he didnt look at me our mutual friend sent me i said i need documentation a tickle surged at the back of my throat i felt the need to rush stupid but id been waiting days weeks months for a chance to track lucy i was like a dog straining at the leash ready to run how could i wait anymore i dreamed of my family every night you have the photos and the money four thousand and the photos half up front half when i got the finished passport he took the envelope from me and told me to wait meet me at the starbucks on the north side of grand central in three hours kitter stood and walked off i sat for a moment thinking good then i stood and started to walk and my stomach wrenched forty feet away stood howell hands tucked inside his overcoat i turned around kitter and my money were gone i sat back down i stayed on the bench and howell walked up to me he didnt sit i dont blame you he said my wife my child id be doing whatever i could to get to them can i have my money back no let it be a lesson learned youre the one who needs a lesson i said i could draw out lucys kidnappers if i could get back to london i know i could we cant trust you look how youve disobeyed instructions but you said you dont blame me you have not been fired sam and your job classification has been reassigned so that you cannot resign without the permission of the director you do not have that permission youre ours do what youre told and be glad youre not locked in a cell for the rest of your life we have been generous to you go back to that charming neighborhood bar smile at people be glad youre not sucking cold soup out of a wooden bowl and being beaten every night i shook my head i dream about my son i said did you have that in your file howell i dream about my wife and my child because i know shes innocent and i know she and my kid are out there and you are in my way i heard the iron growl in my tone for the first time in a long time he was unimpressed youre in your own way go home sam play nice i wont be so forgiving next time there was a debate in the office about whether to shoot you on sight for attempting to acquire forged documents your actions could be those of a desperate man or a guilty man i argued for desperate and thank god for you i won but desperation fades do this twice then youre guilty you dont have the balls to arrest me because you need me out here as bait i said i call your bluff stick me back in the cell im not sitting still howell go home and well pretend it didnt happen that really is your favorite phrase isnt it it didnt happen but sticking my head in the sand doesnt work for me howell turned and walked away from me lighting a cigarette as he walked blowing out an annoyed plume of smoke he was wrong desperation doesnt fade it just gets stronger i watched him walk away and then i got up and walked in the opposite direction i took the bus back to brooklyn i didnt bother to try to shake any shadows it made the trip much faster i went to work listening to ollie tell me the same stories hed told me yesterday drawing lunchtime halfpints of harp and budweiser jetting sodas into glasses listening to regulars prattle on about their problems with difficult clients or troublesome bosses or wives who just didnt understand and when ollie bitched about not getting full shipments of glenfiddichhe was a crate shorti thought of an escape from this second prison august was sitting on the stoop at my apartment building when i got home im in trouble i said are you i sounded like a fifth grader caught skipping school he looked out onto the street like he was back home surveying the windswept plains from what i heard it didnt happen howell is if nothing else consistent i think youre lucky youre not dead you owe howell bigtime i am never going to be in that mans debt plus i didnt know what you were up to he said with a shrug can i have a beer you could have gotten a beer at the bar im tired of hearing ollies opinions august said sure we walked up to my apartment it was bare furnished only with the secondhand stuff the company had bought before i moved in i opened the fridge and handed him a cold heineken you cant run sam he said popping the little kegshaped can you should have told me that this morning i said your stunt set off a wildfire here some people wanted you put back into jail others took it as a clear sign that you were dirty howell fought for you i thought you should know you have one other friend than me and thats howell what is novem soles howell asked me about it it connects to lucy somehow and the london bombing never heard of it and you shouldnt be asking questions not today when youre lucky to be out of a noose maybe this is the group that has her i want you to see what you can find about it please you know i cant share any classified stuff with you then why are you here august a free beer his cheeks reddened i am here to give you a warning he said youre a horrible embarrassment sam the coverup that was involved in london to keep from the press that it was a cia front that was bombed was enormous nearly two dozen people dead were lucky it wasnt worse the british are furious and theyd just as soon kill you if you set foot back on their soil and for the few that think you might be telling the truth no ones taking a bullet for you im telling you watch your back higherups who normally get their way have argued for you to be terminated a hungry souls bound to pick up on the sentiment and will figure they might get a promotion if you conveniently disappear or die howell using you as bait and howells defense of you be damned has the order been issued it wont be an order nothing written just a wish made and a wish granted like king henry talking about thomas becket will no one rid me of this turbulent priest he finished his beer watch your back turbulent ill be fine he pulled two phones out of his pocket handed one to me here only you have this number if someone comes after youcall me ill help you my only friend i didnt want him to see the heavy swallow in my throat thank you august i watched him leave and then i went to bed i think best in bed i cleared my mind by paging through the thick bar book ollie had loaned me every success in life was like a cocktail a careful blending of elements in exact proportions done in correct order i put the bar book down and i lay watching the ceiling hatching a plan i awoke to the barest sound i didnt move it was a footstep and then the slightest click of a door closing i was bait and someone was hooked i could lay still i could get up and see who it was i could wait for one of howells rookies to crash in the door and save my ass but howell for all his warm words to me didnt need me alive after the bait was taken if this was someone from the scarred man he could dispatch me and the watchers could catch him later i wasnt sure the shadows were even listening to me since id tossed them their bugs or maybe it was someone like august had said ridding the company of their great embarrassment i listened for the next footfall didnt hear it i got up from the bed with enormous care scooted the pillow where i should be moved on cat feet to the corner of the room behind the door i heard nothing else maybe i had dreamed the footfall i stood in the darkness and a crazy thought wormed its way into my head its lucy come home finally shes gotten away and shes found me it was lunacy to think it but i did the air conditioner kicked on the soft somnolent hum masked the intruders movements i had no weapons nothing i waited i expected the intruder to kick in the door and lay a round of fire into the bed didnt happen slowlyas slowly as a door opens in a nightmare that floods you with dreadthe door opened the hinges moved in silence i waited no convenient glow of moonlight lit the stage for killer or victim the dark in my bedroom was nearly total then a tiny flash of light sparked seeking the bed a snap of silenced bullet hitting the mattress i slammed the door into the intruder hard i heard him fall back onto the floor and in the thin gleam of light from the den window he swiveled the gun toward me i powered my foot into his wrist and the bullet skimmed along the expensive hardwood i kicked the gun loose then away the intruder stayed as silent as his gun no yell no cry out he was taller than me and i felt hard muscle power into my chest as he drove me back into the bedroom we landed on the bed and he with crisp efficiency yanked a length of sheet around my throat i hardly heard his breathing increase in heaviness from the exertion he started strangling me and i seized the pillow and pressed it hard into his face silent standoff as the oxygen deprivation kicked in for both of us the darkness deepened i let go of the pillow and he tightened the sheet around me with a renewed vigor i piledrove fists hard and sharp into rib cage harder sixth blow i felt bone crack and the intruder gasped and eased on the strangulation i was sick and dizzy struggling to breathe but i launched myself free of the sheets and aimed a shattering kick into his face the intruder fell off the bed and i grabbed at the lamp i missed and my hand closed on the bartenders book ollie had given me i slammed its fivehundredpage hardcover spine hard against the intruders throat and pressed downward as he struggled on the floor he tried to kick me loose but now i had breath and i had fury there is a primal flutter about killing someone who comes into your house intending you harm awful atavistic shudders i could feel waves of energy pouring from the ganglia at the base of my spine that ancient seat of instinct i gritted my teeth harder his struggles grew more frantic i put all my weight onto the bartenders book i pressed my knees against him i wanted him unconscious so he could wake up bound and answer my questions but then i felt his windpipe break and the crack sent a sick tremble up my arms the kicking stopped and i yanked the book off him the intruder said his first words just a gurgle of breath maybe he called for his mama maybe he called me a bad name maybe he cursed whatever boss sent him to his death i expected howells rookies to crash in if theyd eavesdropped on murder but no no one was coming they hadnt put in replacement listening devices i went and stood in the corner on my bedroom and looked at the splayed body and considered the problem after a few moments my head was clear i had a dead body in my apartment i dragged him into the bathroom shut the door and turned on the light i eased him into the bathtub easier to clean dead bodies release stuff i had never killed a man before ever the body count on my jobs had been well zero i fooled people into telling me things and then i left them i did not kill them i never had need i am a killer now i thought and another calming voice rose in my head stop it you did what you had to do keep doing what you have to do killing slices your life into a before and after i was firm in the after because the alternative was to be the body lying in the cool porcelain tub i leaned against the wall and let my gaze focus on the intruders face he was around my age midtwenties oliveskinned with dark short hair big ears a wide mouth a roman nose that id broken with my kick he wore black jeans a black tshirt a black denim jacket dark heavy boots i searched him a heavy knife in the boot hed never had a chance to go for of swiss manufacture an extra clip for his gun in the jacket pocket a cell phone small light not packed with features just a plain cheap model that was practically disposable no passport no id so presumably hed left those stashed someplace on his upper arm there was a small delicately crafted tattoo a stylized blue nine in a curving beauty the top curve of the nine was an orange sun with short spiky rays nine and sun nine suns novem soles my head felt a little swimmy i checked his wallet a wad of dollars another wad of euros wedged in the folded corner of one of the euro bills i found a rail ticket used from paris to amsterdam the ticket was three days old hed come to amsterdam from paris and then here one could presume a man sent from europe to kill me i had a problem someone had taken the bait howell would want to know but given augusts warning maybe this guy wasnt from the scarred man he could be company stationed in europe dispatched by one of my detractors who still thought me a traitor i opened his phone the only referenced activity was a text sent from the phone six hours earlier the text read arrived at jfk i recognized the country code for the netherlands i pressed the number to send another text what the hell lets play i thought capra done i typed but problem followed by surveillance clear now but they may have seen face within one minute the phone vibrated in my hand the text message displayed do not return now lay low destroy this phone and i will destroy mine call backup number in three days good luck well that was not helpful english sent to a dutch phone number meant little practically everyone in holland spoke english including any company operatives there who might consider me a traitor worth killing and if the person on the other side decided to call this number and saw that the phone still received calls or textshmm hed realize his buddy had disobeyed orders and figure out that said buddy might be dead understood i texted back hoping to get more i hope he suffered was the answer wow he did i texted back i knew this was a huge risk it might raise suspicion that i wasnt following orders the call failed the other end had broken or dismantled the phone i was texting to ether i turned on the lights in the apartment i found the bullet buried in the bookcase it had sliced into a copy of great expectations i pocketed the bullet and threw the shredded book in the trash under the kitchen sink i went and stared at the body how was i going to get it out of here there was not only the matter of the neighbors but howells watchers might check the apartment at any time when i was at work and i wasnt inclined to call howell and say someone took the bait until i knew who this someone was my link to novem soles whatever it was was that someone in amsterdam wanted me dead and thought they had gotten their wish i could call august but what could he do for the next hour i retrieved the bullet from the mattress made the bed tidied the apartment then sat and paced and thought about what to do with this dead body there was a quiet knock at the door it was four in the morning i took the intruders gun and went to the side of the door howells soft voice came through the wood sam yes i wasnt sure i wanted to open it are you okay i got a report your lights have been on for a while i cant sleep open the door i tucked the silencercapped gun in the back of my pajama pants and made sure the tshirt covered it i opened the door howell stood there in jeans and a black sweatshirt is everything okay i let him step inside and then i shut the door i hoped he didnt have to use the bathroom you get a call if i leave my lights on yes especially on a day like today when you tried to run i couldnt sleep youre not up thinking about a new way to run no its just standardgrade insomnia that is the curse of accused traitors i hope to get an ambien endorsement next week i kept my voice steady so unbelievably iamastatue steady youre tense you showing in the middle of the night reminds me that im basically still your prisoner tension is a byproduct i shook my head honestly i cant believe you get up out of bed in the night to come check on me you matter to me sam i know you want to believe the whole world is your enemy but im not i wanted to believe him i could hand over the intruders phone and you know validate howell show him the novem soles tattoo and say well you asked if id heard of it and now i have make him happy but howell and his peers had been so ready to believe the worst of me for so long i had no reason to trust them and whoever was gunning for me thought that i was dead i had to take advantage of that temporary illusion i had to move quickly howell said well if youre all right i appreciate the concern i didnt look at him it just occurred to me that maybe i had marks on my throat from the intruders attack or bruises on my face i hadnt looked in a mirror i think now i can sleep i mean knowing that your team is watching over me you all are better than a night light he shook his head at my sarcasm if theyd watched everyone enter the building then theyd notice on their logs that a guy in dark clothes whod entered at some point hadnt left questions would be asked probably by the morning i didnt have much time i met howells gaze howell looked at me and he tried god help him a smile i know this is a pressure cooker just be patient sam the truth will come out im sure of that howell im all about the results the results were in the tub and i smiled at him the tentative way you do when you want a job and youre not sure the interview went well he left i went back into the bathroom and i looked at the dead guy for a minute i looked at the useless phone number on his cell and then i took apart the phone i didnt want whoever wanted me dead to be the least bit suspicious i went next door to an apartment under renovation and i picked the lock then i carried the body there and put it in the bathtub i cranked the airconditioning to its highest setting the body would start to stink in the next day which was saturday but the remodelers didnt work weekends so as not to disturb the current tenants so i might have two days before the body was found if i was extremely lucky fine i would be gone by then i put the pieces of the cell phone into a plastic bag i could throw away after i left the apartment i didnt want the company finding it after i was gone i didnt want them on my trail i went back to bed and i thought that having killed i would never sleep again but i slept the deep and restful slumber that comes after making a hard decision my spark of inspiration came from a complaint ollie had made about some missing imported whisky because there are thousands of containers holding crates of fine whiskies shipped from ireland and scotland and nearly nine billion metric tons of all sorts of cargo shipped on the seas every year these goods are mostly carried in two hundred million containerstwentyfoot or fortyfootlong steel coffins you can fill with whisky or shoes or computers or frozen meat or whatever even me many cargo ships carry six thousand containers or more almost none of these containers are inspected for contraband a busy port may see thirty thousand containers a day enter and then be loaded onto rail and trucks as the ships arrive to deliver their cargowhether in new york or boston or los angeles or houstonthey are met by a fleet of trucks stop the containers to conduct detailed inspections which involves offloading a container onto a truck hauling it to a scanner having bureaucrats complete paperwork and watch the inspection unpack and then repack if any anomalies are found and then reload and return to a truck and you get a logistical and financial nightmare any inspected container creates a delay strains a link in the surprisingly delicate economic chain trucks bring cargo or empty containers to the port and they take away cargo from the port stop for inspections and the trucks and the trains moving the raw goods and finished products stop the stores dont have necessities on their shelves the shoppers complain the stores lose profits the shareholders scream bloody murder the politicians listen this is the big gaping hole in our armor the security people brag that six percent of containers get inspected that math means ninetyfour percent dont but that number lies six percent at a major port would be nearly two thousand containers a day it simply doesnt happen i could get to europe if i could get inside a container the odds of being caught in an inspection were very low hide in the steel box for seven to ten days get spit out in london or more likely rotterdam the biggest european port then hitch a boat into london start looking for lucy and my son all i had to do was smuggle myself amsterdam edward loved fear the smell of it in the skin the taste of it in the saliva the feel of it in the drumming heartbeat fear was the most powerful force in the world edward knew fear was the engine for religion the spark for war even the kindling for lovebecause all people are afraid to be alone fear had been the key to breaking the young womans soul edward sipped his coffee at the kitchen table and considered the past three weeks his experiment had proved to the malcontents and lowlevel criminals hed formed into a loose gang that a careful application of abuse drugs and isolation coupled with a consistent dose of rape and frequent threats of execution could produce desired effects he could tell each morning that the groups nervousness about the kidnapping had lessened the ransoms were paid and the young woman had begun to drift into their circle it wasnt so different from his student days as an actor you created a character and stepped into the skin now hed done that for the young woman he had remade her into a new character edward made it clear to the others that no one else was to touch her no one else was to speak to her without his permission she was his clay he knew though that they listened at the closed door as he told her of her evils and the evils that she and her father had done while he held the knife to her throat and pushed himself inside her he knew they eavesdropped on the disintegration of another human being and hed told her they were listening and it made her more afraid it was lunchtime and most of the group had gone for a walk around amsterdam to enjoy the sunny cool of the day the others were eating in the main room he could talk to her alone now alone was best he opened the knapsack and looked at the most interesting gear that she had rigged for him it had taken a long while to get all the materials but now it was done and there was only the final step his only worry was simon who had to lay low in brooklyn now that sam capra was dead but would be in touch no doubt in a few days he put down his coffee cup and went upstairs she was kept in a small closet in the corner he told the gang she was frightened of enclosed places and her claustrophobia had played a critical role in her unraveling research was so important he unlocked the door and inched it open she lay curled in the dark holding her stomach trembling the room was not cold but still she shivered she stared at him not drawing away just lying there waiting to see what he would do it is an important day he said he did not climb atop her pushing her legs apart and easing down the sweatpants she wore for his pleasure he did not yell at her about why everything in her old life was bad and disgusting and criminal and an affront against human dignity and how they fought against injustice he did not play her videos showing the burned people the shot families the results of her fathers commerce the rest of the gang loved his speeches they leaned against the door and listened to him preach to the girl he had read a book on how the symbionese liberation army had brainwashed patty hearst and it held many useful and fascinating tips for reshaping a woman into a pawn so far his approach had borne fruit after a few hundred hours of careful torture the young woman was quiet and pliant now a textbook victim of intimidation and fear suffering was a condition that forged strength and edward needed her to be strong what do you want to tell me she glanced at the door theyre not out there he said its only you and me he smiled it would let her know that it was okay to smile so you can use the toothbrush today and the toilet and then we will take a walk a walk yes i have a job for you one that is very important edward helped her to her feet and steered her into the small bathroom she stank of sweat she would need a shower before she could venture into public it was important she not be noticed or remembered he opened the door and told her to clean herself she nodded not looking at him he went downstairs and into his bedroom where he had bought new clothes for her modest slacks a plain blue scarf she could pull over her mouth when needed to help mask her face a gray pullover she would be practically invisible he came out and glanced in the kitchen demi stood at the sink frowning whats the matter he said demi said piet went upstairs he said you are handling the woman wrong that you dont know how to break her entirely that he will do it edward turned and ran up the stairs he tried the bathroom door locked he kicked it in and he could see piet bending her over the lavatory starting to inch his pants down he held an antique short japanese sword in his hand a wakizashi teasing its sharp edge along the womans back as though her spine was a whetstone she shivered in silence screaming for help was long past her abilities edward pulled his gun from the back of his pants and put it at the base of piets neck i beg your pardon he said thats my science project she needs to be properly broken piet said and its not fair you get all the fun edwards hand trembled pull your pants up and go downstairs she has a job to do today critical you would traumatize her now if you break her right nothingll traumatize her and thats the point she feels nothing then then he said looking at edward in the mirror what job is she doing a job for which she is uniquely qualified edward fought down the urge to splatter piets inconsequential brains across the faded paint of the bathroom wall he wiggled fingers in piets face touch her again and her skin is the last thing you will feel why dont you want to share little miss succulent here edward didnt like the glint in piets eyes piet was useful but only to a point however he could make trouble and it was important there be no trouble not now not when he was so close so he said because i dont have to piet took the small sword away from the womans spine and walked out of the bathroom edward holding the gun at his side piet turned and smiled back at the young woman who looked away from him covering her nakedness edward closed the door behind piet the woman started to shudder and edward put a protective arm around her shoulders did he did he he didnt finish the question she shook her head he inspected her back a scratch but the wakizashi sword that was piets pride had not made a serious mark its because youre so important to me that he wants you edward said youre not here all the time she spoke very softly im everywhere all the time he said his voice cold im even in here he tapped her forehead now clean yourself he went downstairs piet sat alone in the kitchen people always seemed to clear a room when piet entered it was time to get leverage over piet so he made no further trouble your initiative inspires me edward said come along on the job since youre curious where are you going piet sounded a bit nervous edward smiled centraal station it was amsterdams main train hub on the north side of the city are you letting her go piet asked demi a thin dutch blonde stepped back into the kitchen arms crossed dont be silly she doesnt want to leave me you will walk with us demi you too go get the handheld camera we have footage to shoot piet looked uncomfortable i want you there because i trust you and if you are there i think she will do whatever i say piet would be a spur to her to do what must be done and piet would then be in his power the woman came downstairs slowly she glanced about uncertain her hands trembling she had not been left alone outside of the closet since being brought to the house three weeks ago but she had made no trouble now edward thought and he flicked a smile at piet the hearst approach worked break tear down and give her the barest bit of hope to rebuild she glanced once at piet and her mouth trembled are you making me leave she asked edward of course not yasmin you belong to us now and we to you yes she said her voice small shed fought back hard the first two days that memory of defiance in her face seemed distant now today is about your father edward made a click in his throat he is dead to you do you remember yasmin yes she said after a long silence hes dead to me hes a bad man yasmin your old world was very bad isnt that right weve saved you from that evil he lingered on the last word evil wasnt a word you got to use in every conversation but we are the ones who do good hes a bad man he needs to pay for what hes done more strength in her voice hes bad like you said very bad edward shot piet and demi a scowl of triumph then he gave yasmin a smile you are nothing to him and you are everything to us yes this is true this is your home now we are your family forever she didnt speak we are going for a walk yasmin outside the house youll be good wont you yasmin or ill have to put you back into the closet for a week or a month or maybe a year ill have to visit you there for a long time play with you and my little knife maybe piet would visit you too he ran a finger along her jawline she stared past his shoulder at piet then she nodded she rubbed her arm and he could see the needle marks from the drugs hed given her you dont need to be afraid he said ill be with you every step of the way were going to use your expertise you should be proud us taking the bad you made and using it for good she nodded again were going where there are a lot of people yasmin edward said all very bad people very bad people she repeated were going to the train station edward said and he held out his hand with a smile with piet and demi watching he put her hand in his he could feel their gaze on him like an audience in a darkened theater and then he started to crush her fingers a slow moan escaped her mouth i didnt say you could make a noise edward said squeezing harder she went silent he continued to increase the pressure now you may speak when do we leave yasmin gasped but the best part was she didnt try and pull her fingers away she was broken behind him piet laughed he released the pressure and interlocked her fingers with his in a few moments if you do as i tell you you dont have to go back into the closet you can stay outside all day and tonight you could sleep in a bed yasmin with me like man and wife her mouth moved like words might spill in a flood but she was silent edward put his lips close to her ear will you do what i tell you yasmin but he already knew the answer yes she said quietly ill do what you ask for a moment he saw the strong woman she had been before her ordeal in the hellish closet and then that sense of steel vanished as she glanced at piet and demi now she showed the others that she was a broken desperate shell trying to survive to the next hour just as hed planned fear hed seen it in the faces of the men hed killed in hungary in sam capras blind panic as he tried to find his wife in the smoke and noise of holborn fear worked he released her hand everything changes for you today yasmin today youre the most important person in the house edward smiled this was going to be so much better than london on saturday i had a day off from ollies i had been careful to spend my days off at home sitting quietly watching tv or reading books that sharpened my mind my only outings were an occasional jog or a trip to the library a typical trip to the library meant browsing for an hour killing time in the stacks checking out books that would not raise red flags no nonfiction no books on the company i usually picked thick historical novels i would log onto the web and do a search on lucys name i felt sure howell monitored the librarys internet connection since it was my only avenue to the web lucys name never resulted in any news i would visit her abandoned personal page on facebook and i lingered over the few pictures of her our first christmas in london her walking on a beach during a long weekend in majorca us having coffee in kensington park during a glorious summer morning i have no photos of her nothing left from our apartment in london the company had taken and kept it all for evidence in some of the pictures she smiled in others she wore the intense competitive frown id seen in her i stared at the old photos looking for any trace any sign that she could turn traitor as if it could be read in a face she had not put up any photos since she became pregnant most of her facebook friends were from her college days at arizona and their wall postings remained unanswered so no surprise to my watchers when on saturday at noon i stopped by ollies for a minute and then went to the library i dropped my checkedout unread novels into the return chute i smiled at the librarian behind the desk who ignored me as she spoke into a phone i moved along the shelves for five minutes determining the relative positions of the staff and the visitors i took off the cover of the alarm system sensorit was close to the doorand with a pair of scissors i snipped the wire that connected the back exit door to the alarm i replaced the cover no one looked at me story time was going on in the childrens section a hearty reading of where the wild things are then i took the deepest breath of my life and eased open the door the alarm didnt blare i walked straight out into the cool sunlight i waited for a bullet to pound the pavement in front of me or to cut into my kneecap i waited to be hurt and fall and for a man to hustle me into a car at gunpoint and call on howell to say id been a bad boy asking me to explain the dead body in the neighboring apartment silence the bars were widening just a bit i walked to a nearby car id noticed parked on a side street same place every week in front of a strip shopping center the model was one that was easy to boost and it had no gps system to track it remotely i hotwired it and was gone in less than the proverbial sixty seconds no sign of pursuit in the mirror any watchers used to my routine were probably keeping their eyes on the front door or considered themselves clever by monitoring the internet searches i drove north making a stop at a walmart for the rest of my disguise then i drove on and found a truck stop about thirty miles south of albany i parked the car in the far corner went inside for coffee many ate here because it was cheaper to eat a couple of hours out of new york than in the city i drank three cups of excellent coffee in unhurried progression watching the truckers come and go mostly they sat and listened to the news a bombing at a train station in amsterdam that had killed five a dive in stocks yesterday an indictment against a congressman for bribery in the hush of the commercials i listened to them chat in their varying levels of sociability i wanted a talker talkers dont ask as many questions they like to discuss themselves not you you are just there to drink in the wisdom often they talked about their cargos a conversational opener the same way one might ask about the weather fortyfive minutes after i came in a trucker silverhaired and with a slight southern accent sat next to me and wolfed down a hamburger and fries halfdrowned in ketchup when his plate was clear he mentioned to the uninterested trucker next to him that he was hauling flannel and buttons to be shipped overseas for fashioning into shirts why they cant stitch together shirts here is beyond me the talker said we got sewing machines yeah the other trucker said japanese sewing machines he shrugged at the shrinking world he got up and left the talker ordered a cup of coffee after it had been poured and the first curl of steam was rising from it and hed taken an ample sip i asked are you heading to the port sir he gauged me with a look yeah im trying to get there my car broke down here my brothers working on a ship sailing out of new jersey and he got me a job usually its not american boys working those ships i know hes a supervisor he got me the job i tucked my teeth over my lip all smalltown sheepish im a little desperate ships coming in and leaving tomorrow and im stuck here drinking coffee i kept asking for rides earlier and i think i asked wrong everyone said no i let a shade of heartbreak show on my face thats tough he looked at the empty ketchupsmeared plate like it was a painting i know sir i wouldnt ever ask but i need the job bad if i can get to any port terminal i can get a ride to my brothers ship im not supposed to take on riders you understand sure of course but this wouldnt be out of your way then i went for the knife like you said wish theyd make shirts here id have a job where i could stay on dry land i got to take what i can get i had been careful to count out sparse change for the coffee in front of the waitress i wanted to look like i was what i said i was the moment i walked into the truck stop you have to play the role to the hilt the waitress listening since the crowd had slowed put a bit more coffee in my cup without me asking the trucker set down his coffee cup thinking it over most people are decent and are inclined to help well i could chip in some gas money whats your name sam sam capra i had no fake id there was no point in lying i did have a drivers license and he asked to see it i showed it to him capra like the film director i laughed like id never heard the question before sadly no relation how much royalties could i get off its a wonderful life thats a good movie he said like i had confirmed a connection to the most famous capra says you live in new york why are you up here i was looking to get a job in albany didnt get it could i be more hard luck he studied the license some more like it was a long book he handed it back to me then downed the rest of his coffee then its a wonderful life sam capra you got a ride the trucker said and he laughed at his own joke so did i i was now part of the flux into the port of new york and new jersey the river of goods going out into the wider world i just wanted to be swept along by the current and hope i didnt jam up in an eddy or a byway the denim delivery truck paperworked its way into one of the ports terminals on newark bay past the checkpoints and the inspection sheds all at a steady clip i thanked the trucker slipped him his bribe which we called gas money and stepped out of the cab ports are busy people are intent on their work from my walmart stop i was dressed in jeans and a denim shirt and work boots and a yankees baseball cap i carried not a knapsack but two duffel bags on which id marked facilities along the side with a sharpie pen i could have come from a ship i could have come from an office inside the port complex i hoped i was invisible i watched containers being hauled off the docks and craned into the bowels of the ships and when the holds were full stacked along the flat decks the loadings were as graceful as a dance the trucks inched forward were relieved of their burdens then turned around and joined another line to be loaded again with goods from europe and africa or from american ports to the south charleston miami new orleans houston i walked past a line of cargo ships there was an entry gate with a guard the line of fencing curved away as i walked out past a loading area and within a few hundred feet the guard shack lay out of sight i climbed the fence fast dropped over the other side no one yelled i walked without haste past towers of containers i faced a choice pick a ship or pick a container if i tried to board a ship and then hide i was going to be dealing with people not good it was taking a risk to enter a container i might end up at the bottom of a shipment unable to force open the door i had tools inside my duffel with which i could cut open an air hole but i preferred to pick my own coffin for the next ten days no one was paying any attention to me but my chest felt tight anyone could stop me anyone could challenge me if i looked the least bit suspicious i would draw attention howell and his watchers knew by now that i had run i could make no assumptions about how close they were on my tail hey a voice called a guy twenty feet away hurried toward me i froze he wore a shirt that indicated he worked for a shipping contractor he carried an electronic handheld bar reader and he said wheres the closest john man first dayand this place is too goddamned big i jerked my head toward the nearest building and i hoped i was right thanks he took off if there wasnt a bathroom therewould he remember me i watched him walk off toward the building i might have a lot less time to find what i needed than i thought yeah i asked this guy but he told me wrong no i didnt notice if he had an id clip on i knew what kind of container i was looking for the sides showed a stenciled shipping company ownership mark tied to an individual number containers were routinely bought and sold and bartered among the shippers i could see on some of the containers that they had been restenciled the shadows of old paint edging the new numbers most containers i saw boasted a socalled tamperproof seal but i could see a few of the seals dangled from the openings broken again these seals are not quite up to the ironclad image that politicians feed the public masses the seal is often a strip of plastic sized like the wristband a patient wears in a hospital the number matches the id number on the side of the container and the seal is simply fed through the doors levers i saw a few that had no seal at all the moving positioning emptying loading and moving again of a multiton container means that these strips of plastic can easily be torn off or brushed away during the process and no one checks no one cares the rivers of commerce cannot be dammed a line of big ships lay ahead the ownership marks disclosed a shipping company based in rotterdam in the netherlands it would have to do unfortunately the containers headed for the uk did not have a large neon sign marked london over them but i could hide and slip away unseen in the chaos and the maze of europes largest and busiest port i chose a container on the bottom of a large stackit would be the last to be loaded the door faced away from the crane and i didnt care what was being shippedas long as it wasnt snakes or scorpions this was my chance the seal was in place i sawed through it with a knife from my bag leaving ragged edges so it would appear that the seal had been damaged in transit i opened the door stepped inside closed the door it took all of five seconds i knelt close to the door listened i waited to hear footsteps running toward me but there was only the sound of the continual movement of goods the screech and grind of the containers above me slowly being hoisted into the air i dug in my duffel and found a flashlight i clicked it on and scanned the container stacks of boxes i had half expected it to be emptyafter all what does america build anymore that the rest of the world uses maybe id find leveraged financial products or subprime mortgages i inspected one section of boxes they all read cleanpak hand wipes others read vermonter herbal soaps handmade in usa with a stylized landscape scene of a new england farm on the boxes eight to ten days stuck in here at least i wouldnt smell as bad as ten days with no shower i hunkered down away from the door eventually i felt the container rise leave earth swing toward the ocean and then settle downslowly i leaned against a box of vermont soap wrapped a blanket around me and slept ten days in a steel coffin no way to pass the time except to think and to plan imagine if you had ten days shut off from the world no phone no web no television cutting the electronic cord separated me from the incessant twittering chatter of modern life the quiet might drive many people mad but i welcomed it the only good thing about the prison in poland had been after the initial weeks of questioning the long silences just me and the stone walls the power of time to think is a forgotten pleasure in todays world this was not so different from the stretches of useless quiet in the cia prison except no one was torturing me but the line id crossed weighed on me in a way it hadnt when id thought out the plan howell might well issue a killonsight order on me i had broken away from the invisible cage no second chance now waking i used the flashlight and established my tiny camp inside the steel coffin inside the duffels i had the glock and two clips of ammo id stolen from the safe in ollies office i had a hopefully delicious assortment of protein bars and fruit bottles of water extra batteries for the flashlight toothbrush toothpaste and toilet paper a small container for waste a firstaid kit and sleeping pills a charged ipod with mahler and the rolling stones and an extended battery two changes of clothes gray shirts jeans all the cash id saved after the passport fiasco a few hundred dollars it wasnt much with which to start a long and dangerous journey to find my lost wife and child i checked my watch the cargo ship should have departed by now a constant hum of engine played but i didnt want to risk opening the door and being spottedalthough with thousands of containers i thought the odds of being seen were lowuntil we were at least a day out of america the ship wouldnt turn around for a stowaway at that point they would just arrest me and throw me in whatever small room they could improvise as a brig they would alert the port authorities when they arrived in rotterdam but it was best of all if i wasnt seen i could keep my sanity without seeing the sky the container was like a womb i told myself maybe when i got out id be reborn ready to kick ass i closed my eyes again felt nothing but an utter loneliness that one cannot find easily in todays world nothing to do but sleep and dream about what i had lost it couldnt be healthy to dream so much i dozed and it wasnt a dream it was a memory rising to my brain like a bubble what do you want to name him lucy asked me she stood by the window of our bloomsbury flat staring out at the rain gray clouds scudded low over the city and my normal life was ticking five days to zero him youre sure its going to be a him he kicks like you she placed her hand on the little swell of stomach i have never kicked you she put a hand on my cheek in your sleep when you have bad dreams about danny my brother mention of danny always brought a silence maybe it only lasted a moment but it marked a cold pause in everyday life and the inevitable sting at the back of my eyes in the bottom of my throat i lowered the book i was reading well how about edwin for your dad lucys parents had died in a car crash when she was ten and i had thought she might want to honor her lost father or mother she had been raised by an aunt after her parents died gone to college on full scholarship studied the elegance of databases and joined the company fresh out of school just like me she spoke fondly of her aunt and little of her parents almost as if they were characters shed read about in a novel i appreciate the sentiment monkey but edwins too oldfashioned for me um okay i stared at her my mind a blank how about samuel junior she said i dont want him named for me let him be his own person entirely lucy tucked her feet under her id like to honor a loved one well i loved my parents very much but relations with them were frosty at the moment how about well name him for you lucy call him lucian hell have to be the toughest kid on the playground no my minds made up daniel for your brother you dont have to do that you never even knew danny i know what he meant to you its an awesome name lets honor him if i could put a sticky note into my memory it would read this was the woman the world wanted me to believe was a traitor then lets put daniel on the list i picked up my book again daniel okay what if im wrong and its a girl capri for the island capri capra shell love us forever she laughed sam yes she didnt answer me and i glanced up at her still watching the slow slide of rain along the glass and then she said words she never said in real life do you think i could let you die i awoke with a start the dark was nearly complete and for a moment i forgot i lay nestled in the containers cocoon i lay listening wondering how long id slept today had been the first time in a long while id slept like a free manno listeners no cell no one watching me or my dreams for evidence of betrayal i slept again woke again slept again for how long i didnt know but my brain jerked me awake at a sound an approaching buzz sounding hard above the soft steady thrum of the engines an interrupting roar i knew the sound a helicopter lowering toward the deck i risked cracking open the door daylight hit my eyes the dawn rosy fresh i could smell air unsullied by city saltwater the tinge of rust the light stung my eyes i blinked the pain away my container stood near the top of a stackanother stack stood next to it i could barely open the door and squeeze through and i had to hold on to the side of the adjoining container i looked down i was roughly four stories upif i slipped i would fall into a narrow canyon created by the containers i pushed the door open as far as i could and pulled myself up to the top of the container wall thin clouds streaked the sky the helicopters whoosh faded as the rotors slowed i inched along the top of the containers and looked down at the ships stern a jet helicopter squatted i saw four men armed exiting the helicopter as the rotors slowed one figurea woman in a suitstood at a distance conferring with a group of men who appeared to be the captain and members of the crew the arrivals must be howells people jesus how how finding people who didnt want to be found was hard id hit my head against that wall a number of times yet no matter how carefully i hid here came the company my heart triphammered against my chest and then i thought six thousand containers they cant open and search them all it would take weeks well if the company was seizing the ship they would have weeks they could commandeer the vessel sail it back to new york or to boston pay off the disgruntled shippers they could take as long as they wanted to find me if theyd found the intruders body in the apartment theyd never give up howell would know id killed the guy and run presumably with highly useful information the helicopter rose again it hovered over the stern of the ship then began to work its way slowly over the deck i could see two men sitting in the copters open door peering at a laptop hanging from each side of the helicopter was an array of lenses shaped like a rectangle the helicopter passed low over the first stack of containers keeping up its flying speed but just barely it wasnt in a hurry it was searching my heart sank infrared scanners tied to thermal imagers my body temperature would stick out like a flame against the coolness of shipped goods like my vermont soap and new jersey hand wipes i had to find somewhere else on the ship to hide now i couldnt go down my body heat would stick out like a blister i had to go up and then find rapid entry into the ship id be spotted but they were going to find me within minutes anyway i ducked back down to my container grabbed my gun and the ammo and the cash i put the cash and the ammo in a belt bag and tucked the gun in the back of my pants then went back out the door the containers surfaces were damp from the ocean breeze and i tested my grip carefully a slip would be fatal i hoisted myself up high the helicopter was about a hundred meters away the ship had stopped and dropped anchor the white noise of the engines had faded the helicopter was turned away from me its nose pointing back to where the suit from the helicopter and the captain i presumed stood i crawled out onto the top of the containers i was five stories in the air laying flat on the cool steel of a blue container i could see that the container stack here stairstepped down then rose again the loader had not done a neat job and it gave me ledges and walls just like back in vauxhall the helicopter began its turn i hunkered low and ran i eased myself over the lip of the first stack and dropped down to the next i made a clang when i hit the helicopter couldnt have heard it but a crewman standing near the railing toward the bow turned either at the sound or at the flash of color i made as i ran i saw him turn and point right at me i rolled and ran toward the edge again and i heard the increasing whine of the helicopter i slammed off the edge of one container slowed my descent hit the top of another and rolled to my feet i glanced back as i ran the twenty feet to the edge and saw the helicopter bearing down on me one of the men jumped from the copter onto the container stack gun in hand i ran metal hit metala bullet pinging against the container i had to get off the stackthe helicopter roared above me circling keeping me in sight as the gunman narrowed the gap between us i was caught between man and machine boxed now three stories above the deck and i could see another thin crevasse between shovedtogether stacks of multicolored containers i wriggled inside the gap i had maybe thirty seconds to navigate down thirty feet to the deck before the gunman caught up to the canyon id be a dead target if i wasnt out and clear by the time he reached it he could simply fire a bullet into the top of my head i bounced down my feet catching the edges of the containers just enough to break the descent then dropping again find the line i told myself it was like a parkour run inside a pipeline my shoulders bounced hard against the steel twenty feet i hit a skid lost my balance i slammed into the metal side caught the edge of a container with my hands i could hear the helicopter drumming above me like a hammer i focused and let go and managed to drop to the deck in a controlled roll i spilled free from the container stack out of the shadows into the weak oceanguttered sunlight fifty feet ahead of me was a railingand beyond that the uncaring gray of the sea i ran staying close to the edge of the containers i needed to get belowdecks on a ship full of warm bodies and heating pumps and heavy engines theyd have to do their thermal scans by hand and hundreds more containers should be below i could become the needle in the haystack for a while i was going to make them work to find me because i was sick of being stymied of being pushed away from finding lucy and my son i crashed into a crewman a young filipino who cried out in tagalog for help i showed him the gun and he froze i pushed him away hard and ran through a doorway started hammering down the steps behind me i saw the gunman take a hard run slide off a container hit and roll with enough grace to hold his balance as he came off the front of the container stack i vanished into the depths of the ship the crew was not likely armed this ship wasnt sailing past somalia i didnt want to shoot an innocent person and the sound would betray my location to the hunters best to be silent and vanish i ran down a long narrow corridor turning back and slowing to look for pursuit and i slammed into a wall of a man as he bound out of a doorway i staggered back and the manheavyset asiansnarled and launched a flurry of blows at my face he used muay thai hard sharp brutal blows a thai fighting form designed to knock an opponent down and out with the smallest amount of effort it hurts a lot he landed two precise blows on my jaw and my throat before i could parry and i fell to the ground then he flicked open a switchblade a switchblade the eighties want their weapon back they pay for you he hissed he sliced the air between us smiled his hard awful smile you get up slow and thats cheating i said i thought we were sticking to fists but whatever i pulled my gun free and shot the knife out of his hand at least i would play fair he shrieked the broken knife clattered along the deck i glanced behind me saw the gunman launching himself into the hallway behind us so i cheated some more and i closed arms around the crying bleeding sailor and made him my shield the gunman held fire hurray for morals i yanked the sobbing sailor back along the hall we finally hit a door it opened into the main container hold let him go mr capra we want to talk the gunman called mister so polite i acted like i hadnt heard i hurried the sailor down toward the hold floor he didnt struggle moaning as he clutched his hurt hand but two cant move as fast as one and as we reached the hold floor i aimed at the lights above us i needed the blanket of darkness the gunman appeared at the steps and aimed he fired as i tried to pull the sailor back behind the angle of a container while squeezing the trigger and my shot missed the light id moved too slow the gunmans shot caught the sailor in the upper back and he screamed and sagged to the floor i glanced down at the sailorand instead of a spread of blood on his shirt a small metal dart protruded from between his meaty shoulder blades not a bullet an anesthetic dart like we were on a nature show tagging tigers to trace their roaming the dart was so i could be dragged back and put into whatever cage howell wanted they wanted their bait to be functioning i fired at the gunman who took cover behind the edge of a container then i turned and i ran into the maze of containers hard right hard right i needed to take out the gunman i was trying to get behind him when he descended the stairs i hoped his adrenaline would make him rush make a bad decision to my profit dim lights illuminated the stacks i stopped risked a glance around the corner the containers were more tightly packed down here less room to move longer lines of sight which meant that there was a better chance of getting caught in the open i could hear more voices raised feet thundering on the steel stairs a crowd was coming if i shot id betray my position i broke the seal on a container slipped inside left the door open less than an inch i counted slowly in my head at nineteen the gunman went past me moving quickly but silently i watched him move past the door i stepped out of the container slamming a kick into the back of his head like he was a wall i was running up he collapsed and i caught the back of his shirt so he wouldnt make a noise with my other hand i grabbed the dart gun fired it into his back he ragdolled and i eased him to the floor i hurried to the intersection and looked down the long unbroken gap in the containers and saw another man in black accompanied by a crewman i ran along the aisle hearing their echoing voices clang against the steel they would expect me to hide in the stacks i would have to find another part of the ship to make my own i had to keep moving use the crews thermal signals as camouflage hide where the heat of the engines would mask my bodys signature i had to hold out and get to rotterdam there i could vanish i stopped at another intersection for just one single moment getting bearings and a sting aced my throat hard like a hands swat a dart i had maybe seconds before the anesthetic worked its juice i raised my gun at the approaching gunman the woman in the suit now stood behind him watching me unafraid mila the woman from ollies bar the whisky drinker with the fondness for wolves blond hair pulled back severely eyes of quartz a hard smile she liked glenfiddich whisky and my own blood felt like a bottle had been injected straight into my heart the steel of the gun slipped from my grip i laughed as i fell to the deck i opened my eyes to starlight i heard the slush of water the soft whistle of a breeze i lay on my back steel for a pillow on a container on the deck of the ship above me the moon hung ripe with light the whistle was the wind slicing through the gaps in the container stacks the stars lay in a diamond spill across the sky you didnt see the stars so clearly in a city ever mila sat next to me legs crossed wearing a trench coat cigarette in hand watching the smoke slide into the moonlight i sat up my arms and my shoulder ached but i wasnt hurt a darkness of ocean lay all around id been out for most of the day good evening sam mila said howell sent you my god the trouble they had gone to howell name does not ring bells for me mila took a drag on the cigarette crushed the embers against the steel she looked out over the long expanse of the atlantic the helicopter was gone she opened a bag and pulled out a bottle of glenfiddich and two small glasses well thats one true thing about you you actually do like glenfiddich i said and my name is actually mila she said a doctor might say its not good to drink after a sedation dart so i only give you a bit i held my glass and she clinked it against mine for medicine what are we toasting i asked freedom she said yours mine the worlds mila sipped at her whisky i didnt want any but i took the barest taste ollie will be missing you his best bartender if the wind shifts we may be able to hear his bitching who are you mila i said and who is mila i am your friend sam i can find my own friends mila gestured across the expanse of the ship there was no sign of the crew no indication anyone was watching us forgive me you have so many friends wheres the back of the line and ill wait there sarcasm suited her but i was not in the mood for moonlight and whisky and wit who do you work for and who had the considerable resources to do it i didnt add teams of men thermal imaging a jet helicopter it had to be howell or maybe mila was part of the people who grabbed lucy who framed us they might not want me coming to europe the frame against me and lucy had been elaborate but i was just one man this was a lot of trouble for anyone to go to and if mila was connected to the intruder well then i should have been dead alreadytaken back aboard the helicopter shot and dropped into the cold gray of the atlantic mila took another sip of glenfiddich my employers prefer to remain anonymous are they the same people who grabbed my wife no are you from the company no and she made a slight face i do have an offer to make you that wasnt hard to figure someone who hoped i was pissed enough at the cia for treating me like a traitor to turn me into an actual one im not interested ive arranged for cabins lets go down and talk the night air on the open atlantic was cold i nodded i followed her down to a cabin the two crew members we passed stared at me with barely disguised hostility speaking of friends i said as mila closed the door behind us your fighting them has cost me several thousand in bribes sorry there were two beds i sat on one all right im listening first of all i wanted to talk to you not hurt you and i wasnt going to spend weeks searching containers for you you are company mila fingered another cigarette in her pack but then seemed to reconsider are you dense i have said no i am not cia i have been many things in my life but never that so who are you the question sam is who are you going to be the government spent a great deal of taxpayer money to train you and it wasnt to refill pretzel bowls and bruise gin in martinis and phone taxis for drunks so you want to make the most of that investment you and whoever you work for lets discuss your wife what about her you must have your theories about what happened to her mila said you dont believe she betrayed you framed you framing me didnt require me surviving the blast she didnt have to get me out of the building but if she was a captive why was she allowed to save you why would her captors help you i dont know perhaps she made a deal with them spare you and she would cooperate i said nothing the thought of lucy sacrificing herself for me weighed on me like rocks tied to a drowning man but there is the question of all the money she had all the money she moved before she vanished how do you know i know about the money she moved it doesnt matter how i studied milas face i could grab her throw her against the wall force her to tell me who she was but i could tell force wasnt the way to deal with her she had a lot of resources and shed chosen to speak with me alone as an equal not as a prisoner it was the first time in a long while someone acted like i could be trusted i cant explain i think shes alive i think lucy capra was a traitor paid for her work mila said evenly and once she was pregnant with your child she decided to get the hell out of the situation while she could she was going to have to go on maternity leave in a matter of days her work logs her computer activities would have been under another agents direct scrutiny in your office her trail could have been discovered i let the words settle youre wrong the alternative is a monster under the bed mila said softly the alternative is that she never loved you she used you and then she framed you to look like a traitor she murdered your friends she made you a pawn mila pulled a face i want to know what you truly think sam you worked some of the most dangerous jobs in europe you cannot be a man easily fooled and have survived tell me what you really think no one had asked me that in so long shes not a traitor we were both framed they took her to find out what she knew the companys been trying to break the back of the new order of transnational crime rings especially those with ties to governments whether friendly or not mila waited lucy would be valuable to those kinds of criminal networks she knew more about our infrastructure our computer systems our ways of tracking financial data she would be more useful to them than i would be they would have targeted her i think she warned me to save my life yes she is useful to them mila said and you are useful to no one now except me useful to you how i could give you the freedom to find the truth freedom time resources its hard to conduct an international search for your wife and child when youre ordering tonic water by the case and cleaning the beer taps and under constant surveillance and if they catch you now she shrugged youll be in their prison for the rest of your life the waterboarding was a bitch ive seen the tapes i wont be free as long theyre hunting me and as long as i dont know whats happened to my family they made you into a soldier for the shadows they made you play a role where you would have been tortured to death if youd been discovered smuggler hired gun they made you their weapon and they dont need you anymore sam how long did you last on the waterboarding a minute most people dont make it past the twentysecond mark you are strong how are you not company but youre watching company tapes did you find it on youtube mila risked a smile according to the file you were never waterboarded according to your file your wife is considered missing in action and you have resigned from the cia your file indicates you did not do field work but were a minor administrator with limited duties theyve rewritten your history to make you unimportant all neat and tidy it never happened like howell likes to say if lucy was a traitor she may have compromised a hundred agents in europe and beyond she might have given them secrets in trade for your life maybe thats why they let her save you the thought was crushing please dont say that sam you are aimless thats a waste you should be aimed like a handcrafted bullet so where would you aim me at some very dangerous people recruitment mila wasnt company but she was big mila was capable of accessing my no doubt topsecret file and could have a jet helicopter intercept and search a ship with an armed team im offering you a chance to do the work youve been trained to do with support and to regain your credibility and dignity im not worried about that of course you are the company believed for months that you were a mass murderer and a traitor now they simply believe youre an idiot who was played by his traitor wife they said i was innocent that they had proof the only proof in your file was that you never broke that you never changed your story howell argued for you to be put out as bait that lucy if a traitor would come out of hiding to kill you to eliminate you as a loose end or to keep you from coming after her or if lucy had been kidnapped then putting you out was no risk if you ran you ran and they would find you if she wanted me dead she didnt have to get me out of the office unless you living was useful to her in the moment and its aftermath mila said traitors are not rational they live in a bizarre limbo not poster children for the good adjustment her english was nearly perfect but not quite shes not a traitor i should get you a tshirt with that on it mila said and then my christmas shopping is done youre brutal i am the first person in months sam telling you the truth love me for it okay whatever youre peddling im not interested i set my empty whisky glass on the table i had hardly realized id downed it my wife is gone i dont care what they think i just dont care the tv you watch the news yesterday yes train station bombing in amsterdam yesterday it had been mentioned on the tv in the truck stop near albany i heard about it mila slid a stack of pictures to me a stack i flipped through them several of the pictures caught the magnified face of a young woman attractive darkeyed much of her face masked by a scarf around her throat pulled high to her nose as if warding off the chill she wore a longsleeved shirt and jeans who is she the daughter of a man i know a nice young woman yasmin zaid shes from london she has never been in any trouble she has a doctorate from oxford blameless life shes been missing for three weeks and yesterday she shows up walking through amsterdam centraal with a backpack on her shoulder it had the bomb inside i believe mila slid another photo out the man walking four feet behind her her voice trailed off i felt a jolt in my chest it was the same man whod driven my wife away in the audi the hair was cut into a short burr makeup smeared over the scar that lay near his eye but i knew the shape of his face the questionmark scar seared into my head i see a slight resemblance mila said i looked up from the photo you think this young woman bombed mila handed me another picture the same woman hurrying out of the station no backpack the man who took my wife close behind her i glanced at the time stamp mila followed my gaze the bomb detonated ten minutes after yasmin zaid left in a store inside the station i studied the girls face a blank canvas waiting for the delicate touch of the brush she didnt look afraid or excited about her bombing mission she was blank behind the scarred man was grinning ever so slightly he certainly matches your description he has affected or influenced yasmin zaid perhaps as well your wife gotten good people in his thrall to commit violence i dont understand is he a terrorist no i dont believe he is no one has claimed responsibility for the blast and it wasnt placed on a train where they could have killed many more people they could have blown up yasmin if they were simply using her as a tool instead they blew up a little newsstand that sells candy and paperback books and magazines it makes no sense from the standpoint of an extremist like the london office bombing i thought of the money czari had always been sure our investigation of him drove the london bombing from her accent mila was russiancould she be connected to him but she wouldnt be hiring me shed just kill me i put the picture down i imagine the dutch police are looking for them the dutch have not identified her but they will be using facerecognition software even with only a partial match on her face its only a matter of time before shes identified perhaps days how did you get these photos have the dutch authorities released them no and she didnt say more why tell me your troubles i want you to find yasmin and bring her back to me im not going to work for you i cant my voice sounded hollowed like a ghosts the company bah mila spat like the word was a nail stop pretending to be such a nice guy stop playing by their rules sam their rules put you in jail when you were innocent their rules presumed your guilt when they should not if you could youd want to find the man who took her to know why he killed your friends what hes done with your wife and child dont lie to me its a fever in your blood to find them a slow awful fire burned in milas voice lucy and your child are your holy grail sam i know you you dont know me of course i do you are all about fighting the evil sam you joined the company for revenge a revenge you cant ever get i froze mila raised an eyebrow at me the desire for revenge drove you to the company and now revenge can drive you to find the man who tore apart your family oh what a shrink could make of you i just want lucy and the baby back i said i dont want revenge dont believe revenge isnt fantastic mila said until youve actually exacted it she shrugged i find revenge absolutely thrilling and satisfying i reached for the glenfiddich refilled our glasses mila sipped the whisky it was a nice big comradely gulp if you come to work for me you will have a free hand to look for her i am best boss ever i didnt say anything for a long minute what do you think she asked this could be a company trap a test to see if im willing to sell my services i dont know who you are and i dont care i cannot help you i am practical she made a face at the word practical is what soviet architecture was practical is not always the answer the offer expires in one minute and if i say no ill get you to holland but then we part ways and you never saw or met me and be certain you will be back in prison within days with no hope of ever finding your family and if i say yes mila tasted the scotch find yasmin bring her back to me and you may exact whatever revenge you like on the scarred man if he knows where your wife and child are its your concern but yasmin is saved first shes killed people no you can see it in her faceshe has been drugged or broken break this group of kidnappers for me and i will give you every resource to find your wife and then what the company will be after me not if you produce evidence of your innocence the scarred man might have information that clears the name who are you i said so quietly i wasnt sure that she heard me mila set down the glass i work for a group that prefers to remain anonymous you have no reason to trust me but via this group i am bringing you the best hope you have of finding your wife i am giving you freedom and resources do you care so much for little questions that have little answers she had a bizarre way of talking but i saw her point it didnt matter who these people were all that mattered was lucy and my son daniel i wondered if shed been able to give him that name if they were still alive i decided and if i get caught youre on your own we cant acknowledge you we cant help you i waited in silence for her thin smile to fade she wanted a response why are you doing this i asked i dislike seeing your talent wasted you should be put to good use mila lit a cigarette she was not the kind of person to ask if i minded in the close quarters of the cabin not just good use extraordinary use i picked up the photo from the train station stared hard at the mans scar how many seconds left in that minute i asked ten yes i said whatever bribes mila tossed among the ship worked the crew left us alone i was surprised as i had nearly shot one of them i had decided mila was part of some group within the government unleashed to do dirty work without the boundaries of law and since i was damaged goods i was a perfect recruit they had limited access to company information like my file but the company didnt know about them i didnt care who they were as long as they helped me get lucy back so i exercised in my room lifting myself on a bar running in place thinking clearing my head i endured a selfimposed captivity for three days then i couldnt do it anymore not after the long weeks in the polish prison so i went up to the deck and i ran among the containers in the bright open sunshine the crew watched me i waved they didnt wave back i thought about the best ways to try and find the scarred man i had to assume he knew my face this was going to be the most dangerous job id ever undertaken and i was doing it with an unproven ally in mila when i turned past one stack of containers captain switchblade was there helping to clean the deck hello i said he stared at me in surprise you okay i asked after a moment he nodded good i wasnt going to say sorry since hed pulled the knife on me but i didnt want more trouble with this guy we were still days away from the netherlands i went past him and kept jogging i didnt look behind me and no knife landed in my back i wondered how much his forgiveness had cost mila and why shed bothered to pay it i was lying on the cot in my cabin when mila knocked and came in the company has sent your face to every passport point of entry in europe and asia theyre telling people your passport may have been taken and be in use by a fugitive if theyre looking for me they might consider that id use an earlier legend legends are cover identities used by field operatives id played the part of a canadian smuggler a german money launderer an american mercenary who wanted to make quick money guarding blood diamonds the people who could have said he wasnt really any of those guys were all dead or in prison the legends could still be counted as clean i had no documentation in those namespassports or credit cardsbut i could get that from mila those names were known in the criminal underworld but the risk of using one to infiltrate the scarred mans ring posed serious consequences the company could have burned all my old names told any contact or informant that i was not to be trusted worse they could be listening watching for me to try to step into my old shoes the only sure way to know if the legends were still good was to try and use them i gave mila the background on my old names and we went into her cabin where she broke out a kit full of diplomatic paper cameras a small but powerful printer and a laptop a forgers paradise so whats the first step when we arrive we meet yasmins father in amsterdam her father mr zaid can tell you more about yasmin and her kidnapping mr zaid was he milas boss you tell me id rather you hear details from him what does he know about me just that you can help him get his daughter back thats all he needs to know where will we meet him at a bar you sure like bars i said yes mila said i sure do now i want to be sure you are not rusty the rest of the day we only speak russian and how is your dutch poor i will expect it to improve quickly she rolled her eyes i hope you wont embarrass me with poor verb choices i watched mila build the new versions of me i was like frankensteins monster crafted out of watermarked paper and credit histories and life histories she made me a canadian an american a german and a new zealander all under different names i watched her use backdoor entries into what should have been ironclad government databases in washington berlin ottawa and christchurch to insert the codes for the passports into the appropriate government databases making me a legitimate traveler she slid with ease into banks issuing credit cards to me in my various old identities the company could be looking for my old names too i said they could a risk we must take i wondered againwho was this woman mila whistled a bananarama tune as she worked rotterdam the port accommodated around four hundred ships a day both oceanbound and for inland waterways and a labyrinth of rail and road the port itself was like a city loading cranes the jagged skyscrapers vast avenues of water the streets this was a critical artery between the hundreds of millions of people in north america and the hundreds of millions of people in europe and beyond i rode out in the same container i rode in on mila was unwilling to risk that passport control at the port hadnt received the alert on my passport and she was worried about the crew talking she spent the morning of our arrival greasing more palms silence cost money i waited for the container to settle and for her to come and open the door when she did a uniformed man a port inspector stood with her everything is fine she said to me in russian the inspector stepped inside and displayed great interest in the vermonter soap mila spoke rapidly to the inspector in dutch he nodded didnt look at us mila and i walked out into the gray cloudy day you are very handy with the bribes i said to her as we hurried across the busy docking area i am beloved and popular mila said i have friends in every corner of the world and we vanished into the flood of goods and people coming into europe we took the train to amsterdam fiftysix kilometers away and i watched the flatland of holland unpeel before my gaze i was back in europe where i had been happiest with lucy and imprisoned by the company i thought of the dead intruder and his own ticket to amsterdam i leaned back against the train seat id traded one chain from howell to another from mila i watched the brief stretch of holland pan out in silence id had months to sit and think about what id do if i got the chance to find lucy and here it was and my skin felt like lit matches lay under it the possible truthsthat lucy and our baby were dead or that lucy had betrayed meloomed large the monsters i didnt want to see and yet had to see fine i was going to find the man with the scar force him to tell me where my wife and child were then i was going to be the last thing he ever saw on this earth part two april the most powerful weapon on earth is the human soul on fire marshal ferdinand foch the bar in amsterdam was called de rode prins the red prince and it was located along a lovely old canal called the prinsengracht the princes canal with many small cafes hotels stately residences and offices on both sides of its long curve the anne frank huis stood a few blocks away usually with a quiet respectful crowd snapping pictures and the only boat on the canal was one of those getongetoff tour numbers purring forward while the tourists took their snaps of the waterside buildings and soaked up the charm the air smelled of morning rain but the sun had scattered the clouds the second thing you notice about amsterdamafter the canals of courseare the bicycles they are everywhere and on an early spring day they swarm like bees rising from hives the bicycles are not at all fancy since they are often stolen but you will see them ridden by lawyers in suits mothers with the kids balanced on the back or on the handlebars students and office workers hurrying along no one wears a helmet a steady stream of bikesalthough rush hour was over and lunch not yet beginningzipped their way past the small rode prins a few tables perched on the outside and two gentlemen sat drinking spring beers watching the light dance on the water beyond the parked houseboats mila and i stepped inside and i could see from my couple of trips earlier to amsterdam that the rode prins was a prime example of a dying art it was a brown bar so called because in the olden days an incessant stream of tobacco smoke stained the walls now there was no smoking in the bar and the walls were brown because theyd been painted that way the room was narrow with a longrunning leather banquette with several tables on one side a large table near the window and a beautiful bar along the opposite wall redshaded lamps hung from the ceiling a painting of some forgotten royal hung on the wall and there was a red smear across the canvasacross face and finery and handsas though a glob of blood or paint had been hurled at it years ago the painted prince looked very alone to me rode prins sounded like road prince a king of the wanderers i glanced at a menu while mila waited for the barkeep they offered beers brewed especially for each season this was my kind of bar it surprised me that mila would choose such a spot for a meeting a bartender tall bald heavybuilt and with a small gap between his front teeth appeared from the back mila and the man spoke rapid dutch he gave me the wariest of glances then mila said to me sam this is henrik henrik this is sam sam will be staying upstairs give him whatever he needs henrik shook my hand a solid firm grip where mila seemed all exotic secrets henrik seemed like a bartender to whom you could talk i was staying here i didnt say anything but henrik just gave me a polite nod he gestured toward the back of the establishment to a narrow hallway decorated with blackandwhite photographs of the prinsengracht through the years i followed mila as she headed for the rear of the bar and up a flight of stairs mila stopped and looked at me bahjat zaid is a man who is absolutely terrified for his daughter he doesnt know you and hes trusting his daughters life to you dont rattle his trust were his only hope he cant go to the police why he can explain mila turned and i followed her up the stairs in a private apartment above the rode prins a tall man sat shoulders hunched as though hed played at atlas carrying the world and failed he stood as we entered smoothing his palms on his tailored suit jacket this is the man i told you about bahjat mila said sam capra i was surprised she used my name but i didnt let the shock show a woman like mila had a reason bahjat zaid shook my hand measuring me with his eyes he had a firm grip and a firmer stare he looked at me like a boss looks at an employee who might be about to give him bad news we sat mila asked if i wanted coffee i said no bahjat zaid had a narrow face worn with anguish and he spoke his english with the faintest of beirut accents his navy silk tie was perfectly knotted at a collar of snowwhite cotton a cup of coffee grown cold sat untouched at his elbow he was immaculate and enraged all at once tell me about your daughter mr zaid i said yasmin she is my pride my only child last year she completed advanced degrees in both chemistry and physics she is twentyfive she is about one point seven meters tall her he stopped suddenly as though embarrassed by the spill of words yes i said but mila can tell me all that tell me about her he blinked and opened a manila folder next to him he seemed to gather himself this is yasmin bahjat zaid said pushing a photo toward me i studied it the young woman was lovely a spill of dark hair eyes alive with joy and intelligence a narrow smile she wore a pretty blue sweater and jeans and the sky behind her was gray pregnant with rain she was pushing a windblown hank of hair from her eyes behind her a large estate stood trees swaying in the wind thats a nice house he swelled with pride my estate in kent it is historically important it was to serve as a redoubt for the government should england be invaded it has underground offices a bunker that would have housed churchill in the event of a nazi occupation the house has been in my wifes family for many years we have a town house in london but we love living in kent so did yasmin i didnt say that if england fell to invasion kent being in the southeast corner would likely go first how interesting for you i said there were more photos yasmin with her family yasmin with the estate staff yasmin on horseback yasmin graduating from university the next photo was yasmin as a small child looking up from a book she was smiling her two front teeth missing she indicated from an early age she wished to be a scientist you see she is reading a picture book about madame curie given my business interests i felt a position in one of my companies would suit her and i began to prepare her for such a career i thought you decided her future when she was still missing her front teeth your companies mr zaid is one of the partners in militronics a major firm that does a great deal of business with western governments mila said i knew the company they made a large variety of smallscale military equipment digital binoculars nightvision goggles bulletproof vests and specialized military software and hardware their technology was considered among the best in the world the company was a client yes yasmin works in a research facility near budapest mostly on defensive technologies building better armor more efficient weaponry and equipment her research centers on using nanotechnology and how long has she been missing twentyfive days has she ever gone missing before no never she was always a most obedient daughter obedient not a word you heard every day it was up there with nanotechnology on the rareword scale and my own words telling howell about the money czar thundered in my ears you havent reported her disappearance to the police i said no i was told not to a ransom call not exactly yasmin left work at our budapest research facility on a friday evening as usual she worked lateshe is a devoted employee he pushed a printout toward me it was from a calendar application nearly every hour was blocked out for research or work or in some cases selfimprovement projects learn chinese read up on puccini operas study macroeconomics you see her days are highly structured she works best that way so i have cultivated this fine habit in her and she agrees you keep her organized i said the dryness of my comment went past him i didnt hear from her on the weekend but that is not unusual then on sunday evening i received this message bahjat zaid tapped on the laptop and a video unfurled on the screen yasmin fiddling with a key at her apartment buildings entrance the angle of the camera suggested the video had been shot from across the street zooming in for detail on the young woman the doorstep light gave off a feeble glow there was little ambient street noise no traffic cutting between lens and woman late night yasmin dropped her keys and as she knelt to recover them two men moved into the picture seizing her arms stuffing a cloth over her face the camera caught her gaze wide with terror she struggled and the men rushed her away from the door into the back of a waiting van the van peeled away no license plate in the shot the cameraman had been very careful but not careful enough could you play that again for me i asked my throat dried and i felt the ache of my nearstrangulation in the apartment in brooklyn he nodded and did so i watched it carefully again please he replayed the clip but this time i studied bahjat zaid his mouth worked as he watched his daughters abduction do you recognize those men he asked me you look as though you do one of the kidnappers i felt sure was the man whod tried to kill me in my apartment with the novem soles tattoo yes i do hes dead now his gaze met mine my yasmin being manhandled by those animals it makes me sick he pinched the tip of his nose with his fingertips they have no right my daughter belongs to me i didnt like that last comment at all what happened next mr zaid there was a phone number included with the emailed video i phoned it immediately a man spoke to me he had a slight dutch accent i was instructed not to call the police or report her kidnapping otherwise they would kill yasmin was there a ransom demand yes i was asked to transfer five hundred thousand euros to an account in the caymans i did so immediately and all they asked for was money yes i complied and they did not return her pain flashed in his eyes and then the next email another video he moused over a window on his laptop another video began to play the centraal train station in amsterdam i recognized it from the photos that mila had shown me a darkhaired woman entered the train station a knapsack on her back the video jumped to her walking out the doors without the knapsack the scarf concealing the bottom half of her face the scarred man walked four feet or so behind her now the clip stopped the train station explosion hit ten minutes later mila said five dead they have made yasmin look like a monster exhaustion framed zaids face he got up and paced the floor pale with worry her faceit is so blank like it has been wiped clean and a nothingness put behind her eyes you havent heard from her or the kidnappers again no zaid shook his head i have heard nothing ice coated his words they dont need to ask me for anything they have destroyed her and if this video gets out they will have destroyed my family my company as well you think shes still alive i said i have to hopeif they wanted her dead they would have exploded the bomb while she carried it this video is leverage against me why not call the police now they havent returned her and i would tell them what that she has been kidnapped but that she planted a bomb that killed people if i go to the police the kidnappers will release that video and that will be the end of my business he wiped a hand across his brow i do a great deal of business with nato governments with the united states with russia my daughter as a bomber it would destroy everything ive built people would understand that she was brainwashed think of patty hearst i said zaids voice was iron patty hearst was convicted mr capra the world did not see her then as a victim it saw her as a good girl turned anarchist and bank robber the world is an even less forgiving place now there will be enough doubt to undo my entire business even the mere suggestion that my daughter could be a bomber would destroy my company he closed his eyes my company gained billions in contracts when western governments wanted to show they held no bias against muslimrun firms you see the trap they have set for me i cannot go to the police i dare not defy their demands maybe this isnt about yasmin or the ransoms maybe they want to bring you down then they would release the video now and destroy bahjat mila said quietly but they havent theyre using bahjats hope against him i glanced at mila so you want me to find and rescue yasmin zaids stare was steel oh more than that i want you to find these people who took her and kill them kill them kill her kidnappers i dont care if there are only two or two dozen no one who could tie her to this act can live to indict her name zaid said if she is rescued and any of them survive they could release the tape in revenge but i needed the scarred man alive to answer my questions if i get yasmin out surely that is the primary goal of course but all of them must be dead that is nonnegotiable youre afraid once shes rescued that the kidnappers might come after you yasmin has seen their faces they wont let her go ever he looked at me a long measured stare and then he looked at mila you said he could rescue yasmin i am not sure i dont rush in like a fool mr zaid this is not a suicide mission especially since you want to be sure no one escapes your wrath he raised an eyebrow at the dryness of my tone bahjat mila said quietly let sam do what sam does i would like to ask you both a question have you heard the term novem soles or nine suns does it mean anything to either of you both of them shook their heads i would like to know how you propose to take action zaid said you dont need to know its better you dont he swallowed i want to be sure yasmin is safe i sighed mr zaid yasmin may not even be in amsterdam anymore in which case ive got to find where shes gone i have no leads to follow right now and if her face is on the cameras in the train station and the dutch forensics teams figure out she planted the bomb then the police are going to be looking for her were on a deadline i am not spending my time asking your approval or permission it is just i feel i failed her i failed to protect her the words came from his mouth as though pulled by force he was a man used to iron control of situations and i guessed his helplessness ate at him i leaned forward i know what youre going through i know what it is to be missing a loved one i will get your daughter back for you bahjat zaid looked at me and then he smiled an awful stressed smile that held no joy like a dog showing its teeth if you fail or you take an action that results in yasmins death there will be consequences mr capra he was probably good at handling contracts and subordinates and accounts i was none of those things dont threaten me mr zaid i so easily crumble under pressure he closed his mouth and his stare turned to a glare i need all the information you have on your daughter and the kidnappers he handed me the laptop its all there thank you i studied his drawn face knowing he had just handed me every hope of finding his daughter why you pardon me why did they target you he blinked once twice glancing at mila my money why else if money was all they wanted then they could have asked for more they want more im wondering what it is you have that they want i expect he said being savages who are intent on violence they could ask for arms for military equipment they havent no he folded his hands on the table what kind of research did yasmin do it is classified and not pertinent to this discussion and nothing she is working on relates to current weapons systems i doubt they know or care that she is a researcher they have shown no interest in her work to me what about future systems yes like ten years down the line this is not about her research mr capra this is about her belonging to me that is why they took her i stood i was told you were one of a handful of people in the world who could do this incredible work zaid said yasmin is all that matters i made no promises to him we shook hands awkwardly and mila walked him downstairs i opened up the laptop files on yasmins life photos listings of friends in london and budapest and the united states the emails and the video files hed received an electronic portfolio of a kidnapping and i hadnt an idea where to start looking for her here in amsterdam mila came back with two steaming coffees and set them down on the small table you dont like him he strikes me as the worst kind of controlfreak parent and i dont think hes telling us the whole truth i said same as were not telling him pardon they produce this video to rip his guts out and dont demand a ransom bull theyve asked him for something and hes not telling us hes just hoping i can find them and kill them before he has to deliver they simply may not have asked for ransom yet you didnt tell him i had a personal stake against the scarred man he might be concerned you have two agendas he only cares about yasmin not about your wife i cant decide if hes more worried about yasmin or his reputation i drank some coffee how do you know zaid does that matter i know him and i want to help him and i want to help you tell me why you asked about the name novem soles i explained she leaned back in her chair it cannot be a coincidence the cias interest in this term and the tattoo there are groups that mark their members i studied the photos i tapped the scarred mans face there has to be a history on this guy hes somebody somewhere i have access to government databases around the world mila said and weve found nothing since that photo arrived its like hes been erased she claimed access that even people inside governments did not have you can work all sorts of magic you own this bar too my employer does i like this bar a lot i said its nice when all this is done then you and i shall have a drink together not before im going to get to work now i said the scarred man was within a few miles of me if he was still in amsterdam it is an amazingly compact city which meant just maybe i was far closer to lucy and my son than i had ever hoped before hang tight babe i thought im coming to get you i was going to break the scarred mans world this was what i knew the scarred man had conducted two bombings including one in a highly secure company office he had kidnapped both a prominent scientist and my wife a company agent he had stayed off the grid he had kept his identity secret i suspected he might be in the employ of the money czar id been investigating who had been tied to serious government corruption he had resources including dispatching a man to find me and kill me in brooklyn hed made no political claims so one had to assume all this was done for profit he was part of a network every world has an opening the new world of how criminals operate has more than most law enforcement broke much of the mafia in the united states because the feds could pressure people on the insideoffer them witness protection indict anyone connected to the illegal trade not just those actually conducting it the postmodern criminal networks come together for a particular functionsmuggling in ethnic laborers muling heroin hidden inside televisions from china that were diverted first to ports in pakistan or setting up a train bombing to shortsell a transportation stock price the cells are small and nimble and they snap together and break apart into new shapes like a childs plane or tank or wall made from the little plastic blocks but because the glue of the bricks is temporary they can be isolated where you cannot break a wall you can shatter a single brick i just needed to find the right brick i sat and i drank a soda at an outside table at a cafe near the sprawling street bazaar of the albert cuyp market on the south side of amsterdam in the dim gleaming sunlight the air smelled of fish of herbs of flowers i read a dutch paper and tried to put myself in the mind of peter samson the canadian smuggler i was on a company job a year earlier samson was a nice guy as smugglers went paid his fees paid his bribes didnt kill people id stung two ukrainian weapons traffickers who were attempting to ship contraband uranium to a radical group in new york the uranium turned out to be fake counterfeited by them as was the radical group counterfeited by me samson was held blameless in the grapevine of the criminal community when the two men ended up dead in a prague apartment killed by their business partners who didnt take their failure well they were screwed by their carelessness and greed and breaking of the barebones trust networks form because of necessity and a distant trust as samson i would still be distantly trusted by the man i wanted to see id found him by calling my old contacts in prague and learning that one of them had moved six months ago to lovely amsterdam i was on my third soft drink when he came ambling along walking past the tent stalls shoulders hunched a cigarette dangling from his mouth like a long broken fang id positioned myself because i figured he would come this way through the street market to reach his little store i could imagine the smell of the lavender oil in his hair the slightly rotten smell of garlic on his breath i remembered he chewed garlic lozenges with enthusiasm because he was scared of colds he went inside one of the doors close to the corner a sign announced a watch repair shop called in tribute to his craft and his adopted homelands national color clockwork orange he closed the door behind him i crossed to the door counted to thirty it opened up onto the groundfloor business a tiny old cd and record shop where the guitar riffs of an old clash album drilled the smokescented air in the store a bored punk sat at the cash register waiting for punk rock to come back stairs led up to the clockwork orange i went up and tested the door it swung open he hadnt locked it because his hands were full of bags i stepped inside i saw gregor setting the bags on a wooden counter glass counters showed vintage and collectible watches a table covered with black velvet held a snowfall of gleaming gears and next to them lay watchrepair tools craftsmans tools laid out in straight lines ready for work gregor was very good at bringing order to chaos i shut the door behind me he turned and stared at me for twenty long seconds and then he said i know you he had seen me only a few times but watchmakers are detail people from prague he did not look overjoyed you knew the vrana brothers yes they tried to cheat me but i guess i wasnt as pissed about it as their partners were the vranas had been the morons trying to grab from me money that didnt exist for goods that didnt exist and the sting id run helped the company empty their bank accounts their business partners took it hard they expressed their disappointment with an ax they buried them in a single coffin gregor said no need for two gregor had been a bit player with the vranas a guy whose business they used as a cover to mule goods out of eastern europe to britain i remember you were always worried youd catch a cold you like the climate in amsterdam better i asked its hardly tropical but i sneeze less he was nervous because he couldnt know what role id played in the death of the men hed known his eyes narrowed samson from toronto is that still your name i smiled its the only one i got he didnt smile back he tested whether i was armed by saying i need a lozenge and slowly reaching into his pocket i tensed but i didnt pull a gun yet gregor pulled out a package of garlic lozenges he slid one between his thin lips a test i wasnt here to kill him i was here either to offer a deal or get information hed provided the setup for the smuggling route for the fake uranium but since it was never smuggled the company had decided to leave him alone in play to be useful again but hed moved to amsterdam for what i guessed was a fresh start amsterdam had better smuggling routes and more of them tied back to the massive port in rotterdam how do you like amsterdam i said lovely the dutch are very pleasant people he sucked hard on the lozenge drawing out every bit of the garlics restorative powers they have an excellent healthcare system i gestured at the small shop brimming with inventory business looks good he shrugged watches are a leftover from an analog world books records movies everything goes digital he sniffled clicked his tongue but analog watches people still like them they are both necessity and luxury we must always know what time it is and we must look good doing it he cleared his throat wiped at his lip with the back of his hand how may i help you like i was here to look at his rolexes you dont ever answer a question when asked at least a man like the one i was pretending to be wouldnt instead i invaded his privacy i peeked inside the bags party stuff for a kid a girl napkins plates wrapped candies a party i married a woman here four months ago i have a stepdaughter my life is calmer i dont think i can be of help to you samson i am no longer connected you have a website for your little watch business gregor you probably do a lot of international trade hereordering from switzerland for inventory and shipping goods all over europe great front for smuggling get out i dont know what you mean a touch of panic bruised his voice oh i can get out i could head straight to the czech embassy and tell them that one of their wayward sons has set up business in this nice country and maybe if they dont want to be embarrassed by whatever idiot scheme youre up to these days they should keep a careful eye on you look very carefully at your books at your shipping manifests see where your customers are i dont smuggle no more i am legit now hard to make a living with used watches i opened up my wallet pulled out and inspected an impressive wad of euros courtesy of mila everyone has a price gregor looked at the thickness of the wad and stopped ordering me out i need to find someone gregor i pulled a photo from my pocket it was a print of the scarred man from the video of yasmin at the centraal station now i need to know if youve seen this man i handed him the photo gregor didnt push it back right away and say dont know him that would have been too obvious a lie he inspected him the way he might peer at damaged gearwork a narrow pianists finger tracing the circle of the mans face finally he said i dont know this man think i dont want your stepdaughters birthday present to be finding out that her shiny new dad used to be a smuggler or still is she wouldnt mind me being gone she acts like shes allergic to me but gregor studied the picture again i dont know him but this man i know who he looked at me i peeled off a couple of bills and slid them onto the counter him the big man with the dye job behind the first guy you pointed at i looked at the picture a few feet behind the scarred man was a big broadshouldered man with dyed white hair he looked as though he might have asian ancestry mixed with european him i know gregor said the edge of the photo trembled ever so slightly as he tucked it back into my hand watchmaker hands dont tremble do they owe you money he asked and that was his second mistake he wanted to know why i was looking for the blond so he could tell the blond about it who is he gregor uh i have to think about his name he backed away toward the gear table no more money who is he gregor tell me first why you are looking for these men i have a business proposition for them you can take their picture but not walk up and introduce yourself i dont know this looks like a police photo its been cropped of course it had id cropped out yasmin gregor just tell me the blonds name and where to find him the blondlook ill do you a favor and give you some advice stay the hell away from him whatever job youve got lined up find someone else i stepped forward and said tell me no no if i tell you then ive sent you to him that means he comes to see me no thank you terror colored his tone he cuts up people who get in his way no im a family man ill tell you his name but you can get someone else to put you close to him not me i touched his shoulder and he tried to slice my throat open the blade was a small thing but then so is a vein i wasnt sure if it was part of his watchmending gear or if it was simply a weapon he kept close at hand i heard the hiss it made as it sliced the air and i flinched back and it parted only the air close to my skin oh hell gregor said hesitating sorry i just want you to go im insulted youre more afraid of him than of me he dropped the little blade it wouldnt have hurt you really thats between me and my carotid i said whys he got you so scared he didnt answer me and so i decided that if he was afraid of violence id show him a little just a taste i shoved him back toward the watchmakers repair table i knocked him with a hard blow to the throat into a chair youre a bully he coughed i just wanted to run you out of here leave me alone that is entirely unfair gregor i inspected the craftsmans tools they were designed to hold gears in place remove bits of metal one had a curved point to it like an instrument you would see in a surgery i picked it up i put a fingertip on each side of his left eye i held up the vicious little tool i dont know the scarred man he yelled oh i believe you but you know the blond please please gregor i dont want to hurt you i want you to go to your stepdaughters party and enjoy your vision i have to pick up the cake he said sobbing a little for the games the koekhappen the what the game the kids play sticky cake hanging on a string you try to eat it fastest oh gregor that sounds like fun i want you to go to that i want you to go get the cake and win the race i hope its an awesome party and you can go soon as you tell me his name and where he is gregor tried to wrench away from me is the blond an old friend more friend of a friend he gave in the blonds name is piet he is close to an acquaintance of mine and your acquaintance his name is nic ten boom i havent known him long he and i had a beer a week ago this piet came with him but nic is connected and piet carries himself like he is too and what did you talk about during this beer ajaxthats the amsterdam football team and we talked about women i put the edge of the tool closer to his eye then what you just hung out and drank beer we went to the rosse buurtthe redlight district and you a newlywed gregor i i didnt partake neither did they you just went and looked at the whores i said this in approximately the same tone as a disbelieving spouse that was what piet wanted he was a little drunk he likes his beer he wanted to see the hookers standing in the windows is he a pimp gregors tongue flicked along his lip no no i dont know why piet wanted to go he was insistent we just went and we laughed at them the women standing behind the glass i dont know piet laughed and so nic and i laughed too you do whatever piet likes he takes over the room laughing at prostitutes i didnt believe him i cut him a little close to the eyelid what else did you talk about he yelled gritted his teeth okay okay piet wanted to know about moving goods to north america he asked me questions how did i sneak goods into the states i told him but i think they decided i was too small an operation for what they wanted i dont ship watches in big enough quantities i guess have you seen either of them again since now i put the instrument so close to his eye i could see the eyeball tremble shake in its socket he didnt answer right away and i jabbed the small blade into his palm he gasped a little blood welled up from his hand next the eye i am serious gregor you do not want to get in my way right now i havent seen piet again i had a beer with nic two nights ago whats nic do he works with pietbut i know him just through friends in the business he does stuff with computershes a bit of a geek he runs internet scams you know bank letters from nigeria kind of stuff i dont know how hes gotten involved in smuggling his face was tense under my hands hes hes odd i dont really want to be friends with him but he always has good email lists for marketing oh a spammer true evil where can i find nic i touched the pointed end of the instrument to my tongue wet the metal gregor shuddered under my grip he lives above a coffee shop over in the jordaan neighborhood but mostly hangs out at a bar called the grijs gander its down near the rosse buurt they know him there i let him go slowly you tried to cut my throat i said if you want me to forget that bad idea of yours youll forget we talked you dont mention me unless i need you as a reference with these guys then were buddies got it gregor nodded youre after piet piet i dont like piet can fry in hell he clutched his hurt hand close to him but carefully so he didnt besmirch his suit with the blood he didnt look at me theyre always ashamed after they talk if you tell anyone about our visit i will be back gregor i mean nic no harm i just want to talk to this piet but you narc on me to them and ill make a phone call and youll be on the next plane back to prague ill say nothing i tucked a little extra wad of euros in his pocket he nearly sighed with relief then i extracted his cell phone and said whats your wifes name your stepdaughters his eyes were bright with fear leave them alone samson please their names i made the words sound limed with frost my wife is bibi my stepdaughter is bettina i hope you and bibi are happy gregor tell bettina i said happy birthday i gave him a long look and said if they ever make a film about peter lorre you have a lock on the lead i turned and walked out i was not used to terrorizing people and if gregor hadnt tried to cut me i would have been a lot gentler but a scared gregor was a useful gregor on the street i checked the call log on gregors fancy smartphone two days ago a call from a nic late in the afternoon probably the invitation to have the beer at the grijs gander i checked the other phone records nothing of interest that jumped out many calls to bibi a few to bettina nothing else i checked the voice mails one from bibi in rapidfire dutch reminding him to pick up the party decorations for bettina bibi sounded impatient and drunk and she told gregor twice in the voice mail that he was a useless piece of crap but it was not up to me to question gregors choices true love was blind i thought with a sudden and sharp sting in my chest thinking of lucy the other voice mail from a week before was from nic and bonus there was a picture of nic next to the voice mail thicknecked red hair gathered in a short ponytail no smile grijs gander tonight if you can slip from bibis chain see you there at six i want you to meet a friend of mine nic said in the unerased voice mail said friend being piet gregor was good at slipping all sorts across borders under the authorities noses what did piet want smuggled into the states the grijs gander was not as nice as the rode prins it wasnt as nice as a broken urinal it sat on the edge of the rosse buurt a block or two from the neonkissed windows where the hookers pose it was hard to remember that families and regular working people lived in this district but they did and the grijs gander wasnt the kind of bar that opened around lunchtime i walked stuck in a mass of japanese tourists in the early evening the streets throng with nervous gawkers who simply want to look and have no designs to touch the girls standing in the windows mostly pose and preen for the tourists like its a warmup game they know the real dealmakers will come by soon the grijs gander wasnt just a dump bar it was a karaoke bar that made it about a thousand times more evil think american idol except that all the judges are drunk and might be handy with a knife it was only nine early by amsterdam standards on the karaoke stage a drunken young spaniard was slaughtering michael jacksons off the wall as his friends applauded a few men stood in the back playing pool a few others sat in booths two young women sat at the bar with their young boyfriends i cast my bartenders eye over the drinks most favored vodka or beer no fancy cocktails then i profiled the room this is a bartender skill trouble has nothing to do with gender or age or economic status it has all to do with where people sit where their gaze goes most were here just to get drunk and sing and laugh at the bad singers the pool players seemed to know each other which made it less likely for cues to be swung like swords one trouble spot was in the back a group of big darkhaired guys who spoke turkish and who kept scanning the bar as if waiting for a bubble of trouble to rise the other was one of the young women on the opposite side of the bar who looked exquisitely bored and kept glancing about the room as if looking for bigger muscles or a firmer ass or a brighter smile her checking out of the other men was pissing off the boyfriend those were the hot spots so i avoided both by sitting at the bar facing the front and looking at the beer taps i ordered a pint of amstel the bartender a thin sallow guy with five piercings in his left ear brought it to me he gave me the quickest of onceovers and set the beer in front of me i slid the right amount of euros to him rounded up for a small tip he did not offer to start me a tab i sipped made eye contact with no one and listened my dutch wasnt superb but id spent four months in suriname the former dutch colony in south america so i had enough to get by and with any language hearing it spoken revives the command of it my parents worked with episcopal reliefmy father as an administrator and auditor of the charitys funds and my mother as a pediatric surgeon specializing in cleft palatesand they and my brother danny and i traveled the world for all my youth my spanish russian and french were fluent my chinese and german okay i could say i am an american and i need to call the embassy in about three dozen languages although that phrase would do me no good with howell and the company hunting me id broken scores on speed of learning back in langleys language immersion programs but id never studied dutch that hard and i didnt doubt that my words sounded ragged and colonial i heard a mix of tongues in the bar dutch english widely spoken in amsterdam french spanish i gave the turks a careful look again they noticed me looking at them and i quickly put my gaze up to the moonwalking or moonstumbling spaniard i could wait in this drunken babel for hours and nic might not show up and someone someone in dutch intelligence was going through the centraal station bombing tapes and was going to see yasmin zaid enter the station with a backpack on her arm and then leave without it i had an overwhelming sense that my time was running out i had forgotten the virtue of patience spying was waiting and the sudden dull weight of trying to find nic hit me but he was the only link i had to piet and piet was linked to the scarred man and yasmin and the scarred man to lucy this was the only chain i could tug on i sipped my way slowly through my beer the next karaoke singer delivered an accurate version of knockin on heavens door that drew hearty applause and then a drunken woman got the giggles halfway through a screech of madonnas like a prayer she didnt get booed because her top was tight and the crowd was more forgiving i hated this place i missed the clean smells of ollies bar he was no doubt mad at me for running off i missed hanging out with august i hoped that howell and the company hadnt leaned on him ollie knew nothing not even that mila played him for a friend interesting though that shed been a regular visitor at ollies that couldnt be coincidence not with me getting a job there another thread to pull on but later i watched one of the girls lean close to her date nuzzle his cheek with a kiss i missed lucy third beer you had to drink in a place like this order a soda or coffee and you were instantly noted as someone worried about keeping his senses you were suspect you had to drink the young woman with the roving eye was suddenly sitting next to me dont you want to sing she asked me in english slurring her words she hadnt even tried dutch with me i guess i looked more american than i thought i glanced over at the boyfriend he watched me right back id be out of tune i said you and everyone else hmm what should you sing she studied me as though you could tell what a mans musical taste was from his face nirvana you look a little angry uh no ah now a smile crept onto her face prince i think i have a purple scarf you can borrow maybe radiohead theyre too solemn maybe justin timberlake you could bring some sexy back i didnt look at her the boyfriend had turned his attention to the stage no im not a singer what are you then just a guy having a beer who doesnt want to sing and doesnt want to talk sorry her smile turned to a frown asshole faggot go back to your boyfriend i said hes willing to put up with your bad behavior no one else will she got up in a huff and then i saw a man had sat down two stools from me while the girl was chatting nic from gregors phone with his red ponytail and his dour face i moved my eyes back to the karaoke stage where the crowd had turned on a filipino guy singing a kings of leon song with hearty boos he flipped off the crowd and an empty pint glass nearly hit him the bartender started yelling at the offending table they all shrugged like kids caught lobbing spitballs in class the lazy bartender stayed behind the bar either i was lucky and nic had decided to sit near meor gregor had warned him and given him a description of me and hed come to see who the hell i was i watched him from the corner of my eye and ordered another beer i could see nic pulling a smartphone from his pocket studying it he tugged nervously at the ponytail while he did so thumbing through messages he cursed quietly in dutch and got up suddenly and headed for the bathrooms which led into a hallway toward the back exit hed only drunk half his lager so i followed him he turned into the bathroom and glanced back he saw me knowing he was just going to the toilet i would have retreated back to the bar but now i couldnt the bathroom was cleaner than the bar nic stood at a urinal talking on the phone i hate that dont you think the other side cant hear the crash of your pee against the porcelain i washed my hands threw cold water on my face i got the goods the cops dont know he said in english he stopped talking he finished and flushed the urinal and put the phone back in his pocket two of the turks from the drunken table stood by the toilet stall talking smoking and they moved to block his way out sudden tension nic murmured words i couldnt hear in dutch the men moved but slower than they had to they left nic rinsed his hands there were no towels so he dried them on his jeans i followed him at a distance he was already back on the cell phone when i got back to my pint i was careful not to look at him but movement caught my eye the turks at the far table were glaring at nic frowning with a clear and ugly rage nic stayed on the phone not paying attention his voice was too low to hear over the surge of a bad journey imitation wafting from the beersoaked stage four of the turks got up headed toward nic lost in his conversation he didnt see them coming i finished my beer you could sense the karaoke was about to be eclipsed as the entertainment and a glass is easier to use as a weapon if its empty the four filled the bar space between me and nic i glanced at them but no one had eyes for me one mans thick finger tapped on nics shoulder hey you been ignoring me maybe nic said he closed the phone without saying goodbye you give a message to your friend piet thats hes a piece of shit and i want my money i told you later later not now i hadnt been the only one waiting for nic it seemed i got him his route i want to be paid now i didnt really want these turks beating up nic and breaking my chain i set the glass down and got ready to move nic said did you not understand im not his messenger tell him yourself a snidenessvery much im better than you undercut his words he was a thin sliver of a guy and he seemed to notice only after the snotty words hung in the air the stocky strength of the gathered turks no you call him now he keeps dodging us on the phone now you tell him i got to know where the delivery point is to finish the arrangements and i want my money you agreed to the conditions you dont like the deal once its done thats your problem he wont be getting what he needs then delivering what i wondered this might be what piet wanted smuggled into the states youre crazy nic said go drink your beer and leave me the hell alone im done taking the risks the turk said you get me my money and the rendezvous point from him or ill break your goddamned neck are you threatening me nic hissed you call him now the biggest turk grabbed at nics cell phone and nic jabbed it down into his jacket pocket face reddening with anger hello needleim the thread excuse me i said to the turk do you have a problem with this guy or with his friend its no business of yours the turk said staring at me as though id been stupid enough to stick my hand in a pot of snakes i am more lean than massive the turks were all my size or bigger muscles and hands hardened from work but youre beating him up to send a message to piet my every word was a poke a prod and the turk knew it the most brutal bar fights erupt after whispers not drunken hollers a yell is a flail a whisper is a fist i readied myself to take the first punch and thought every step is closer to lucy and the bundle so you can take this because you cant let these bastards kill him go find piet yourself what do you care the turk said because piet already owes me and im going to get my money first i lied i love a good lie that acts like a miniature bomb it shut them all up shifted the tension nic stared now unsure if i was just a loon or someone spoiling for a beating at the hands of a bored and drunk gang i felt sure now that he didnt know me gregor had kept his mouth closed tighter than a watch spring the idea of someone getting payment before them raised the groups temperature by about a dozen degrees on the karaoke stage the girl whod flirted with me launched into depeche modes enjoy the silence so i used it listen to the song dumbass i said to the turk id really like to enjoy your silence why dont i call piet nic started and well just see i got hit hard from behind and even being ready my forearms slammed into the wood of the bar i lashed out hard with a sharp kick that caught my attacker in the groin rule number one of a bar fight you make it short the brew of alcohol and machismo makes for a heady mix and a fight can quickly draw in people with no connections other than proximity to the combatants i did not want a ripple effect i wanted efficiency i wanted it over in ten seconds and i wanted both nic and me to be on our feet when this was done my attacker went down and i took a step and powered the base of my palm twice into the face of the man next to him he was bigger than me and he wasnt expecting a frontal assault nose throat very fast just as his fist grazed my jaw and he reeled back blood gushing from the fractured nose gasping one of the others seized me from behind pinning my arms and i twisted trying to throw him off balance nic fought with the fourth turk slugging without grace or economy of action he took a hard punch to the mouth and sagged he wasnt nearly as tough as his phone talk consider me unsurprised my attacker rammed me into the bar he slammed the front of his head into the back of mine and my head hammered into the wood it hurt a lot i wasnt going to be done in ten seconds i gonna mess you up so bad he hissed oh so original i didnt answer because i dont waste breath talking in a fight no one is listening a longburning ember of rage exploded in my chest these men were between me and nic and therefore between me and lucy i kicked away from the bar planting both feet below its shelf propelling myself and the turk clear he thought i was going to try and break free so he tightened his grip stupid right now i wanted him bound up with me we spun i kicked off against the floor now he was between me and the bar i slammed him back into the wood threw my head back and cannoned it into his face while kicking back clutching me close he didnt have a place to dodge he sagged on the fourth blow and let me go so i grabbed nics full pint glass and hammered it into the side of the mans head in a spray of beer the heavy glass didnt break but he crumpled done three of the other four turks sitting at the table approached one stayed behind watching arms crossed as nics man got the better of him pinning him to the floor the three threw themselves at me since i was open and available to dance i leveled one with a kick to the throat took two hard punches from his friends i stumbled and then i parried the next punch drove a knee into the groin you see how i prefer the throat and groin they offer a substantial return on investment of the next guy he withdrew to the floor young turk number three swung a broken beer glass at my face i blocked it with my forearm and with my other hand yanked a rag from the bar whipped it over the mug if you cant take a weapon away you neutralize it this isnt rocket science the move surprised him and i powered the covered glass back into his own face the glass didnt cut him but it scared him knowing the edge was jagged uncertainty is your friend in a fight the guy stumbled back and left himself open four hard fast punches to the eyes and the stomach and he was done four to keep him down and to make a statement to anyone in the bar eager to enter the fight nic was still grappling with his original opponent like it was first day of fight school i seized the man yanked him off nic and positioned my arm just so his head caught in the crook of my arm ill break his neck i yelled in turkish and the slowly regathering turks stopped seriously there is no point in fighting if you do not have to the man in my grip went very still and i could feel the panicked panting of his breath the bar could see i meant what i said and i stood like a man with a knowledge of leverage it got quiet even the flirt stopped singing and the depeche mode melody thrummed ahead in its lonely beat let him go the bartender called in dutch i said you call the police the bartenders gaze slid to nic and i saw nic shake his head ever so slightly no the bartender said in turkish i said back off and ill let him go your friends started it not me you saw him hit me first the turks stayed put hands still in fists then one sat and the rest of them followed gggaaggghh the man in my grip said i said shhhhhh then i yelled at the girl on the stage start singing please she stared and then her gaze caught the karaoke prompter she mumbled and then broke into that last bridge of the depeche mode tune with a nervous bright smile on her face outside i said to nic and looking a bit stunned he got to his feet and obeyed i shoved the guy i was holding to the floor i followed nic into the cool of the amsterdam night the girl crooning about vows spoken to be broken nic waited for me thank you he said youre welcome i said and i stopped by him to catch my breath and then he put the gun in my ribs take the gun down i said youll get arrested in about five seconds he kept the gun under his jacket me close to him i didnt pull away because i didnt know if hed shoot me walk he said just walk normally he kept glancing back to see if the turks were surging out in pursuitand yes here they came you might point that at them i said he lowered the gun and i grabbed the first turk by the throat there was a window with a hooker standing in it and i gestured with a slash of my hand for her to move out of the way she got the message and bolted behind the red velvet curtain that was her backdrop i pushed him through the glass and ran like hell because once the hookers are in danger here come the police and they closed in fast talking into shouldermounted mikes hurrying past me and nic you put that gun back in my ribs ill break you i said lets go talk someplace quiet near dam square we found a quiet barcafe no karaoke no drunken turks no fights brewing i had blood on the front of my shirt and the bartenders gaze widened slightly as we came inside she was an older brittlesmiling woman and she started to shake her head no nic went to her spoke softly in rapid dutch that i couldnt catch and she nodded after a moment we sat across from each other at a corner table out of sight of the street in case the turks kept roving my back to the wall so i could see the entire room but we were blocks away now and i hoped theyd decided to drink away their anger and embarrassment if theyd dodged the police he ordered us two beers from the waitress she looked at me and i had blood in the corner of my mouth she brought me a wet napkin and no questions i cleaned my face she set beers down in front of us with a tall shot glass of clear liquid kopstoot nic said pointing at the chaser it means a blow to the head youll like it at least its not a hole in the head i said i wasnt done with the fightingi wanted to hit some more i am not proud of that but it is what it is i used to prefer quiet nights at home reading watching good movies with lucy going to bed early and making love now i just wanted to hit fist against flesh boot against jaw the brutal dance of the fight shook awake a darkness slumbering inside of me i tamped it down with a long draw on the tall shotit tasted a lot like ginbefore i even bothered with the beer a drunken bar brawl wow i was really sliding into smooth gear here i had to clear my head thats backwards nic said you drink the beer first then the jenever do you do everything backwards huh usually you get to know a man before you risk your life for him in a bar fight those guys were assholes i dont like assholes and youre an asshole for sticking a gun in my ribs when i helped you nic took a sip of his beer forgive me i am a cautious man he said who are you peter samson my friends call me sam for short you fought like you are a soldier i was once now im not does piet really owe you money i dont know who piet is i said he stared what you just decide to he fumbled for the right english word insert yourself into a fight i was bored i dont have a job to go to tomorrow he took a long hard sip of his beer and rubbed his jaw he followed it by a sip of jenever i saw his glance wander over to a family sitting a few tables over father mother little girl about eight he watched the girl laugh and take a bite of her mothers dessert then reluctantly almost it seemed he pulled his gaze back to me as if hed decided on his questions where were you a soldier canadian special forces you left them they asked me to for fighting in bars no i stole some stuff and sold it on ebay dishonorable discharge but no jail time once i paid them back my commander wanted to avoid the embarrassment of me implicating him i shrugged i did it i cant blame them for giving me the boot well a fighter and a thief arent i lucky he gave me an odd crooked smile i prefer to think of myself as an entrepreneur you said you dont have a job maybe you want a job what fighting your fights for you he took the slap of the insult well i havent thanked you fine thank you sam i could have handled them but thank you you didnt pull the gun id missed wherever he was carrying it must have been strapped on his lower leg nowhere had i seen a broken drape in his shirt or his jacket no you seemed to eliminate the need to do so i didnt say anything and i drank slowly the rest of my beer he wasnt very smart to be a poor fighter and not produce the gun when threatened by an angry group there was only one reason he might have hesitated he did not want the attention he wanted to stay below notice and pulling a gun even in a rough bar would result in unwanted interest silence is my most powerful weapon most people literally cannot sit in silence with another human being around especially in a cafe over drinks we consider it odd the quiet bothered nic so if you might be interested in bodyguard work i might be able to get you a job i dont have a dutch work permit i said i lost the paperwork you wouldnt need a permit my clients are um very discreet um like pimps i dont beat up on hookers oh no much more highclass he lowered his voice but one of the perks is you know girls i kept my face still i think i ought to get a beer for each guy i downed i hoisted the glass you owe me two more a smile inched across his face slowed faded back to the solemn frown all right he was a busy man he gave off an air of impatience but he liked what hed seen in the bar fighthe had to know id acquitted myself far better than he hadand hed decided not to walk away from me not yet he gestured at the waitress for another round sans the jenever where in canada are you from i knew all this would be checked tomorrow toronto i know it well really yes did you ever eat at the rosedale diner on parker street its on yonge street best hamburger in town i could smell a test your parents dead i shrugged they left me a little money to see the world which high school did you go to st michaels college school then to mcgill studied history barely passed but enough to get into canadian forces officer candidate school my legend as peter samson canadian scofflaw had been built by the company nic wasnt going to be able to dent it i was peter samson from birth until now and there were school records and credit histories and a canadian military record to support me unless the company had wiped out that identity in which case no records on peter samson would exist you know amsterdam nic asked me i took another long drag of beer and stifled a belch pardon not well i know prague and warsaw and budapest better youve spent a lot of time in eastern europe thats where the more interesting work opportunities are such as such as stuff i really shouldnt tell a stranger i said with a kidders laugh and he laughed too no really he said after an awkward silence you put a man through a window for me sam were friends now protecting stuff i guess its like protecting people i just made sure the stuff got to where it was supposed to be that was a kind and subtle description of smuggling but if piet was a smuggler like gregor suggested then i might be more interesting as a potential employee or at least i might get an interview i just had to get close enough to scout them out kill them all except the highranking onewhich i assumed was pietand force him to lead me to the scarred man simple subtle worked on nic he lit a cigarette sipped at his beer like to where mostly to north america getting a secret shipment to there was piets goal i hoped and i wondered from the turks words if maybe hed arranged illicit passage to the states and now the arrangement had gone sour i might be able to offer you a job but i need to speak with the client your clients not this piet guy who doesnt pay is he piet pays those dumbass turks need to learn patience i made a noise in my throat shrugged look im good at getting stuff to the states protecting it making sure nobody screws with it if that sounds good to you fine if not thanks for the floor show it was critical i not look too eager nic waited a few seconds and then said i think i can use you the pay is excellent two thousand euros a week in cash well im running low on beer money so yeah i guess maybe i ran my finger in a circle along the beer smudge on the table how do i get in touch with you you got a cell yeah he pushed a napkin toward me write it down i did i didnt put my name on it decide quick i said with a shrug i get bored i might move on he tucked the napkin into his pocket all right question i said yes you pulled a gun on me after i helped you youre kind of a jerk he cracked a smile i have to be i wanted to be sure you didnt really come after me next you told the turks piet owed you money you might have fought them just to get at me yeah i dont know your piet i said that just to get them to shut up i said didnt work the fists worked well enough all right sam he tossed more euros on the table treat yourself to more blows on the head or get yourself dinner you did me a favor tonight and i think we can do business together okay you got my number he got up and left i had my back to the wall and i watched him go out of the door and across the long flat stretch of dam square under the nationaal monument i stepped out into the night and caught sight of nic at a distant corner he was heading south in the direction of the prinsengracht it was full dark now and i hung back in the shadows as he crossed a street and a bridge i followed if he turned he might see me but no he was back on his electronic nipplethe cell phonetalking i followed but not too close a car stopped picked him up he got in and the car roared off then turned toward singel a major street that made a large ushape through amsterdam i looked around for a cab none i just started walking the direction hed gone you never know what you might see and homethe rode prinswas the same direction thirty seconds later a small blue sedan pulled up next to me the passenger door opened mila get in dummy you were watching me she roared away from the curb before i even had the door shut you could have screwed up gotten captured i would have had to kill you cant have you talking about us it was hard to know with her if she was serious if hed grabbed me you would have killed me instead of rescuing me if you screw up the first job no point in giving you harder work she said cut losses move on she turned revved fast slowed as we caught sight of the car that had picked up nic i got into a bar fight good way to stay in the shadows she sounded disgusted you could have gotten arrested guess what happens when they run a check on your face dumbass youre on your way back to your boogeyman howell i didnt have a choice were not like the company sam i dont do job reviews i just cut you loose if youre a problem its nice to know you have my back she glared at me dont misunderstand me i will have your back always as long as you prove its worth having now all you prove is you like to make stupid fight i made contact and hes trying to get me a job with the blond guy named piet we watched nics car turn onto singel tell me all the details mila drove with intensity while she listened keeping just the right amount of distance behind i wondered where she had worked who had taught her her skills so he might be going to talk to piet i finished about you a job applicant you flatter yourself she said i meant he made a call that said he had the goods and hes having problems with a turk whos making trouble for piet who was setting up a route you understand smuggling you dont just load your illegal goods up and hope for the best you plan out the exact path your goods take with all supporting documentation and people along the way to protect it and keep it out of the authorities attention solid unbreakable routes are a valuable resource if their route has been messed up or compromised by this turk it might cause a meet to happen she kept nic in her sights as he turned onto another side street these guys are weird i said theyre smugglers so why do smugglers kidnap yasmin and have her blow up a train station can you get me more details on the bombing on the victims the response the investigation mila didnt look at me as she made the turn a soft rain began to fall all right ill get you what i can but you dont have a lot of time sam to be analyzing these guys you just need to find them and get yasmin back dont lose sight of that understanding them will help me find them she snapsnapsnap ped her fingers our time it is going sam you cant conduct psychoanalysis on a bunch of crooks before the dutch police id yasmin on a security tape right now shes just some girl with a backpack but if they can id her were out of time the damage to zaids company will be done if i was going to psychoanalyze anyone itd be you she glanced at me analyze away you will simply have to trust me that we are the good guys ive heard that before yes she said i know ah nics car sped up took a hard turn she revved followed close in the street where he had taken the left five streets led off like the spokes of a wheel each street short intersected with another turn you distracted me she said your fault nic was gone the rain began to come down harder ten days before in an office in new york that hid behind a sign claiming it was a financial advisory firm howell raged find him find him and bring me his head on a plate thats very salome of you august said howell touched his temple the slow arterial throb of a migraine began to pulse behind his eyes he has to be heading to london has to be thats ground zero for him i want every office alerted to his profile i want him found now put under the control of our people not under anyone else i want to know who the dead body was august said dont you think that matters yes of course howell said i want ids on this guy and i want to know how and when he died i think he died friday night august said just from a visual check christ howell blanched he mustve killed the bastard right before i got there he got up and paced to the window i should take you off this mr holdwine youre his friend my being his friend is the reason you should leave me on august said im the only one he might surrender to guys who leave bodies in tubs like party favors for us to find arent interested in surrendering howell said i thought we broke him of escape when he couldnt get the passport you questioned him for how long but you never got to know sam august said you dont know how he thinks i do take me with you get me reassigned to your team all right howell said august holdwine might just be a superior secret weapon against sam capra he thought the past ten days had not been pleasant for howell first the discovery that sam capra wasnt whiling away an hour in the brooklyn library then the discovery that the company had an agent who had left a dead body in a neighboring apartment then tracking the stolen car to the truck stop and then nothing for days sam capra could have hitched a truck ride to anywhere in the country they had scant few customers to track from the truck stop in the window of time that sam might have been there most of them paid cash for their lunches and coffees three days later one of the waitresses remembered that a man matching sams description had left at the same time as another trucker no she didnt know the truckers name but hed paid for his lunch and fuel with a credit card every credit card charge had been traced until a trucker named vince trout was found who said yes hed given a young man a ride to a port of new york and new jersey terminal the bastard is sneaking into europe on a cargo ship howell said he was empowered to send teams to london rotterdam and marseilles to scout crews to see if anyone had seen a man matching sams photo but hundreds of ships and the crews that might have seen sam would be back at sea and not easily questioned we could go public with his face august said now invent a story about him no howell said we dont want him front and center in the press a possibly rogue cia agent we dont do that kind of selfdestructive publicity horrible at funding time we dont call them out until weve got them in handcuffs or a coffin he crossed his arms stared at august or we catch him and we find out what the hell hes up to the guy he killed might have been sent to kill him i think someone took the bait then we want to find said someone i have an id on the dead guy hes a lowlevel thug connected with smuggling operations in paris simon tauras long criminal record nothing special lowlevel thugs dont normally cross the ocean to try and kill a company agent yes thats interesting to me howell said im going to follow that lead see where it takes us i want you to focus on seeing if there were any communications from ships out of new york that implied anything unusual like they found a stowaway or they had any odd radio transmissions it will take days to search that database there are millions of conversations in it then get started the trail gone cold grew hot two days before sam capra arrived in rotterdam august discovered in the echelon databasewhich monitored a vast number of the worlds communications and could be searched for critical keywordsradio chatter from the captain of a liberianregistered cargo vessel to the owning company about an approaching helicopter the ships captain was told the helicopter should be allowed to land no further explanation howell ran into a stone wall when he contacted the shipping company the helicopter was explained as an atsea inspection by the owners the flight plan referred to didnt exist though so someone had maybe chased the ship out to sea for a reason to find sam or to bring him back for three days the shipping company stymied him then they told him that the man he wanted to interview the captain of the elisa martin was already back out at sea and wouldnt be available for a facetoface interrogation until he docked in new jersey in another week he decided to question the man by satellite phone which he did and ran into a wall of denial someone had paid well for silence howell thought let me at least send his face to the authorities say his passport may have been compromised stolen by a known fugitive and whoever is using it needs to be contained immediately august said howell agreed so rotterdam homeland security had constant satellite surveillance going on all major ports in the world howell pulled strings to get the imagery analyzed it took a team of twenty and they found a dozen leads they coordinated it with security camera footage from the port itself and caught a photo of a man who might have been sam capra walking out of a secured crew area next to a blonde pixie in leather jeans the crew area was close to where the elisa martin had docked so sam capra was in holland probably trying to figure out a quick way to london howell alerted the dutch intelligence service who promised to coordinate with the police in rotterdam amsterdam and the hague and the border police all quietly eurostar and the ferry companies were alerted the dutch authorities had their hands full with a train station bombing and howell could tell his request wasnt a priority he contacted his counterpart in the british intel service who given that the company bombing had taken place on their soil and they had lost several civilians were most eager to find sam capra themselves he could not find any identification on the woman her eyes were masked by sunglasses and the facial recognition software did not give any partial matches in the company database he asked the techs to expand the search sam had a friend and he wanted to know who this most interesting woman was howell badly wanted to go to the netherlands he wanted to find sam himself because he suspected this would only end with a bullet now and he wanted to be the one to deliver it if hes done this its for a good reason august said maybe hes doing the job we should have done months agofinding the people who bombed our office howell said slowly yes that has occurred to me but thats my job not his and whos this woman hes gotten some help yes howell said and who would bother to help sam and why howell and august took a flight to amsterdam hurried to a company safe house that lay in a stately home along the herengracht canal and set up a communications point waiting to hear waiting because someone was going to see or find sam capra in the next day sam was not going to be hiding sam was going to be looking for the people who had grabbed his wife howell felt certain august holdwine stood at the window watching the rain hit the bridge and the canal and thought you dumbass your only hope is if we find you and you are willing to talk to me if you dont youre going to jail for the rest of your life and a jetlagged howell lay awake listening to the rain patter against the canal and the roofs shingles and thought they wont risk another embarrassment back at headquarters they wont care what hes doing even if its right now i have to find out what he knows and then i will have to kill him there is a man trying to infiltrate our group piet said nic told me about him he is a former intelligence agent he has been seeking a means to get close to me and presumably to you im pretty sure hes tied to your little bitchs daddy edward had just gotten off a plane his flight delayed by bad weather and he was tired and irritable his stomach rumbled the lunch hed eaten in budapest disagreed with him the fish he thought that would teach him to eat seafood in a landlocked country and hed gotten word that simon his man dispatched on a critical errand in brooklyn had failed which meant sam capra was alive this was a bad night but he would not be afraid fear was for fools where is he now edward asked he put down his suitcase he took a calming breath earlier he was at a bar nic can tell us and he wants to see me edward said bring him to me i will put him to good use and your little bitch if anyone is my little bitch piet edward said its you you will undo my work if you speak of her that way shes one of us now be nice piet sucked in air and crossed his arms edward hated him but piet was necessary you better be getting what you need to get out of her piet said his voice was a low growl otherwise youve risked us all for nothing and nothing doesnt pay my bills life is getting what you want and im better at life than you are piet her father caved caved collapsed avalanched youre overconfident piet said bahjat zaid is behind this infiltration he is trying to outflank you he had his plaything the wakizashi sword pulled free from the custom holster on his pants let me go van gogh on her ear send it to him hell behave you dont touch her ever im starting to think you have feelings for the little bitch on the last word ignoring the short sword in piets hand edward seized piet by the throat and pushed him almost gently back into the wall piet brought the sword up quickly the edge of it touching edwards wrist you know if you cut me youre dead edward said the sword is a stupid prop piet carrying it you look like a refugee from a bad samurai film now put your toy down or ill yell out and my friends will come up here and kill you with their bare hands thats their loyalty to me after a long moment piet lowered the sword edward released his grip piet was afraid of losing respect of face easy to manipulate the routes to get my goodsyou did an excellent job the pickup in budapest went very smoothly it had been so hard to leave his treasures behind and get on the plane back to amsterdam but now the treasures were on their way hidden in piets smuggling route they would be in the netherlands soon enough lets have a look at this spy and make him useful get the cameras set up please the modicum of respect worked piet left with a curt nod and edward went to yasmins room he touched the place where the sword had lain against his wrist he could still feel the edge of the blade piet was starting to be more of a problem than he was worth but edward needed him right now everything was lining up the money the goods his future yasmin lay on the bedthat was her privilege now edward was proud of his fair lady the woman hed modeled from raw clay into a killer he stood over her as she slept in an uneasy drowse after shed dropped the backpack behind a book display inside the small magazine store in the train station theyd hurried her out to a van two blocks away and driven off she had not panicked or freaked out or tried to flee she had followed her orders without question without fear edward could see the admiration for his work in the eyes of the others that night they had moved her to the attic edward brought her favorite food cinnamon pastries he told her she had done a wonderful job that she had done great good today you eliminated a serious problem for us today he began to unbutton her blouse you are a heroine to me yasmin are they listening she whispered no you are one of us now you proved that at the station no one is listening to us it is only you and me here little bird he slipped her blouse from her shoulders she did not resist he held up a small wooden dove i saw this on a street vendors table at the albert cuyp market and thought of you beauty strength and wood can be shaped into so many things yasmin he eased off the skirt theyd put her in she lay nude and shivering on the narrow bed there is no going back now yasmin the bombing went well you did your part exactly as we asked bombing she didnt blink at the word your old dirty life is done he put the wooden carvinga dovearound her throat it hung on a leather thong and he tightened the string almost unconsciously as he put it against her flesh he felt the pulse of her throat through his fingertips edward stood and undressed his body was lean and muscular he lay down on her and kissed her throat her face with gentleness she did not kiss back she lay still youre troubled by what you did he asked we went through this a thousand times she didnt resist his kisses he took her with urgency she closed her eyes he finished lay next to her then took her again this time with gentleness she lay as though not feeling his touch he didnt care the whole time he whispered this is how you stay alive yasmin do what i say and you live now he sat and he watched her thinking until he heard a commotion a struggle downstairs and he knew piet had readied the show for the cameras he woke her yasmin wake up the first thing she saw was the gun he was holding is that one of the she began and then she blinked past the bleariness of sleep no no its not she blinked and sat up from the pillow he sat next to her on the mattress listen i have a duty for you but one you will like would you like a shower some food she nodded he led her to a bathroom and fresh soap and shampoo and a toothbrush when she started to take off the dove he stopped her no i want you to wear it always a hope for peace he gave her fresh pants a shirt underwear demi brought up bread and fruit for breakfast he thanked demi and so did yasmin demi gave her a surprised glance as she went back downstairs its nice to be one of us to be free from the closet isnt it she nodded come with me he felt a thrum of excitement in his chest it was just like going back onstage he brought her down into the main dining room and there they were piet demi six other men including the twins who often stared at her now they all stared at her and in the middle where the diningroom table should have been there was a man tied to a chair thick rope bound him a gag protruded from his mouth he moaned as edward and yasmin entered his face bruised and beaten do you see this man yasmin edward said yes i see him her voice was flat hes a terrible man yasmin he has been working on a scheme to take you from us and to kill you if he cannot take you away to take me and to kill me her tone was quiet unruffled yes to take you back to your father he contacted one of our people with a mouthful of lies we followed him do you know this man yasmin edward grabbed the former spys head twisted it toward her hed been beaten badly but she studied the face and finally she shook her head your father knows we are protecting you from him your father sends people to destroy us in secret like this man she said well thats wrong i dont want to go back to what i was and she spat in the mans face the gob of saliva hung off a clotted eyebrow dense with dried blood the group gave a soft murmur watching her are you sure you dont know him he has tried to infiltrate us through piet i dont know him she looked at edward the man bound to the chair stared at her and edward took the gag from his mouth i just i just want the money im owed by piet thats all i dont want to know about anything else you know about me from who edward said i dont know the man said in turkish and then edward started to beat him yasmin tried to look away and demi said dont you dare dont you dare look away or well tie you to the chair so she didnt under his fists edward saw the blood leap in its little splatters and the teeth break he stopped and picked up one of the mans hands i have ten ways to make you talk right here bahjat zaid sent you yes he said and he began twisting the fingers hard finally the man screamed no no all right zaid sent me and then a torrent of words that yasmin couldnt follow and edward leaning close his hand on the mans shoulder gentle now like they were friends you were going to steal our shipment when it arrived in rotterdam yes trade it for yasmin i would get it and then trade it for her so i could take her back to her father i will tell you all please just dont so your route to smuggle our goods from here to america that was all a lie i just want to be sure i understand you have nothing to fear if you tell me the truth yes it was a lie all a lie there was no route his breathing came in hard jolts edward stepped away wiped a speckle of blood from the toe of his shoe he gestured at demi standing by a camera he snapped fingers and said action demi started the video camera edward pulled out a gun its barrel capped with a silencer from the back of his pants he handed it to yasmin he could hear the sudden gasps of the others act one he said kill him she took the gun in her hand she looked at him in confusion its not a test yasmin its a duty the man was broken blood dripping from his mouth his gaze met hers yasmin do it now please my todo list is not getting shorter edward said she didnt raise the gun she stared at the beaten man yasmin he hoped he wouldnt have to threaten to kill her again im deciding where to shoot him she said i dont want to hit the ropes instead edward smiled a teachers pride in his student the man began to babble in his own tongue begging her not to shoot pleading for mercy she raised the gun steadied its grip yasmin the turk yelled in perfect english your father is trying to help you whatever they told you its a lie dont do this my father is the liar the gun wavered a moment she blinked and fired the spit noise was soft the bullet hit him in the chest the chair fell over he was still alive he screamed in agony yasmin fired again the bullet struck the mans throat he spasmed and then went still one of the men laughed and then they all clapped for her she just stared at the dead man as though he might fade from her sight she didnt lower the gun she was a statue thats a wrap demi load the footage onto the computer blur our faces if theyre visible then well get it ready to premiere it for her idiot father edward took the gun from yasmin and lowered her arm like settling a marionette back onto its wooden stage you are perfect now she cupped her elbows as if she felt cold and she seemed confused he took her chin in his hand your father is now under our heel he will not give us any more trouble yasmin she glanced at the eyes of the others all on her may may i go back to my room or do you need me to help you clean up go upstairs she obeyed the group watched her in silence i wonder piet said if that girl is playing you she is not i think she might do anything to survive piet said she knew it was her or that turk you said she was a scientist right i think she just might be stonecold dont turn your back on her shes shot a man now it will be easier the second time always is shut up and get rid of the body edward said piet could do the dirtiest job given his mouth and demi i want that tape ready to send i want her father to start his day with his lovely perfect daughter i opened my eyes i heard a baby crying and for one sweet moment i thought it was my and lucys bundle and that all was right in the world that london had never happened but the ceiling was weird a blue peaked roof with white beams cutting across it at an angle i was in amsterdam morning light shone on my face i could still hear the baby i got up and went to the small window that overlooked the prinsengracht canal and saw a harried mother walking by pushing a stroller the nights rain had gone and it looked like a pretty morning i had not thought much about being a father when lucy had told me we were going to have a baby there was at first the shock of surprise and joy then i thought of my dad whod taken me and my brother to six continents by the time we were ten who was busy saving the world and often ignoring us he had been a good father in some ways and an indifferent one in others i would not repeat his mistakes assuming i got that chance a knock at the door i kept my gun close and opened it mila dressed like a young account executive a neat gray suit muted scarf stylish shoes she carried an expensive briefcase and a bag of groceries she was a little chameleon are you jobhunting today mila yes i hope to work with a better class of people very soon get showered ill make coffee we have a busy day i showered fast dried dressed in jeans and a black tshirt and a jacket when i came out to the small kitchen she had breakfast pastries on a plate coffee steaming from the percolator her laptop was open and a video was playing on it yasmin shooting a man the video reached its end started again mila munched on a roll sipped coffee the quality of the film is dodgy but impact is there my god i said i rewound and looked at the murdered mans face the man executed was the turk id fought in the bar the night before i hit the space bar on the laptop and the video stoppedyasmin frozen raising the gun her face was clear in the video every other face except the dead mans had been digitally blurred let me guess i said blackmailing bahjat zaid chapter two this arrived in his email at six oclock this morning he forwarded it to me via a secure line so theyve made her into a bomber and a murderer i said they cant or wont take her to a bank for her pattyhearstjoinshercaptors moment so theyre manufacturing them mila made a noise as she sipped her coffee did zaid send that man a slow anger started to smolder past the soreness i felt from last nights fight he hires me he hires this guy we dont know about each other i dont like it he could have named you before they killed him if hed known yes but now theyll be on guard like never before we both took the same tack trying to connect to piet and now im screwed mila my job just got a thousand times harder just when id started to get close to nic i stood and paced the floor get zaid here we have to talk what the hell is this shipment that his other hired gun was supposed to steal he told me he was leaving amsterdam where is he i dont know then lets find him i sat down reopened the email hed sent on the laptop the original email sourcefrom yasmins captorshad gone through an anonymizer service and was untraceable but i looked at zaids email to mila encoded in the source headers was information about the provider i looked at it plugged the information into a website that provided information on server locales zaid sent this from hungary why the hell is he in hungary hes hiring me to save his daughter and instead of being here close to the action hes in hungary i heard my voice rise thats where yasmin worked why is he there i dont know sam and yelling at me is not going to put a gps on him his company has a facility there he might simply be tending to business right the one yasmin worked at i do not like this zaid hiring another agent to attempt a rescuewe could have tripped each other up we could have killed each other mistaking each other for members of the gang i assume the turk was given the same orders i wasrescue yasmin and wipe out the kidnappers she shrugged perhaps we need a different approach no we dont even have the full story zaid wanted the turk to steal whatevers being shipped so it could be exchanged for his daughter we need to know what that shipment is i will find out she said i considered okay i was in the bar before nic was maybe i can say i heard the turk make a threat that will concern both nic and piet she gave me a slight smile eat your breakfast you must be prepared to frighten nic very badly i watched the tape again what will they ask zaid for now they did this because they knew the turk was chasing them but they did it to ruin her again now theres footage of his daughter bombing a station and executing a man what if she hasnt been brainwashed what if shes a willing participant nothing in her background suggests violence i stared at the video watched yasmin become a murderer again its like they want zaid to suffer this is personal that is your guess you could be wrong mila said heres the problem i dont know how i can get leverage with nic and therefore piet and rise above suspicion we could grab nic force him to tell us no you want this whole group eliminated then i have to get inside i have to get them all together nic is the key right now so how will you convince him that you are necessary any operation like this faces a challenge i said i need to know what their challenge is and be the cure how will you find that out i considered gregor told me that nic lives above a coffee shop in the jordaan i know his last name is ten boom thats a start it took me a while to find nic he was not listed in the phone book i could have called gregor but i didnt want him any more scared the jordaan is an older neighborhood not far from the prinsengracht thats gotten a bit trendy it wasnt a canal district the streets were narrow in some stretches and wide in others even with parking for cars in the middle of the street the buildings were the narrow tall sort favored in amsterdam the roofline was a jumble of angles and heights many of the shops were appropriately hipster or aimed at students bookshops clothing stores and many places to get coffee or beer the ninth coffee shop i tried yes there was a ten boom listed on the door buzzer to the corresponding doorway i was standing at the bottom of the stairs when i heard nics voice raised feet coming down the stairs hell i bolted out the front door and hurried into line in the coffee shop if he came in for his morning jolt i would have a bitch of a time explaining why i was here i thought hmm maybe it would show initiative that i had found where he lived more likely it would freak him out i heard the door jingle behind me best to face the music i looked over my shoulder it was a pretty young woman entering and beyond her nic on a cell phone talking with animated gestures he unlocked a bicycle pulled it free from its railing and got on it he didnt bother with hands on the handlebars like many of amsterdams daredevils and he rode off still jabbering on the cell phone i ducked out of the line smiled at the pretty woman and hurried back to the buildings lobby his apartment was on the top floor i ran up the stairs found the door listened silence inside i knelt before the door mila had pronounced my plan stupid yet had geared me up the lock was a simple one with two picks i had it open in forty seconds i eased the door open and stepped inside shutting the door without a sound the apartment was unkempt halffull beer glasses left over from last night and smelling stale sat on a coffee table yesterdays newspaper lay scattered across a couch i moved soundlessly through the littered den the small kitchen three doors beyond the kitchen i opened the closest it was a small bathroom then the next one and froze an elderly lady lay asleep in a bed snoring an empty vodka bottle stood guard on a night table her hair was a mess and the slightest odor of dirtiness wafted above her i eased the door shut damn this was too dangerous but this might also be my only chance i tried the other door nics room and it was as spotless as the other rooms were dingy most of it was taken up by a desk with three computers sitting along it above the monitors were rows of books on database design programming languages and many books on computer hacking and security perhaps he was more than a spammer a scattering of photos sat on a side table a younger nic without the ponytail and the beer weight standing next to the woman who lay in the other rooms bed she looked younger and healthier and next to her was a man who looked like a much older version of nic nic the wannabe badass was a computer geek who lived with his mother id come equipped i needed information and most information these days is parked on computers i tapped the keyboards space bar there was a login prompt asking for a password i slipped a usb portable drive into one of the ports on the first computer the software loaded on it started its work to crack the login password mila said it was nsabased technology and didnt say how shed gotten her dirty little hands on it while the cracker attempted to well crack i searched the room nic had a gun a glock under his bed nothing else the womans snoring rose in volume snuffled went quiet the computer pinged i was in i removed the password cracker and slipped in a different usb drive one designed to copy his entire hard drive mila had promised me that it would work much faster than a conventional drive it started its work and i went to the listing of his most recent applications and documents to see what hed been working on hed been looking at pdfs i opened them all up hed been reading and capturing news website accounts of the centraal station bombing i scanned them nothing i didnt already know five killed four dutch one russian the russians name had not yet been released the police said because of difficulty locating his family the bomb had gone off in a small bookstore it had been left behind a cardboard display of books that were on sale police speculated it was not left in the open area of the station because there was no place to easily dump a backpack without it being spotted next up were pictures of the devastation and id looked at them for five seconds before realizing no way these came from a news website these were crimescene photos the kind simply not made available for public viewing taken by the police they were gruesome people buying their papers their magazines chocolate candy for a snack or a badforyou breakfast one cashier just doing a simple honorable job all dead their shredded bodies lay among the torn and burned remains of the shop blood splattered the walls limbs torn from the corpses it brought back the most horrible memories of the holborn bombing how did nic have these photos there was a police analysis of the bomb stamped as classified what had he said last night at the urinal i got the goods the cops dont know i thought hed meant smuggling goods but i was wrong the smug bastard had hacked into the police database he was following the investigation a chill touched my skin nic was far far more than he seemed i had badly underestimated him i examined the details of the bomb a small amount of semtex explosive believed to have come from an inventory stolen in the czech republic six months earlier simple but but there was nothing in the report about how the bomb was detonated i paged through the rest of it there should be a timer or a cell phone to trigger the blast with a call none was present even a devastating blast should have left forensic evidence of how the bomb was activated and blown the next page was labeled unidentified electronics i glanced through it there was gear in the knapsack that had been annihilated in the blast but left enough fragments to indicate that it wasnt from a cell phone the police were still piecing it together maybe that was the detonator but if it wasnt obviously a cell phone or a timer what was it i could see a halfmelted grid no bigger than a handit looked like a honeycomb forged from metal i had never seen its like before apparently it had blown through the paperback display and into the intestines of one of the victims preserving it from the worst of the blast the police did not yet know what this gear was and that troubled me next door the snoring rose again and then stopped i could hear movement in the bed i stopped typing the rustling stopped but the snoring didnt resume i glanced out the window it was a straight drop four stories down to the cafes awning i waited no movement maybe she was awake and staring at the ceiling i checked the portable drive halfway done maybe mom was used to the soft insistent click of the keys she might just assume that nic was home i looked at the files on the people who had died in the blast the four dutch citizens were the cashier and three customers including a nineteenyearold girl a fortyfiveyearold man a fiftyyearold woman and a twentysevenyearold man they were wives and husbands fathers and daughters friends each had in their electronic dossier a photo from either a drivers license or a passport the file on the russian was blank except for an autopsy report no name no age listed no passport number listed no photo weird the amsterdam police among the best in the world didnt have a read on who the fifth victim was that astonished me i looked through the rest of the files that nic had stolen from the police databases found a video labeled toezicht and dated the day of the blast toezicht meant surveillance i activated it the security camera feed had gone into a central security station if the tape had been only at the store it likely would not have survived the blast i had five minutes of the feed that nic had managed to filch off the police servers i watched the last moments of the lives of innocent people the young cashier at her station giving change with a slightly bored frown she kept scratching her ear customers coming and going most not lingering long i did not see yasmin which meant she must have dropped off the bomb before this section of the feed started dozens of people leaving and arriving and leaving again the store was busyit was amazing that more people hadnt been killed i saw a man stop before the book display next to it was a newspaper display he reached for the paper and then the screen went whitehot blank i backed up the film and froze it five people in the store caught in the cameras unblinking eye the four dutch i could see and guess at from their photos in life the russian was the man reaching for the newspaper display when the bomb detonated i backed up a frame at a time he stepped back from the newspaper display he was in profile his face turned slightly away he backed toward the magazine display and then i saw his face i know him it cant be behind me in the hallway a door opened feet shuffled on hardwood nic ben je wakker are you awake ja i called in my best impersonation of nic i couldnt stay i pulled the drive from the port i could hear the bathroom door shut and then water running in a sink the flush of a toilet a shower started and beyond that i heard the front door open nic was home no way out the front i tapped carefully on the computer making sure i was not leaving traces of my time there i logged out and the screen returned to its prompt page i put it to sleep i put my leg out over the window i could still hear the crash of the water in the shower and i hoped nic wasnt heading straight back to his room i pulled myself out standing on the sill i couldnt go down i looked up there was a beam extending from the brickwork several feet above my head most of the buildings in amsterdam had them i presumed they were used to haul large pieces of furniture up to the homes given the narrowness of most dutch stairwells it was quite a jump i waited for someone on the street to notice me but no one was looking up i gathered my thoughts let the muscle memory of hours of parkour training settle in i could do this i raised my eyes to the beam i jumped i extended my hands to catch the beam i missed i fell i reached and barely seized with my palms the brick ledge below the windowsill id been standing on my body hit against the brick and pain lanced up my arms my fingertips burned like fire but i didnt dare cry out i used my feet to muffle the impact and that gave me leverage to strengthen my hold on the brick parkour hardens the hands and the arms and the abdominals but i was too out of serious practice i glanced down the street was mostly empty a woman walked out of the cafe past the bright yellow awning didnt look up i heard the door open nic inside his room whistling i was screwed i heard a clatter on his desk he was probably only a foot away from me he might even see my hands if he looked out the window i heard him speaking rapid dutch to his mom annoyed telling her he didnt have time to chat thank god i risked a pullup and saw through the window that he was walking away from me down the hall but hed left the bedroom door open parkour is about effective movement from place to place efficiency i made my mind a knife i cut the problem into small steps that could be done in one fluid movement i had been hanging on to the windowsill for less than ten seconds i had no time to spare i pulled myself up cleanly i managed to get a foot on the sill and i stood the rest of the way nics mom called to him from her room complaining about him not bringing her breakfast nic told her to piss off and go back to bed until she was sober his voice got louder walking back in the direction of the bedrooms i had to make the jump again i jumped and this time i closed hands around the beam i swung my legs up quickly hearing nics voice berate his mother and her answering bray i heard a shout from the streetid been seen all i could do was to vanish quickly before the police were summoned i moved to the top of the beam and eased myself out of view onto the roof on the roof no one could see me i lay and i stared at the sky and i caught my breath slowly i slithered off nics roof onto the neighboring one i made my way carefully silently staying out of the streets sight it seemed to take forever a little girl in one of the attic apartments watched me goggleeyed as i reached the end of the block a dozen buildings away from nics house she was maybe four brighteyed applecheeked i waved and she waved back then i put a finger to my lips and so did she laughing i pantomimed cranking open the window she did i slipped through the window into her room she stared at me i patted her head and pantomimed silence again she laughed again i slipped out of her room heard bedroom noises that sounded like a mom getting dressed bathroom noises of a shower in moments i was out of the apartment and heading down the stairway you know the dead russian how mila said shed plugged the portable drive into her own computer and was looking at what id stolen from the thief nic my voice felt thick the day of the bombing in london i gave a presentation on a guy who we believed was tied to financing for international crime rings ones that even reach into governments we called him the money czar a guy no one could put a finger on nothing on him he was a blank slate we only had the one picture and mentions of him by a couple of informants who ended up dead this is the guy this is the guy i was hunting that i wanted to catch i thought the scarred man might have been working to protect the money czar instead the scarred man kills him i could hardly breathe my chest felt cut from stone they killed my target who the hell are these people what are they after why did they take my wife mila stared at me this was no ordinary bombing i said this was a hell of a lot more this was a murder i need to go through everything we lifted off nics laptop i have to find a reason for him to bring me into the operation then lets find you one mila said leaning over the computer i dont think i can bring in new people right now nic said on the phone i suspected hed gotten a lockdown order from piet they were in panic mode over the attempt of the turk to infiltrate them or a scarier possibility he figured out someone had been in his computer or his room no one new was going to be trusted the turk had soured my chances but i had no options i had to sell him on me listen nic thats cool but you got to get me some money man because i have some information thats worth real money to you and your boss i doubt that sam but before you got to the grijs gander the turk was talking about moving a valuable shipment for you to the united states i dont think you should trust him mouthing off in a bar you need delicate goods moved i can do it fast and safe and cheap he talked about a smuggling route in the bar nics voice rose slightly he said it all in turkish to his friends and i picked up enough i said i glanced at mila who was listening in he said hed make piet pay if he didnt get his money he said hed phone in an anonymous tip to the cops if piet didnt give him what he wanted i i cant have this talk on the phone the nervousness in his voice increased but it didnt mean anything to me until they started going off about your friend of course if theyd tortured the turk and hed told them a different story from mine i could be in very great danger but such were the risks well i will give you a better and more secure route than that turk and i know to keep my mouth shut i need steady work nic i will have to call you back but no promises look fine you and your friend get fried i dont care good luck to you i hung up mila raised an eyebrow you hooked him hard i didnt answer her sam what dont let emotion trip you up im not emotional do you see emotion i am the embodiment of a poker face right now this money czar if he was working with the scarred man if he was the money man why would the scarred man kill him and why would they kill him this way two bullets in the head and dumped into a canal is far easier i didnt have an answer and that was part of the problem two birds the scarred man made yasmin zaid look like a murderer and hed eliminated the money czarbut why i had assumed the scarred man bombed our office to protect the money czar clearly not the phone rang in my hand i let it ring five times hes pissing himself mila said i let it ring twice more before i answered yes i might be able to get you some work just understand that my boss is extremely cautious right now ill bet he is i thought i like a cautious boss i will meet you at the bar we were at last night and take you to piet no in the open the sunlight where i can see you and your friends coming i know a bar but then mila was shaking her head no i tell you what nic as a show of good faith you pick do you know the pelikaan cafe on the singel mila nodded i said yes meet me there noon all right ill see you at noon nic hung up well mila unclipped her earpiece they bit but they might well grab you force you to talk someplace of their choosing there will be no immediate trust well have to prepare for that eventuality why not have them meet here on our turf because i wish to protect our turf she said you must treat the rode prins as your safe house i know the pelikaan i know what we will do hurry we dont have much time she rose and i touched her arm did you get a hold of bahjat zaid no she said no one seems to know where he is look i think he gave them something from his office in hungary the one that yasmin works at thats what theyre smuggling across europe she bit her lip hes an arms manufacturer mila what the hell is he giving these people hes paying ransoms and theyre never going to give her back to him you and i have our orders sam we rescue yasmin eliminate her kidnappers as witnesses and as a threat do that and you dont need to worry about whatever he gave him do you know be totally honest with me no i dont she said and i believed her i still have to know what they want to get to america first things first yasmin this gang thats the way to find out the truth about your wife sam stay focused her voice got a new steel to it i have some leverage for you with nic most unpleasant what on his computer she opened a file photos photos of youngsters in awful provocative poses boys girls a range of ages a range of poses from coy to hardcore i saw a list of names of emails i looked away hes a child molester perhaps at the least he is a broker of smut it seems that if you want a photo to your specificationsnic can provide it the steel in her voice faded and she cursed under her breath i thought of the odd glance hed given the little girl in the cafe by dam square last night and felt ill okay thats leverage i can force his hand and then mila said you can cut it off howell studied the video feed in the security center at the rotterdam train station there the cameras caught the man hed seen on the port coverage that looked like sam capra the blondhaired pixie in the huge sunglasses walking a few steps in front of him the train theyre boarding he said that was the service to amsterdam august said checking a train itinerary i want every record of a pair of tickets bought together on a credit card they could have paid cash or used a prepaid ticket august said or they could have made a mistake howell said ten minutes later howell had a name en route to amsterdam most people traveling on the service already had their tickets but one pair in car five were charged to a credit card belonging to a woman named fernanda gatil he called the cia office in amsterdam and gave them the name requested a full workup on fernanda gatil told them to put her name out on the wire to the dutch border stations he wanted to know where she worked where she lived every detail of her life he wanted photo enhancement on the images pulled from the train station security cameras he wanted to know who this woman was and why she was traveling with a man he felt reasonably sure was sam capra ten after noon nic the scumbag was late i sat outside the pelikaan on the south side of the canal sipping a halfpint of heineken the sunlight shimmered on the water i wondered for the first time who the turk was that zaid had hired a soldier of fortune an actual smuggler someone like me with his own personal vendetta against the scarred man bahjat zaid was a panicked father who hadnt put his entire trust into mila or her secret employers after i calmed down a bit on the way to this meeting i could not blame him i didnt know if my child was dead or alive either i was getting closer to the truth and to lucy i knew it this was the most important meeting of my life i tried not to sweat i tried not to think too much just play the right note and id be in nic worked his way through the strolling saturday crowds he gave everything and everyone a disdainful glare he did not look happy he sat across from me in the daylight he looked pasty robbed of sleep i wondered if hed figured out hed had an intruder in his room parsing his hideous secrets but probably none of them had slept well last night after learning of the turks attempt to infiltrate them hello i said i absolutely had to keep the contempt from my voice i know what you are im having a very bad day he said the waiter stopped by the table nic ordered a coke the waiter brought it and vanished no one sat near us so this turk compromised your route it was all bluff nic said the turk was a liar was i mean is forgive my english i had to sound like a guy desperate for a job which i was nic listen ive moved plenty of stuff from eastern europe to holland to england and america i know how to get contraband of any sort through if youre worried that the turk has screwed up your planned route let me design an entirely new route for you with new transport be safe nic sipped his soda i waited if theyd depended on the turk to set up transit for their goods to the us they couldnt use whatever hed arranged so they had to be desperate unless theyd already found a solution but the turk had died a few hours ago and maybe i was their best chance of keeping their operation moving forward nic would have been sent to take my measure why are you so desperate for work he asked i like eating and sleeping under a roof and i need a foothold in the netherlands why here a few minor difficulties for me in eastern europe i need to focus on smuggling goods to the west i took a long sip of beer i wouldnt mind a slice of the action of whatever youve got going what is it counterfeit cigs or luxury goods designer drugs all of those were trades worth billionsnearly twenty percent of the world economy these days is in illicit goods you must be in dire straits to be hanging out in seedy bars looking for work to appear actually im just a big karaoke fan and if youd said dire straits there last night i would have sung one of their hits a smile flickered and vanished whats your full name sam peter michael samson nics phone rang he opened it listened carefully he kept a poker face mostlyi saw the slightest tug of a smile at the corner of his mouth he got up from the table walked to another empty one made a second call he listened watching me i raised my glass to my lips whispered behind the camouflage of the halfpint did you get that i said mila answered yes the transmitter was hidden beneath my collar thin as a toothpick hard to detect under my starched shirt hence dressing for the meeting like it was a job interview mila had slipped the transmitter into my clothes the earpiece where i could hear mila speak to me was a risk it would be easier to spot state of the art i wasnt sure the company had field gear this good it made me wonder again exactly who id decided to work for if they have passport records access they could be digging my name up right now the company could have killed the peter samson legend eliminated the ids the passport records and surely there would be a trace put on any queries made against my old discarded names as well as watching for any use of them which might bring the company right down on nic and his friends but that couldnt happen before i got what i needed from them not before i had the scarred man in my grip not before i had got yasmin to safety and knew the truth about lucy and my son i watched nic nic watched me minutes passed long enough for whoever he had working for him to access a canadian passport database they had hacked into the amsterdam police servers why not the canadians as well i had underestimated nic before i said nothing more to mila she was close watching us from an empty office space across the singel canal on the herengracht in the grand company safe house august pushed open the door of howells office howell glanced up from looking at photos that had come through passport control in rotterdam thousands of faces none of them sam capra he felt dizzy sir we just got a query hit on one of sam capras old legends the peter samson identity it just came moments ago from an ip address from an internet cafe in amsterdam looking for passport information military records criminal history where over on singel a few minutes away lets find out whos so interested in sam god he thought maybe it was sam himself checking to see if the old identity was still active that little bastard finally made a mistake any record of the passport being used to enter holland no sir august said do you want me to kill all the documentation tied to the identity no no leave it active lets see where it leads us he and august and van vleck an exmarine permanently assigned to the company office in amsterdam hurried down the steps into the bright spring day we can call the dutch police van vleck said howell raised a hand absolutely not we handle this ourselves he glanced at august this may get ugly if hes there we take him down and you can talk to him later dont hesitate i wont sir august said well catch him nic closed the phone and i lowered the beer glass from my mouth he approached the table he might have been told that peter samson no longer existed he could have taken a picture of me with his phone sent it to piet or even the scarred manin which case i was dead i looked at what was on the table cloth lovely flowers in a small glass vase halfpint glass if he came back to the table knowing i was a fraud i could kill him with the vase shatter the end put it against his throat the glass in the vase was heavier than the beer glass nic slid into the seat across from me he straightened the ponytail and smiled at me you were wanted in croatia last year for smuggling that was sadly true of peter samson he was such a loser thats so last year i guess so the charges were dismissed bribes work i shrugged and a witness decided not to talk what were you moving whatever needed moving illicit explosives from the czech republic old weapons from ukraine opium moving through turkey i shrugged again im not a product specialist i move whatever needs moving to canada and new york and being a mover made you a good fighter the canadian army made me a good fighter i have a friend from prague i asked him about you last night gregor yes he said you could do a good job but he also said that he thought you might have sold out some people who tried to screw you over a pair of brothers the vrana brothers were screwing over the people who brought me into the deal internal politics in a group arent my concern im only about the money sorry if that makes me sound bad it is what it is so your loyalty would be to me are you the one getting me my money then yeah my loyalty is to you he watched me for a minute deciding i might have a job for you then but i need you to do me a favor if you want to land work im not really in the favor business then think of it as an investment my boss piet has become a liability i think he needs to be cut out there it was bluntly nic wanted piet gone probably to take his place to take his cut or to take his power if you can get us a route to america then you and iwe dont really need piet in the picture or in the profit and if i dont want to get into your messy office politics then were done he was using me this was survival of the meanest nic was using piets mistake in trusting the turk to bolt up the food chain but then so could i whats your beef with your boss brains make more money than brute force the hacker didnt like the muscle no doubt youre smarter than your boss there is no doubt piet is a moronic whoreson he waves a sword around if you can believe it a sword do you know how unprofessional that appears the superior tone id heard in his voice last night returned what is it youre shipping theyre not large packages but they must be well hidden extremely valuable and not easily replaced not an answer what is it that you need not know it is not toxic or poisonous or dangerous i didnt believe him but i didnt press it not now i had a new card to play basically nic wanted me to tattle on piet make him look bad hope that the scarred man would cut piet down even loose networks are brimming with egos and ambitions this might be the fastest road to the scarred man you want this job youll help me nic pressed and i design you a perfect route to smuggle your goodies with documentation and containers and a wellgreased captain and the right bribes and you take my route and you shut me out no we must trust each other a little sam im proposing you and i work together this job all the other jobs that come im in demand right now and i need a partner whos not an idiot and is reliable i dont want to have a boss who thinks hes a ninja i put an edge of nervousness into my voice look im going to put my ass on the line here i dont know you people ive got resources to smuggle whatever you need smuggled but i need appropriate guarantees i sounded like a man who was talking too much and thats what i wanted nic to think i wanted a scent of desperation to close the deal but to close it with someone with power if you cant give them to me i need to talk to someone who can i cant take you to piets boss doesnt work that way compartmentalize keep each node of the network safe that was clearly their operating standard here it was smart then were done bluff time i stood he needed me i knew that i was his chance for a power grab there is a great deal at stake nic said the only great deal i care about is a great deal of money you will get a cut and a bonus for helping me oust piet cant i get a job without bloodshed not these days he lowered his voice look we need our goods moved from rotterdam to new york i dont know where the goods are right now except theyre on their way to holland from hungary piet knows all right you can talk with him and see if youre willing to take this on both the smuggling job and helping me get him out of the game that was as much as i could hope for now all right lets go and then i saw howell hurrying down the north side of the singel canal heading in our direction behind him walked august i kept my smile in place it meant wed made a mistake but mila had left a trail for us to follow if that happened then i saw howell and august and another man clearly a company agent turn hard into the doorway of an internet cafe a neon coffee cup steamed in the window same building where mila was watching from the top floor choice help mila or go with nic i wanted to help her but i couldnt walk away from nic that way led to lucy and my son i followed him wondering how howell had found us from the id check nic had done maybe if his associate who searched for the peter samson name had hit an electronic tripwire nic walked directly beside me hand across my shoulders i couldnt look behind me couldnt see mila i had to think of a way to warn her trouble is coming i said what do you mean nic jerked a glance behind us you playing your boss he wont be my boss for long i had a boss once a guy named howell i said in a conversational way a total ass and i feel hes always behind me then you should have dealt with him the way im going to deal with piet i couldnt say more i had to trust that mila had deciphered my warning i had to go with nic and i knew hed search me the earpiece was a liability he would find it the moment nic pulled up ahead of me i tore the tiny earpiece from my ear and dropped it on the street i left the transmitter in place i wanted mila to hear every precious word mila hurried from the empty office space and ran down the narrow staircase howell was close if he interfered in the sting all was lost the top three floors were offices the ground floor housed a small internet cafe popular with students and collegeage tourists she reached the bottom foyer to her right was cafe sprong right now the internet cafe held a halfdozen surprised kids hands lifted off their keyboards three men in suits stood inside two holding guns an older manshe recognized him from the company files as howellwas saying just everyone stay calm were working with the dutch police he was hurrying from laptop to laptop clicking on the keyboards searching theyd found her and sam the one closest to the door grabbed at her arm he was a big man blond scandinavianlooking with appleflorid cheeks mila fought down the overwhelming urge to throw him through the neoncoffeecup window excuse me she said in a low hard growl he didnt raise the gun but he pulled her inside this is police business do not be alarmed we are seeking a criminal were you accessing the cafes internet connection he said to her in slightly mangled dutch she shrugged like she didnt understand is this a joke she said in english braving a smile or a movie do you have a laptop or a smartphone he asked in english were you on the web no she only had a small purse the wireless kit shed used to talk with sam was taped to the small of her back under her suit jacket her gun lay strapped to her ankle he looked inside her purse found her smartphone he tapped her browser she waited the big man put the phone back in her purse thank you police business please dont try to leave so she didnt but if they were looking for hershouldnt they have just rushed to the roof perhaps not maybe they knew she was here but not who she was she stayed put but every muscle was singing howell didnt have a weapon out she decided how she would fight the order in which she would kill them the big blond and then the darkhaired man then howell the decision put her mind at rest and she watched howell like everyone else the barista argued in polishaccented dutch with the armed men that they couldnt just come in here and do this and the men ignored him howell stepped away from a frightened girl to a back table where a young chinese student sat the boys hands quivered above the keys and mila thought he looks quite guilty she watched howell turn the laptop away from the chinese boy study it tap on the keys mila could see a terminal window appear on the screen a spill of data white letters on a black screen howell closed the laptop gestured with one hand toward the gunmen the big blond hurried forward frisked the boy roughly nodded an allclear outside said howell in english youre not cops the barista shouted too much caffeinated courage mila thought howell glanced at mila as he walked past she knew she should drop her stare everyone else cowed by the guns had she couldnt she just couldnt she didnt glare she just looked at him he met her stare for a moment if she had known theyd seen her on a security tape feed from the port dressed in leather and wearing giant sunglasses she would have killed them all where they stood but howell intent on his prize didnt linger on her face he followed the man and the chinese boy outside without a backward glance the other manthicknecked with dark hairlowered his gun and said in perfect dutch our apologies you may return to your work that man has been conducting serious cybercrime attacks using the cafes server we apologize for frightening you all but we didnt want him erasing his data before we could stop him the barista started to argue again saying we didnt know you cant just come in here like that waving guns you could have shot us the thicknecked man kept a broad smile in place our apologies again he turned and hurried out as the cafe broke into rapidfire talk the barista yelling at the mans back reaching for the phone vowing to call the police mila stepped out after the muscle he broke into a full run hurrying after howell and the blond he caught up howell carried the boys laptop mila looked across the canal toward the cafe where sam sat with nic gone both men gone choice follow the company thugs or try to find sam the chinese boy might be a link back to the scarred mans group and she wanted to see what the company people did she followed howell and the others keeping back a discreet distance she dug her earpiece from her purse slipped it back into place and hurried toward her car nic put me in the back of a van he held up a blindfold you asked me to trust you i said that works both ways it does but im not going to let you see where were going you dont need to know everything within our group is needtoknow you get to that point youll be told it wasnt a bad thing for him to believe he had full control of the situation so i allowed him to put the blindfold on me he said im going to search you and he did thoroughly from hairline to throat to belly and below down to my heels he was thorough but he missed the transmitter under my collar id made the choice to keep it alive and broadcasting despite knowing that if he found it he would kill me immediately i didnt fight the search i told him once it tickled and he ignored me i heard him go back up to the front of the van crank the engine and with a sway we pulled back out into traffic wherere we going am i going to see piet yes i wanted to ask and his bosses the scarred man and yasmin might be there the scarred man would recognize me i had to assume if hed taken lucy he knew my face i didnt want to end up tied to a chair like the turk but i had to take the risk the van drove for a long while i figured given the number of short sharp turns that we werent heading out of amsterdam but rather that nic was trying to shake off any possible tail or confuse me i wondered if mila was sticking close to me i could only hope she had dodged howell and august otherwise i was alone how on earth had he found us it had to be the hit on my peter samson id from nics computer guy he must have been working in the internet cafe perhaps masking his work behind its server but howell and august were in amsterdam hunting me no doubt and theyd cornered nics hacker which meant howell might be hot on the trail of nics people and in that case hed ruin my chance to find my family there is a time on every job where you say screw caution im not foolhardy im not stupid but sometimes you have to be the battering ram howell was getting way too close so my time to find the scarred man was running short i want to tell you how to handle this nic said piet will be there and so will another man you dont need to know his name i realized i was holding my breath okay let the other man please be the scarred man please you will tell them exactly how to set up an alternate route and in return i get money and work yes but i want you to make piet look bad you tell piets boss that you know of piet through smuggling in moldovathat youve worked the same routes that piet sold girls that he moved along the way and pocketed the money before delivery he cheated his clients my guts twisted piet is a human trafficker piet is mostly a mover of commodities i could practically hear the shrug in nics voice women from moldova shipped to britain and germany and israel for the whorehouses babies sold to adoptive parents in italy brought in from macedonia and albania massproduced counterfeit goods brought in from china to western europe it doesnt much matter he moves what needs moving a sick tickle feathered the back of my throat as the van stopped i could smell a tang of fuel of exhaust and in the distance i could hear the purr of freeway traffic were here sam showtime nic said do good and ill do good by you the fourth blow to the face produced their desired result it was howells experience that hired computer hackers were easily broken their loyalty was earned only with money and access to technology the chinese boywho according to his id was a graduate student in computer science at the delft university of technologymade it through two black eyes a torn lip and a badly cuffed ear before he screamed out an address it was a warehouse off the a highway which ringed amsterdam van vleck stepped back from beating the hacker and august checked the address with his smartphone and who will we find there howell asked nic nic whos nic guy who hired me the boy broke into a babble of mandarin calling howell a worthless stump of a penis and howell slapped him and told him in mandarin that his mother was a disgusting whore and to not talk to him that way the students mouth twisted in shock and pain and nic hired you why we have a back door into a passportmonitoring exchange used by north american and european governments and you were checking peter samsons passport and records yes to see if he was for real who does nic work for he does work for hire for samson no nic wanted to be sure samson was who he said he was he was hiring samson for what kind of job howells voice sharpened he leaned close to the battered face and he could smell the milk and stale coffee on the students breath under the coppery blood from his ear and his nose the chinese student started to cry i dont know any more i swear i was just supposed to verify his story as he told it to nic that he was a canadian named samson august gestured at howell and they stepped out of the van where the hacker couldnt hear them if sams risking using a legend hes trying to get close to this guy nic august said so maybe he has a lead on whoever took lucy well know soon enough lets go see whos at this address shouldnt we wait for recon sam capra is close august howell said no way in hell were waiting thats not standard protocol neither is letting his friend be part of the search team howell said you coming or staying holdwine august got back into the van he did not notice the small blue car at a distance behind them nic kept me blindfolded until i was inside when he shut the door it made a steely echo he pulled off the blindfold and i could see that it was an old machinists shop the equipment to reshape and refine steel into tools remained in place near the entrance the shop was crammed with boxes and pallets along two walls i could smell the tang of curry and the yeasty aroma of spilled beer a metal table scattered with papers stood in the center of the room windows smeared with dust let in a slant of brownish light two mentwinsstood on either side of me one was armed with a glock the other with an assault rifle both had dead eyes one was shaved bald the other had scant reddish hair smiles with cruel mouths these are the twins nic said as if i hadnt noticed they shared the same scowling face the twins searched me for weapons and wire they found nothing they too missed the little transmitter in my shirt collar i looked to see if any of these guys sported the same novem soles tattoo as the killer in my apartment no no sign of it so maybe nic and the twins were just hirelings sitting at the table was the dyedblond man id seen on the videos piet the trafficker he was taller than me sixsix wide shoulders narrow hips the curve of powerful arms under his sleeves he looked like a guy whod fight with gusto his nose had been broken in the past and he had eyes like two dots of oil cold and unyielding under the iced eyes and the twisted hook of nose he wore a smile twisted with malice i had a sense that smile had been the last thing seen by many people he was the kind of guy i guessed who thought cruelty was funny and yes he had a little sword a wakizashi it sat on the desk and gleamed in the faint light there was no sign of the scarred man i smiled back at piet i understand you can help us mr samson he said in english im sure i can he got up and walked around me i doubt i looked forbidding old jeans worn shoes an old gray jacket mila had bought my clothes secondhand clipped out all the labels i looked like i was neatly dressed but desperate i met his gaze but then i let my eyes drop let him think he was the alpha so i have fifty parcels i need to get inside the united states they cannot be discovered they cannot be seized i need them there in ten days they must arrive together they must not be separated during shipping at the same time i want the most secure cover for them imaginable how would you do this how big are the parcels less than a meter across a meter long there were fifty of them okay and heavy no five kilos then id probably disguise them as leaded crystal glassware from poland mark it as fragile but it explains the weight you could also do frozen fish i shrugged if the goods can be packed in ice without harm then its a good call this was standard smuggling tradecraft or electronics from finland they ship tons of cell phones and related equipment if its electronic goods then that would simplify the camouflage in case its xrayed or an easy route is counterfeit cigarettes fake british or french or turkish brands one out of three cigarettes smoked in canada today is counterfeit its big business i want you to make sure its not xrayed i have a contact in rotterdam who could make sure the containers not singled out i was lying but it didnt matter and what about dealing with american customs i have a friend on the customs staff in new york he has three children currently in college and grad school so he has large bills hes rather open to not inspecting whatever i say and where would you get the appropriate export documentation and the packaging and the manifests from a legitimate manufacturer piet asked well before i give away all my trade secrets id like my money first i said piet stared at me why did you come to amsterdam i came for the waters i said ha piet said one of my favorite movies casablanca i used a line from bogarts character the bar owner rick blaine when he is asked to explain his presence in the intriguefilled city i smiled i needed a change you were based where prague and croatia i stayed there after i got out of the army i liked the country i looked at nic then back at the smile whats in the fifty packages you dont need to know wheres edward nic asked suddenly after all my performance was supposed to convince piets boss that piet was untrustworthy more trouble than asset and piet appeared to be alone there was no one to convince edward edward was the scarred man edward i let the name roll around in my brain edward the man with the question mark close to his eye whod taken my wife edward isnt here piet said left it up to me to take the measure of this man this man ended up in a bar fight last night defending your good name i said and i dont even know you yeah interesting that thanks for the good turn not really used to altruism i was looking for you i said you and the turk both he said popularity is a curse i said but i wasnt really looking for you until the turk started threatening you that was an opportunity for me and i took it but i hope you dont have more loudmouths around here piet glanced at nic then back at me id like to hear what you heard the turkish gentleman say last night the turk was talking to one of his friends at the bar before nic here showed up you speak turkish enough i used to run goods down to istanbul excess russian ordnance bound for africa mostly the turk said he had arranged to smuggle something to america for you and that he was going to get you to give up some woman you have in exchange for the smuggling going smoothly i watched his face as i laid down the trump nic wasnt so good an actor he jerked his head toward me at this unexpected twist some woman piet repeated yes he was going to guarantee that whatever you were smuggling wasnt harmed wasnt captured by the cops if he got some woman whos with you yasmin i shrugged i may not have the name right he didnt blink but his hand curled into a fist unfolded fingers close to the wakizashi sword like its weight called to him then he made his hand a fist again and that was all yes and on that basis you fight for the honor of my name he laughed no i thought you might not want him screwing up your deal i need a job i didnt realize until later that what i heard might be valuable to me i shrugged you cant use his route to america now but you could use mine im guessing if youre using the turk its because you dont have a regular route into america but we dont know you you want my creds ask petrova in kiev about me ask djuki in athens about me i threw out the name of two traffickers petrova is dead piet said i hadnt heard last month she was shot by a rival oh too late to send flowers i guess now piet flicked a smile like he was tossing a card to me sure my hand would crash djuki went missing a few months ago hes probably hiding the fact i knew their names was not cred enough i didnt expect it to be or hes in china running gucci and ralph lauren counterfeiting action and if i could reach him id hire him over you him at least i know you could just be cleaning up the mess left behind piet said you could work for the same people as the turk thats a theory what did you work on with djuki girls from moldova and ukraine shipped to israel and to edinburgh and toronto i moved guns from albania and uzbekistan to mexico i shipped in fake cigs and fake windows software from china to canada and the us mostly houston and new york he raised an eyebrow you moved girls with djuki yeah twice you find him in china you can ask him about me i shrugged djuki wasnt hiding he was dead he was a greek trafficker whod been turned by the company spilled information on his routes and methodologies for a hefty sum and immunity and then been killed when he tried to vanish after the company put him back out in the field to serve as an informant djuki was scum id met him once or twice and the company had entrusted me to put out the word hed gone to china to work deals on that side wheres his scar piet asked and my mind went blank i didnt blink there are so many to choose from the most embarrassing one i swallowed trying to picture the photos in the smugglers thick file not on the face not on his chest then i smiled as i remembered brandon my boss back in london cracking a joke across his ass i said his girlfriend gave it to him with a kitchen knife she should have had your wakizashi he smiled at my using the japanese term and why did he get it he was screwing around with girls he was shipping to israel and dubai i said breaking them in for the customers i couldnt let the disgust show on my face most of the girls trafficked were from the former soviet republics desperate for work theyd been promised waitressing or secretarial jobs they were going to be broken with rape and heroin before they met their new pimps girlfriend didnt approve he was lucky she cut his backside and not his front and how did you see the scar id seen it in his file of course i hoped djukis explanation as to the scars origin was accurate if it wasnt i was dead piet would kill me on the spot if i couldnt kill him first he kept up his practice of breaking in the girls when needed i saw it then piet gave me the slightest of nods i was inside the circle at least for now my creds proven by knowledge of a rapists ass scar make your calls he said to me the goods will be here in two days you will arrange a pickup of them when they arrive repackage them for shipment to america and then get them past customs and onto the ship in rotterdam youll be paid fifty thousand in euros if you need help forging documents my boss edward is an expert forger repackaging the shipment oh yes that would be it the key i would need help i would need the whole gang together to help me and thats when i could take them down rescue yasmin and find out the truth from the scarred man the opportunity dangled before me bright as a diamond i hid my sudden relief by holding up hands wait a minute youve cut the turk loose right im not coming aboard if hes about to bring the law down on you hes not a worry for anyone anymore this was one of the twins speaking the bald one oh i said piet said the turk is a former mit agent mit was milli stihbarat te kilatturkeys cia he got run out of the agency for malfeasance he bribed a group of turks here to let him work with them to get close to me i wont ever work with those guys again he tried to screw me over he failed he leveled a stare the twins are very good about finding out what we need to know about people the turk was like me then bahjat zaid had found a fellow reject to try and save his daughter well i dont fail when i take on a job piet glanced at the twins and then at me and said you want to break in a girl samson what he jerked his head toward a door i got eight girls heading to nigeria and israel two still giving me a bit of lip even with the horse in their veins to settle them down but nothing settles them like getting broke in a second test if i was experienced as a human trafficker i shouldnt blink much at raping the merchandise go choose one you like give her a ride piet said you said we could have a turn the bald twin protested why does he get first pick i thought how pleasant it would be to kill piet i had not killed but once before and it was not an experience that i had liked no human being would but with piet i wouldnt blink at it at all it would be a service to humanity part of my heart the part that thought i might be a husband and father again as soon as i found lucy and the baby said dont be so ready to kill but this guy if edward had taken lucy had this monster been near her had piet touched my wife it took a total gripping down inside my heart to say do you move a lot of women my best revenue stream from moldova mostly doing more from russia and the baltics as the economy worsens about thirty a month usually special requests cant keep up the demand for the young ones come see i glanced at nic who trafficked in pictures of kids filling specific demands welcome to the personalized world of human suffering i followed piet down a short hallway to a side office the twins and nic followed me i smelled rotten fruit burned steak and a chemical stench with sweat an uneasy undercurrent he opened the door into a dimly lit room a side parlor to hell in the flickering gloom i could see eight women along the wall manacles cupped their ankles and their wrists the chains threaded back to the concrete on the floor the women sat huddled they wore their tops stillstained torn but their skirts and jeans and underwear were gone robbing them of dignity i saw bruises and tears and emptiness in faces that had endured too much horror i felt a hot red rage glow in my brain but if i killed piet and nic now to free these women i ruined any chance of getting close to edward to finding lucy and the baby but i could not permit this rewrite the scenario i told myself let mila know what horror lay inside this room youre trafficking in women i said piet scowled at me as i stated the obvious i hoped mila was still in range that she was listening once we left the machinists shop mila could rescue these women but that would put me in danger being the new guy if this operation got compromised i would be compromised they would kill me on the spot impossible choice i needed an option fast i needed a scapegoat which one you want the redhead six awful little words the redhead looked to be seventeen and i could see her lip quivering in horror in fear just dont hit the faces or the tits you got to whip one do it on the back of her legs no one ever looks at the back of their legs one of the twins said no i said no thank you whats wrong with you theyre like ripe fruit pluck one piet laughed well both take one seal our friendship and we wont get cut on our asses like stupid djuki will we he laughed and i saw the women shudder i tried not to think about what hed already done to them what hed do to them if i left them in his grip he prodded the closest one with the tip of the wakizashi and she burst into shuddering tears i looked at piets neck and thought about how i would break it nic had followed us watching me seeing me dipped in this inhuman litmus test im a businessman i said i dont stoop to sampling the goods thats for the muscle eh piet didnt like that id implied he was not a boss that he was muscle i could see rage rising in his stare he stepped back from the terrified woman and the edge of the sword glittered in the faint light from the hallway are you serious i said is this going to be how you test me whether im willing to break a girl piets mouth worked one of the young womenthe redheadlooked up at me id spoken english and who knew if she understood dont talk to him this way nic said what the hell is wrong with you tension tight as wire strained his voice i stared at him at this point i was only just inside the circle but only just in wasnt good enough i needed to be all the way in i glanced at nic rock meet hard place if i played nics game of betrayal piet might never let me near edward if i didntnic was unpredictable i didnt need nic i needed piet i gave nic a last smile he was a traitor to his friends and he was a scumbag who used children i didnt mind paving my road with his bones i want in i said to piet but on my terms then i turned and launched a hammering kick into nics face he crumpled i didnt want him talking so i slammed a second kick precise into his throat not hard enough to kill but enough to keep him nice and quiet piet had a gun out leveled at me before my foot was down it was good to know he had more than that stupid forshow sword the women screamed and retreated against the wall i raised my hands hes your problem not me i pointed at the sprawled nic with a tip of my toe nic made gaspy breathy noises eyes blinking in shock hes setting you up he wants to take over your operation outside piet gestured with the gun screamed at the women to be quiet they fell into a snuffle of tears and whispers he gestured toward nic i pulled nic to his feet shoved him staggering out into the hallway and back to the main room i pushed him as the twins hurried out and piet shut and locked the door five seconds i was alone with nic but that was all i needed as the twins and piet rushed up behind us what the hell is your problem piet said hes busting on you i said selling you out check him nic moaned through his ruined lip and broken teeth he started to sit up consciousness rousing and piet pushed him back down to the floor with the barrel of the gun he wanted me to lie about you to edward say that you had been stealing girls from shipments for another client reselling them i kept my voice steady looking at nic as his eyes widened in horror because you know i was telling the truth its always easier to tell the truth than to lie he wanted you out and himself in as lead trafficker he figured theres more in live women than in photos of little kids hes working for someone else who wants your business and betraying you is the cut piet kept the gun glued on nic who stayed still and bubbled blood from his mouth where my heel had smashed lip and teeth he ran a hand along nics pockets under the jacket at first i thought piet had missed it he stood not even aiming his gun at nic anymore then i saw the thin little tube in piets hand pinched between thumb and forefinger he held it up to nics face nic blinked what is this piet asked in a whisper that sounded like dirt sliding off a coffins top i dont know its not mine nic mumbled hes a goddamned liar piet who are you going to believe him or me you know me yes yes i do know you nic piet inspected milas little transmitter he tried to cut it apart with his thumb failed he opened a knife from his pocket and sliced into the microphone and unpeeled it apart carefully id had seconds to slip it into nics pocket giving up the transmitter would be cutting my only link with mila assuming she hadnt been grabbed by howell and his men but i had to do it it was my way to save piets victims and to put all the blame on nic when mila rescued them my heart beat out a hard skittering rhythm in my chest i watched piets face as he inspected the stateoftheart device god damn it he said this is like freaking spy gear who are you working for nic no one i work for you hes lying you dont know him you know me yeah and youve had the hate for me for weeks piet said you think im blind you always had your goddamn precious nose up in the air around me who do you work for stand up nic stood the light in his eyes shifted darkened in rage the anger of the trapped animal i dont work for anyone but you and edward hes tricked me hes tricked you he planted that on me i shook my head but piet raised the gun from nic to me i guess i have a choice to make piet said call in reinforcements august asked howell they sat in the van half a block from the address provided by the chinese student it was a gray block of industrial space multiple buildings but the complex looked mostly deserted two vehicles parked in front of one door at the end the rest of the parking lot space was empty youre rather timid howell said surprises me one mans caution august said i dont want my friend dead when hes more valuable to us alive i like the idea of moving now no witnesses around van vleck said i want this kept quiet i dont want to attract the attention of the dutch authorities what do we have in the van howell asked four assault rifles bulletproof vests infrared goggles august looked at him with a scowl theres only the three of us i can count agent holdwine i think respectfully we should call in backup august glanced at van vleck capra is trained we dont know about the other guy we should go in with overwhelming force two vehicles here one van that brought capra and his contact the other cars small theres not an army inside howell smiled lets go gentleman i am tired of sam capra being a problem for us van vleck and august started putting on the bulletproof gear get that young man to his feet howell said gesturing at the chinese hacker well use him mila parked her car a few blocks away from the warehouse at a small cafe she pressed her earpiece and closed her eyes for a moment she heard most of the conversation between piet and sam the offer to sam of one of the captives to rape her breathing grew very calm a hot hollow rage expanded in her chest she wore a black trench coat over her suitshe had a gun for each pocket and now she also carried a retractable baton it was her favorite weapon and she imagined beating piet and nic senseless with it she hurried toward the machinists shop on foot she heard sams advice to search nic and the discovery of the microphone and knew what sam had done she applauded him but he was cutting her loose severing the one tie between them so as to delve closer to these monsters but if howell blundered in now he would ruin their chance to break inside the ring mila watched the van crouching from behind a corner a block away she saw the back of the van open the chinese student theyd grabbed lurched out hands bound she could see the kids face was battered and bruised a wet smear of blood below his nostrils then the two thicknecked men then howell all armed the three men stopped at the door she could see the chinese boy shake his head theyd stopped at an access keypad by the door the chinese boy hands shaking entered a code the four men entered mila hurried toward the van they were going in full throttle so they were more worried about their front than their back she slid under the van and began to count watching the door her timing would have to be impeccable if sam was to survive him or me i asked nic looked too shocked to speak or both piet said i dont need trouble but you still need help i said or you wouldnt even have bothered to talk to me nic thinks youre a joke he ever make fun of your sword the corner of piets mouth jerked sometime in those months nics disdain had been noted and filed everything you said is correct piet said here fine and he handed me the gun kill him final test if i was a cop or a plant i wasnt going to gun down an unarmed man this was the line that no one with a shred of decency left would cross what decency did i have left i raised the gun my head crowded with lucy and the baby this man had helped kidnap and assault women shipping them into slavery he was smuggling weapons he was hacking into government databases and stealing information he was trading in photos of assaulted and abused children and i was whata courtroom on two legs i guess i was him or me and with me my family i fired the bullet caught nic in the chest and he fell back bad shot it didnt kill him outright sorry nic he looked at me with a wrenching stare of agony and hate and i fired again and his face didnt matter anymore i wouldnt see it again except maybe in my dreams i pulled my shirt loose wiped my prints off the glock and handed the gun back to piet my hand didnt shake and for one moment the past five seconds seemed like a life that happened to another man well piet said into the silence he stared down at nics body well i said well well well who was i now lets get to work he gestured at the goods i like your ideas but ive already got a load of goods to use as camouflage you reinforced my opinion as to what would work best nothing like brownie points from the trafficker i inspected the boxes counterfeit cigarettes youre going to ship your superduper topsecret stuff inside illicit cigarettes that you then sell in the united states and double your profit two birds one stone i maximize my efforts piet was much smarter than he looked he gestured at the boxes about a million euros worth i pointed at the shredded destroyed microphone you better hope there wasnt a tracker in there whoever he worked for will be coming when contact gets cut which is why were going to move everything right now the women the cigs he turned to the twins and started issuing hard orders in rapidfire dutch how could i get the women to safety without blowing my cover right now i couldnt the thought hurt i heard a soft ping a door opening i couldnt see the front door from here the boxes and boxes of illicit cigarettes made a labyrinth between here and the front door i was counting on the arrival being mila which meant i wanted piet heading out the back with me abandoning the captives and his goods are you expecting anyone no he whispered we leaned against the wall stacks of boxes barred part of our view he gestured at the twins who took up positions ahead of us closer to the door i saw a figure step into view not mila a thin young asian man walking in wearing an illfitting jacket and loose jeans he had thick black hair cut in a bad slash tufts stuck up like little exclamation points he works for nic piet said hacker for some reason he retreated back toward the table the asian kid stumbled forward into the dim light and i saw hed been beaten really worked over one of the twinsthe bald onesaid hey what are you doing here the answer was a bullet that sang out and caught the bald twin in the throat he sagged to the floor his brother bellowed a shocked scream and started blasting the boxes with his assault rifle puffs of brown powder danced in the air the fragments of cigarettes tobacco exploding into miniature clouds by the impact of the bullets ripping through the boxes and someone from cover near the front shot out some of the lights i saw the asian kid scream and run and then he caught a bullet and sprawled to the floor chaos near darkness i couldnt let them shoot backthis could be mila piet ran around one corner of the stacked boxes and i followed him ping another light shattered one light left directly over the metal table i saw a figure standing near us laying a round down toward the remaining twin a darkhaired man piet fired before i could react and the man toppled screaming in english both he and piet raised to fire and i yanked piet back out of the line of fire i needed him alive for now god damn it what the hell piet coughed these have to be cops i said who else would give nic a wire like that we need to get the hell out we ran and an explosion of bullets tore through the cardboard maze i heard a clang metal landing on concrete and then a blast tore open the biggest stack of the cigarette boxes flame erupted from the flying debris the hot sweet scent of tobacco crowded the air the thrum of the blast nearly deafened me i turned as piet fired back and i saw him drawing aim on a man through the tendrils of smoke august the company was here i grabbed piets arm spoiling his shot the bullet pinged to augusts left and he ducked behind an unused machinists lathe he hadnt seen me what the just run come on i shoved piet toward the exit i ran back toward the attackers vaulted over the lathe and hammered both feet into the side of augusts head as he risked standing up he sprawled i didnt think he had seen me yet i had to keep it that way without killing him i grabbed his gun the remaining twin ran toward me expecting me to put a bullet in augusts head instead i raised the gun id just taken off august and fired right between the twins eyes he had about a second to look surprised before he collapsed i ran like hell if howell took me back into custody now i was done i would spend the rest of my life in a prison i couldnt prove that i worked for milas secret dogooders that i was trying to infiltrate a criminals inner circle i would just be a bitter exemployee keeping company with a slaver i would vanish back into howells prison sealed in stone or be dead and buried unmarked unmourned everyone who thought i was a traitor was going to think they were right i heard a roar from the lathe howells voice yelling i ran past nics body piet reappeared gun in hand and laid down fire behind me driving howell back into cover i could see howell returning fire and thenin a moment when piet paused to reloadfire coming from the front door someone was shooting at howell from the other side he turned returning fire on the other side of the steel door i heard the captive women screaming and sobbing i grabbed at piet come on no im not leaving these bitches here theyre not worth your freedom theyre not worth losing the big job i could see on his face he hated to give upbut he listened we ran down a hallway and hurtled out into the clouded light of the gray day a volvo van was parked in the rear piet held out an electronic key the vans lights blinked it made the ohsowelcome click of locks opening we jumped inside piet jabbed the keys in the ignition and slammed into reverse we roared backward straight piet not taking the time to spin out and turn yet howell came through the back door when we were about thirty feet away he saw me and a scowl swept across his face he had been wrong to give me a moments trust i was a traitor a criminal the evidence was running away before his eyes piet jerked the wheel and we hurled around the edge of a building gunning out of their sight theyll throw up roadblocks i yelled he just spun the wheel around and floored the van we exploded out of the industrial park revving onto the service road dodging around several slowermoving cars got to get enough distance then find new wheels he said we can carjack someone theres a school nearby a mother wont fight us but shell see our faces you still have a bullet lets do this the easy way i can hotwire anything takes too long he slammed a frustrated hand against the wheel i hate losing those whores i was free from agonizing about the captive women howell would make sure they were safe now i just had to keep piet from killing someone else so we could catch a ride those werent cops i said theyd already have blocked out the industrial park they didnt so who the hell was nic working for piet didnt answer for a minute so i did rivals rivals piet said you mean other traffickers or maybe whoever the turk was working for i said i wondered if piet would now mention bahjat zaids name well we are going to take care of that problem i loved that we although he was horrifying company fine for him to think we were a team easier for me to slide the knife past the ribs when the most happy time came i fought down the thought enjoying killing people that was a downward slide in which i had no interest he pulled into another sprawling industrial park that wore a concrete gray anonymity he wore a mulish frown on his face he seemed almost eager to find a victim to vent his rage he spotted a young man carrying a box walking toward a mercedes parked at a remove from the others him well take his i dont want you to kill someone over a car piet every small crime we have to do is a crack in the chances of pulling off the bigger job dont talk to me like i havent worked before he said annoyance in his tone im not but you kill only when absolutely necessary that was true this isnt necessary yet his face reddened he did not like being lectured ill take care of the car without killing the guy you stay here keep your face out of sight i dont want him to see you hell see you if he does you kill him he wont see me i slipped out of the van as piet kept driving slamming the door running the guy bespectacled thin started to turn toward me and i hit him a single precise blow at the base of the neck he crumpled and i caught him i pulled him out of sight gently set him down in front of a cluster of other parked cars where a narrow strip of anemic grass lay facing the concrete wall of the office park his breathing was regular he had mercedes keys in his pocket and i fished them free piet was already out of the van and running toward me i ran to the mercedes unlocked it and slid behind the wheel that was extremely smooth he said but his tone of voice wasnt admiring where did you learn to do that canadian special forces he said nothing more i peeled out of the industrial park where to i asked im not sure i trust you sam he said and he tightened the grip on the assault rifle he held mila ran shed fired four rounds into the machinists shop with calculation she wanted to confuse to unsettle shed winged the blond in the arm and had forced howell and his men to concentrate on her for a full minute which hopefully had given sam time to flee then shed retreated running across the parking lane and around a corner a closed sign gesloten hung in an office and shed worked the lock with a kit in her pocket ducking inside before she could be spotted she slammed the door closed and hurried to the curtained office window to watch five minutes later howell and his two men emerged no sign of the chinese hacker the big blond clutched his arm his jacket sodden with blood the other man stumbled hit in the leg both men looked more pissed than hurt howells face wore blind rage the van pulled away so howell was not treating a crime scene like a crime scene maybe he would call the dutch police but then there would have to be explanations as to how company personnel had arrived at the warehouse and engaged in a gun battle and although the industrial park looked neglected and empty someone nearby might have heard the shots and summoned the police ten seconds after the van roared off she made her decision howell wasnt waiting for the police but that didnt mean he wasnt calling them and they might arrive within minutes she had very little time to scope out the building mila slipped back inside the old machinists shop the smell was of closein gunfire acrid the sweet smell of tobacco she saw a spill of blood drops heavy near one of the lathes the chinese student had taken a bullet in the head she glanced down at him didnt see breathing the id on him was still in place and she took that anything that could delay the police investigation was to her advantage she checked an abandoned office empty she hurried through the entire office space tense her breath tight expecting to see sams dead body but there was no sign of him then she headed down a short hallway and found a shuttered steel door here they had to be here mila picked the lock with care as quietly as she could the mechanism eased and her hand went back to her gun she took a deep calming breath leveled the weapon and kicked in the door screams greeted her eight women halfnaked bruised chained to the wall for a moment she faltered a pain as sharp as a steel blade went through her chest made her spine ache she stared at the women and they stared back at her then a surge of indignant strength rose in her bones revenge was its marrow had howell not realized these women were here or did he not care or was he calling the police anonymously to report their presence it didnt matter she could not would not leave them most of them kept their gaze low to the ground but one a redheaded teenager glanced up at her mila tried english its okay its all right youre safe now the redhaired girl spoke to her in moldovan who are you mila switched to moldovan the words tasted like a sweet shed loved as a child youll be safe im getting you out of here the bad men have gone who are you the redhead asked again a friend i want you to do exactly what i say because we may not have much time im going to get you to safety and then home we have no money to get home one of the other women said her lips were purple with bruising i know mila said i will take care of you all she stepped back out in the hallway knelt by nics body in his pocket she found a set of manacle keys in his palm she saw sams transmitter stripped apart she scooped it up from the dead man and tucked it in her pocket her hands shook as she unlocked the women from their restraints her head flooded with forgotten sensations the low rumble of the traffic on the boulevard the odor of cheap pizza the warmth of a gun in her hand the breeze through the open windows of the warm israeli night as she walked through the rooms of the damned the man that shed left alive roaring that shed be killed a thousand times one day for what shed done she shoved the memories down a couple of the women started to moan and cry in moldovan hardly believing that their horrific ordeal might be over she was thinking they need shelter doctors documents she was not thinking about sam capra for the moment he was on his own i watched the gun pointed in my direction i just saved your life if i wanted you dead i could have shot you in the back when we were running to the van but i dont know you and you walk in and everything goes to hell everything went to hell because of nic turning against you i gave him to you and everything that happened since then confirms he was trying to screw you over but i dont know you logic wasnt his strong point ive lost everybody everybody he was scared listen piet i have a few friends in amsterdam maybe you know them gregor he used to run a watch shop in prague hes living here now he was a friend of nics we did a bit of business last year ask him about me i was gambling huge here that gregor would play along welcome to the tightrope i know gregor the watch geek who else give me another name one is not enough the only other person i knew was henrik the softspoken bartender at the rode prins and id only talked with him once or twice butif he was smart he could cover me i had no idea if he knew what kind of work mila and i did and by giving piet the rode prins i was giving him my hiding place in amsterdam mila would kick my ass but it didnt matter if piet tied me to the rode prins he was going to die soon i drink at a place called the rode prins on the prinsengracht you know it i had a drink there once a bartender there henrik he knows me and whats your drink usually beer henrik had served me only once but id drunk the beer on his recommendation i held my breath im not real original he worked his phone presumably summoning up the rode prins number from an internet search he pressed the button so i could hear him make the call but to piet i was peter samson i was just sam to henrik this might not work henriks voice came on rode prins henrik please this is he henrik this will sound very strange but do you know a gentleman who goes by the name samson who drinks there now and then not dutch a pause a painfully long pause the barrel of piets gun felt screwed into my temple henrik said samson you mean sam yes is that what you call him thank god thank god yes everyone calls him sam dark blond hair tall midtwenties yes what is he you mean what nationality is sam i dont know wait i saw him once take stuff out of his pocket to get his money set it on the bar his passport was canadian i remarked on it then do you know what kind of work he does no idea he is one of those who doesnt talk much about himself is he in some kind of trouble no hes not what does he like to drink there heineken and you know i have a business to run and you sound like a goddamn stalker you like sams green eyes maybe henrik got a little edge going in his voice you want a date with him he doesnt swing that way as far as i can tell but you could leave your number piet hung up silence stretched for five long seconds i like you dont talk about what you do i dont like people who talk too much he dialed another number speak and youre dead piet said hello a voice said gregor i could be dead in the next ten seconds gregor this is piet do you know a man named samson a pause that ripped my heart from my chest yes but not well establishing that allimportant distance hes in town gregor said what does he do um i would describe it nicely as transport work and i dont know what else muscle when needed sams dangerous in a fight who did he work for when you knew him the vrana brothers but theyre dead now pissed off their partners and got axed in the bathroom he worked with djuki too is sam reliable or not reliable kind of a knowitall but he can move all sorts of goods he had inside contacts at legit shippers made things easier i could feel the air give in my chest a hollow breath gregor was repeating words he believed to be true thank you gregor how are things fine but slow do you think people dont wear watches so much with their phones telling them the time now piet didnt answer his question i can throw some major business your way very soon good okay now i could hear the tension in gregors voice the eagerness to be done with the conversation thank you gregor well speak soon piet clicked off the phone the barrel stayed in place what the hell more do you want a resume now i pulled the car over to the side of the road earning a honk from a truck behind me i turned to look at him piet was scared to death this stonecold mother was in deep trouble hed lost his ally who had betrayed him to an unseen enemy hed lost his distribution point for a lot of counterfeit goods and his slave trade hed lost two men that hed counted on hed lost a warehouse full of goods and slaves that his clients would be expecting him to move he had just lost a great deal of money hed been made by nic and he was being chased this on top of the turk blaring his name around town piet was rapidly becoming a liability and he knew it its gonna be okay piet chill and i carefully pushed the gun so that it was aimed at the vans floorboards and not my body he let me you dont want to tell your boss about the day going bad i said shut the hell up and lets go have a beer at that rode prins we stepped into de rode prins it wasnt too busy a group of young men sat at the biggest table laughing drinking beer talking sports a woman sat by herself sipping lager studying a guidebook to the city in the back a group of scottish tourists downed beers in the corner and munched on plates of cheese sausage and fried lumps of something mysterious an older man in a nice suit sat at the far end of the bar with a small glass of jenever reading a newspaper i could love the rode prins because it truly was a quiet neighborhood bar from the wall the redsplattered prince looked down on us all no sign of mila henrik stood behind the bar and i gave him the slightest of nods some guys looking for you henrik said i raised a thumb toward piet my friend he found me henrik nodded piet ordered two heinekens for us we sat at the opposite end of the bar from the man in the suit dilemma i thought as henrik brought us our beers piet seemed calmer he needed me badly he was on my turf now and i could beat him senseless haul his sorry ass upstairs and question him hard for the location of the gang and then i would probably kill him since i could hardly hand him to the police while i still had work to do but right now with an infiltration and an attack on his resources edward might scramble run to distant corners and take yasmin zaid with him i needed piet alive and i needed him as camouflage not a good day for you i said in a low whisper piet sipped at his beer he should have been running straight back to his boss edward but no one likes to be the bearer of bad news i began my slow squeeze i can see the mess youve landed in youve got your regular business here maybe nic helps you forge documents on his computer you make most of your money from the women moving them from eastern europe to here and you got hired for a truly big job with this edward dude you broke out of your comfort zone having to get goods to america he glanced at me why do you think i left prague all of a sudden man ive been there i shook my head sipped at the beer i had killed two men less than an hour ago and now i sat in a bar drinking theyd never feel the cool comfort of beer in their mouths again fine theyd made their choices if i hadnt killed them innocents would have died i wasnt going to dwell on what id done i wasnt proud of it either it was what it was but it was important that piet think i was as awful as he was my hand didnt shake as i picked up the beer glass it stayed steady edward isnt going to take this news well is he no and he doesnt fire people no what is he like piet considered very smart but hes a dick hes english he mentioned once he used to act on the stage i dont know where maybe in some backwater expert forgeri think he might have worked in intelligence once hes good at getting people to follow him talks like he was raised around money he throws money around too how do you know so much he should keep his mouth shut edward likes to be the most important man in the room that often involves bragging time to play you might have to fire him fire him you know some clients interfere with profitability thats what happened in prague i fired clients who tried to screw me over he laughed and now youre running no im laying low it was best that if i didnt want to be fired from this good sweet world that i relocate for a bit why are you telling me this because i know how a guy like edward works hes got critical goods he needs moved they want to use our networks our connections because they need us but if the job goes wrong they dont hesitate to kill us i felt like i was slipping entirely into a new skin i finished my beer gestured at henrik for another round the point is were businessmen and guys like edward are bigger trouble than theyre worth i cant fire this guy it would bring so much heat on me i wasnt suggesting you should i lied you just have to be prepared for every eventuality when i tell him what happened the fact youve waited is going to piss him off i said right now i needed to be the voice of reason someone piet could trust he might run no the job is too important to him and the job is what his gaze slid back to me how many friends do you have left piet lots and im sure now that this edward might be gunning for you theyll be lining up to help he let the sarcasm hang in the air for a long moment why would you help me money im very predictable and hell man im sort of deep in this now if i dont do this job i have not so much money i need it badly i wasnt particularly interested in his financial woes these guys were all the same big risks big payoffs and they blew it on bling and expensive girlfriends heres the deal youre crippled right now i still have my resources to help you move what the mystery meat is that youre shuttling for this edward guy youve lost your team youve lost some of your capital you take me on as a partner just for this job i get half half red crawled into his cheeks and he didnt bother to keep his voice down the scots and the old man glanced at us half i whispered im pulling your fat from the fire you underestimate me sam very badly the words were stone cold i think im estimating your sorryass position just fine good luck with edward and good luck with the police or dutch intel or whoevers gunning for you between those two i predict a week full of puppies and rainbows for you asshole i tossed euros on the counter got up to leave if he stayed i would grab him when he walked out and haul his ass upstairs and let him see what a grieving husband and father could do to mortal flesh he let me take five steps before he spoke ill give you thirty percent fortyfive forty he hissed i set up the job ive done most of the work youre just helping me reach completion forty i needed to let him win the battle all right forty percent he risked a smile at me it was the same smile hed given the captive women and it took a certain amount of selfcontrol not to slam my beer glass into the shine of his crooked teeth then you deserve to know who were fighting he made his voice low yes its not the police its a man bahjat zaid i know that name he raised an eyebrow military equipment manufacturer i read the economist you know i risked a frown did you counterfeit his goods rip him off not me he has a grudge against edward legit business types dont hire gunmen zaid does so true and this respectable businessmans trying to derail your big job i wanted to know if he would confide in me about yasmin why doesnt he just call the cops he has his reasons i took a sip of my beer what are you smuggling to the united states cant tell you piet i have to know i cant get it packaged and shipped without knowing be reasonable his need to trust me won out military equipment what kind electronics i didnt like this vagueness but i wasnt sure hed tell me more not in a public place what kind experimental zaid has his reasons for keeping the police out what reasons piet finished his beer watched the remaining suds inch down the empty glass what mattered was getting piet and edward and their group all together i had to work that angle relentlessly so put the edge of the knife against piets fears so youre in a mess youre moving counterfeit cigs to the us and youre hiding edwards secret military experimental equipment inside the shipments now youve lost your cigarettes and your means of smuggling edwards gear piet clenched his eyes im screwed and i dont like being screwed so we need goods to ship to serve as camouflage for whatever edward wants to get into america yes for a moment he looked like a stressed owner of a small business worrying over his accounts payable and an anemic cash flow i have a solution one i thought that would get me close to edward and yasmin and the rest of the group what we steal replacements replacements yes hijack a load of goods preferably counterfeit that way whoever you rob wont go to the police and we ship whatever secret stuff edward wants in the us in the stolen goods containers it is a bold thing to steal a freight shipment easiest thing in the world if you know how to do it but you and i cant do it alone this edward guy he must have people yes yes then we need them they are not robbers neither am i but circumstance dictates do they want to get this electronic gear whatever it is to the us yes what is the gear he leaned close to me i could smell his deodorant the soft stench of his scent the beer on his breath weapons weapons for who not your concern what kind terrible ones piet said i said nothing for a long long minute let the conversation in the other parts of the rode prins rise and fall then define terrible i said unlike you i dont bite off more than i can chew i had to play my part right and it was okay to be scared of the enormity of a job you cant back out now are you going to tell me the n word n word nuclear oh my god piet laughed oh no no he laughed again no i need details before i give you details i need to talk with edward fine i need to talk with edward too why because i blew nics cover and i saved all your asses i want payment i want my slice of this piet im getting shot at and i deserve a stake in this deal i made my words a hiss apply the pressure i thought crack him crack him now make the world an anvil falling from the sky in a twisted cartoon to obliterate his head i dont share a bit of information on the shipments until i talk to this edward and his people not a bit i could sense the desperation coming off him a dozen telling signs in the flick of the tongue on his lips in the way he held the heavy glass this was a man not easily rattled and he was rattled badly by the thought of failing edward he didnt speak so i asked when was your shipment supposed to arrive in rotterdam morning after tomorrow then we dont have much time do we tomorrow wasnt enough time to plan a robbery but i hoped that their desperation would be as great as mine edward does not rush ever he will not be rushed by my deadline in the mirrored wall of the bar i saw mila walk past us she did not look at us but she caught piets eye he watched her pass with an appreciation that made my bones go cold thats a prime little number three or five huh little prime number what you dont like math jokes math only exists for money mila vanished through a door into the back of the rode prins i wanted to talk to her now find out what had happened he finished his beer come with me sam i didnt want to leave but i set my beer down where are we going you want to meet edward you shall meet edward lets go finally it would happen i was going in unarmed but id face the scarred man find my wife and my child henrik watched us leave i wondered if mila was going to tail me again but i never looked behind me to see i couldnt have piet becoming suspicious i saw him howell stood in the quiet of the safe house in amsterdam outside the spring light danced on the shallow waters of the herengracht bicyclists pedaled by slowly savoring the lovely day he could smell gunfire and blood as if it were burned into his clothes i saw sam capra he fired on us he left behind a warehouse full of goods that i suspect are stolen or counterfeit and a room full of women i suspect are bound for sex slavery there has to be a reasonable explanation august said a company doctor was tending to his arm he winced as the doctor closed a stitch i think he went rogue long before his wife died has it occurred to anyone that he was the bad guy not her that lucy wasnt the driving force behind him turning traitor howell said i appreciate your loyalty to him but i am telling you august that it is misplaced and misspent on sam capra or he thinks these people know where his wife is he shot at my men did you see that howell hesitated no august thanked the doctor who left without a word then he turned to howell novem soles what you asked him about the words novem soles is it a group could these people be it these people are apparently cheap traffickers i doubt theyve endowed themselves with some grand latin name whats novem soles howell howell crossed his arms a term heard mentioned on some monitored lines tied to criminal rings or to government officials who were on the take i dont know if its a group or a code name for a person or what it is that dead man in brooklyn had a tattoo of a stylized nine and a sun novem soles nine suns i didnt sleep through latin maybe sam capra was working with these people on the bombing and now they want him dead or maybe hes turned against us since we let him walk weve thrown him away are you surprised hes landed with trash august said the hard awful truth is that the only survivors of the london office are the capras someone recruited either lucy or sam or both of them they killed our people they attacked us with impunity thats whats unacceptable hes acting like a criminal pretty it up how you want it august but hes a criminal too you told him that you had proof he was innocent i lied howell said it was a considered decision to let him go to see what he did then lets use our contacts in the underworld here ferret him out ill talk to him you howell said are going home soon as we can get you a plane sir dont let me stay youve been shot agent holdwine go home youre going to kill sam august said only if he tries to kill me howell said sir i request permission to stay my injury is not that serious and permission denied get some rest august read a good book watch tv youve earned some quiet howell walked out shutting the door behind him on the other side of the door august considered he still had the spare phone in his pocket the number that hed given to sam in case someone came after him back in brooklyn it had never been used he felt bad that sam hadnt called him after the attack in his apartment either sam didnt trust him august thought or he liked him too much to get him involved but he still had a few hours in amsterdam to hope for the phone to ring doyou know where de pijp is yes it was the same district as the albert cuyp market where gregors shop was drive there piet gave me directions and an address and dialed his phone yes hello listen i have bad news the machinists shop was compromised nic turned on us he was spying i have an associate who exposed him great he was claiming ownership of me nic might have been working for the same employer as the turk we were attacked not by police possibly by rivals the twins are dead our cover shipment lost what do you want to do this had to be edward and edward would have to summon piet for a meeting then i was set id already killed two of them i figured from the video id seen that there were about nine more who could damn yasmin zaid as a killer nine targets and edward i had no weapons on me and couldnt have counted on taking any because i would be searched before i was brought anywhere close to edwards inner circle fine i would have to start killing them before he saw me before he recognized me as lucy capras husband with what my bare hands bahjat zaid wanted them all dead but zaid had lied to me and avoided me and given this group weapons if piet was to be believed all without telling me i didnt like being a pawn so i didnt feel that i had to follow his orders to the letter grab his daughter and get out was good enough for me and that alone was going to be a nearly insurmountable challenge we lost the shipments but my partner says he knows how to get replacements he listened then said yes three times he clicked off the phone where are these shipments we can take over he asked you cant steal a legit shipment i said you cant redirect it not if you want to be sure of total control of it they could have gpid chips inside for the police to track it you need to steal from counterfeiters they cant run to the police and if they want to try and take you on you might be able to outgun them i dont want to steal in rotterdam he said these people could be my customers later i hate people who think longterm i needed him panicked not logical i tented my tongue with my cheek we dont have time we will have to figure it out now were on a deadline i miss it edward will kill us both well i was about to ruin his plans but what if edward and yasmin werent where we were headed right now id have to continue the charade to get close to them where the hell would i find illegal shipments to hijack i considered the chinese usually move their billions in counterfeit cigs in stages shedding shipments in major cities as they move west across europe i drummed a finger against my lip so i think chinese counterfeits are our best hope we can grab a shipment relabel it hide the goods and get it on its way to america he was calmer what do you need a team of at least seven and guns silencers we will need forged papers to replace their shipping manifests with our names in case we are stopped and how will we find the chinese shipments i know a man i said but i hoped id have edward in my grip before i had to make that call the house was in a section of de pijp that was a bit worn and tired if i could get the gun from piet before we were in i could work through the house eliminating them i would be going in blind though but better to get the layout see the faces then strike assuming i got my hands on a gun god i was assuming a lot i glanced at the rear mirror it would have been nice to see mila pulling up behind us arms laden with well arms but the street was empty except for two women walking along the sidewalk carrying their shopping bags a man opened the door as we approached his eyes hidden behind retrostyle sunglasses his mouth was a lush cruel curl i tensed i felt like i was walking into a gas chamber this was what my life had come to killing i wondered what my baby looked like i wondered what his skin felt like what it would be like to know the curl of a hand around a fathers finger you think the damndest things when you believe youre really about to die like you know you only have so many thoughts left the man who had taken my wife and child from me was inside waiting piet said hes clean but the sunglassed man guided me into the house with a fist in the small of my back and searched me thoroughly his hand running along my back my legs my groin beyond the entryway i could detect a scent of spicy food of laundry detergent of sweat another man a blond stood at the end of the hall three to kill but i would kill them somehow a young woman stepped out next to him she wore jeans and a faded tshirt and held a gun she had brown hair pulled back not yasmin zaid she stared at me with flat eyes four to kill and on her arm a nine paired with a sun stylized just like the man in brooklyn who id killed with my bartenders guide i wondered if the guy in shades could smell my fear my tension i didnt want to die the realization was on me like a weight slamming between my shoulders youre enjoying this i said as he ran probing fingers up my leg toward my crotch those are some gifted hands shut up you talk when i say so he said in perfect english since his fist was close to my groin i decided silence was the best option i could see the gun in the back of his pants good to know id already decided id take the womans gun she was holding it a bit loosely as though it were more prop than weapon ready to use this is samson piet said hes all right he and he didnt get a chance to finish the sunglassed man jabbed a hand hard into piets throat piet slammed against the wall choking and the sunglassed manprobably about sixfour two hundred very solid poundssaid im not happy with you piet pietbig tough swordninja pietstarted to beg ah freddy please please we all want to know how today went so bad how marc and dirk died i guessed those were the twins he cant answer you if hes choking to death i said piet gurgled and brought a bit of color to the dour room turning a nice shade of robinsegg blue freddy shot me a look i dont know you marc and dirk got killed because nic sold us out i said nics dead the revenge is done if thats what youre after i killed nic and im going to get us some goodies to hide your junk they were our friends im very sorry they died standing up he had the same tattoo as the woman the nine that was partly a sun it looked very fresh on his forearm these guys were novem soles these guys were nothing what had they done that ranked a company file before the london bombing freddy gave me a long funny look piet started to kick the wall freddys bicep looked like it was hewn from marble he probably didnt keep a gun at hand because he could kill you with one blow the woman said freddy lets hear what piets come to say freddy dropped piet who coughed and rolled on the dirty floor i helped him to his feet i couldnt get my hands close to his gun though and freddy had a gun out now and had it very close to my temple he steered us into a den at the end of the hallway and i thought here we go moment of truth but it was empty no edward no scarred man he wasnt here edward wanted to talk to us piet said edward doesnt talk to people he doesnt know the woman said she had an odd tone as though english and dutch accents had been pureed in a linguistic blender she was pretty in a technical sense that proportion and balance were in her features but she was ugly at the same time like the rot in her soul had inched its way to the surface i disliked her immediately and intensely that must make his social circle very tiny i said yes the woman seemed to be in charge freddy wasnt contributing to class discussion my name is samson i said and you are demi she gestured at chairs i sat like the actress like the actress did you know her name is very popular with dutch parents i did not i said this wasnt right they looked like lowlevel crooks nothing that could pull off multiple bombings to rid themselves of enemies or blackmail a corporate titan like bahjat zaid but as my mind flashed across the video images from the turks execution i felt sure that freddy and demi and piet and the other guy had been among the masked crowd on the tape i could recognize freddys bulk the dutch kids slouch demis crossedarm stance the house was old and it smelled and they looked like youngsters playing at gangsters rather than being real criminals on the tv a spongebob cartoon played muted i could smell burned popcorn wafting from the kitchen a disassembled gun lay on the table sloppy whens edward going to be here i said hes not demi answered she watched piet slide into the chair next to me the blue tint in his face had been replaced by a flushed red he was pissed what the hell is this he yelled edward said hes making sure the shipment reaches us okay hell see you when youve got the american side of the trip ready not before i could hardly ask if yasmin zaid was here is this all i have to work with what do you mean there are four of you including piet i need more people to grab a shipment piet was hired to arrange the shipment were not helping you at all but we need more people i gained nothing by taking down this group it wasnt all of them and yasmin and edward werent here you dont get to talk to edward or anyone else until youve fixed the cargo problem i glanced around the den it wasnt the room where theyd shown yasmin shooting the turk this wasnt their base of operations this dump was a backup safe house for them i was going to have get edwards operation back on track that was the only way to get him and the whole gang within reach close enough to kill close enough to get answers no choice starting tomorrow i was going to have to steal a shipment of cigarettes from guntoting chinese smugglers to give me the man i was hunting lucky me gregor said i dont do a lot of business with the chinese he looked at me and then at piet he swallowed seriously guys i dont think i can help you i just need someone in the counterfeiting chain i said you must know someone no way are all these rolexes entirely real i beg your pardon sam but they are gregor managed a moments outrage he turned to piet i honestly cant think of anyone to aim you at i was going to owe gregor bigtime but killing piet and removing all danger to him would probably be a good settling of the accounts i need to know gregor you must have a contact among the chinese gregor looked gaunt and frightened and once again like he was fending off a cold he shook out a garlic lozenge from a package and slipped it between his lips sniffling i have one or two but im not sure theyd appreciate me giving you a name the chinese counterfeiters are very very careful about their associates they are also very very entrepreneurial i said and im sure that we can make them an appealing offer what do you want them for we want to hire them to smuggle goods for us piet lied gregor clicked the garlic lozenge against his teeth ask your friend nic wouldnt he know nic is dead i said gregor dragged a tissue across his nostrils with a wide swipe really he looked at me as if to say well done yes so we need a name with the chinese well pay gregor he pulled a piece of paper close to him wrote down a name and a phone number you want mrs ling she handles a lot of trade coming into holland ive gotten watches from her before she has a legit export company but she uses it as a front i take fake swatch watches from her sell them online he finished his cigarette i would not cross mrs ling im supposed to be afraid of a woman piet snorted i had no intention of playing the fool tell me about her she goes nowhere without her three sons i suspect their father is the devil and mrs ling won custody these are vicious people i do not deal with them unless i have to where are the lings my impatience showed fine id face the badass lings i just wanted to get close to edward id thought of my child in that moment when i thought i might die and now i couldnt shake the thought of my baby you can call them gregor said dont involve me tell her you would like to propose a business deal to your mutual advantage he sounds like a dickens novel piet muttered i hadnt expected literary knowledge from piet i reminded myself not to underestimate him thank you gregor i said it occurred to me that gregor could solve a couple of problems for himself as soon as we left by calling the lings and telling them we intended trouble or that we were trouble cmon piet the plan on how to use the lings to get rid of a chunk of the gang was already forming in my head but piet said wait i turned back piet stared at gregor who stared back what gregor said whats the matter hes real nervous today hes afraid youll warn the lings about us and so hes thinking about killing you i said i believe in honesty in all dealings with people like gregor he was a crook but he was not a vicious killer and rapist like piet garbage has different levels piet shot a look at me but if he kills you ill kill him i said piet shot out his arm and grabbed gregor by the throat gregor tried to wrench away his thin delicate fingers plucking at the sausages that made up piets hand listen piet said you keep your goddamned mouth shut and youll get a cut all right all right gregor choked piet pulled out the short sword and ran it along gregors jaw with a frightening tenderness let him go i said now piet pushed gregor away gregor gagged and fell to the floor he spat out the garlic lozenge huffing for breath were all cool all cool piet stormed out of the watch shop it will be okay gregor he wont bother you again i promise gregor didnt look at me please dont come see me again please i dont want to stay in the business i dont want to be tied to whatever youre doing i have a wife a child please id pushed him too far and he wanted out i couldnt blame him hed given me a lot okay gregor thank you for helping me piet had repaired to a cafe across the street i sat down across from him and he said you do not issue the orders the next time you do that in front of someone i will take the wakizashi and ill lop off a finger do you understand me youre nobody here nobody im a nobody whos saving your ass and dont you forget it the next time you decide to strangle someone whos helping us i will take your wakizashi and drive it into your back you understand me he glared at me fuck you listen to me edward and his people are just about done with you thats clear to me if not to you theyve had their fill of your screwups so either we get the shipment or theyre going to kill us both piet said nothing as his beer was put on the table i shook my head at the waiter i will find out where the lings have a shipment heading for amsterdam one we can intercept how will you i will trust me but give me tonight to do it i stood piet stared down at his beer give me a number where you can be reached he spouted one off and i memorized it i didnt want to leave him but i had to he could duck and run now but i couldnt show him how i intended to find the lings without tipping my hand on my past because id heard of the lings one of the suits the young one had mentioned the name in the briefing a minute before lucy called me and the bomb went off the company was watching the lings the rode prins was empty inside its few customers were all outside basking in the sun henrik wiped down the bar and nodded politely as i approached you saved me i said thank you youre welcome sam i dont like that man not a bit i dont like him either where is mila she is upstairs i caught her coming down we need to talk i said she turned around without a word and we went into the apartment i started to speak and she delivered a slap right across my face it stung what the hell we did not bring you inside she hissed just so you can find your wife who is probably a traitor we brought you in so you could do good actual real good didnt i you left those women there agony layered her voice it is beyond indecent sam the company was there my friend august was there and they abandoned the women they left them behind that couldnt be i tried to think of a reason why howell would have done such a thing mila they had wounded and they were operating on dutch soil without clearance they had their covers to protect they would have called the police im sure you are sure so they and you leave women chained like dogs in darkness her voice broke mila where are the women now they are with friends of mine i will make sure they are returned home mila i did my best to protect them i took a step closer to her her slap still stinging my cheek i kept piet from hurting them again or taking them with us im sorry if i let you down she bit her lip clutching her elbows you will have to fend on your own i need to help the women youre abandoning me you abandoned them you know thats not true i set it up so they could be freed mila why are you being this way she looked at the ground because i have to be this way sam listen carefully if you have to leave amsterdam my employers own a bar in just about every major city in the world do a search for roger cadet on your phone and youll find the address for the closest one go there and tell the manager that roger cadet asked you to stop by and you will be helped whatever you need whos roger cadet the supposed owner but he doesnt exist its just a password but every bars location is encoded with it so itll show up on a gps map these bars are a chain no each bar is unique but each can serve as a safe house for you i took a step toward her i am so close mila so close to finding this edward jerk and to finding my wife and child to saving yasmin zaid please dont walk away help me you dont need me sam you need only yourself and your unbroken focus everything else is a distraction and i have to help these women i have to she spoke from a place of pain and i couldnt argue with her all right i can always be reached at this number she gave me a cell phone number i repeated it and she nodded good luck sam she left i didnt want her to go but in one way it was easier because there was no way in hell she would agree to what i was going to do next i went to my duffel bag where id stashed it under the bed and i pulled out the cell phone august had given me a lifetime ago in brooklyn i went downstairs and i walked a half mile away and stood on a bridge that spanned the prinsengracht a sightseeing boat cruised below me a group of students laughing walked past me i dialed it rang seven times before it was answered yes hi august a pause where are you i need to talk to you you better be turning yourself in no i need to see you facetoface um i was shot today you know are you in the hospital no flesh wound in the arm and i took a blow to the head the bullet is out and my heads hard as steel but i get sent home tomorrow they didnt have a plane available tonight i need your help you need help all right sam you know there was a dead body in the apartment next to you dont you i knew that did you kill him yes oh sam well he started it i said can you come see me without howell or anyone else you have to be kidding the guys i was with are tied to the man who set off the london bomb and kidnapped my wife i said now if you want to grab me you will ruin any chance of getting this guy hes behind the bombing in amsterdam and hes working on getting experimental weapons of some sort to the states he sent the dead guy who tried to kill me hes tied to the money czar we were investigating in london august its all knitted together and im this close to pulling it apart i need your help you are so majorleague screwed up sam look come in tell us all about it and let us help you i cant august theyll just put me back in jail howell thinks im in with these people i dont have time to explain to him that im not ill lose my job if i dont report this conversation and you know it yes you will i waited where are you august arrived an hour later alone i was at a back table in the rode prins near the curtain screening the corridor that led to the kitchen he sat heavily across from me id kicked him in the side of the head and a purplish bruise stretched from temple to jaw i could see the heft of a bandage underneath his jacket how are you feeling like hell howells gone to a meeting and i told them i needed fresh air he stared at me sam what in gods name are you doing one of the crime families the company had an interest in are the lings theyre based here one of the langley guys mentioned them in london okay they behind the grab on lucy no but i need to know if they are still being tracked by the company what for i need to know where their shipments are i need to steal one his mouth opened closed opened again insanity doesnt agree with you sam its the only way for me to get close to the guy who took lucy he he has a hostage august so i cant force my way in i have to draw him to me but i need to know what we know about the lings routes youre crazy sam i cant imagine what youve lost i cant but i think your grief has damaged you badly and you have to acceptyoure not getting lucy and the baby back theyre gone you know they wouldnt have kept her alive for months they wouldnt have been saddled with a baby he stopped as if horrified by his words i stared at him this is all for nothing august said youre not getting them back im sorry man sorrier than you will ever know but i please just do as i ask if we were ever friends friends dont put friends in positions like this man i could lose it all you could i already have august i know that you as a decent man are going to help me you cant not help me i wanted to say i saved your life today but i couldnt play that card he hadnt seen me and it wasnt fair howell will have my head howell left a group of women behind in that machinists shop what do you mean after you and the other agent were hit and he chased me out did he secure the building he did did he tell you there were a group of sex slaves being held captive in the back august paled dragged a finger along his unshaven jaw no i didnt know i swear i believe you because howell is ahab and im the white whale i said hes losing perspective august i i dont know i took a deep breath i knew about you and lucy seeing each other before lucy and i dated she never mentioned it you both kept it secret and i dont blame you the company doesnt need to be in your business but i knew and you didnt dump me as a friend for going out with your ex i said lucy and i werent a good match he said it only lasted a month why i never trusted her he put his hands into his coat pockets and i wondered what i would do if he pulled a gun on me i honestly didnt know august felt like the last strand of my normal life and now i was asking him to do a job that was incredibly dangerous i didnt know what he was suggesting to me about my wife i just couldnt go there a long silence and then he said can i call you on this number if i find out about the lings yes i tried to keep the relief from my voice thank you dont thank me yet no promises he turned and walked out of the rode prins without another word i sat and drank henriks good coffee and closed my eyes and thought through how i would steal the shipment given what i could guess about the limitations i would face five hours later august called we have an informant inside the lings operation the lings trucks stop at a sweatshop in france you do not hit them at the sweatshop you hear me you do not youll dirty up a current investigation into them he gave me the address their trucks are marked as being part of a company called leeuw en draak lion and dragon thank you i said and meant it dont call me again sam good luck and he hung up now id lost my best friend as well i mourned for all of ten seconds then i called piet i have what we need the next day we waited in the rain just north of paris it had taken us nearly five hours to drive south from amsterdam to the locale august had given me it was early afternoon and the day was gray and sodden piet sat next to me sharpening his wakizashi sword on a whetstone stroke stroke stroke it made the flesh on my neck jerk how sharp could you make a sword the sweatshop was off the ee expressway hidden in a gray huddle of buildings i wondered how pleasant it would be to be rid of piet very soon i thought very soon we sat and watched absolutely nothing happen at the sweatshop hours passed twilight began to approach how does a canadian soldier get into this business piet asked breaking the silence i glanced at him i was bored how did you get into trafficking women he smiled i needed money for art school i didnt expect that answer an annoying percentage of young people in amsterdam harbor a secret desire to be van gogh or rembrandt anyway i knew a guy a friend of my moms he needed help getting girls to holland i helped him buy a van so we could move them and eventually i took over the route took over he got married and thought he shouldnt traffic girls no more what you thought id killed him yes no known him since i was twelve he rubbed at his bottom lip he owns a coffee shop now i really didnt want to know piet as a person but some instinctive need to understand took control so i asked why the sword the sword is who i am but it makes you memorable i thought the idea was to stay under the radar it honors my mother she was japanese yeah she came here for love boyfriend brought her dumped her she stayed i remembered nic called piet a whoreson perhaps he meant it as more than an insult as a description his mom might have been a worker in the rosse buurt many of the women there were not dutch i thought i wanted to study art do japanesestyle stuff like netsuke or watercolor painting my mother did that in her spare time he shrugged but art school didnt work out they hated me there and a girl made trouble for me assholes so i left i had not thought of piet as someone with smothered dreams he read my expression eh you thought i was just a snake he laughed well i man were all snakes gregor likes to pretend hes shed his skin been reborn as an honest soul but his scales are still there and i suspect youre a very crafty snake sam i shrugged sure i got run out of the army i spoke some czech from my grandmothers side of the family i couldnt find a real job in prague so i made my own there so you went straight from art school into trafficking not right away i used to do contract work for the police department in amsterdam designing their websites and brochures he said he gave a long low laugh then i saw how much the opposition paid i glanced at him thats a switch you make serious money by being a player if id stayed with the police then i would have been a cog in their operation i paid attention i wanted to own cogsnot be one so you picked girls for your commodity my mind kept saying shut up but it was a strange thought to sit here making conversation with a monster in the shape of a man he shrugged good profit margin growing demand not likely to run out of raw materials it was brutally cold accountancy i wondered if it was a sort of twisted revenge on his mother you sell people piet you sound like a schoolmaster he shrugged i think of it as selling comfort and convenience not to the people you sell he flicked a smile they dont have money they dont count the smile turned greasy you know they live better here even as whores than they do back home ive done them a favor i have it would be one thing if they chose it but most dont he gave me a look of disapproval i didnt know id offended your sacred morals i had overstepped i could show my loathing for him when i killed him not before i just think counterfeit merchandise is a lot easier to control than people i like the control his voice became a low slur of gravel you should try it ill treat you to the choicest morsels from my next batch from moldova got some girls coming in four days an order from a house in london you and me we can break one of the girls in you get a taste for this business then fake goods will pale if i looked at him i would kill him on the spot and i needed him so i watched the sweatshop parking lot he misinterpreted my silence ah maybe you dont like the girls we get boys too not so many but i know a couple of boys back in amsterdam you might like no thank you i said not interested youre weird he said worrying so much about people other people dont matter all that matters is you you judge me but you are no different than me sam you lie you kill when you have to you live under a false name i never shot anyone down the way you did nic i did you a favor with nic true he rubbed his lip i keep thinking that i will be arrested any moment because i dont know what he was transmitting or who he was talking to i need a big payday sam i need to be able to run and hide thats a great luxury to hide well thats the mark when youre not a pawn no more when youre a player tell me about edward i said is he a player or is he more what do you mean more you said hes moving experimental weapons i think hes pulling corporate espionagestealing from one company to sell to another whats he want to put into this shipment piet not for you to worry about if we get caught id like to know what im serving time for youll never see the light of day if we get caught on this job piets gaze went back to the warehouse ach hello a truck marked with a stylized lion and dragon pulled into the back of the warehouse where the sweatshop sat three chinese men spilled out two wore black trench coats another more portly wore a regular tan jacket and blue jeans he walked to the bay of the warehouse the two in trench coats stayed close to the truck lets go piet said no i said theyve got shotguns under the coats how can you tell see the way the fabric bulges right below the arm one guy was riding in the cab but the second came out of the truck itself they wont go into the building theyre guards well what are we supposed to do we cant grab the truck here theyre picking up extra goodstheyve already dropped off fake cigs along the route we go in now while theyre parked at a friendly spot the lings get a phone call not if we kill them all i didnt sign on for a massacre i said and its bad business practice interference with profit was the only argument that might sway piet the lings would start hunting for us fast we need to tackle the truck crew alone so how do we steal the shipment we dont i said we hijack it august was sitting in the hallway of the safe house waiting for the pilot flying him to new york when he heard an exchange between howell and one of the operations techs mr howell we have a match on the description of the man at the warehouse based on the description you and august gave is this him yes who is he piet tanaka dutch national formerly a contract employee for the amsterdam police whats he doing now hes dropped out of sight sir no listed address no listed occupation august howell called august got up and walked to the computer screen this the guy you saw in the warehouse august nodded yeah distinctive face thats him howell turned back to the tech find this guy hes got sam capra working for him i dont think thats accurate august said dont you have a plane to catch agent holdwine howell said august left and found the pilot downstairs ready to take him to the airport howell didnt wish him well or thank him for taking a bullet treason poisoned the air they all felt it since howell had seen sam capra leaving the scene of murder and trafficking treason put people in a sour mood after loading several boxes the chinese truck pulled back out onto the highway and we followed at a distance three cars back piet was good he knew how to tail how are we going to get this truck grabbed before they stop again we force them off the highway what in broad daylight yes in broad daylight right now theyre split uptwo in the cab one back with the goodsand they are more on guard when theyre stopped they wont expect an attack now thats because attacking them on the highway is stupidity piet said what do you suggest we do get behind them then go past them i said i want a better look at the cargo door he inched up past the two sedans between us and the ling truck and swerved back over i studied the back of the truck a sliding door secured at the bottom by two separate padlocks hard to pick roaring along at seventy miles an hour now go past them he floored the van and hurtled past the truck the cab door appeared to be normal no modifications i didnt give it more than a glance i didnt want to attract the drivers attention but i saw him and he was laughing stay ahead of them i studied the map unfolded on my lap there was another highway intersection cutting across northern france perhaps fifteen kilometers distant floor it get us there now i have an idea this is insane piet said but he smiled the ling truck would be here within minutes and the van was parked on a bridge over the expressway you understand what to do he nodded if this fails youll have wrecked everything if this fails ill be dead so dont bitch just do what youre supposed to do good luck he offered me his hand i dared not show my revulsion for him so i shook hands theyre coming he said looking south i could see the truck approaching in the heavy gray mist i put my legs over the side of the overspan and i heard piets van roar off but my mind was on counting the truck should pass under me at fifteen twelve thirteen fourteen i was wrong the ling truck hurtled beneath me at fourteen and if i hesitated i would miss it landing onto unforgiving asphalt tumbling into fastmoving traffic i threw myself off and caught the last third of the truck trying to land on all fours and roll with controlled parkour grace a roll would be far quieter than hammering feet against the roof but my legs slipped and the truck veered slightly i started to go off the roofs edge on the passenger side my legs danced in the air i swung myself hard every muscle in my arms screaming thinking if they see me in the wing mirror im dead i yanked myself up with a jerk that felt like id torn flesh from my arms and settled into the slight depression in the trucks roof then i lay very very still had they seen me i had to assume radio communication between the cab and the guy in the hold of the truck either could have reported an unexpected sound or the passenger in the cab could have seen my bluejeaned legs swinging out into the empty air when i struggled for a grip maybe theyd take the next exit search for a place of privacy then dispatch me no i saw the next exit sign pass a light rain began to fall from the granitegray sky the truck pressed onward i started to crawl along the length of the truck slowly steadily keeping my head down i didnt want a motorist to see me i risked a glance behind me piet had rejoined the highway and his van was there staying close but not too close the rain increased slicking the metal i needed a firm grip for the next step and nature had just made my job harder i reached the forward edge of the truck the cabs roof was about two feet below my hands i could ease onto the roof but id be more visible to anyone in approaching traffic cell phones were everywhere i didnt want the french police getting reports of a crazy man trucksurfing the expressway the other choice was to ease down between the cab and the truck into the narrow space so thats where i went feet first my back to the cab the truck jolted over a rough patch of road and my right foot slipped gravity seized me and i caught my hand in the jumble of cables at the cabs rear my foot landed on the metal strut connecting the cab below me i could see the road passing between the crushing wheels i steadied myself now or never i inched my arm holding piets gun around the cabs corner i planned to grab the passenger door wrench it open and yank myself inside all without the cabs guard shoving me back out into empty air at seventy miles an hour the wind whipped hard around me the rain seeping into my eyes i put my head around the corner and stared into a mans face leaning out of the window the passengers eyes were bright with shock that someone stood behind the cab he looked to be about forty heavyset time froze for three seconds then his shoulder made a sudden hard shrug bringing up his arm i jerked my head back around the cabs edge as he fired the bullet made a bright spark against metal ricocheted out into the rain the truck veered hard shuddering into the other lane then whipped back they were trying to throw me off i gripped the rainslick metal and saw piets van race up to the drivers side a spray of water fountaining from the tires a muffled shot from the truck aimed at piet i took a risk that the driver wasnt driving and firing at the same timethat it was the passenger shooting at piet all i had now was force calculated and vicious i went back around the corner and heard another crack of shot i yanked on the door just as a hand from inside tried to pull it back i threw myself forward the doors handle in a death grip then my feet gave way on the wet metal of the doorstep my legs shot out and my shoes dangled inches above the tarmac i dropped my gun it clattered onto the metal onto the road and was crushed under the wheels the window inches above my head exploded shards blew out stinging my scalp the passenger firing in panic i wrenched my hand shifted my weight pulled my legs against the door for leverage covered my head with my arm all in one fluid move like i was jumping onto a publichousing railing in london i threw myself through the window head first my back slamming against the edge of it i wriggled trying to get leverage elbowing the passenger hard in the throat knocking him into the driver i had five seconds to win this fight the driver whipped a gun from his left hand to his right toward me he fired and the bullet skittered a path along the very top of my scalp hot and vicious i seized the guns barrel and pushed down he had to keep one hand on the wheel and he pulled the trigger in reaction the next bullet hammered into the seat by the passengers leg he screamed and in panic wriggled past me i threw a kick at him and he slammed into the door and crumpled now i barreled hard into the driver shoving him into his door where the bullet had grazed me the pain was like a burning match dragged along my skin he knocked me back but my heels hit the windshield and i powered back into him i threw hard fast punches into his throat eyes the truck veered wildly and he dropped the gun but i felt the tires leave the asphalt and brush along an unpaved surface grass a skid beginning i levered my foot up snaked an arm around his neck ill break it i said in mandarin you listen to me the man with me he will kill you i will not all we want is the cargo he will kill you if you do not cooperate i will let you live do you understand me and i gave his neck the slightest wrench he nodded i grabbed the gun and pressed its heat to the drivers ribs drive normally the driver settled the truck guided it back onto the highway we earned a roaring honk from a mercedes that powered past us the driver shaking a fist blind to the struggle inside the cab the van pulled alongside us like a teenager sidling up to the dream girl at a dance a bullet hole marred its roof piet leaned forwardwith extreme caution i waved the man in the van will kill you i said again do you speak english a little the driver said dont let him know you understand hes crazy im your only hope right now you got me the driver nodded the passenger unconscious did not contribute to the discussion tell the guard in the trailer that were pulling over and hes to lay down his weapons come out with hands up you tell him any different i shoot you in the knee the driver obeyed speaking into a walkietalkie i gestured for piet to drive behind us and at my order the driver took the next exit i blinked away wetness on my face we pulled four kilometers or so down the road now i saw empty stretches of land with a shawl of gray mist hovering above the ground cows grazed maybe a dairy close by no sign of people and the road was an old narrow affair rough around the edges in the distance i saw a rough stone building it looked like a storage facility i said in chinese remember do what i say no matter what i say to the man in the van we will walk to the storage shed and then well take the truck you understand me the driver nodded piet crept up from where hed parked the van a gun at the ready i pulled the driver out keeping the gun on him i turned and heard a creak of metal the back of the trailer opening piet jumping back the driver called in mandarin do what i told you dont shoot the guard yelled he came out hands raised crime is a kind of war but while soldiers will die for their country few people will die for lords like the lings loyalty is a smoke that inches up from the ashes of greed in this world a change in wind scatters it how do i know you wont kill me the driver said in chinese because youd already be dead if we wanted you dead i said silence while he decided he opted to trust the calm in my voice the guard was maybe forty tired looking a little heavy his mouth trembled as he blinked at the cows on the soft turf here piet said handing me his gun kill them not out here i said shots will echo across an empty field and im not dragging dead weight into the woods ill take them to that shed you check the cargo if there are any gpid chips on there to trace the goods tear them out the lings could be monitoring the shipment ill take care of these guys piet looked at the chinese and smiled god theyre dumb standing here while we talk about killing em and they dont have a clue but maybe the guard did he looked like he was about to break into a panicked run calm down i said in mandarin its okay come with me then i told the driver to haul down his unconscious friend and carry him he obeyed putting the knockedout passenger over his shoulder the guard said in stuttering mandarin this is my first run i used to be a schoolteacher my brotherinlaw he got me involved i dont know much about doing the runs he wore a yankees baseball cap they walked ahead of me and we went over the fence and toward the shed i glanced back piet had vanished into the truck the shed was old and when i kicked the door the weathered lock shattered i gestured them inside please the guard said please dont terror ragged his voice sit down i said they sat the driver laying the unconscious cab guard down first he has to think you three are dead you understand but i am not going to hurt you they nodded their eyes stayed on the gun i took a step back you i said to the guard toss me your hat he pulled off the yankees cap and threw it at me i caught it and covered up my bloody hair with it your wallets your papers they tossed them over to me trembling and i studied them stand up now turn around slowly they did shivering and i quickly hit each one of them hard with the butt of the gun and they collapsed i punched both until they were out cold i left the unconscious guy alone then i fired three shots into the rotting wall motes of wood and dust danced in the air before my face i wiped the blood off my knuckles in the dirt i walked back to the truck piet studied papers the manifest on the truck indicated these were turkish cigarettes bound for london of course they werent theyd been made in china most likely in a factory halfhidden in the ground any tracking chips i asked no piet said nice cap then lets go i want to see the chinese he said well then go look i said i would have to shoot him he studied me a small blue farm truck suddenly appeared on the road inched past us the driveran old womangiving us a long curious stare as she went by it rattled him lets just get going get you bandaged up clean off the blood in the cabin im driving the truck youre driving the van and we drove away i kept my eyes locked on the little shed in the rearview mirror no one came out of it we arrowed into belgium past the empty buildings of the old border station and the lights along the expressway activated by the cloudy day glowed white in france yellow in belgium i had no cell phonepiet had insisted still nervous that he might be betrayed again no way to contact mila there was no builtin phone in the van but there was a gps i wouldnt have the weapons i wouldnt be able to set a trap i felt dizzy from the loss of blood from my scalp wound and i decided i wasnt going in blind it was time to see if mila had been telling me the truth i did a search on the vans gps monitor entering in the name roger cadet mila had said that would show me her employers bars that i could use as a safe house one result taverne chevalier off avenue lloyd george in the diplomatic district as we edged into brussels i flashed the lights piet pulled over and i walked up to the cab i need a drink and a meal and i need to make some phone calls what phone calls piet said we keep going this isnt the only deal ive got either we stop or you decide to trust me with a cell phone no calls i have to work the next deal after this one and i have to work it now greed lit piets eyes what is this deal military goods high profit margins i was already thinking of the call i needed to make where do you want to stop i know a place taverne chevalier was one of those places that looked rather humble but was zealously guarded by posh types as their private unpretentious discovery the bar itself was a finger of dark mahogany taps for a large assortment of belgian and dutch brews lined the bar and it looked like some ales were being served in oldfashioned ceramic pitchers i heard a variety of languages bubbling from the crowd hipsters in their requisite blackframed eyeglasses men and women who wore the carefully neutral smiles of bureaucrats brussels was a city of diplomats and dealers and i thought that if mila and her mysterious bosses had half a brain between them they would have planted bugs on all the tables recorded every conversation not the time for a drink and if we need to eat we could get fast food piet did not sound happy we had parked the truck in a lot a few blocks away and he was very nervous about leaving the shipment i know the owner here i lied you cant do business here too many people trust me i said piet laughed i like it when you make a joke i leveled him with a stare what are you drinking i think i should go back to the truck we can be in amsterdam in a couple more hours and we will be follow me we went to the bar waited for a waitress to take our order i ordered two jupiler lagers and when she brought them i slid money to her and said id like to see the manager please shes busy sir shell make time for me i think mila sent me the waitress vanished into the back of the bar and a few moments later a stout fiftyish woman appeared a frown on her face yes sir im a friend of roger cadets i said using the pass name mila had given me back in amsterdam she nodded any friend of rogers is welcome here is roger here id like to speak to him alone her glance slid to piet i can find out if hell see you i turned to piet stay here drink your beer ill just be a minute no you could be calling someone telling them where the shipment is we stick together i put my mouth close to piets ear this is a byway a stop i have private business with him on this weapons deal but i can use your help and youll earn a cut were partners yes he was torn he wanted the money but he didnt want me apart from him i dont like this sam listen to me i took the risk back on the truck im not messing you over were solid piet all right i must pay respects do you understand you could bolt out the door and steal the shipment while im in there and im trusting you that you wont lose piet and i might well lose edward for good but i had to take the calculated risk i wont be but a minute or two the manager cut through the crowd of diplomats and skinny beautiful people and we went upstairs she glanced back at me youre new yes and in trouble i need weapons a cell phone she unlocked a door to the left of the landing i glanced back down the stairway no sign of piet i stepped inside the door im eliane the manager said after she shut the door youre supposed to call first i couldnt no phone the small room was lined with shelves some of which contained weapons a cot neatly made up stood in the corner i wanted to fall on it and collapse instead i searched the shelves found two glock mms spare clips silencers what else do you need i have to fight a large number of people i said they will be heavily armed and ill be alone so i guess i have to kill them eliane blinked youre going to kill them all i swallowed i dont know hell was i if i left some of the group alive couldnt i leave them for the dutch to interrogate possibly to glean useful information zaids insistence that everyone be killed to protect yasmins good name nagged at me she had been brainwashed that wasnt a crime his reputation might survive eliane moved to a box opened it the box was marked with a logo i recognized militronics zaids company gear from his own company would help free his daughter do you have restraints i asked yes but i thought you were going to kill them not take them hostage lets keep our options open let me have several sets she showed me a thick banding of plastic wrist cuffs and this a flash grenade she said modified police issue do you know how to use it here is the activation button here the timer thanks where am i going to hide these i could hardly go downstairs loaded with gear in front of piet my van is parked about a kilometer away can you get this stuff there yes she said this man with youhe is not good hes a coldblooded murderer and a slaver i have to ambush him and several others at a meeting then we mustnt make a mistake eliane said i liked her id been judged by so many people lately from howell to august to mila and eliane just seemed to want to help me i could have kissed her i gave her the keys and the description of the van and i need a cell phone programmed with a number where i can reach mila i took off my baseball cap and she gasped at the encrusted blood she insisted on examining the wound its superficial but it needs tending eliane said no time and it would make him suspicious how much time do you need to get to the van load it and get back ten minutes give me cash a thousand euros if you have it i need to impress him that i cut a deal with mr cadet she went to a safe in the wall keyed in a combination then fingered her way through a pile of bills and handed them to me it felt human again to not be pretending to be someone i wasnt to not be with scum like piet i wanted to savor the moment eliane was like a cool mom for people on the run and just like a mom eliane looked at me as though my thoughts were written on my forehead we have jobs to do go she was right i hurried back down the stairs piet had found a corner table and was sitting in a sullen funk wolfing his beer i sat down and slid him a hundred euros he blinked at me cadet owed me some money i said and gave me an advance on the next job this wasnt worth the stop it was to me piet i gestured at the waitress i had to give eliane time to find the van plant the goods where he wouldnt see them jimi hendrixs purple haze began to play on the speakers not louder than the talkers but enough to impart the necessary funky vibe to the suitinfested pub i saw piet lean back slightly and let the feel the groove of taverne chevalier ease into him it had been a long hard day the mind the body wanted to relax let the adrenaline burn itself out we ordered the specialty thick ardennes ham sandwiches but piet downed another beer in four long gulps and said no coffee please when the waitress asked if we wanted another round i agreed coffee get the sandwiches and coffee for takeaway please piet said no i said i am sitting here like a human being and having my dinner i leaned forward and made my voice a hiss i got grazed by a bullet and lost blood today piet i jumped onto a truck if i want to eat here were eating here were taking a short break how much did he still need me i could see him weighing the balance by the way he glared at me he could get up walk out force this to a fight shoot me in the darkness of the parking lot where wed left the truck and the van leave the van behind the stop had raised his suspicions hurry eliane i thought i couldnt risk a glance at my watch or the clock he watched me a hard awful light in his eyes so i took refuge in my beer some of the suitsmen speaking in hushed germanpushed past our table making their way to their own piet scowled i hate these suits rule makers they think they run the world all they do is set up walls and rules and then argue amongst themselves about what those walls will be men like you and me we tear down the walls i said i couldnt help thinking of my first few months in london lucy and me sitting in a wine bar on the side of paternoster square in the soft light of the old city happy to be together and excited to be doing good work good work had been my familys specialty and my familys tragedy i had killed now to stay alive and i wasnt worrying about it but i wouldnt have wanted to describe those moments to my father or mother my own life had marked me with my own permanent stains the damned blood that didnt wash off the guilty hand eh tear them down they build them back up he fell silent as the waitress set coffee down in front of us well take our food to go miss he told her but no sam his voice was like a knife i dont like this bar i dont want to be here a moment longer after im done with my coffee this wasnt a fight i could win and i knew now that the closer we were to delivering the shipment to edward the more piet would seize command this was his deal i was a replacement player fine let him think i was cowed all right piet but i didnt really hurry youve got time to finish your coffee he said i need to make a call stay here and he stood up and left the table stepped outside the taverne chevalier panic inched up my bones if he was running i would lose the only thread i had to edward and to yasmin and to whatever happened to lucy i couldnt see him on the front window of the bar my gut said hes dumping you follow him the waitress placed the bag with our order on the table i slid her money and got up from the table i stepped out from taverne chevaliers front door piet stood twenty feet away closing the cell phone staring at me i raised the bag of sandwiches are you ready to go yes he said come here sam i did and he pushed me along the street then into the barely lit doorway of an art supply shop what youre going back to art school and need supplies hands on the door why whats wrong he ran probing hands along my legs my arms searching to see if i had anything i shouldnt have had he pulled the wad of euros from my pocket thats enough i dont have a phone i dont have a weapon youre really getting our partnership off to a great start after i saved your ass give me my money he pushed the wad back into my hand there sorry he added almost as an afterthought i pretended to be angry i pulled your ass out of the fire i found you the lings shipment i took the bigger risk today if someones not going to trust someone maybe it should be me not trusting you perhaps he said i think you think im not as smart as you as tough as you he was threatened by me id jumped onto a moving truck and hijacked it stupid this was about machismo come on lets sit here and eat if the bars making you nervous i dont like cold food i had to give eliane time to return otherwise id have to pretend id lost the van key in the tavern and wed have to come back and his suspicions would skyrocket he seemed to feel a bit guilty about his rant so we sat on a bench on the road and ate our sandwiches i saw a vaguely female form race around the corner on a scooter i could tell it was eliane and hoped that piet couldnt he seemed engrossed in his food though hunger winning out over the desire to make time i need to go to the bathroom i said when the sandwich was done me too he said i wanted to go back in alone i needed that van key eliane was behind the bar drawing a beer she glanced up caught sight of me but gave no sign of recognition piet was close behind me we both went into the bathroom i finished first and stepped back into the hallway eliane was three feet away and she brushed by me calling out orders to the barkeep she pressed the key into my hand and it was in my pocket a moment later piets hand clapped me on the shoulder youre right a break helped i got new life lets get going we walked out into the darkness the laughter and music of taverne chevalier fading as we headed down the avenue he kept his hand on my shoulder in my pocket i worked the key back onto the ring so back to amsterdam his phone call had to have been to edward now that we had the cigarette shipment to camouflage his military gear yes were meeting edward and his people well get the shipment ready with their goods and on its way to rotterdam and then well get paid and you and i will go celebrate how long do we have until the meet three hours all right i said the parking lot was in sight i could see the truck the van parked next to it nearly there within three hours i would either be dead or id have killed piet and the kidnappers and found yasmin and have edward talking to me about where my wife and child were you know sam he said youre right you have proved yourself more than once here you drive the truck i stopped no not what i wanted no thats fine you drive it i said no you drive the shipment as a sign of trust in our partnership i felt a chill settle into my bones either he was being sincere or hed seen the key passed from eliane to me trust or suspicion i still needed him i didnt know where the rendezvous was and if i showed up without him id never get inside fine whatever let me have the truck keys he dug them out of his pocket and traded them for the van keys just follow me he said what if we get separated in traffic we wont he said i got into the truck maybe that was all this was he was tired of driving the truck maybe that was all it was but the phone and the weapons were now out of my reach and once we got to the rendezvous point there was no need for me to go near the van i was still heading defenseless and alone into the snake pit amsterdam well past midnight the night was a mirror of the city the lights of amsterdam reflected in the sky by a sprinkling of stars peering through the tracery of clouds it was not a city that ever slept deeply or soundly too much business in amsterdam needed the night i followed piet there would be ten of them including edward if the count in the group in the video held true wed have to meet at a place with privacy for the weapons to be repackaged with the cigarettes some of the gang would be dispatched to unload the cigs another group would probably be inside the facility guarding whatever edwards prize was that division of targets might make it easier for me but not for long yasmin would be held separately i guessed i should be able to make a sweep and not worry about her in the cross fire dont you need a gun a little voice chimed in that was i told myself only a temporary problem piet drove to the southern edge of amsterdam and stopped at what appeared to be an old brewery an unweathered sign announced in dutch that the brewery was closed for renovations another truck was there unmarked next to it was an audi sedan and i felt my heart jump the silver audi id chased through the streets of london with edward and lucy inside different license plate but i recognized the scuff on the back bumper where hed scraped through the jammed street to get away he had taken my wife and i was close to him now i felt a primal rage rise in me the raw anger we like to think was banished with cave fires and wall paintings but i couldnt be angry i had to be cold thin lights flickered in the windows they were here this was it time to live or die piet had already walked back to the truck as i got out van keys please i said why i left my smokes in there i didnt know you smoked well i do i said well hell you got a whole truck of cigs right there i dont feel like opening crates fine go get them and he pressed the van keys into my hand i turned and went back to the van he went around the back of the truck presumably to open up so the unloading could start go i could only guess where eliane had hidden the gear under the drivers seat they took your wife and your child be cold i made a show of searching the seat for the cigarettes in case piet was watching then i put my hand under the vans seat nothing i leaned over groped under the passenger seat nothing no way eliane would have hidden it under the back seats i glanced into the emptiness of the van and felt the barrel of the gun press against the back of my head you tried to fool the wrong guy piet hissed stupid move what the hell are you doing i asked your guns your phone your little devices the phone went off someone in amsterdam trying to call you why do you have this stuff i didnt answer him and he pushed the barrel of the gun harder against my head to protect myself from me no from them them i turned to look at him he kept the barrel on my face so that the gun slid along my cheek settled below my eye edward and his people what do you think theyll do to us the moment weve delivered the goods theyll kill us man they dont need us anymore were two and theyre what a dozen they wont hurt us edwards not just a smuggler piet i know who they are the people who blew up the train station his face went pale how the hell do you know who are you peter samson just like i said my friend at the bar got me the gear i said i didnt blink i didnt look concerned because old piet had tipped too much of his hand confronting me outside if you are heading toward a rendezvous with very bad criminals and you think you have a spy on the inside coming with you and you have brought said spy close to said very bad criminals it might be a very bad idea to let the very bad criminals know that you have put them in grave danger of exposure so i figured he hadnt said a word in warning to edward all this cut through my mind in seconds along with the realization that edwards team having heard the low rumble of the trucks arrival should be stepping out of the old brewery within seconds i didnt have time for piet anymore arent you going to shoot me i said i want to know who you work for he said his life depended on information now hed brought the spy close now he needed to know who i was it was the only way to redeem himself with edward and his people tell me god damn it or ill kill you i said nothing who are you he raged and then he took the gun off me because he remembered he had a better way to hurt me he pulled out the wakizashi from under his jacket lifted the blade he stepped back to launch his swing he wanted to scare me to have me know i couldnt stop the sword from opening me up so he stepped back too far and he gave me room he slashed the wakizashi toward me with a singing hiss i pivoted and blocked it with a kick the blade went halfway into the thick sole of my work boot his melodramatic toy of a weapon stuck for one sweet second he was so surprised he didnt know what to do so i grabbed the handle of the van for leverage and kicked him with the other foot my work boot caught him hard on the chin and he flew back teeth flying lip splitting i landed on the asphalt awkwardly one leg i yanked the wakizashi loose from the thick rugged sole and advanced on him i pointed the tip at his groin his front teeth were gone he tried to skitter backward on the pavement no please i yanked him to his feet put the blade at his gut he let out a brokentoothed mew of surprise he thought i was going to eviscerate him then i heard the brewery door open the van was between us and the doors i slammed a fist hard into his bloodied mouth and he crumpled i hurried into the van crawled to the back the gear was there where hed tossed it i pulled out the two glocks one mounted with a silencer the explosive charge the cell phone i heard footsteps skittering on the pavement at least two people i wished it were more piet a mans voice called then in dutch hurry up edwards pissed were going to be behind schedule they stepped into my range in the intermittent light of the moon one of them saw piet lying on the black of the pavement he rushed forward the second man was smarter stopping then falling into a protective crouch gun at the ready through the barely open back door of the van i shot the first one in the knee i have always heard that the pain is excruciating the silencer made a quiet hiss he fell with a raging howl clutching at his leg i shot the other one standing over piet in both knees he dropped his knees hit the pavement i slammed a fist into his throat and he went silent i kicked the first guy hard and he went quiet too two down i ducked out of the van and ran for the door it had been propped open oddlyand i didnt like anything that suggested oddity right nowthe large bay doors to the brewery remained closed with the truck here i expected them to be opening in greeting i didnt want to be caught in the open i hung at the lip of the parking lot door no sound no voicesonly a distant murmur i risked a glance the old brewerys entryway was empty dimly lit by fluorescent lighting concrete floor brick walls high grimy windows i smelled the soft waft of sausage and pizza i rushed the door beyond that was a brick hallway of old offices most of the doors shut one door open faint light gleaming from inside i could hear voices speaking in dutch youre cheating a mans voice young rough you cannot cheat on a computer game a womans voice you know a trick knowing a trick isnt cheating whiner the woman said laughter from more people i stepped into the doorway five of them four men and a woman sat with their backs to me hands holding video game controllers a fictional bloodbath erupting on the screen they were killing nazis in the computergenerated rubble of berlin the room wasnt so much an office as a big storage room and i saw a large heavy metal door hey assholes i said game over not a brilliant line but i wasnt thinking witty they all did this little jerky dance of surprise jerk freeze stay frozen the woman demii recognized her from the house piet had taken me towas closest to me and i pulled her close she stiffened with terror they dropped the game controls and behind them on the screen i could see their players immediately fragged by an ss squadron i put the gun against demis head drop the weapons slowly three of the guys had guns in the back of their pants id seen them when they stood up two of them obeyed the third a muscular youth with a hateful glint in his eye took his out and hesitated you wont get away with this he said i remembered his name freddy do you want to die seriously drop the gun he didnt and i needed an example so i shot him in the knee too all his bravado evaporated as he screamed and fell he also dropped his gun okay then i said i kept my voice steady i want yasmin zaid and edward where are they none of them answered if you dont know youre useless to me i let the guns aim go to the next guy past the vat room demi said in a hoarse whisper down to your left theres an old wing of offices shes guarded how many others here her lips tightened do you think i wont shoot you because youre a woman get over yourself i said how many others here i knew they werent pros when demi said five and freddy gasped twelve and more coming at the same time i believed demi god i hoped she was right that metal door i said open it one of the men obeyed freddy yelled dont help him dont do you want to dance again i said shut up he went quiet i could see insideit was a cold room like a giant refrigerator cell phones on the floor empty out your pockets they obeyed five cell phones hit the floor i gestured them inside with the gun then slammed the door and locked it five more and i didnt know if that included edward i continued down the hall the main brewery floor was dark thin light gleamed from up high i could see the squat bulks of six old copper vats concrete flooring separated them a catwalk encircled the square of the floor up high a few rooms and offices above the catwalk the walls were white tile i heard footsteps approaching above me on the catwalk a man with an assault rifle buckled across his chest you walk on a catwalk you tend to look down through the metal mesh he saw me he opened fire i ducked low behind a rounded vat and the shots drumming the copper sounded like a jangling of cymbals i could see in the distance on a halflower level a long wall with a metal rectangle the bay doors that was where most of them would have been i thought when the fight began waiting to do the work of the loading if i stayed pinned down here theyd rush me i climbed inside the vat it was low and dark and the singing of the bullets made it sound like crawling into a gong the catwalk formed an l shape over the opening i waited the rifleman stopped shooting he was looking for me not wanting to waste bullets and he had thought i would just hide behind the vat i listened for the soft scrape of his feet above me and threw myself into the opening firing into the space between the flooring and the railing he jerked and then he fell to the catwalk i didnt know if he was alive or dead but he was down and not shooting at me but all surprise was gone now i ran into the loading bay area jumping over a railing dropping to the concrete floor i saw a man running toward me raising a pistol two more men following him old pallets of bottles sat to my right and i dodged behind them gunfire exploded the tops and shattered sprays of glass splinters and stale beer fountained above my head three to fight i went still i had a glock in each hand piets wakizashi tucked in my back belt and an explosive charge in my jacket pocket the gunfire stopped an awful echoing silence filled the room the smell of cordite of old beer i could hear a hissed argument in dutch you go no you go cowards daring each other to find some courage i thought of the people theyd helped kill at the train station i tried to calm my mind think of efficiency like running along the edge of the building in parkour find the line one called out in dutch throw down your guns you cant get out i moved as quietly as i could to the corner of the large pallet id hidden behind i raised the glocks aiming down each corner from the beer pallet no sign that anyone was coming behind me on the far side of the huge room i heard a muffled scream from a woman yasmin i didnt have time to wait the three stooges out the old pallets of beer were stacked in five long rectangles at one end of the dock space maybe forty feet between me and the external doors i could hear at least two voices two pallets away like a run to make break it down into steps then commit each action as part of a more fluid movement my mind shifted to a gear it hadnt been in since i tried to save lucy in london overhead a bay of fluorescents loomed i gunned the lights the room plunged into semidarkness the only light now came from the glow of the vat room yasmin screamed again i studied the room with a traceur s eye pallets to leap on railing to jump walls to bounce off i could try to use parkour to outflank them i wasnt sure how steady the pallets were and usually i ran with hands free not holding guns i saw movement to my left and i risked standing and firing a shot then fell back to the floor a babbling scream rose from the other side of the pallet i hurried down the passageway formed by the pallets suddenly glass crunched under my heels gunfire exploded around me from three sides in front behind me to my right surrounded i retreated left in the direction of the man id shot i could hear feet scrabbling around two closing behind me to cut off my retreat back to the vat room but i wasnt retreating they were only looking for me between the pallets if i wasnt where they expected i could gain a momentary advantage i did a standing jump and yank onto the fifteenfoothigh pallets and ran along the edge i saw movement to my right another guy rounding a corner where id been crouching twenty seconds before and i fired missed him he fired at the same time i did and i felt the bullet tear up through my jacket and score along the flesh of my back then heat hit my shoulder a sting that rose into agony below my feet bottles broke the pallet coming apart at the top the stack gave way beer flooded my shoes i knew if i tumbled into the mess id be cut by the jagged glass and an easy mark i jumped to the roof of a forklift looking down to see a surprised face hiding behind its bulk i fired wildly and the surprised guy went down bullets punching into his shoulders i jumped to the next pallet hit the wood and didnt look back the pain in my shoulder seared a warm throb of blood coursed down my back i was hurt i couldnt be hurt i couldnt i jumped off the stack and landed on concrete and one of the two had doubled back on his run i landed three feet in front of him he raised an assault rifle but he didnt fire drop your weapons he screamed i dropped both the glocks on the floor i went to my knees my hand twisted behind me for the wakizashi hands where i can see them my hand closed on the wakizashi s handle i turned the sword and it sliced through the thin leather belt i wore thank you piet for being bored for sharpening the sword while we waited in the rain outside the sweatshop for the lings truck if id pulled it free he would have seen it but i made my right hand dangle im shot in the arm i said i cant lift it he took a single step toward me who are you police yeah because the police come in one guy at a time i said dont be an idiot im not police i heard the crunch of glass behind me my feet were in shadow the only light coming from the vat room whoever was behind me would see the wakizashi any second who are you the first man yelled again two more steps from behind me the guy coming up behind me would see the blade in three two one i fell backward into the scattering of glass and rolled my jacket protecting me from the floor full of sharp edges the wakizashi swung through flesh down to bone on the leg of the guy behind me he screamed and the guy with the rifle froze in surprise i yanked the sword free from its mooring of flesh and swung the wakizashi back twisting to put the edge forward and slashed through the thigh of the man before me he bellowed and staggered back bullets spraying into the floor as he fell seriously are any of us prepared to be slashed with a sword no for an instant the pain must have been so hot and fresh in the mans mind that he forgot to shoot me thats the key you must ignore the pain i could hear someone else approaching god how many were there i kicked both the men unconscious i yanked the flash charge from my jacket activated it and tucked it under one mans arm i hurried on the other side of the pallet moving as quietly as i could ignoring the pain cmon i thought i heard footsteps one set closing fast spraying a panicky round of fire down the passageway formed by the pallets bottles shattered and beer gushed i heard someone kneel on the glasscovered floor murmur a name and then the light and sound burst like a little bright warhead a howl i hurried around the corner saw a manbut only onewrithing in the glass blinded and deafened by the flash bomb i picked up a beer bottle and smashed it on the back of his head and he went groggy a second kick to the face left him cold my shoulders hurt too much to try and punch a dozen id taken out a dozen i was barely on my feet still one still one more edward i checked my glocks empty one of the men had a gun with a full clip and i took it i crept out of the space between the pallets the glass from the beer bottles was like a signal every movement producing an audible crunch under my feet a terrible telegraphing of my position i moved as carefully as i could my ears rang from the concussive blast and i was bleeding freely everything hurt lucy the bundle yasmin the girl id been sent to save the key to the man who had stolen my family and my life focus dont give up now i heard nothing except the distant sobbing of the young woman she was valuable to edward maybe the orders were to guard her at all costs then i heard her voice rise into a scream i could hear the echo coming from a hallway to the right maybe edward had gone after her decided to make his stand close to his prize i tore down a small hallway gun extended ready to shoot any shadow yasmins screaming stopped i skidded into an old circular chamber lined with stone it smelled of wood and spilled beer and a more recent tang of gunfire the darkness was gray and blue and a sputtering light flickered at one side of the chamber three side doors the farthest one half open i heard a hushed voice inside murmuring i strained to hear the words dont be afraid just do as i say and all will be well a mans voice a low growl full of impatience and hate my father has sent someone else yasmins voice wavering please i inched closer to the door be quiet and it was edwards voice the voice on the tape the voice of the man who had stolen my wife hell come here soon enough damn straight anger and hate roared up into my head and i kicked in the door in the guttering light behind me i saw them him crouching over yasmin her mouth twisted in fear she sat on a bed and edward had positioned himself between me and her the scarlike a little question markgleamed by his eye he held a gun in his hands he started to raise it i needed him alive drop the weapon i fired and the bullet went just wide of his head he dropped the gun i didnt see fear in his eyes i saw a raw calculation kick it over here he obeyed he was a big guy broadshouldered muscled bigger looking than in the videos i stepped on his gun on the floor now hands on your head yasmin was crying edward obeyed scowling yasmin its okay your father sent me im getting you out of here come here she slowly inched away from edward he seemed to shackle her with his stare directed fully at her not at me i know you edward said as she slowly made her way toward me i know you too london his voice was a snake moving across stone he had a soft british accent the bastard smiled you ran very fast it was almost funny to watch you made me think of a spider with its web burning no place to go my wife where is she yasmin was halfway between us wiping tears from her eyes thats my sole value to you yes information where is my wife he laughed worth something to you i see knowing her final resting place are you afraid of knowing how she suffered my skin prickled cold no you tell me and you get to live even if ive killed lucy i still get to live edward laughed again i didnt like the laughter a man only laughs when he holds the upper hand do you mean the american woman yasmin stopped two feet short of me her hands clutching her elbows shivering in real life her voice was a bit higher than on the tape the american woman with the baby lucy yes my gaze jerked to her where is she i hollered i dont know where she is now she seemed to fight for control of her voice i dont know edward said you want to know where your wife is you let me and yasmin leave its the best deal youre going to get today sam i heard a footstep behind me in the doorway id missed one i turned and fired and the voltage hit me like a steam train slamming into my bones i fought to keep the grip on my gun but the shocks coursing along bones and tendons and spine like lightning made it drop from my grasp i fell to my knees i stared at the black leather boots in front of me i looked up lucy holding a taser every sound was a blasting roar in my brain every sight a nightmare i tried to slap the taser needles from my body but then i saw as if in slow motion her thumb work and the shattering surge hit me again her boot came back rocketed toward my head darkness part three april systems do collapse and are replaced by others the state is only here because people choose to believe in itbecause they trust its systems this then is the threat of crime to modern society not that it will overcome civilization with violence but that it will undermine trust in and thus the viability of the system carolyn nordstrom global outlaws piet tanaka opened his eyes and blinked away blood he took a hard shuddering breath the hiss of air over ruined teeth hurt so sharply he jerked up a weight lay atop him he shoved the form away a man one of edwards thugs shot unconscious piet pulled himself up from the concrete he could hear the shattering sounds of gunshots inside the brewery it was time to leave the job had gone very wrong he didnt care who was winning on the inside that fool whod tricked him so badly or edwards people he saw the vans keys stuck in the driversside door he lurched into the van started the engine and accelerated into the night when he realized his sword was gone he felt a feverish rage take hold of his heart sam you rotten bastard two kilometers down the road he had an idea he needed a safety net sam worked for someone fine sams bosses would want information they could hide him it was time to defect it had been a bar in brussels where the manager got sam his gear well sam had used another bar manager in amsterdam to establish his bona fides de rode prins the bars must be connected and there he could look for sams bosses to make a deal he blinked through the painhis tongue kept probing where his front teeth once were and his gums gave off a hard throband he headed for the prinsengracht the bar would be closed but he could break in find out who peter samson worked for pain from my head to my shoulder to my backforced open my eyes i slowly sat up everything hurt dried blood on my head my cheek drool stuck to my lips i was in a small stone room no bed file cabinets my shirt and jacket were hiked up then i saw lucy sitting across the room from me i blinked at her hello sam you cut your hair i said my voice sounded thick heavy broken im supposed to kill you she said five words to end a conversation before it started i could hear a trucks engine rumbling in the distance the plonking sounds of crates being moved i heard those sounds and i couldnt wrap my head around the words she had just spoken to me lucy i told edward i would take care of you but take care has a whole range of meanings lucy where is the baby my mind swirled with a thousand questions but that was the one that knifed through the shock sam youll die if you dont listen to me i looked at the flat of her stomach her dark blouse was neatly tucked into blue jeans where is our son hes not your concern sam hes my only concern now that i know what you are hello anger boiling up in my chest will you please listen monkey i am trying to save you her use of her old term of endearment made my stomach twist but i kept my voice steady you i dont even have the words for what you are youd rather argue with me than live what you are i know what you are now i said smarter quicker stronger richer you could try those on for size the woman i loved i thought i loved she sat there wearing the face and the body that i knew so well that id treasured she spoke with the voice that had murmured love into my ear she regarded me with the intelligence that sealed the deal to spend my life with her but she was a stranger i hadnt known her let me say that again i hadnt known her she had been a complete and utter lie and she had stolen far more than three years of my life the scale of the lie staggered me she had stolen my sense of who i was and what i knew in the world the marriage was done and i didnt even have time to grieve for it all this flashed through my head in a second not even in words just a coldness that covered me all right smart and rich i said where is our child dont you want to know why no ill ask and youll lie or you wont tell me youve done what youve done and thats it i said i dont understand it but i dont need to understand it i only need to stop you well thats not going to happen now she showed me a half smile the one when i used to tease her and shed tease back fine well play it your way tell me why youre clearly dying to i said you seem to have a reason for keeping me alive just to taunt me im not heartless sam i do have feelings for you you were a good cook good in bed thoughtful company you were a good husband i was good camouflage i said i was a good pawn ill bet you insisted to the company that i was innocent very chivalrous very naive no im just very good at fooling people she said an emptiness seemed to hollow out her words i got to unsteady feet my head rocking what is going on here lucy who are these people what are you doing sweet mystery she said im supposed to find out what you know and shoot you but i cant i cant just shoot you in cold blood sam i think i took a shambling step toward her and she raised the gun its not cold blood if you attack me then i do what i have to sam and i assume you dont want to die i stopped yes im glad i didnt wreck your will to live then i couldnt read the emotion in her face she wasnt smug despite her earlier words about being smarter and richer she looked unsure like she wasnt used to seeing consequences staring back at her i want to know where our son is you say nothing to the police to the company that im alive you dont mention me and in a week or so ill be in touch with you ill tell you what you need to know to find the baby you can have him just say you never saw me okay is the baby all right hes safe sam she glanced up at me a healthy beautiful boy we made us a good one she stood and i saw a swallow work her throat a silencer capped her gun i really need to go now so heres what were going to do i am going to leave you are going to be quiet and not make a sound edward and i will be on our way eventually the police will come and you will have to answer questions you keep my name out of itand ill know if you do or notand then ill let you know where the baby is mention me and youll never ever see him why would you let me live i stole three years of your life this is restitution her voice was unsteady the spouse always knows august had said that so had howell the spouse always knows when treason is in the house i hadnt thats not reason enough why she had to have another motivation one based on her own advantage dont be an ingrate lucy said i thought of our three years together how every word every action had been choreographed to protect her did you ever love me i asked i hated asking it didnt matter she didnt love me now any question was sentiment id lost years of my life as surely as if id been stranded on an island or walled in a prison the only thing that could matter was my child not my ego i must have youre still breathing she looked past my shoulder out the window and i heard the blast of gunfire she slammed the door locked it i staggered to the door i started kicking the lock trying to break it the gunfire stopped i looked out the window a van roared into the parking lot spilling three men out onto the pavement one of them was howell piet had parked his van on a side street and stumbled along the prinsengracht he remembered walking along the grand canals with his mother hand in hand before mama would go to her job kneeling before the disgusting strangers hed dreamed of living in one of these nice homes with the canal glistening in the morning light hed become a great artist and have a studio along the prinsengracht or the herengracht it had never happened and now it never would most of the windows were dark but the apartment immediately above the rode prins had every light blazing he staggered to the rode prinss front door what was the barmans name henrik he could ask for henrik maybe henrik was the manager maybe he lived above the bar the job had gotten too messy information on edward could buy him passage hed go someplace quiet like panama or honduras warm under bright skies and slack laws lots of girls there that could be shipped up to brothels in the states and canada hed start over you could always start over when you had good people skills heavy velvet curtains covered both the front windows and the door he knocked on the door once almost timidly he didnt want to attract police attention he didnt see that a small camera hidden in the doorway watched his moves he knocked again slightly louder and was very surprised when the curtain on the front door slid slowly open a woman stared at him through the glass and to his surprise he felt a shiver odd the night wasnt cold maybe he was losing blood samson sent me he needs help please the woman seemed to study him she was a nice little number maybe thirty but a bit older wasnt always a drawback blond hair petite through the pain he assessed her out of habit as though she might bring him value he remembered her now hed seen her in the bar before when he drank beer with sam a prime little number hed joked i dont know who samson is and the bar is closed she spoke with the very slightest muddle of some eastern european and british accent her words were hard and precise he liked the accent hed developed a taste for hearing broken english with slavic pronunciations usually in a begging scream he knew how to deal with slavic girls i dont care if its closed i want to see henrik or whoever runs the place i got information to sell he remembered the name samson had used at taverne chevalier in brussels roger cadet thats who i want to see whoever works with roger cadet what sort of information on who peter samson is chasing his names not peter samson the woman said now he really didnt like her tone a bit clipped and impatient bitch needed a lesson in respect he thought its just sam she said well sam whatthehellever he works with you right you and the people in brussels with the same bar can you make me a deal or not bitch she smiled at him yes i think i have a deal for you he lowered his voice to a hiss your boy is fighting some badasses right now he needs help and you want protection from those same people your type it is very predictable to me he didnt know what she meant he didnt care i got stuff of value she looked hard at him i am sams superior come inside she opened the door and he stumbled in she closed the door behind him and shut the curtains christ thank you can i get a drink she went to the bar poured a stiff shot of jenever he eased onto a stool and drank it down the alcohol seared his lacerated gums sam kicked my teeth out he sounded like a whiny child she stayed on the other side of the bar and poured him another yet you are here sam had backing you dont just show up at a bar and leave armed to the teeth he slammed the second one down warmth seeped through him my name is mila she said and im not offering anything in trade you will simply tell me where sam is piet spat blood onto the bar feeling nauseous nothings free in this world he poured himself a refill and gulped the jenever again pain is she raised a small black stick a baton it telescoped out to an arms length and she lashed it hard across his nose and mouth he screeched in agony as the jenever glass shattered in his face he swung blindly toward her and missed she vaulted over the bar and began to hit him with a precision that rivaled a surgeons delving past nerve and blood vessel to diseased tissue he felt his nose break on her second blow he lunged trying to close his massive arms around her pixies frame and she shattered his knee with a blow air vacated his lungs her fist closed around his testicles and agony replaced breathing then she hammered her forehead against his broken nose and he lay flat on the floor he opened his eyes a lock of her blond hair daubed with his blood lay between her eyes she was breathing hard do not move mila said do not raise your hands do not do anything except breathe and listen he gasped and he listened i know what you did to the women in the machinists shop she whispered i know i know what you are in the old days piet you would have been the captain of a slave ship or a nazi commandant whipping laborers to death you are cut from the same foul fabric i know what you are i know every inch of what you are he moaned and writhed his knee the thought that he might never ever walk right again scratched past the pain in his brain the bar has a concrete floor the walls are soundproofed none of that is an accident she said she ran the edge of the telescoping baton along his shattered knee you will tell me what i want to know or i will rape you with this baton a cold terror enclosed his heart he looked up at her and saw in a flash across her face all the women he had sold past her shoulder he saw the red prince in his portrait the splatters of paint marring his face he could see his own blood splatters low on the bars front do you understand me mila said yyes where is sam he babbled out the address of the brewery and directions she moved the baton toward his groin please please shut up you dont get to ask for please you dont get to ask for mercy those are human concerns and you are a human being in species only she stood he sobbed clutching his knee moaning in pain stand up she said i cant i cant you bitch it would take ten of you to make a real person you shot one of the moldovan girls in the calf when she fought you mila said i know she told me she managed to stand im just seeing if youre made as tough as those women were standor the baton goes up your sorry ass ten nine eight on two he was on unsteady feet shuddering in pain and rage listen he said its not my fault its just a business i had to make money my parents are ill shut up she said you are piet tanaka you never knew your father and your mother is a dead whore i dont care that you hurt right now no one cares you made your choice about life your whining bores me tears leaked from his eyes i told you i can provide information those girls you send to israel to britain to spain to africa they dont get mercy they dont get to cut a deal they dont get traded to the police they get used up and then they get killed they get raped two dozen times a day please piet tried again i think you need to know what its like to be taken into a dark room and know that you are only there to be used to be hurt to be treated as less than human piet grabbed the brass railing along the floor in front of the bar squeezing it in agony he sobbed she pulled a phone from her pocket and dialed a number hello nadia nadia was the name of one of the girls he remembered the redhead i have him he has a broken leg a broken nose and hes beat up good he cant get away from you he cant hurt you do you want me to bring him you all could do with him what you like a pause that lengthened are you sure it might make you feel better no all right then she rang off the women dont want to ever see you again i guess theyre better than you mila shrugged she closed the baton please please the women are also better than me she pulled a gun from the small of her back and she shot him in the crotch pain beyond imagination he screamed and writhed and howled and clawed at the concrete mila began to count leisurely oneamsterdam twoamsterdam threeamsterdam while piet sobbed and shuddered on the concrete when she reached eightone count for each young woman shed saved from himshe put a mercy bullet between his eyes he jerked his corpse hissed out a purring breath and lay still she didnt look at him again she picked up the phone and called henrik he answered on the third ring i need you to clean up a very serious mess use the dump site out past the airportand keep the bar closed today until you hear from me i understand henrik said she unlocked the door relocked it and hurried to her car arrowing onto the still streets she started to shake about five minutes out of town thinking of the dying mans terrified eyes a gaze that pled for a mercy she could not give do you think he ever thought of the womens eyes mila asked herself he never did ever let it go she did and she drove she wondered if sam capra was still alive if she would ever tell him what shed done she thought not i felt the lock give i pushed open the door my back was soaked with sweat i ran upstairs i could hear distant shots the men lay where id left them except for one he was by the wall all of them had bullet holes in their foreheads i ran up to the vat room the guard id shot on the catwalk was down by the stairs now bullet hole in forehead i stumbled up the hallway to the storage room the spill of cell phones still lay on the floor the video game had run its course showing an empty battlefield the steel door was partly open i pried it back the five id corralled into the freezer room sat slumped all of them shot dead at pointblank range i felt stunned edward had killed his entire team why i hurried back up to the loading dock area it smelled of blood and beer i could surrender to howell tell him about lucy and hope that he believed me if lucy was already gone i had no proof and howell would not let me escape again so no surrender i had to get out without being seen i heard the back door crashing open i ran or rather i half stumbled half ran i darted through the wide open rooms ran past the dead men a window in the brickwork faced an empty field and a slightly decrepit windmill first one id seen since getting to holland i pulled myself up to the window worked the lock shoved it open stop sam capra howells voice rang out like a bolt from the blue i stopped i shouldnt have but i did i looked behind me and he had a gun leveled at me two men behind him glocks aimed at me step away from the window sam she was just here i said lucy she was just here step away from the window and well talk about it he said he wanted me alive you dont believe me i said i know she was just here i came here to rescue a hostage they have and lucy is with them you were right i was wrong howells voice was stone lets talk about it sam come tell me what you know and well find her i looked at him in his pressed perfect suit and his steelrimmed glasses and his stage actors voice i hated him im going to find her myself shes alive she lost the baby i didnt want him asking about my child just come down sam they were going to shoot me that was my last invitation how did you know where i was he nearly laughed our informant in the ling organization wasnt happy you robbed their shipment she called us we tracked the truck with a gps device the lings keep hidden inside the cab i can guess how you found out about the lings august went for a long walk the other night didnt he he shook his head you should be ashamed ruining your friends career get down from the window sam or ill shoot you in the back i considered my options get shot or throw myself through the window or surrender none were good he would not let me escape from him again id be bound and tied and kept with a pistol to my temple and not given a mockery of a life in brooklyn id be back in that prison that wasnt supposed to exist the plaything of howells special projects group inside the company i got down from the window i staggered and i put my hands in the air and the three of them closed in on me with fists and guns they cuffed my wrists they shackled my ankles and they dragged me to their van they shoved me inside howell sat across from me he briefly examined my injuries his fingers probed my head my back my shoulder well sam youre a mess then he told his two puppies to start processing the scene the van door slammed closed we were alone i need a doctor i said i enjoy stating the obvious youll get one if you cooperate how did you know august was in holland i saw him when i stopped a guy from shooting him at that machinists shop i said i stopped those psycho twins from shooting you too and youre welcome i could smell my own blood sticking to the clothes on my back my arm my injuries were untreated id been tasered and then tranquilized my limbs felt heavy and awful and disconnected from bone and tissue august got sent home because he was hurt im glad i think he would have affected my judgment regarding you he is actually your friend useless as that position is to him i can explain all this sort of listening i took a painful breath ive been undercover kind of governments and police agencies give cover you pretending youre someone else is just breaking the law sam sort of kind of please i want to talk to langley this guy edward that took lucyhes moving illicit weapons of some sort is that who shot at us as we arrived yes i dont know was it a truck we didnt see a truck leave a man in an audi shot at us as we arrived audi thats him please take me seriously call the ports but edward wouldnt use rotterdam not with this heat hed move the weapons out of france or belgium or spain here i can tell you what was in the ling shipment you can stop it call langley get authorization ill talk to them maybe langley doesnt want to talk to you sam maybe langley just wants you to go away and stop being a giant pain in the ass i swallowed what i said about lucy is true please she was here he raised a hand im going to offer you a deal sam i want you to consider it carefully because right now your life is in my hands in a way it never was before i dont like your answers i put a bullet in your brain and were done i have permission to do whatever i need to do to you the company wont let you execute me they want to know what i know they want the connections ive made here they want information and i have it the company doesnt know that i have you yet sam right now you and i get to write our own history you were found in a building full of dead bodies the woman and one of the menthey have tattoos like the guy in brooklyn who tried to kill me novem soles you asked me about it well here they are he stared at me ran a finger along his chin and you killed them all no edward killed them because he didnt need them anymore howell folded his arms and he looked at me with a glare i had not seen on his face since i had been his prisoner in poland i think youre the sole survivor sam but i think these people were your colleagues i think they helped you blow up the london office and i think they helped you escape me in new york the guy in brooklyn could have brought you your money and papers to escape and you killed him to keep him quiet he tried to kill me these people sent him to kill me and then i wondered edward or lucy it had to be edward whod dispatched the assassin lucy had let me live twice and wheres the lovely mrs capra she tasered me and she left look at my chest ive got the taser rash he opened my shirt and inspected the needle marks so she works with these people goodness after all those months you kept insisting on her innocence his tone was mocking im a good husband i said you dont assume your wife is a traitor or a criminal i saw her taken by edward she saved my life twice i think you were both working with this group gang whatever i think she turned and then she turned you i tend to go for the simplest explanation thats because youre simple i said life isnt this isnt i dont understand why lucys done what shes done wheres your baby i looked at my knees i didnt know what to say i didnt want him to know shed offered me my child for silence a silence id already broken so i looked up and said lucy lost the baby he studied my face for a long time where is lucy where will she go i dont know but im going to find her and im going to find out the truth i said uh no youre not howell said i swear bureaucrats have a smug voice they save for moments like this ones they can savor yes i am look howell if i was guilty and i was caught id be cutting a deal i dont want your deal im not going to confess to anything i havent done put away your knives and your waterboards because i will never confess to what i havent done ever all i care about is finding lucy convince me sam tell me the whole story of whats happened since new york and maybe i can help you find her who got you off the boat whos been funding you and supplying you i cant you helped a man escape who fired on me and my men i didnt shoot at you i killed men firing on your agents they used to give medals for that he grabbed my shirt and slammed my head against the vans wall it hurt my body felt wracked with pain i want the whole truth sam everything why dont you believe me why why i screamed into his face why dont you even try to believe me spittle from my mouth sprayed his face he leaned back i fought for calm pain wracked my body id been beaten shot and the implacable doubt on howells face made me blind with rage he just stared at me why arent we at a company safe house i asked why arent you recording what im saying in front of witnesses where are the dutch intelligence agents none of this is protocol pot meet kettle he said sam you have no place to lecture me on right and wrong the whole company is going to know soon enough that you are a traitor the word was like a lash against my skin im not a traitor you want me to believe you then tell me everything i blew out a long hiss of air i had to give him more to get to a position of strength this edward used the centraal station bombing to kill the money czar we were investigating in london a supposed financier for criminal networks the biggest ones that connect back into government i dont understand why edward killed this man but he did i said hes smuggling contraband bad stuff into the states and he needed that shipment i stole as camouflage for whatever hes shipping it could be a bomb it could be plague it could be people i dont know i could have found out if you hadnt interfered lets say youre telling me the truth and that you are innocent how did you find these people sam how did you learn about them how do you know any of these details who helped you find this edward who got you into holland it was the wrong question realization bolted into my bones dont you care about what his operation is i dont believe a word you say until you tell me who has been helping you where is your curiosity about edwards shipment first things first he pushed a photo at me me and mila at the train station in rotterdam then another one at the train station in amsterdam who is this woman i pretended to frown at the photo someone who rode on the train with me i dont know her you do we questioned a conductor on the train you traveled together you sat together and talked oh her yes lovely face but horrible breath i offered her an altoid that was the extent of our interaction bull where have you been staying in amsterdam in hostels cheap paying cash im young enough to look like a wandering grad student which hostels let me get this straight i said i have just told you that the guy who bombed the london office is smuggling seriously dangerous goods into america and you want to know what hostel i stayed at if he can smuggle this stuff in its because you provided him with the camouflage howell said what ive caught you doing is helping this guy i heard a noise outside like a man falling against the side of the van and sliding to the pavement a yell howell whipped out a pistol aimed it at my head im tied up i said im not the threat he moved the gun away from me and i hammered my foot hard into his jaw i hope i broke it because i was really tired of hearing him talk shutting up for a long while would do howell a world of good he slammed against the side of the van and i launched myself toward him my hands useless and bound behind me but i didnt care i wasnt rational i just wanted him to shut up and listen to me i wanted his silent belief i hit him hard with my head pounded my skull upward to catch him under the jaw he gurgled and a freshet of blood oozed from his mouth i rocked my head into his and he went down i lost my balance and collapsed on top of him the van door opened and i expected to see one of his puppies there mila finally i said she sliced my plastic restraints off and i helped her put the two company guys into the van both were unconscious but not seriously injured she slammed the van doors shut locked them tossed the keys into the field behind the brewery we got into her car and she gunned it toward amsterdam the day was going to be a cloudy gray one it matched my mood thank you i said you are welcome she sounded weary how did you find me your friend piet piet is not my friend piet came to the rode prins he was panicked he thought he could trade information for sanctuary for whoever you worked for and piet talked piet talked now her voice was cool iron is piet still talking piet is done talking what did you do to him such concern for the rapist and the slaver my concern is not for him my concern is for you i put my hand on hers she shrugged it off dont worry your bloodied and beaten head about me sam im fine never felt better you killed him he needed killing she raised an eyebrow did you find this edward did you find yasmin i found my wife milas resources included a doctor i woke up in the bed in the apartment above the rode prins with an old man poking at me he was bald and frowning and his breath smelled like hardboiled eggs youre a wreck young man he said to me yes in more ways than one i thought but id sooner die than admit that i stitched and bandaged your head and cleaned out your shoulder the muscle will be sore you should rest it the back injury required several stitches like a furrow it was so drink fluids rest i leave you some pain pills do not abuse them he turned to mila and said i know you are no nightingale woman make sure he rests he extended a finger but did not wag it mila nodded the doctor packed a bag and scooted an array of medical equipment back into the storage room i watched him rather i stared off into space and thought about what i was going to do now are you hungry mila asked henrik made potato soup its very good im mostly thirsty she brought me cold water and i drank it greedily i felt like a bus had hit me then backed over my body several times just to ensure a high level of misery i drank more water and then yes i was hungry and i ate a huge bowl of the potato soup dotted with gruyere cheese and with bits of ham mila watched me eat and said nothing but she was mila and she waited until my spoon scraped the bottom of the bowl i am sorry sam she said it like the words tasted funny in her mouth i know you are can you tell me all that happened i explained mila listened in silence when i was done she said so your lucy is a traitor she is i said the canal outside was very quiet i listened to my own stupid heart still beating okay she was a traitor to me to her country okay i had to deal id heard the words for months from howell and even from august and i hadnt believed them i hadnt wanted to believe them no fool like a fool in love i dont mind calling myself a fool weve all been fools at some curve in our lives but i had been so sure that i knew her why didnt she kill you i thought even weak in bed that i could go downstairs and rip the beer taps from the bar smash every window knock down the brown walls my rage felt like strength enough even with the pain in my body and my head why didnt she kill you that was the question that defied both brain and heart she could have put a bullet in my head and why hadnt she let me die in the bombing in london no way that she loved me that entire life had been a cheap fiction sold with great competence and warm smiles and teasing kisses and long shuddering nights joined at hip and heart why did she leave you alive mila said as though she could see my thoughts hovering about my head there has to be a reason i said your child she has hidden him somewhere if i keep quiet to the company that shes alive shell call me and tell me where he is i kept my voice steady sam my employers and i we can help you perhaps to find your child shell never call my son is her shield were not done she and edward took yasmin i am going to find her where i am going to call the company and alert them and alert customs maybe theyll find edwards shipment they have the resources howell didnt believe me someone will maybe august holdwine try if you like but this edward is no fool hell disable the gps trackers there will be entirely new manifests for those cigarettes there will be no way to trace them their crates will be labeled as an entirely different product now customs wont shut down rotterdam on what theyll consider a prank call and if the company believes you to be a traitor theyll think your warning is simply a lie or a diversion your friend will be trumped she was right howell was a lot more interested in whod helped me than my phantom shipment hes after a group called novem soles i think he thinks youre it did you speak of me no never she stood i didnt think you would i am glad i dont have to kill you well im glad too mila rest now like the doctor said i closed my eyes i kept thinking in all the spin of information that i now had that i was missing some vital elementa fact or an insight worming its way through my brain that could provide an answer it all went back to london the bombing to protect the man that edward himself later murdered somehow that was key work id done in london was worth all this grief to edward and his people i will for a bit but were going to london why london i want to see zaid he put us on this job and ever since hes been avoiding us and he knows more than hes ever been willing to share he gave edward weapons to smuggle now that the shipment has reached edward maybe zaid is supposed to get yasmin back so we go to zaids unannounced surprise him i will have to see your bosses wont approve is zaid one of your bosses she walked over to the table set the glass on it no but he is connected to them who am i working for mila me i think ive fought hard enough for you to deserve an answer i could have given you to the company i didnt i wouldnt you might do anything to get your child back she raised a hand before i could interrupt her sam you work for me lets leave it at that if you wish to stop working for me you may rest here for however long you need until you feel ready to leave and we will not bother you if you do not bother us you have resources i need to find my child i said that is an uncomfortable truth for you i looked out the window you dropped out of sight for a while mila i was busy how are the women theyre safe well get them back to their families or find a place thats safe for them im glad you helped them but you could have let the police handle them i needed your help i could not let the police handle it she said i needed to the police deport them they just go back to moldova where they could be targeted by the recruiters and the traffickers for revenge such has happened before they need protection them and their families i had to arrange that i understand i closed my eyes i am going to find bahjat zaid i am going to go to london in the morning either you can arrange the travel or ill risk using one of my forged passports and getting picked up at the airport or the ferry howell will be looking for me get me into england if youre so clever you wont give up will you i have a child to find i cannot give up mila my kid is to me what those women were to you innocents who cannot be abandoned i cant stop she got up and closed the door i sat in bed and i swallowed one of the pills the doctor had left and then i fell into dreamless sleep monday in london gray bleak the sky smeared with rain my body hurt but not as bad as yesterday id slept the rest of the day until early the next morning gotten dressed in new clothes mila brought me and wed taken a private jet to london very posh milas deeppocketed employers must have given us the okay to chase down bahjat zaid she used one of the new passports for me and there were no problems with immigration mila had a jaguar waiting for us it was strange to be on british soil where id been happiest where id faced the worst day of my life zaids office was near the bank of england museum in a modern tower mila and i were dressed casually slacks shirts jackets i wore a dark cap to mask the bandage on my head zaids secretary at militronics gave us a chilly smile mr zaid is not available the secretary said he was called away on a matter of urgent import i glanced at mila urgent import she said do you really talk like that the secretary frowned perhaps if youd care to leave a message you tell him that sam and mila came by to talk to him about his daughter we know where shes been the secretarys frown deepened he left to go see his daughter sir she said but i will relay the message when did he leave about ten minutes ago we left we stood on the busy street corner yasmins contacted him i said or theyve finally worked out an exchange mila said we need to find where hes at because if theyre delivering yasmin to him then lucy and edward are there we walked back to the jaguar you drive she said i got behind the wheel and she opened the glove compartment a modified netbook wired into the cars satellite system lay inside she slid it out opened it and began to type furiously on the small keyboard there are cameras all over london she said for traffic and security we have limited access to the grid lets find out if we can see when bahjat left she found a video feed that displayed the front of zaids building rolled it back to the time zaid stepped out of the building a mercedes was brought to the curb the driver got out zaid got inside he headed up princes street mila opened another window on the netbook found him turning onto gresham street followed him making a turn onto st martins le grand past the museum of london then it looked like she lost him she rechecked the video he was heading north on aldersgate street she tapped keys and a map of london appeared in the corner turning the camera stations shed tapped red so we could see his route through the city it was timeconsuming trying to spot his car in the press of autos backtracking when she missed it hoping he hadnt made a turn when the video feed wasnt snapping images a few more dots and she said hes gone to st pancras im a fool drive fast now come on whats at st pancras the eurostar arrives there the train from holland and belgium edward may have decided now to give yasmin back driving in london is often an exercise in madness and patience i drove like a man possessed this doesnt make sense say edward has decided to give yasmin back i said they could easily have asked for zaid to come to holland but they take the risk of moving her a kidnapping victim so they want something from zaid goods he couldnt bring to them sam she said if lucy is here with them and we catch them would you like me to kill her for you i know it may be hard for you to do so it was the single strangest offer i had received in a life full of bizarre opportunities thank you no i dont want you to harm her i will deal with lucy unwise i have no baggage with her to slow me i am worried enough if you are emotionally stable for this knowing she is a crazy loser bitch i wont hesitate if need be the words if need be are hesitation she said and she was right i want to talk to her the child forgive me i mean no cruelty but you dont even know if she had the baby sam you have no proof the child is alive i dont think shes lying about this shes lied to you every second of the day for the past three years now she tells the truth mila made a disgusted snort the tires lost their hold on the road hissed wetly as they grappled for the grip i eased up and the car regained its footing as we sliced through an intersection she could have killed me why would she spare me and lie to me a thousand reasons she wanted you found alive with all those dead people again you alive is a distraction for the company you attract blame and investigation she wanted to feed you false information she is cruel and she toys with you leave her to me you dont touch her mila i said you do not touch her i want to know where my kid is she knows then mila said the truest thing id heard in months your wife has made herself bulletproof to you with that lie sam you do not know that there is a baby anymore or that it is even yours its mine i said she lied about everything else perhaps she and this edward were lovers here in london thank you for the head screw then i made my words bricks slow and steadily added building a wall i have considered all these options long before you did i said i knew maybe shed fooled me maybe she was a traitor when i saw the evidence but it was all circumstantial she saved me then she saved me now she knows where my child is its the ultimate insurance policy and she wouldnt give that advantage away its only insurance if you believe her you cannot properly interrogate her i will i will get to the truth mila set her mouth in a firm line you are not much use to me if you are distracted by this loose end of your kid loose end i wondered what forge had formed mila that she could think such a way i was afraid to know i thought of her solicitude for the captured moldovan women back in amsterdam she could be kind she could be cruel i thought piet might have suffered mightily at her hands she might also be right lucy would dance a dance with me she would play on our past on the embers of my feelings for her on the obvious wish that i had that she had loved me mila would not dance i almost felt a tremble of fear for lucymisplaced and illadvisedthinking of her at milas mercy unleashing mila might be the quickest path to my child my child i didnt want to think about what mila was saying i had to know i couldnt walk away from the possibility of my child lost in the world or worse being raised by a woman like lucy capra lucy and mila were both willing to use my child to reach their goals i was willing to let them think they could use me but i would use them its an ugly world when we fight over children i veered the jaguar into a parking garage we were here st pancrasis a huge rail and underground station it has undergone a serious highcost beautification process in recent years massive pale blue steel arches sweep against original brickwork glass ceilings lend an air of openness in the concourse highend shops and restaurants fill the walkways a sign advertises the worlds longest champagne bar thousands of commuters and travelers moved through the station but i walked through st pancras alone mila stayed with the netbook in the car i had a microphone nestled in my ear she was watching bahjat zaid on the video feed having hacked into st pancrass security system we were running a big risk the security system might notice it was being invaded and a security team might decide to investigate if they discovered the hack was occurring so close to the station security was naturally heavyif not obviousat such a critical travel hub found him hes waiting at the champagne bar on the upper level mila said is he alone yes are you reading anyone watching him no i headed upstairs toward the impressive stretch of the champagne bar it was packed with beautiful people and a few tiredlooking travelers the bar ran for hundreds of feet broken only by waiter stations stretches of wood were designed for solo travelers to sit with their laptops other lengths were actually booths for four its far and only wall was glass and steel and it faced the eurostar station where trains from the continent arrived and departed zaid sat in a booth alone in his armani suit and his polished gleaming shoes and he looked as bent and as ill as though hed been consumed by a cancer the confidence id seen in him was gone he wiped a trace of sweat from his forehead and he kept a briefcase close to his legs very close i sat to his left where he couldnt see me so easily where a square bar formed the entrance and where the waiters nattily attired gathered their poured flutes and moved with grace back to the tables i stayed on the other side of the bar and hoped my sunglasses and the dark cap would keep him from recognizing me i ordered the cheapest glass of champagne on the menu but didnt touch it zaid kept scanning the crowd eagerly nervously he craned his neck around when groups walked alongside the eurostar waves of people came and went a crowd to my left was getting a bit loud fueled by a magnum of champagne zaid kept glancing toward them i turned away i couldnt risk him seeing my face do you still have him i said into the mic yes mila said into my ear hes nervous constantly scanning the crowd i cant risk him seeing me you dont think you should just go up and speak to him not if hes getting yasmin back edward could see me you are afraid of edward i am afraid hell kill yasmin if he spots me i said mila said nothing but i could almost hear her sneer i felt a tap on my shoulder i turned bahjat zaid looked as though he meant to stagger toward his death bed sweating pale mouth twisted into an angry tremble get the hell out of here he said you must leave now is edward bringing yasmin here i am ordering you to leave he hissed i know youve given edward weapons for keeping his videos of yasmins crime spree to himself are you swapping your snazzy briefcase for your daughter he looked as though he might vomit on my shoes leave now answer me and maybe i will i give them the bag they give me yasmin and this nightmare is done whats in the briefcase cash nothing more after all this they just want some cash what did you give them in budapest mr zaid what experimental weapons pure hatred came into his eyes your services are no longer required i will have my daughter back and she is safe no one can talk about her now they will be here at any moment they could be watching us now you being here may cost me my daughters life he so badly wanted to scream at me to punch me but he couldnt he couldnt draw attention to us you yell and bring the cops down on us and ill tell them everything your daughter has done since they grabbed her he stared i think he was too stunned that i was here or unsure of his next step you lied to me you lied to mila and when we needed you to help your own daughter you hid from us i did what was necessary if you ever wanted to help yasmin you will go now i took a tiny sip from the flute to show i had no intention of vacating my seat i might get up and leave or i might not cooperate and ill play along with you whos coming edward he nodded as though it cost him physical pain yes i was told you were dead then he wont be expecting me will he go back to your seat at the bar zaid youve got champagne to toast getting your daughter back shouldnt you be rushing her home i am taking yasmin to a psychiatric center where she can be cared for where she can forget all she was forced to do i wish you luck leave this is suicide for us both this edwardhe is both insane and calculating you cant beat him i beg you go sit yourself down right now my voice was cold and measured he retreated slowly unused to the idea that here was someone he could not get rid of he returned to his spot at the bar and sat down he made a production of not looking at me i moved to another part of the bar farther from the entrance and from zaid so i couldnt be easily noticed how much backup could edward and lucy have here i had to assume they had contacts to help them in london but if they were arriving on the eurostar what with yasmin in tow no yasmin would be squirreled away somewhere and zaid was trading the briefcase for that location did zaid signal to anyone else in here i asked into the microphone he could have his own security backup after all not that i saw mila said he wasnt taking any chances with his daughters life except that id changed the math twenty minutes passed champagne drinkers came and went friends met lovers toasted business types dealt a low constant murmur of talk broken by the happy pop of corks leaving bottles at velocity in my ear mila sang coldplay songs bored until i asked her to stop he kept a glass of champagne in front of him and another glass across the table zaid kept eyeing his watch as if willing yasmin to appear and then she did i saw her before zaid did she was walking unsteadily as though shed been doped edward held her arm he was almost holding her up half of yasmins face was hidden by a scarf i glanced around the bar there might be backup here but it wasnt zaids behind me lucy she sat at my booth and for one second i thought she would kill me where i sat you are a bad father lucy said i told you if you want the baby back off irony is wasted on you i said youre going to make things difficult for me arent you sam you dont know difficult dont open fire here sam so many innocent people not to mention expensive easily broken champagne bottles edward thinks im dead not anymore hes seen you you will let this exchange happen or i will never tell you where daniel is daniel the name cut like a knife our son i named him for your brother like i said we should i felt my heart shift in my chest dont interfere she said what is zaid giving you for his daughter now thirty feet away edward and yasmin approached zaid they stood by the booth facing him hes giving us lucy said everything hes worked for in his life you could learn a lesson here sam hes doing whatever it takes to protect his child back off and daniel will be yours yasmin blinked heavily the scarf hid the rest of her face zaid handed edward the case edward spoke softly and yasmin sat beside her father sagging into the booth edward remained standing stay in your seat sam and ill tell you where daniel is dont interfere lucy said edward turned and hurried away carrying the case zaid embraced his daughter she seemed very small in his arms she did not hug him back reunions are lovely lucy said and i wanted to tell her to shut the hell up you and your son can have a reunion too just stay seated she leaned forward plucked the tiny earpiece from my ear and crushed it under her boot who are you working with a crazy woman i only say that because now she cant hear us sam come with me daniel is very close i can give him to you now and then were done shed protected me twice before i so wanted to believe shed just give me my son that i know is the definition of both optimism and insanity i glanced back zaid still held yasmin heaving in the massive relief that his child was safe yasmin kept her scarf over the bottom of her face they sat perhaps waiting for edward to clear the area i remembered that no one knew yasmin was missing she nodded once in answer to words her father spoke tears ran down zaids face i can get you immunity i said you could negotiate a deal you dont have to keep running is that going to be your life now dodging and hiding immunity thats a laugh i made my choices sam i know that i heard a catch in her voice for the first time a prick of regret zaid held his daughters hand he picked up the champagne glass and drank it dry a nervous gesture yasmin stayed still as stone i couldnt imagine the levels of therapy shed need to get her life back lucy why would you turn your back on your whole world then on her wrist i saw the little sunburst inside the nine same as the thugs in holland same as my wouldbe murderer in brooklyn lucy my god i jabbed at her tattoo get up she said were walking out now i saw edward hurrying past a statue of a man in a windblown coat looking up at the glass ceiling as though expecting a storm then he had vanished in the mass of people heading downstairs i hoped mila was tracking him i wanted her to forget about me yasmin was safe we were up and walking i risked a glance back at zaid just after we passed and saw him jerk slightly as he set down his champagne glass cough he coughed again then yasmin eased out from the booth and hurried toward the entrance i stopped yasmin zaid didnt in her eyes was cool resolution she was hurrying past us not giving me or lucy a glance or glancing back at her father she went down the stairs the same way edward had gone i took a step forward and felt the gun rub up against my spine this way sam you want to see your son this way zaid still sat but his head had sagged forward no one around him intent on their bubbly on their laughter on checking their phones noticed i couldnt see if he was breathing or not poison i thought hes dead i said she killed him yes she said his own daughter what the hell has edward done to her this world where wives betrayed husbands where children poisoned parents i felt my chest go hollow edwards made her into his own you honestly dont want to know were walking sam a server stopped by zaid noticing his state knelt close to him and screamed your son lucy said your son like it was a prod to keep me going i walked farther down the concourse edward waited for yasmin she closed the distance between and his right hand closed around her wrist his other hand held the briefcase just stick to me lucy said as we went down the stairs and youll get your kid back no i wont i said and i turned and grabbed the gun she had set in my side under my jacket transport police swarmed past us hurrying to the champagne bar you shoot me now you wont have time to get away our lips were an inch apart like lovers saying goodbye at the train station in an old blackandwhite movie sam dont why cant you just walk away from them for your sons sake her voice begged i glanced down the stairs i could see edward and yasmin looking back at us at lucy and me locked together i took the risk i pivoted and grabbed lucys gun twisting fingers around the barrel forcing its aim toward the floor over lucys shoulder i saw edward drop zaids briefcase and raise a heavy oddlooking gun out from under his trench coat larger than a revolver it had a strange black section connected to it with a metallic grid pattern on it that looked familiar that gleamed for a moment in the bright light of the concourse the firing boomed loud and the heat of the bullet passed between lucy and me we both fell partway down the stairs but neither of us relinquished our grip on her gun in the stunned silence after the gunfire screams erupted all around us a choir of chaos edward fired again the bullet kicked the green stairs very close to lucys head and still fighting we tumbled down the rest lucy powered a fist into my face as we got up hard right below the eye i wouldnt let go of the gun let go or daniel is gone she screamed i didnt let go maybe theyll trade me you for him i said she hit me again as the crowd scattered no one looking at us so i tripped her yanking her backward over my leg she landed hard on the floor and kicked me in the thigh and i landed on top of her the panic in st pancras was now a fully fledged stampede hundreds of people running seeking cover if we lay here on the floor we would be trampled i yanked her to her feet the pistol was gone lost in the shuffle i didnt assume she was still unarmed you listen to me i hissed in her ear youre nothing to me now nothing and youre nothing to your friend because he just abandoned you and he didnt care if he blew your head off trying to kill me so im your only hope screw you anger and fear shredded her voice she tried to pull away from me but i was stronger and i was madder her face was white with shock that edward had risked killing her i yanked her to her feet wrenched her arm up between her shoulder blades in the stampeding panic no one accused me of being ungentlemanly we were swept out into the street by the crowd i pulled her close to me our faces as close as our wedding kiss if you try to run from me i will catch you and break your neck she shook her head then you wont get your kid back no youll be dead and ill still find my kid there is no place on earth you can hide him from me lucy do you understand i will never give up ever i will find him and you will be in a coffin her hand went behind her back i hadnt frisked her yet swept along by the sea of panicking commuters i saw the flash of steel in her hand knife short curved i dodged her swipe felt the blade nick my ear sam stop please just let me go so you can kill me i thought i powered a fist into her stomach and she folded dropping the knife i grabbed it whyd he try to kill you i said she was groggy and she stopped to dryheave along the sidewalk confusion and emotion felt like a storm blossoming in my chest id loved her crazy operasinging love beyonddeath love but to love her was to die at her hands now i forced down the swell of emotion i felt i dont know hes turned traitor on me she managed to gasp he doesnt need you i said this is almost funny you betray everything for this guy and he betrays you its rich i dont work for him who do you work for not edward we have the same boss she gave me a sideways glance i sensed the beginnings of a deal who the guy who made you get the tattoo i could see that the fight wasnt out of her yet you couldnt beat the fight out of lucy it had been one of the traits i loved about her i put the knife in her back under her jacket we walked i looked at her and saw tears on her face dont cry i said almost automatically i used to say it as a husband lucys tears a rare occurrence were always like nails in my flesh it wont work on me we were close to the parking garage i pushed her along she went why is he turning on you i didnt know yasmin would kill her dad she said she was just supposed to be returned in exchange for what the other part of the weapons the chips what weapons what chips she went silent making the point that she had critical information i needed i pressed on well yasmin just murdered her dad so i think this ransom this kidnapping was all a big fake she and edward engineered why i cant explain myself she said you think i can explain other people did she go patty hearst brainwashed into joining her captors its one survival mechanism to play along trust me i know lucy said shed just compared our marriage to a kidnapping i shook my head your charade is over i said yes but its another thing to kill your father or your husband i made them save your life here in london that was the deal youll regret it i said we hurried up the incline of the parking garage no she said i dont think i will her words made me feel cold because if she had daniel she had the trump card she had it all mila stood near her car watching us approach her expression was blank you caught her mila said congratulations hello lucy ive heard so much about you lucy studied mila i dont know you you will mila stepped forward and put plastic cuffs on lucys hands i pushed lucy into the backseat and sat next to her to keep her under control mila stormed the jaguar out of the garage and i explained to her the chaos that had carried us out of st pancras i have no idea where they would go mila said i lost them on the feed i know where theyre going lucy said quietly with you captured im assuming that their plans will change i said sams not dealing with you mila said youre dealing with me i told you sam daniel is close let me go and you can have him within a few hours i dont believe you you didnt know i was going to be at the station you thought i was in holland probably in a hospital bed you wouldnt have brought daniel with you no way youre carting a kid around while playing hired gun youve hidden him somewhere lucy and the deal is youre going to tell me or i will hand you over to howell and the company as a murderer and a traitor howell was entirely right about you kill me now then because i wont just tell you you have to let me go mila said you wont tell him but you will tell me shes charming lucy said but he wont shoot me little miss russia do you have a name by the way you can call me mila mila said i plan on beating you senseless by the way just so you know i will enjoy it shell talk without violence i said to mila is this where you thought you would end up lucy said i mean you joined the company because you wanted to avenge your brother now youre a hunted dog and you dont have your kid youve lost everything no i still have you i stared ahead into the traffic lucy said what will you do with me first you will tell us where edward and yasmin will go mila said sam shut up thats an order yes sam thats an order lucy said mila pulled the jag over in a screech of tires she launched herself toward the backseat and she hit lucy hard two snapping blows to nose and mouth blood gummed under her nostrils in the corner of her lips listen mrs capra mila said let us be clear as the crystal youre nothing to me you dont speak to sam unless i give you permission you are going to talk to us or i am going to kill you i doubt your superiors want me dead lucy said her voice a half scream blood dotted her spittle i have information to barter you do not understand who sam and i work for now i do not work for a government accountable to voters who do not bother to inform themselves on basic issues i do not work for an agency worried about budgets controlled by petty politicians my only rule is that i have to return the car clean she flicked a little smile i dont have to be a good example to anyone i dont like you i dont like what you did to my friend sam i dont like a woman who uses her child as a pawn you are an infinitely bad mother and an even worse person i know what i am lucy said through the blood on her lips and ill make a deal with you i will take you to where i think edward and yasmin will go ill answer your questions ill tell you where daniel is and your price for this jackpot mila asked you let me go when youve recovered edward and his goods which i promise you will be of great interest guarantee me that if sam says youll do it ill trust him cars honked madly mila veered back into the flow of traffic you have no reason to trust me i said yes i do i know you i know your word is good lucy looked at me and for a moment i could think we were back in our bloomsbury flat a young couple happy a baby coming in love you let her go and she cannot testify to the company that you are innocent mila said they will never take you back they will never stop looking for you a life on the run sam think long and hard about it are you going to drag your child along for the ride a tradeoff my child for my freedom at least this way i could find my kid see him hold him be a father lucy had to deal with me fairly or she was dead she knew it her game was over she wasnt going anywhere until i had my kid safe in my arms i glanced at mila she gave the barest of nods i leaned back fine cooperate and well let you go if you survive she said mila said where will they go new york she said we were to meet with my boss for what reason you get edward and youll know this boss your tattoo this is novem solesthe nine suns lucy nodded what is it a group that wants power and doesnt care how they get it i cant give you a single name though i dont know them but you got the tattoo they make you do that she shrugged its part of owning you they made me like they made me do everything else made you like you had no free will whats edward smuggling only he and zaid and maybe yasmin know i dont youre lying i have no reason to lie she said i dont know what it is where will they go right now to new york on the next flight i think yasmin will go home she said she and edward have unfinished business londons adrenaline bar occupied an old power station on the border between hoxton and shoreditch it was all open space and brick walls and a gorgeous long steel bar much bigger than its brothers the rode prins and taverne chevalier and the bartenders were serving actual cocktails precise with the measurements using fresh ingredients i saw a proper martini being mixed shaken is still the fastest way to chill and bruising the liquor is a myth a bull and bear made with genuine kentucky bourbon an excellent bottle of french bordeaux being opened the barkeeps had been well trained my kind of bar the tables were low and long and rustic more french farmhouse than elegant but cool looking i had thought given its name that it would be a frenetic dance club rather adrenaline seemed an ironic name a place where cool control would win the day more than frantic action we walked through it keeping hold of lucy by the arm it was easy for a moment to think about the loveliness of a proper bar rather than to think about my traitorous wife i liked the open space which somehow seemed warm and inviting bright forceful modern art and bold photographs hung on the walls all done mila said by local artists many of whom patronized the bar youll see movie stars here as well she said i have to do my damnedest to keep us out of the guidebooks so we dont go touristy i knew artists had reclaimed onceblighted hoxton for their own and the developers followed the artists quickly pricing most of them out of the territory theyd staked a large outdoor patio held sculptures and large blowups of photographs it held a circular stage for live music currently empty as it was midmorning a thin welldressed man approached us he was handsome in his early thirties wore a perfectly tailored suit and spoke with a west african accent mila hello how nice to see you this is kenneth mila said kenneth help me lucy said theyre holding me prisoner he ignored her mila introduced me just as sam and he shook my hand give sam whatever he needs mila said he nodded and regarded lucy she said ill scream kenneth said i believe you have no interest in speaking to the british police do you lucy shut up upstairs was a much bigger office than the bars in amsterdam or brussels it housed an array of computer screens mila locked the door behind us and sat at a keyboard began to type the back of her computer monitor faced us i pushed lucy into an office chair handcuffed her to it and sat across from her you want us to take down edward to help keep you safe then you talk to me go to their house zaids house thats where theyll go she turned to mila since the bars open id like a scotch mila ignored her i went around and looked at what she was doing she turned off the computer your wife is correct she said we have to go to zaids house why she looked at lucy come with me to get your wifes scotch she leaned down close to lucy and wheeled her chair into a small empty windowless room she slammed the door and locked it whats going on my employers insist i go to zaids country house and make sure there is no evidence of his connection to us what do you mean wipe out his computer yes he was just murdered in full sight in a train station the police will be swarming over his residences that is why we must hurry remember zaid telling us that his estate was equipped with bunkers for the government in case britain was invaded during the war i think if he has kept secrets from us on what he has given edward those secrets will be there it is his best hiding place but why would they go there it is hiding in plain sight zaid covered for yasmin while she was a socalled kidnapping victim he told us remember that no one knew she was missing not even her mother so now she cannot be missing whatever they are up to she must be in sight now or she would be suspected i ran a hand through my hair youre right that underground complex would be the perfect hiding place do we know whos living there a small staff i would suspect he keeps a sizeable stable of horses i love horses i said zaids death and the gunfire at st pancras dominated the news the rest of the day no one else had been seriously injured and the shooters had escaped the police were already at zaids london home interviewing his family i saw news footage of zaids blond wife walking into her london home in belgravia filmed at a distance yasmin with no scarf on to mask her face walked with her mother a supportive arm around her shoulders mrs zaid had said that her husband had gone to meet their daughter who was returning from a trip and that yasmin had phoned her to say shed been running late and when she arrived her father was dead from an apparent heart attack shed killed him vanished in the panic and then boldly returned her face uncovered for her meeting she poisons her father and now pretends to be the doting daughter i felt sick yasmin would have to vanish before poison was identified in her fathers body we did not have much time on the television i watched yasmin zaid and her mother step away from the press of the reporters and go back into their perfect house my daughter belongs to me zaid had said a million years ago back in amsterdam he had been so so wrong early the next morning i drove past the zaid country estate in kent not far from canterbury high stone walls rose and fell with the gentle sway of the rolling landscape i followed the road looking for signs of cameras or monitors hidden in the trees or the fence itself i drove a few miles past the property and then drove back again i wanted to get a feel for the terrain based on the satellite map mila had shown me together with the plans of the house she had somehow obtained the night before the complex lay under the georgian mansion stretching toward the western edge of the estate near the end of what would be the far side of the complex were stables a private airstrip lay on the far western side and stretching halfway across the ample property was a small river which seemed to start in the grounds itself and a number of small creeks it looked like one tunnel ended close to the stables which lay about two hundred yards from the wall a private road fed from the wall past the stables no guard at least right now but a heavy gate with a keycard reader i drove past again one more time then wheeled back to the closest village i keyed in the phone number hello a womans voice crisp undaunted apparently by the tragedy that had befallen her master stables please i hoped this would work even with zaid dead his horses would have to be cared for someone should be on duty one moment then the phone rang again hello this time a crabby mans voice hi i said id like to speak with whoever handles purchasing for mr zaids stables please this is a most inappropriate time young man we have had a death in the family the man scolded me oh im so sorry i didnt know i am so sorry i could not have sounded sorrier goodbye then sir could you please tell me who i should ask for when i call back that would be gerry and hes not here today whos calling please im mike smith with servicefirst equestrian were a brandnew firm and i think we could give gerry great service at a very attractive price the voice surprised him with a laugh you better give gerry service or hell yell your ears off just fair warning i laughed a false salesmans laugh yes sir i appreciate the candor might i ask if you know who supplies mr zaids horses now um yeah blue lion horse supply theyre close by very fine company but we have better deals with our suppliers we can pass on to you save your pitch for gerry dyou want to leave a number no sir ill call back next week and make an appointment with gerry sorry to have bothered you all right then good luck bye the man hung up a search on my phone gave me a listing for blue lion horse supply and i drove the two miles to the business it was in a standalone building of old stone with a paved parking lot i walked inside horse feed and equestrian equipment lined the walls and the shelves a young man stood at the counter tapping on a keyboard and frowning at a computer hi i said im from the zaid place gerry sent me he gave me a nod we were supposed to get a delivery of feed yesterday and it didnt come gerry sent me to pick it up the guy frowned and said we delivered your supply two days ago well we dont have it and gerrys out today and so im supposed to come get the stuff hold on my brother does the delivery to the zaids alec he called and got an answering what from the back office theres a guy from zaids out here and he the clerk turned around and i had the gun square in his face an apologetic smile behind the glock i tied the brothers up in the back office tight gagged them hung the closed sign in the window and found the delivery pickup a delivery for another client was already loaded good it would save me time i pulled a knit cap marked with the words blue lion off alecs balding head guys i knelt close to them now i had to scare them a bit i went through your wallets i know where you live so youre going to stay nice and calm and if anyone finds you before i come back here youre going to tell them someone who doesnt look like me took your truck you arent going to mention bahjat zaid you arent going to describe me because ill vanish and if it takes five days or five months or five years if you piss me off ill be back and you wont see me coming you boys understand me the brothers nodded okay ill be back with your truck real soon be good i called mila from the parking lot i said im ready she said im going inside now mila had gained access to the mansion by flashing a false identification that stated she was with scotland yard the news crews which had been there the night before were gone mila stood in the foyer after shed been admitted by the sallowfaced housekeeper mrs crosby who stood with a stricken look on her face a handkerchief in one hand she said two police inspectors have just left mila gave a polite slight bow i apologize for intruding upon your grief but i work in computer forensics and i need to access mr zaids computers we need to see who he had been in contact with if anyone might have threatened him mr zaid was a fine man mrs crosby said he didnt deserve what happened to him you were with him a long time yes me and my husband both weve been in his employ here for almost thirty years excuse me a voice came from beyond the foyer mrs crosby went instantly silent mila turned to see yasmin and edward stepping out from the study mila gave no expression that shed seen either of them before but her stomach lurched hello edward said im edward maxwell a security consultant for mr zaid may i be of help the housekeeper was strangling her silken handkerchief twisting it into a tight rope shes afraid mila thought this woman is scared to death well i hope so she said to edward im inspector mila smith from scotland yard forgive me but ive never heard of a scotland yard inspector with a russian accent i am a naturalized citizen and married to the worlds greatest manchester united fan she offered a small polite laugh as edward shook her hand he smiled mrs crosby edward said to the housekeeper its all right ill assist the inspector im not sure why the police are taking such an interest in mr zaids heart attack were not convinced it was a heart attack sir mila said mildly edward gave no reaction mrs crosby let out a small gasp edward said i think it would be best if you went home mrs crosby unless the inspector needs to speak to you no mila said softly that wont be necessary it was as if they were in agreement no noncombatants on the field edward took a step closer to mila she made herself not look at the questionmark scar mrs crosby nodded and left yasmin didnt smile she didnt speak she didnt watch the woman leave mila waited until she heard the soft jingling of the housekeeper getting her keys and a back door shutting so mr zaids computer edwards tone chilled im afraid that i cant let you have access to mr zaids systems there is confidential information on them regarding militronics business i understand sir but i do have a warrant mila reached inside her purse i pulled the cap over my head and turned into the gate i waved the key card over the pass the gate didnt open maybe because people up at the house were busy dealing with mila confirming her story or fighting with her a voice squawked from the speaker by the card reader yeah who are you i put on my best english accent alec at blue lion horse sent me he didnt have some of the horse feed in this weeks delivery for mr zaid and im bringing it now i didnt look directly at the camera i looked at a notepad checking the details of the delivery what i was delivering wasnt horse feed but a story to a guard who was probably already nervous given that his boss had just died but it is the nature of underlings to trust their eyes and i wore the cap i drove the truck bearing the blue lion logo and name on the door i lobbed the right name silence for ten seconds someone will meet you at the stable wait there it wont take long will it because ive got other deliveries mate ill see you there thanks i rolled up the window the gates opened and i drove through milas hand closed over her pistol but she sensed edward take a step forward she looked up and edward held a gun on her you he ordered mila drop the purse youre not scotland yard honestly couldnt they find a british bird to play a british bird no edward yasmin started just a moment love he said to her his gaze bore into mila who are you with sam capras bunch yes very carefully her fingers pressed a button on a small device next to the gun in her purse in her head she started a slow measured countdown and who exactly are they we work for mr zaid ah clear your hands from the purse then drop it on the floor slowly mila made a show of sliding the purse off her shoulder her gaze locked on edwards and the only time her glance wandered was to evaluate where she would strike him the throat the eyes the base of his nose where the bone would spear into the brain if you hit it just right yasmin get the guards on the radio yasmin stumbled toward the hallway i told you to drop the purse bitch he said to mila her purse hit the floor edward leaned down keeping the gun fixed on mila dragging the purse toward him and five seconds later its zippered opening exploded in a blast of dazzling light no welcoming committee was waiting at the stable when i parked the truck i didnt see a soul i grabbed my bag and got out then dropped the gate of the pickup took a bag of feed and half dragged another bag off the edge of the pickups rear gate i needed to look like either an eagertoplease deliveryman or a deliveryman hurrying to finish one job and get to the next i stepped inside the stable slung the bag over my shoulder and waited zaids beautiful horses nickered perhaps anticipating a run or an exercise i was sorry to disappoint them three minutes later a truck topped the rise of the hill three men inside an awful lot to receive a delivery either mila had already failed or they were cautious three against one and me already coping with injuries i hurried to each of the stalls and opened the doors led the arab horses out via the back gate i swatted them gently on the sides to urge them to run two broke and bolted past the corral the others cantered they were such beauties i remembered my dad teaching me and my brother to ride one humid summer when we were in virginia not melting in a third world housing project and the joy you could feel from the wind in your face from the bridled power of the horse i went back into the stable and waited the truck stopped before reaching the building as the guards caught sight of the horses rounding the stables one man a redhead jumped out to try and catch the horses the other two wearing holsters kept the truck headed for the stables they pulled up next to the blue lion pickup got out but left their guns in their holsters they moved like professionals and i wondered if they were just hired security or if they were part of edwards organization i didnt really want to kill rentacops whod just taken the wrong job patrolling a quiet english estate the way they fought would show me who they were as they stepped inside i swung a heavy bag of feed into the first ones face the man toppled and as the weight of the bag spun i nailed the second guard with a kick below the throat that sent him sprawling out onto the porch my shoulder ached from the weight of it and i staggered after the kick the first manthicknecked with a blond burr of hairrolled into a martial artists stance and yanked a small knife from a sheath on his belt not a copforhire then that simplified things he swiped at me with the knife and i hammered my palm into his face then grabbed both his wrists and slammed them against the top of a stable door they broke he screeched and staggered backward staring at his bent wrists the second man a wiry african coughing blood lunged at me drawing his gun and yelled an order to surrender i ignored it and rammed a fist into the mans hand knocking the gun to the floor the bolt of pain shot up my arm to my wounded shoulder and i was too slow pulling back the african slammed three hard brutal blows into my ribs bruises still fresh from holland thundered into agony i couldnt fight for long i stepped inside the africans swing and headslammed him and the man went to his knees i gave him a kick square in the groin and i meant it the african collapsed in huffing agony he looked up at me as a man expecting to die fear shining bright in his eyes i relieved him of his gun and yanked an earpiece from his ear they were wired to check in so reinforcements might be here soon the man with two broken wrists looked at me in shock i leveled a kick into him that drove his head back against a stall gate and he crumpled i pulled out my gun wheres the entrance i said to the underground rooms the african shot me the finger honestly i thought i knelt down and twisted the finger back to within a millimeter of breaking it the african howled are they paying you enough really i asked the back the kitchen i yanked him to his feet hustled him into the kitchen pantry he said a bit more steel in his voice now he was going to get cute but i still needed him the small kitchen held a pantry at its back and i opened the door keeping the gun aimed at the african another door stood behind the narrow shelving made of new reinforced steel i tried pushing it locked open it i said door only opens from the inside he was right there was no knob or bar okay i slammed the african into the pantry shelving once twice and the guy cracked his head and dropped unconscious i checked the window no sign of the redhead hed be back in minutes or radioing his friends whod gone into the stable and wondering why they werent responding i opened my bag found the strips of plastic explosive and the wires and began to shape the charge around the door the blast was more light and dazzle than heat and as edward screamed and staggered back mila drew her baton from the small of her back the first blow grazed edwards jaw the edge of the baton bloodying the skin mila slashed again aiming for edwards chest but he caught her arm and twisted her forearm savagely she slammed the heel of her other hand into his face a fist hammered into the soft of milas throat and she fell to her knees yasmin attacking with blows and kicks edward grabbed milas hair spat in her face pounded her head against the table twice then a hand wrenched the baton from her grip yasmin panting and mewling smashed the baton across milas head and mila fell onto the fine persian rug she hurt me edward said blood welled along his skin dotted his shirt mila looked up and yasmin zaid leveled a gun at her her thin mouthwith a stitched lipjerked wavered slid back to a mostly straight line the hand shook slightly the eyes were blank of feeling whatever personality that once ruled this woman was gone hollowed out and replaced with an emptiness that twisted milas stomach stand up yasmin ordered slowly mila stood wheres sam capra edward said gone hunting that wife of his she got away from him im supposed to believe that and you just came here to confront us please do i look moronic you dont look smart mila said is sam capra here edward asked no i came alone these people you work for who are they are you cia or are you mi what you should be so lucky mila said were worse were focused you wont know how to fight us edward backhanded her she held her ground and her strength seemed to enrage him i am not breakable you pathetic small freak mila said in a hoarse whisper well see yasmin bring her with us where are the guards they went to see about a delivery at the stables edward froze have they come back no radio them you come with me he grabbed mila put the gun close against the cool of her throat he hurried her down a hallway your friend piet when i killed him mila said it was like beating a crying sack of flour edward didnt slow you did me a favor ah yes you slaughtered your own people back in the brewery mila turned her head and spat in edwards face edward slammed her into the wall drove a brutal fist into her stomach youre trying to delay me it wont work i know what you are she said to edward you worked with a slaver youre no better than he is you dont like that piet was a slaver edward laughed when im done with you when youve spilled every secret about who you work for im going to sell your ass to a man i know youre not too old to be broken into the trade we dont need her yasmin said coming up behind them she centered her gun on milas forehead i feel sorry for you mila said and yasmins aim wavered whatever he did to you time can undo i know people who have been through worse than you and you can recover what he did was set me free if theres a shred of yasmin zaid left under the brainwashing you know thats not true i am what i wanted to be alwaysfree of my father yasmin said but her mouth wavered her hand shook you traded one bully for another mila said dont shoot her edward ordered i want to talk to her did the guards report any problems some horses got loose she said theyre chasing them down he frowned i dont like it yasmin gun now to milas neck hurried her to a wall hanging edward pushed it aside pressed a release and a door opened dim light showed stairs going downward churchill planned to use the estate as a base for a resistance if needed edward said the resistance is here all right its just not the one he envisioned he shoved mila through the door the explosive felt soft and claylike under my fingertips and for an odd moment i thought of playing in the mud along a river in thailand with my brother danny when we were young i heard the sound of a footfall behind me im holding high explosives i said so you probably dont want to shoot no bullet came id given him room for doubt i risked a glance over my shoulder and saw the redhead aiming a gun at my back put the explosives down he spoke with a serbian accent youre the smartest guy ive met here what put the gun down youre making me nervous you dont want me nervous you can only kill me i can kill us both an edge cut his voice put the gear down stand up hands on your head the gear was in place and i slid the triggering device into my sleeve now the redhead yelled he looked at me like i was the prize a promotion or a bonus normally i applauded ambition not now slowly i stood turned locked my fingers on the top of my head move back from the door i obeyed taking five steps wheres the trigger the redhead asked he was the smartest after all in the gear bag the edge of the triggering device lay cool against my wrist i took another step backward getting the redhead between me and the door the guy was doing it all wrong but i wasnt going to correct him not my place he knelt by the gear bag explosives apparently made him nervous as they would any sane person it looks like a silver cylinder i said and it was true but the guy didnt do what i hoped he picked up the bag instead of searching its jumble and gestured at me with the gun lets go outside dont jostle the bag i made my eyes franticwide not at all because its a sensitive button it gets pushed then its boom boom the redhead stopped so i turned and i pretended to stumble over the outstretched arm of the unconscious african dropped one hand and the detonator device slid into my palm then you come find it not me im not touching this again all right i said and i covered my ears and head as i dropped to the floor and pressed the detonator the blast juddered the heavy door and blew it off its hinges the noise thrummed my bones as i leaped up and slammed a fist into the redheads face already concussed and dizzy the man collapsed i bolted through the mist of grit and down a set of stone stairs into the darkened tunnel i put the map mila had shown me into my head mila had told me there was a sharp bend after you entered the tunnel from the house and that was where the old complex lay where zaid would have done his secret work and where the truth about this weapon would be i ran dim lights illuminated the tunnel and the air smelled damp i could hear in the distance a rushing of water as i went down the tunnel the sound increased in volume and then faded as i ran deeper into the ground the passageway opened into a large open space hewn from rock concrete blocks gray with age constituted the floor the air was cool lowhanging lights a metal table filled with an array of computers personal photos dotted it bahjat zaid and his family a picture of yasmin as a girl standing with her father the sun slanting across her face i shut the door behind me and flipped the lock then i sat at the computer at the center of the table gear that looked like external hard drives was attached to the machines each drive held a small slot too small for a cd more like a flashdrive connector but narrower each bore a militronics stamp i moved the mouse the computers monitor awoke someone had been here and recently the screen showed what looked like an oversized barcode image full of encoded data that meant nothing to me i looked at the files name dna this was someones dna analysis the software had an open recent files option there was a list of files under the arrow dna to dna i hit the more option under the last listing it showed a numerically ordered list of files the last being dna fifty files fifty dnas in each corner was a picture dna was a girl who looked to be about twelve they were analyzing the genetic profiles of children why i started scanning the files most were children a few were men the rest were women most appearing to be in their forties and fifties they looked like normal everyday people some of the photos looked like passport images but some did not the people all well dressed were walking several of them waving at the camera i recognized none of them and no names were attached to the files who were these people i looked at the drives one was mounted on the computers screen maybe all the answers were on the external drivea backup i could take with me i selected eject on the icon but the drive didnt eject instead a small chip did from the drive i held it up it had a flat shiny surface a grid on it echoing the one id seen on the weird gun and on the remnants of the amsterdam bomb on the table lay a plastic case sized for the chip i slid it into the protective case then put the case into my shoe then the door unlocked and opened as i began to sit down at the computer again edward and yasmin stood there with a gun locked on milas head the same unusual gun id seen him fire inside st pancras hands up sam edward said i obeyed finally facetoface he smiled wow youre a piece of work man i didnt speak i thought of him slapping lucy in the car i thought of him driving away while my friends burned and died i dont blame you for trying he said you are much tougher than i ever thought you would be we figured you for you know a powerpoint jockey mostly but no i really have to say you surprised me my gun was on the table less than a foot away from me even if they killed me and mila i could not let them walk whatever they were planning my god against innocent people against kids if you move or resist us edward said your baby dies it just takes one call he knew where my child was stay still edward said yasmin take his weapons she obeyed she brought the gun and the knife to edward why i said why my wife why kill all your friends in holland why should i explain a thing to you i dont care if you die confused yasmin search him she came back to me and her hands shaking roamed my body she didnt think to check my shoes who do you work for sam i nodded at mila mila said nothing and who does she work for she wont tell me where is our troublesome lucy gone dead mila lied she wouldnt tell sam where his son is i will put your mind at ease about one point sam edward smiled i sold your son they were the four worst words id ever heard worse than watch what happens to men like him when my brother was killed worse than im supposed to kill you said by my wife for a moment i thought my knees would buckle i sold him to a trafficker shes keeping him close at hand for me shell kill him if you or lucy make trouble i have no words for the horror the rage white hot like id been crafted from lightning i spoke the only words that occurred to me im going to kill you i should have bargained said id do whatever just dont just dont hurt my kid sell him vomit rose in my throat i swallowed the sourness down edward laughed no youre not he gestured me away from the computer i stepped away then he did something odd he ejected a computer chip from the side of the gun where the unusual grid lay and inserted a new one from his shirt pocket the chip was just like the one in my shoe the gun was a bit bigger than the standard glock heavy and glossy and very dangerous yasmin started are you giving a demo did you get his never mind edward said i want to take them to the shaft i didnt like the sound of that mila was in handcuffs yasmin took me by the arm pressed a gun against my neck and guided me out of the lab we walkedme and yasmin first then edward and mila the corridor was narrow not enough room to fight and if i fought he had my son killed your father just wanted to save you i said to yasmin he gave up everything to save you my father wanted to control me she virtually spat out the words someones controlling you far worse than your father ever did i said shut up edward said i wanted to keep him rattled hed make a mistake maybe the dna analysis for the kids and the other people whats that about youll be free of all worries by then edward said dont burden your mind with it this was the end of my life no way out no exit we walked down to a dark room that was a widening in the corridor i could smell the earthy tang of artesian water just kill them yasmin said her voice shook we knew what had been done to her and she didnt like us being around we were from her old life outside the cocoon where edward had trapped her the hallways splinter opened up into a narrow room and the concrete ended at a heavy steel door we went through the door into a round stone room at the end of the room was a large hole nearly seven feet across in its depths i could hear a rush of water i remembered seeing the start of a river on the property map this must be the underground route of that river take him to the edge yasmin edward said she eased me along edward kept one gun trained on milas throat the other on me you behaved so your son lives edward said you are a good father you dont need to hurt my kid ever i was going to die for a son id never see okay it was what it was but i wished id gotten to hold him to see his face look for the clear bits of me and lucyyes even lucy the lucy of my dreams the honest onein his face edwards mouth twitched im sure hell have a good life i had nowhere to run nowhere to fight and in my last moment i decided dignity was the only exit let me go lucy had said and i hadnt i couldnt it had got me here im sorry mila i said she nodded edward raised the odd heavy gun that hed slipped the computer chip into and aimed it at my chest he was seven feet away i wondered if id die before i hit the water if id drown i didnt want to drown i thought of my father my mother the weird life theyd made for me my brother i thought of daniel i held on to him the barrel of his gun centered on my chest he fired i kept standing and like an idiot i looked down at my chest where a gaping hole should have been my tshirt was unmarred four feet away from me yasmin staggered stunned blood welled from her chest couldnt be the gun was aimed directly at me impossible she was four feet to my left and edwards aim hadnt veered edward laughed milas mouth dropped open i caught yasmin at the edge of the shaft felt the life pulse out of her as i held her in my arms one mans science he said is another mans magic what what i managed she couldnt be dead the gun was aimed at me i dont need her anymore he raised the gun again while you die in the dark i am going to kill your baby he hissed just because i can he fired two more shots i held yasmin tried to turn us both away but there was nowhere to go the bullets hammered into her and i fell into blackness i fell into dark water yasmin still in my arms i stayed under the water if i surfaced he would just shoot me the cold was a shock illuminated by the crooked lights above the stone shaft the water was gray i kicked down steadying myself against the stone wall trying not to rise again if i broke the waters surface he would kill me he had to believe me dead my lungs felt like they would explode i heard a distant scream perhaps mila or i wished edward mila was not the screaming type and i was sure edward was a crazy disjointed thought to keep my lungs from shredding but no mila crashed down to join us yasmins face turned to mine an inch away eyes half open in the water i touched her throat no pulse a little wooden dove on her necklace floated between our faces the lights went out in the distance i heard a heavy grindingthe stone door shutting total darkness my lungs seared with the burn of spent oxygen i eased to the surface tried to breathe as quietly as i could i failed my gasps echoed against the stone no shot came edward was gone and i was buried in a horrible suffocating darkness i groped for the side of the stone shaft and explored it with my fingers but it wasnt smooth concrete it had to be a more ancient well with hewn stone that might give me a chance to climb it i didnt think i was badly hurt i could feel furrows along my wrists where the skin had parted as the bullets had hit yasmin as i held her and my alreadywounded shoulder hurt very badly first try i made it up about five feet before i fell and slid back into the waters embrace i didnt bother to rest i clambered back up i am going to kill your baby just because i can i made it ten feet at least i thought i had the pitch dark could be playing a cruel trick on me then i ran out of handhold and flailed found another grip lost it stone hit my chin and opened the flesh blood was a seeping warmth down my front the cold water revived me i started to climb again fell again climbed again but now i started to recognize the stones by feel i used the same path and after a half hour of agony i felt the smooth lip of the top of the shaft i pulled myself up and lay spent my ribs afire with pain the rest of me shivering and cold i groped for the wall i found it and searched found the stone door it was bolted locked into place and over the lock was a smooth metal plate it was engaged on the other side i had no way to pick it and no light to see by yasmin had taken my flashlight when she searched me i am in my grave the thought nearly paralyzed me someone would come but how long how many days maybe never did anyone else know this complex even existed i am going to kill your baby just because i can and the kids on the computer they were part of edwards sick plot i slid to the edge of the shaft i could hear running water the river would have to surface at some point but i couldnt know what turns or twists the stream might take how many minutes can you hold your breath how long long enough i said to the empty blackness long enough i put my legs back over the shaft it was one of the hardest things id ever done i didnt want to drop back down into the awful inky darkness it had taken so long to climb up i could just wait sit and wait and hope that someone found me i thought of daniel he needs me it was a strange thing to be needed i hadnt known it in a long while the need that lucy had for me was false a need curled in the grass like a coiled snake my parents didnt need me after danny died they hated me for living daniel though he needed me and he didnt even know it with that i dropped into the black i dove down yasmins body was gone i could feel the tug of the moving current beneath the relative quiet of the shaft shed sunk and shed been swept away i filled my body with oxygen heaving in slow deep saturating breaths i pushed my fear of the water deep back into my brain then i went down the dark water was cold and clutching it felt like death grasping at me i stayed close to the roof of the cave that met the end of the shaft it was smooth stone worn by the ceaseless knife of the water the current shoved me forward i brushed hard against the rocks that scraped my back and my head agony lanced my ribs ten seconds in the deep no pain no fear i pressed on trying not to panic trying to stay streamlined like a torpedo to move me along faster the blackness was complete like nothing i had ever experienced i kicked kept my hands out in front of me to try to protect myself from any hidden obstruction in the pitch black told myself i had all the time in the world fifty seconds so i guessed my lungs began to burn panic tugged at the edges of my mind a little tug and then tearing i saw a blossom of dim light to my left and hurled myself toward it the light grew brighter i kicked i swam trying to cut through the current to the unexpected glow i saw a stone circle dimly outlined from the light above just like the shaft id fled i kicked upward fighting the urge to let the stale airprecious goldout of my lungs the shaft here was narrower i went up and exploded into air i took long huffing breaths a grate lay two feet above my head brown with rust i breathed like id never breathed before i tried to push open the grate it was locked into place with heavy iron bolts i couldnt get up the shaft to the rest of the complex but the sound of the water was loud and this must have been the rush of current id heard heading from the stables into the complex i tried to pull the grate from the stone and i realized i was getting nowhere and losing precious strength i wanted to remain in this pocket of light and air but i couldnt my kid needed me mila needed me had edward killed her i thought not he wanted to know who she worked for i had to go back into the darkness i took the long low heavy breaths looking up through the stone shaft like a baby glimpsing a distant world at the end of the birth canal i filled my body with air and kicked back into the blackness the cold river swept me away i could feel a sudden shift downward in the angle of the ceiling going down further from the ground from the surface and the sacred air dont panic whatever you do do not panic i fought the urge to turn back to the last shaft then i felt the stone not only above me but below me the tunnel had narrowed into a grave i tried to turn back panicking now the bubbles exploding from me in a rush and the water swept me forward between the stone jaws narrow black stone scraping both sides of me my mother my father my brother staring into a camera silently pleading for his life i would be with danny again my child lucy i didnt want my last thought to be of lucy i thought of my brother imagined i felt his strong hand taking mine then no stone pressed against me above me no rock light a thousand miles above me i kicked weakly my muscles trying their last then my head burst above the water into the sweetness i gasped wheezed turned into the water and vomited i was in the river bright with sunlight alive i heard a buzz a plane i remembered the private runway on the map and lying in the cold gray wash of the river i looked up and saw zaids learjet edward was gone i lay on the bank until i found strength enough to get to my feet i walked to the stables the guards were gone either to the hospital or to the main house i guessed i headed back into the complex i checked all the computers all the hard drives were gone all the backup drives the strange drives for the chips the chips were gone as well i checked my shoe the chip id taken was still there edward had put a chip in the gun before hed shot yasmin so the chips somehow worked with the guns the bizarre gun that shot yasmin when it was directly aimed at me the gun that shared a strange metal grid with the bomb that had killed the money czar back in amsterdam i got into the delivery truck and drove to the empty plane hangar no sign of mila hed taken mila because he wanted to know who was after him i drove down to the canal i drove past where id climbed out from it and about another half mile i found yasmins body i waded into the water and i pulled her free from a thickness of rushes i picked up yasmins body and carried her to the truck i wasnt exactly crazy about the idea of driving back to london with no license in my name in a stolen delivery truck with a corpse in the back but i couldnt leave her body the gun that had killed yasmin had not been like anything id ever seen before i wanted to see the bullets adrenaline thrummed with music guitars battling under androgynous singing most of the crowd was in the buildings courtyard listening to an impossibly trendy band play i parked the truck behind the bar in the reserved owners space and used the private back entrance carrying yasmins body on my shoulder keying in the code mila had given me to open the door no one saw me lucy was still locked inside her windowless room i left her there right now if i looked at her i might kill her i had to stay focused i locked the doors behind me the room had been soundproofed but i could still feel the distant beat of the music there was medical equipment in a closet just as in amsterdam i found a scalpel i spread plastic sheeting on the floor and carefully cut into yasmins bullet wounds i couldnt shake either the image of the treasured daughter she had been in her fathers eyes or that of the empty shell shed become i found one of the bullets and carefully pulled it out i wiped it clean and took it to the table the bullet was longer and slimmer than usual malformed slightly from the impact on entering yasmins body it carried a grid on its nose that matched the grid id seen on the bomb shrapnel and the gun i pulled apart the bullet inside lay a complex web of miniaturized technology i took photos of the dismantled bullet and loaded them onto the computer on the desk then i took one of the phones from the shelf checked it and called a number in new york city it rang three times howell its sam capra sam i have my wife you what i have captured my wife a long shocked silence you were right howell she betrayed me the company i have proof slow down have you intercepted that cigarette shipment no the customs people in rotterdam havent tracked it listen lucys connected to a groupyour novem solesthat has stolen a prototype for some kind of hightech gun i want to send you photos of a bullet i need it analyzed no you need to come in sam do this right no i will send you the photos i think that maybe theyre targeting kids with these guns kids i saw a list of fifty people that i think may be targeted mostly kids a few men and women give me an email to send this information to you bring in the evidence now sam howell lowered his voice all could be forgiven if you really have lucy but if i told him everything id have to give him mila as well i wasnt prepared to do that give me an email thats the only way were doing this reluctantly he did i hung up i went to the computer and used an anonymizer program to access a series of servers finally ending up on one in south africa hosting a popular celebrity gossip site it was a company front i used an inactive account there id once had as peter samson to send the photos id taken id give howell a couple of hours before i called back i changed into dry clothes i found in a closet then unlocked the soundproofed room lucy sat on the floor chained to the wall i looked at her as though she were a complete stranger lucy drew back against the wall you look like crap edward has this weird gun you aim at one person and it kills another tell me about it she shook her head i dont know what youre talking about it uses a computer chip i dont know sam he has a list of children to target children lucy i honestly dont know he told me he was going to have our son killed just because he can i could almost see the next i dont know forming on her lips then her mouth went slack i waited to see what she would say he said that he sold our son lucy is that true she tried to stand you have to listen to me sam please did you help him sell our child i screamed in her face she shook her head then she nodded then she shook her head again the number of people i have wanted to killnot needed to kill but wanted to killis very few the men who killed my brother who set me on my lifes course piet for raping and selling those women into slavery and smiling about it edward but now i wanted to kill lucy i felt my hands close around her throat and she didnt fight me she just looked up into my eyes my fingers began to tighten against her flesh then i shoved her away from me she closed her eyes edwards keeping daniel so i cooperate with him where is he i dont know after he was born they took him from me i had only held him once just the once and id kissed him and given him his name i couldnt stop them the birth was hard sam i wasnt strong enough then i knelt by her and and he said he put daniel with a trafficker that he would sell daniel to a couple back in the us and id never find him if i didnt obey him she turned away from me i turned her face back to me i dont believe for a second that youre an innocent victim lucy you might feel guilt for me maybe even for our child you let me live but you have stayed with these people because they had daniel edward is very good at finding your one fear and capitalizing on it you put the bomb in the office i said you had money going through accounts that the company thought were closed you are not the innocent victim of a kidnapping here they had no leverage over you then i didnt know it was a bomb i got in over my head it was supposed to be a drive that just copied the hard drives edward wanted the files from the office all of them like the files on my investigations she nodded i didnt know it was a bomb until edward told me i was in the car i knew you were inside he got out of the car because the remote for the detonator wasnt working and he had to get closer to the building it had a twentysecond delay he got it working and then he got back into the car and he realized id called you then everything exploded i saved you sam and let everyone else die i had to make a hard choice just like you do she said i took a steadying breath if you want to help me youll tell me what i need to know this weapon it uses a chip the chip i got was connected to a computer that had a dna profile on it you put the chip into the gun it uses nanotechnology to somehow key a persons dna to the bullet slowly she nodded i sat across from her this is how i think it happened she pulled her knees up to her chin edward is british but hes working in eastern europe he works for one of these transnational crime rings our office was targeting he finds out about these dnaguided guns being developed in hungary maybe from the scientist informant that could have handed me the money czar he kidnaps yasmin to get leverage over her father the ransom was these guns but zaid only delivers the guns not the chips that make them work lucy looked up at me yeah he screwed over edward and edward realized he had items of huge value in these guns so he wanted them for himself im thinking this whole operation was funded by the money czar edward wanted him out of the picture so he had yasmin kill the guy to make her look like shed willingly joined her captors and to assure silence from her dad but no one in the amsterdam gang knew the money czar only edward did edwards gang helped kill him and none of them knew that wasnt a bombing to show possible buyers that the technology they were smuggling worked that it was simply a murder and when they were done being useful to him as a cover he killed all of them i raised lucys jaw with my fingertip novem soles nine suns who are they is it edward alone theyre the ones who said i had to come work for them you didnt have a baby to be used against you no i had you i shook my head wrong you didnt do this to protect me yet theres that troublesome fact that i got you out of the building no matter what ive done sam i did that youre welcome i turned my hand into a fist and put it back in my lap the bomb in amsterdam the police couldnt figure out how it was triggered but it had some sort of scanning grid on it the same as that gun the same as the bullet the bomb goes off if the person with the right dna gets close enough she nodded our office wasnt bombed because of the money czar the bigger threat was one of the guys whod pointed us toward the money czarthe scientist who was working on nanotech research we were targeted because we were investigating that connection to a researcher in dna technology in nanotechnology when he had to silence the scientist in budapest the next target who could help him use the technology was yasmin did that scientist used to work with yasmin she nodded these guns these bullets that bomb its all using nanotechnology to tie the weapon to a persons dna isnt it yes the money czar gives edward money to bomb london to wipe out my investigation then he uses the money to set up the group in amsterdam he pays off piet and nic to run a criminal smuggling operation for him so they could get the guns away from zaid and to the united states lucy wiped at her face yes a bullet encoded with dna wont miss snipers can fire into crowds and know they will hit whoever they want to hit unerringly so who are these fifty people theyre targeting who are these kids i honestly do not know i dont know what hes doing edward tried to kill me did you forget that i can help you sami can help you deal with the devil i thought part two moonlight broke through the clouds above brooklyn like a smile in the night time was scarce the burglar had to assume that there were hidden camera feeds in the empty apartment scrolling data onto a hard drive there might only be minutes for the burglar to find what was needed the burglar headed straight for the bathroom a comb a brush and a toothbrush lay on the shelf under the mirror the burglar held up the hairbrush and examined it sam capra had a full head of brownishblond hair several strands lay entwined in the stiff bristles of the brush the burglar hoped some held surviving follicles the brush went into a plastic bag to be joined by the comb and the toothbrush a slide of the gloved fingers along the bag and the job was done then out the door down the stairs back into the moonlightdappled night the burglar slid up the dark heavy balaclava that hid his face and walked off into the black the key to dealing properly with sam capra lay rustling like a whisper in the plastic bag i called howell back three hours later what did you find his voice sounded grim the photos match a set of prototypical weapons being developed by the company by the company oh my god being developed for you by bahjat zaid god or nature or biological accident gives us these awesome brains and this is what we do with them we think of better ways to kill ways that make murder as easy as taking a breath these guns could change history kill a ceo kill a president kill a pope kill a good guy kill a bad guy with total confidence that the bullet will find its mark howell said sam do you know what the goal is of this man having these guns whys he doing this profit im surehe must be selling the guns to someone who has an agenda he has the dna of fifty people one of my contacts piet said there were fifty packages edward was smuggling fifty fifty means something but the fifty people arent famous would you recognize them if you saw them again maybe i dont know my head pounded the guns were a ticket back to having my life back if the company forgave me my sins then i had a chance of getting back and keeping my son without looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life new york i said hes shipping the guns to new york piet had told me that why to who i dont know silence then you listen to me if youre setting me up for another fall then you will seriously regret it i have bigger problems than you howell i know youre just doing a thankless job im sorry im your headache i really am sam when i find out more ill call you you are still a company officer i am not you areand i am ordering you to come in i hung up i went downstairs and found kenneth the manager of adrenaline he came back up to the office with me he sucked in his breath when he saw yasmins body i didnt kill her i said all right kenneth said i explained what had happened without telling him about the specific nature of the weapons best to keep that to myself when i told him mila had been captured he said how can i help kenneth who runs this who do you work for i work for mila who does mila work for this technology this level of resourcesyou folks have serious clout kenneth said mila should have told you mila may be dead he sat she works for the round table round table like king arthurs round table mila likes to pretend they date back to a distant time but its simply a name theyre a group of powerful and wealthy people who have joined forces over many years and i dont know more than that i do know i can make phone calls and certain resources are arranged for mila or for whoever is working for her okay i am working for king arthur i nearly laughed with all the insanity of the day i felt on edge no sir kenneth seemed alarmed that i believed this and the round table owns the bars adrenaline de rode prins in amsterdam he nodded under a front company why do you work for them whats your background he studied me for a moment then he said very formally ten years ago i was accused of murdering a former girlfriend i was innocent but i was convicted and i went to prison milas employers helped me prove my innocence and they found the real killer i owe them and i have an interest in justice now i did not have before is that milas background too falsely accused and saved by the round table just like me i cannot say because i do not know does it matter right now we must help mila all right i need transport to the united states for me and for a prisoner inside that room i cant cart her through first class in chains can you arrange that yes i can put you on a private plane kenneth went to a phone and picked it up to make a call he hesitated do you think milas dead i hope not i hope im going to get her because i think whoever has her wants to know about this round table they wont break her he said this with certainty mila was edwards bonus he knew that he and his employers were facing a formidable enemy in whoever mila and i worked for it was the only reason shed been kept alive edward was if anything a constant opportunist i stared down at lucy were going to go get on a plane shortly if you try and break away from me or create a scene ill shoot you do you understand me sweetheart yes monkey lucy held up her wrists i understand you the cabin was bare but functional me lucy and the pilot and copilot they did not ask questions about our guest in chains theyve been told that shes a prisoner of the cia kenneth said i thought you would appreciate the irony thank you lucy ate the sandwich that i gave her and drank from a bottle of water the plane left england behind soaring out over the dark heavy steel of the atlantic i have a question for you how exactly does the chip get the dna i could bore you with the detailed science but you put a hair or a blood sample on the chip and it encodes the bullets with the targets dna then the bullets like a guided missile but he shot at you and missed he didnt have my dna on the chip it acts as a normal gun without the dna enhancement does he have a chip with your dna she started to answer and then fell silent he could and you dont know if hes smart he does edward wont let anyone betray him ive been thinking hard about why you turned traitor trying to see how someone like edward a psychopath could lure you away from your life with me well when you were investigating these criminal networks i used to see the numbers you crunched you look at these crime rings you see how much money they make billions and billions twenty percent of the worlds economy comes from illicit goods now its easy money you just need the right mix of skills smugglers hit men hackers the right network and then she looked at me coolly im a businessperson they offered me some money i knew i could clean it through company accounts and make it vanish at least i thought i could it wasnt going to hurt anyone giving them the files tell me about novem soles i have a contact he got me my money but ive never met him she finished her sandwich i dont even know how they got their name but i found an old legend about nine suns on the internet chinese it says that there were once ten suns but they wouldnt come out just one at a time during the day all ten would come and their heat and power would incinerate the world her voice had grown very soft the emperor asked the father of the ten suns di jun to ask the suns to appear just one at a time so the earth would not be remade in heat and flame but the suns refused so di jun sent an archer named yi with a magical bow and arrow to frighten the suns to make them obey instead yi shot nine of them so only one sun would remain she risked a smile because the nine suns returning would destroy the world annihilate whoever tried to tame them i dont even know if that story has anything to do with the nine suns or why they use a latin name if its based on a chinese legend she smiled but there was no joy in it nine people who could remake the world thats how they think of themselves is edward one of the nine or is he a flunky i dont know these fifty people whats special about them i said i dont know thats a lie no its not lucy drew her knees up to her chin she peered at me above them when you asked me to marry you i almost said no not because i didnt want to marry you i did but i felt like you wouldnt be enough i wanted a lot from life i wanted money i wanted respect i wanted to work hard for ten years and then have enough to live on not work my fingers to the bone clawing up some malerun bureaucracy not putting my life in danger for a bunch of ideals she slid her legs out in front of her and for a moment we were back in london drinking lager in our apartment talking about our future i knew you didnt care about that and for a time i thought i could live without the money i couldnt i didnt say anything she was quiet for nearly forty minutes and i thought shed fallen asleep then she said i think i will tell you a little bit about who i work for why the change of heart because do you think the companys really going to welcome you back even if you help them maybe theyll give you a pardon maybe but theyll never ever let you work for them again they wont trust you they wont think you can follow orders orders trump all are you telling me this to offer me a job she stretched out a leg consider it a lifeline i think the company will simply kill both of us when theyre done no oh not them officially but there are rogue groups running inside i looked hard at her could i have been so wrong for so long the thought was a fist in my chest in my brain i wasnt enough for you marrying me wasnt enough i said marrying you was marrying you was the right thing to do i loved you it was an act of optimism i dont believe you loved me she raised an arm slid up the sleeve and i saw a trio of round brutal burns on her upper arm that was the price of making that phone call that got you out of the office edward thought id betrayed them leaving you alive a dead patsy is more valuable than a live one who can deny and possibly disprove the frame but you did frame me you were alive i knew they might let you go that there was a chance better prison than a grave why wasnt i enough wasnt i a good husband you cannot possibly care about my opinion i started to answer and she raised a hand no you dont care about me i see through all this talk this is about the baby she smiled and then the smile went away my trump card dont talk about daniel that way i know hes a person who grew inside me for nine months she wiped a hand against her lip when we found out i was pregnant do you remember it was a sign of her psychosis i thought that she even had to ask i remember it had been right after dinner shed taken the test without telling me of her suspicions and brought me the test with its little affirmative plus and id whooped and hollered and shed worn a stunned smile on her face well i thought thats that i wont work for novem soles anymore i will walk away i will cover my tracks and i will stop and no one will ever know that i ever sold bits and pieces of information i will have this baby and i will love sam and that will be my real life she rubbed at her lip and she dropped her gaze from mine but they dont let you walk away you dont submit a letter of resignation they told me they would kill you i closed my eyes and felt a corner of my heart die i could never know the truth of anything lucy said she had saved me in london but why i could never know maybe even she didnt know love guilt a more selfish reason to use me in the future it didnt matter she lied like other people breathed so that when she told the truth you had no way to recognize it i said nothing so my choices were let you die and then be faced with a life i didnt want with a child or to keep working for them and figure out a way to cut loose and to set you free you could have come and told us that you were in trouble cooperated with us youve used me youve used our kid i couldnt come back after the bomb i couldnt do prison there are worse things than prison is that a threat you wont hurt me a half smile played on her face you wont youre the good guy im the mother of your child where did you have the baby i said you owe me this lucy tell me i owe you nothing i saved your life were square there is a company airfield in maine near damariscotta if i tell the pilots to land there they will i thought we were going to new york no i think i should give you back to the company sam we had a deal you stop edward i walk but you dont know where he is you say ill bet youll tell the company i bet theyll make you talk but the guns my son takes precedence maybe these people havent even fixed their targets yet maybe the fifty people are just to see if they can encode a chip they may not be targets at all just dna samples that they stole somehow i crossed my arms i cant wait to see what howell does when he gets his hands on you oh i was just the warmup sweetheart youre the main course you made him look very bad hell hath no fury like a bureaucrat screwed hell kill you too no ill get forgiven hell say he authorized me in secret or some bull hell be clean hell have his traitor in his pocket the company wont let you land at their airfield she said i stood up i can be talking with howell in five minutes ill have clearance you werent always so stubborn where did you have the baby tell me and well keep going on to new york she decided to believe me strasbourg a private clinic called les saintes on the tenth of january he was given the name of julien daniel besson who took him a woman id been told the broker was a woman who does daniel look like babies all look like winston churchill at first but he has your eyes sam what is this baby brokers name edward didnt tell me i dont know thats how they kept me in their pocket it was insurance and they gave you money for my son our you just lost the right to call him yours lucy dont you ever call him yours again no dont say that you let them take him to sell him jesus she stared at me and she knew the deal between us was dead that i was never going to let her go without having my child whats going to happen to me she said you tell me everything and then you tell the company everything i want my name cleared your name is never ever going to be cleared sam there will always be someone in power who believes you knew that maybe you didnt do anything wrong but you knew what i was doing and you kept your mouth shut either hoping that i would stop or i would never be caught youre a good husband that made you a bad agent then ill focus on being good at my job where is edward delivering the gun chips where in new york you cooperate with me and ill be your advocate with the company she considered this and for several long seconds there was only the whine of the engines at the new yankee stadium since edward tried to kill me im assuming he thought that you were going to capture me and he wanted the plan protected he wont change it if he thinks im dead what time is this meeting at eight tonight as the game starts the seasons just begun i stared at her i thought of our last morning together our lives so normal our lives such a lie that it clenched the air in my lungs she said very softly do you remember once that i asked you if we knew a day was our final day together what you would say to me i remembered id say anything but goodbye i never wanted to say goodbye to you she looked at me and i couldnt tell if there were tears in her eyes or if it was the dim light of the cabin i think ill say my goodbyes now sam lucy and i walked free of the private plane our papers had been stamped and the custom official waved us through thank you kenneth and flight crew borders do they even matter anymore we exited the airport and walked along the short service road a car pulled up and i pushed her into the backseat and then followed id phoned ahead hello august holdwine said mr nice guy you just committed professional suicide lucy said as he pulled the car away from the curb career advice from you is rich he said how are you lucy i should have married you not him lucy said be nice august is going to get the credit for your capture i said youre not surrendering to the company lucy jerked her head to look at me no im going to go get our kid thanks again august august glanced at lucy in the rearview i always thought it was iffy to trust you i hate being right so often i could feel the defensiveness rising in her youre betraying the company yourself going out of bounds to help sam august said you got a limited imagination lucy certain people in the company might entirely approve of what im doing as long as it nabs you lucy opened and then shut her mouth you mean we have help i asked no you have me august said i wasnt sure how tough we could be i was injured and august had been shot in the arm we werent exactly a pair of badasses lucy seemed to study these words as if they hung in the air above augusts head wheres howell i asked summoned to langley whatever technology you found these guys have it has set off a firestorm the rendezvous is in one hour lucy said i suggest you drive a little faster since youre in such a hurry to be a hero there has to be a reason theyre meeting at yankee stadium august said a demonstration i said you want to prove a bullet can truly without fail seek out a single target among thousands a crowd is the best way to make your point without a doubt so whos the target any of the star players august said and the governor was scheduled to throw out the first pitch i checked but he had to cancel i looked at her thinking of the photos of the kids id seen on zaids computer kids are they going to kill a kid at this game lucy said i told you i dont know if theres even a demonstration thats between edward and the buyer it seems awfully risky to me i said to august do you have a liaison with the yankees security or police detail yes but i ask them anything theyll want to know my source and im supposed to be on leave do they know that i imagine not say the tips anonymous call find out if there are any groups of kids being brought in august phoned his contact hey lieutenant garcia this is august holdwine at the manhattan cia office pause yeah im fine thanks im kind of dodging channels here but i thought i better talk direct to you do you have any groups of kids coming in for todays game we picked up some chatter that talked about targeting a kid he listened okay no i dont have more than that he listened some more can you give me a rundown if edward sees you coming our son is dead lucy said just so you know not if he gets caught first i wouldnt be willing to risk it she said as though i were the bad parent august got off the phone twentyseven kids groups there today everything from orphans being brought in from a catholic orphanage in queens to boy scouts and girl scouts and prepschool groups theyre going to put extra security around them all but garcia needs to know more we dont have more this is getting peoples attention sam august glanced at me in the car i suspect the police are going to want to talk to me as soon as i get to the stadium i cant back you up if im chatting up garcia theyll want threat assessments good i raised my hand like a cop can stop that bullet once its fired nothing can lucy said we find him before he ever fires i said you risk our child to save a strangers life lucy said i should have killed you in amsterdam sam at least our son would be safe if youre wrong i had been so wrong about so much i couldnt be wrong now i expect hell be alone edward said into the phone do you have the sample for him in case i need it yes i took the precaution ill see you shortly edward and i look forward to the demonstration yes i think the whole world will be impressed edward said bright sunshine kissed new york city the sky gleamed a faultless blue he felt happy he was nearly done with his trudge along a very dark road he missed yasmin to his surprise he had made her shaped her into the person most useful to him and he wondered if he had given her up too easily ah soon he would have enough money where he could attract a woman who required much less effort to bend to his will a marvelous day it was to prove that fear works wonders it was a gorgeous afternoon in new york the sun smiled down like a saint august already had our tickets and we moved through the crowd augusts phone rang he answered and listened yeah i dont have more information garcia kids credible i dont know how much you cant take the risk though yeah what what um okay he hung up the phone garcia had to go hes dealing with the governors security detail you said he uncancelled the governor is here to throw out the pitch august said his son apparently begged him to do it the governor of new york was in his late forties a man named hapscomb popular but with no plans for higher office thats it i said surely if you want to demo a weapon you kill a prominent person but killing a governorit lacked the impact of killing a president or a religious leader it seemed a smaller stage for edwards ambitions especially with such a powerful weapon and none of the people in the photos were politicians at least none that i recognized we watched thousands of people settling into their seats the game would begin in minutes i scanned the ring of the stadium looking for a likely spot for a sniper to fire from but the security details would already be watching those lucy saw what i was doing and shook her head as long as hes in range edward doesnt have to set up a careful position to shoot the governor she said he can just fire the bullet will do most of the work if theres nothing in its way if hes delivering the guns here too he needs seclusion i held her between us a firm grip on her arm steering her through the crowd august on the other side of her fifty guns fifty bullets fifty states fifty governors but none of the people in the files were governors this is the product demo isnt it and then the buyer will move onto the next targets youve missed the other timing advantage of this gun she said god i thought you were smarter sam any fool could assassinate fools had been doing it for centuries but nowwith fifty guns all at once you can hit many targets i said mass assassination you kill a governor security goes up on all the others you kill them all at the same time and what would it do to this country lucy said oh it would be a shock wave how do you fight a weapon like this and psychologically what does it do every governor dead within minutes of each other their replacements dead in another month no one is really going to be rushing for those jobs then are they you have a profound shock to the political system if you cannot guarantee that leaders stay alive what does it do to america if the leadership pool gets rapidly thinned if no one will lead because theyre going to be killed it makes the world weaker it makes it easier for the criminal networks to do their job to commit more crimes maybe even to take over she smiled you know the crooks run parts of colombia of moldova of pakistan why not here why not in the west whos this buyer i watched august hurrying down toward the field he hadnt waited to hear more he was heading straight for the field and the security detail for governor hapscomb i scanned the stadium let me go and ill tell you where he is lucy said the baby no i mean edward you cant have it both ways sam im keeping where the baby is a secret she knew she knew and she knew where the meeting site was god damn it tell me i grabbed her shoulders lucy for gods sakes dont do this tell me hey buddy a deep voice rumbled behind me i glanced over my shoulder three guys thicknecked short haircuts five hundred pounds of muscle glaring at me you dont need to talk to the lady that way let go of her arm the good citizen said im arresting her i lied the last thing i wanted was attention i made my voice easy calming authoritative you didnt talk to her like a cop you let her go he said not backing down lucy began to moan as if in pain the slugger slugged me hard i saw it coming and ducked back but he still connected with my face lucy launched a hard kick that caught me on the collarbone i let go she ran i saw her heading toward the large section of private suites it might be perfect elevated private lower a window fire leave in the resultant chaos the good citizen grabbed me asshole youre done i saw two police officers racing toward us so i played the victim i screamed please help me help me hes gone crazy every bit of subtlety helps it shifted the cops reaction ever so slightly the guy tackling me looked the bigger threat you never want to look the bigger threat but of course the cops were going to take us both down they couldnt risk doing otherwise the copsone heavy one skinnytook us down i gave the skinny one a hard sharp blow and he was on his knees i seized the gun from his holster slamming my fist into the back of his throat and ran into the crowd the gun high the other cop couldnt risk the shot not with the crowd between us i saw lucy then i heard the roar rising from the crowd i risked a glance toward the field and saw august bolting out onto the field as the governor stood on the mound with a teenage boy presumably his son ready to throw out the first pitch and the realization hit me like a bolt his son his son it wasnt the governor at all and it wouldnt be all the governors to come it would be their kids their husbands their wives next to the stadiums main outdoor private suite area an interior bar with a view of first base was closed for repairs no place is more deserted in a stadium than a closed bar inside the buyer looked down over the field and said lets get started time to begin an extraordinary audition edward thought in a flash of the first time under the lights his brain burning with the right lines eager to pretend to be a whole new person edward lowered the window of the closed bar slightly and placed the rifle into the gap there was no rifle sight he didnt need one but he didnt want to risk the demo going poorly so he aimed toward the mound and saw the big blond man barreling out onto the field deftly stiffarming a policeman who tried to stop him interference no edward pulled the trigger without hesitation governor hapscomb saw the runner screaming that he was a cia agentplowing past an errant security line heard the rising gasp of the crowd and had he been alone he would have simply stared his attacker down but he had his thirteenyearold son bryant with him and he could not bear the thought of bryant being harmed so he threw himself on his surprised son in case the crazy in the nice suit was armed just as the bullet shot out over thousands of spectators its nanosensors seeking the one true match among thousands i saw the flash at the edge of the mainlevel outdoor private suites through a slightly opened window near the seating area right where lucy was headed a few rows above us i caught her and pressed the cops gun against her ribs i wrenched her around so i could see the mound screams erupted from the massed crowd the governor and his son were down on the mound not moving august buried under a pile of police let me go she screamed let me go and ill tell you where the baby is just tell me i hadnt stopped edwards bullet id failed she threw a fist against my jaw i wouldnt let her go and we slammed into the railing sam capra the buyer said there edward tore his stare away from the mound he couldnt tell if the hapscomb boy was down or not sweat exploded down his ribs he ejected the chip and slipped the new one in the gun whirred the match being made the bullet given its own soul the coding process would be done when the green light appeared he couldnt wait edward raised the rifle and fired tell me i said clutching her close we spun her fighting me daniels in and then she stiffened i heard the impact of metal hitting flesh and she fell in my arms no i screamed no this hasnt gone well edward had to pick his words carefully or the deal would fold i think the governor took the bullet meant for the child he covered him just as i fired this isnt a normal situation since wed usually strike without warning he turned to his buyer and the knife flashed across his neck edward staggered tried to close up the wound with his hand as the blood gushed pointless he fell against the wall and thought no no it hurts and im afraid im afraid the buyer stepped away from the spray of blood he could see panic arising not only from those close to the field but in a nearby section where edwards second bullet had scored no sign of lucy no sign of sam capra he collected the briefcase of dna chips technology could always be refined this demo might have been too extreme fine time was on his side resources were on his side there were networks of rogue programmers hackers scientists assassins all eager to help him refine bahjat zaids prototype he had the chips and the rest of the guns would arrive in the next few days he could collect the shipment and even if those prototypes were lost he could recreate as many guns as he needed based on the gun he had and he hadnt transferred the funds he folded the gun it telescoped down into a wide metal tube which he put in his briefcase there were worse days he stepped out the panicked crowd rushing pellmell and no one noticed him hurrying toward an exit with brisk efficiency thousands began to pour out of the stands the police trying to effect an orderly evacuation he was close to the gate when he heard a voice say hello howell howell kept his bags close to him his pinched frown told me he could feel the gun in his ribs move and ill kill you i said so turning yourself in dont bull me youre the buyer howell took a deep breath kill me and mila dies shed call that a fair trade i said he kept walking so did i i was careful to keep the gun under a fold of my jacket you left your wife to die howell asked shes not my wife anymore ah who are you howell who are you really who do you work for the company no you dont the company hired zaid to develop these guns you would have gotten them without stealing them hed used edward to steal them of course if the guns were stolen before they were ever delivered then howell would never be suspected hed chased me to keep me from tracking down the guns or perhaps hed hoped to doublecross edward and steal them before he had to pay millions for them using me to see if i could locate the trail do his dirty work parttime he amended i have another job we can use a man like you novem soles you asked me if id heard of it because you wanted to know if shed talked not because you were on its trail you were protecting novem soles sam that deal god everybody wanted to make a deal i was sick of deals no where is mila now we were out of the gates streaming into the parking lot shes being questioned we want to know about you the same way you want to know about us you got lucy to turn she worked for you and that was worse hed used her shed gotten her orders from someone inside the company i believed her she hadnt known it was a bomb shed planted in the london office until that final minute when edward left to make sure the detonator worked and she called me howell gave me the equivalent of a shrug where is my son i dont know dont lie to me you will simply tell me where my son is actually i dont know your wife handled all the arrangements for the baby broker thats not what she said and you believed her howell cleared his throat this is my car we got inside it him sliding over from the passenger side me keeping the gun on him sitting in the backseat yeah now i do youre the asshole howell youre the king of the assholes i can make your troubles go away sam i can clear your name i can stop being your inquisitor and be your champion we get rid of mila you forget about the guns i can get the company to say you infiltrated a dangerous group in holland well say you were on a secret job and we expose your wife as the well traitor she is was he turned his flat stare onto me i can even help you find your child well pretend in other words that it never happened his pet phrase hed used with me in that distant prison where i had been the only inmate yes he said no i said and i shot him the bullet sprayed through his heart and he jerked the sound of the shot was loud but no one was right by the car then immediately afterward a group of boy scouts hurried by and they glanced at me and howell sitting in the car he stayed sitting up his head down a bit like hed decided to grab a nap like the shooting to use a phrase he favored had never happened i just got out and walked away from him sifting into the crowd let me go now id let it all go everything all of it gone when a company exec dies in a baseball stadium parking lot right after an elected leader is assassinated the case gets taken from the nypd and the company takes over the investigation the company was most interested in the nano bullets and the gun and the shipment manifest tied to a container of cigarettes the fifty people id seen on zaids computer were indeed the kids and spouses of americas governors no one is targeting them now and they sleep safe in their college dorms their beds at home their cradles including bryant hapscomb shielded by his fathers body the bullet couldnt change course fast enough thousands attended the governors funeral he died for his child although the world believed him to have been the target it did not occur to anyone that a thirteenyearold boy was the real target and that the governor simply threw himself on his child covering him in the same millisecond that edward pulled the trigger a few days after the shootings at the stadium i sat in the round tables new york bar an elegant space called bluecut drinking a boylan bottleworks ginger ale my favorite soda waiting for mila to show up the bar sat on the edge of bryant park not far from the hubbub of times square and it was a beauty perfect connemara marble curve fine chairs the right tools with which to lift cocktail creation to an art a glance even in the early afternoon told me that it was a destination every person at the bar every person at a table had their own story soft jazzbut not light jazzfilled the air played on a grand piano by an africanamerican woman with a shock of blond hair and fingers delicate enough to impress monk or mozart i liked this bluecut bar a lot but i felt itchy waiting here i had things to do i ordered a glenfiddich for mila and had it waiting for her she had been kept in a rental office near a port shed been found by a member of a salvadoran cleaning crew howell had been questioning her the burn marks on the soles of her feet were taking a long while to heal august slid onto the stool he pointed at milas drink can i just down that its for my friend mila but go ahead if she drinks that shes my friend too i thought it best not to mention that mila was the one whod grazed him with a bullet in amsterdam go ahead but its eleven in the morning i said try the ginger ale its perfectly cold and good but whisky means good tidings he said i thought whisky was for wakes one mans wake is another mans good tidings august said he cupped his hands around the glass the police identified you you know lucy getting shot got captured on a security camera they know you didnt do it i know they havent bothered me the company sat on it it took a lot of grease and muscle and loss of face nypd is quite particular about its officers being bested in terms of control of their firearms i sipped my ginger ale so now the company is shielding me theyweoh hell august said none of us are fools while i was being suffocated under the weight of new yorks finest you were killing howell if i did theyre ignoring it hes the biggest embarrassment to the company since since lucy you can say it officially there are no prints then it didnt happen like howell always said august cleared his throat studied his drink took a nice healthy sip the company has deputized me to offer you your job back why you they think youll only listen to a drinking buddy i would only listen to you august you were a real friend to me i clinked my green bottle against his whisky but i have to find my kid and the company except for you was quick to think me a traitor not a nice vote of confidence sam you must understand i do i dont want them they had no faith in me august savored his drink over several small sips this is why i needed the drink youre a bad influence i can only hope you are going to find gainful employment i dont care about a job i have to find my kid how edward is dead howell is dead lucy may never wake up lucy was lost in a limbo between life and death and i couldnt decide how i felt about that edwards final bullet had left her in a coma the doctors in the cia hospital could give me no real hope that she would wake up but the powers that be wanted her kept alive she was a potential source about the mystery of novem soles so she lay beribboned with wires and tubes broken maybe she dreamed endlessly of her precious money maybe she dreamed of me and our child i lean on the right people back in europe ill find him the company isnt going to let you go quietly into that good night august lowered his voice theyre going to keep a watch on your passport theyre going to be shadowing you when you might not expect it this whole howell working for a secret group has them shaken theyd like to pretend it isnt as frightening as it actually is they want to know what youre doing who youre going after they can try and find out as long as they dont get in my way are you sticking with them yes i must get my semisuspect hands on my retirement benefits august shot me a sidelong look im sure though well see each other again im sure too he got up and fished in his wallet i got it i said least i could do yes but i have a job he said no really i got it thank you august you will find your son sam i know you will i know i will i watched august leave and wondered if anyone was shadowing him i could smell the whisky left in augusts glass and i ordered one for myself i was just starting on its replacement when mila slid onto the stool hello sam mila i promised we would have a drink together when all was done her bruises were healing but there was a sadness in her eyes instead of the steel i was used to in her gaze i gestured at the bartender he brought her a glenfiddich without being told i said that doesnt go with painkillers americans have obsessive worry about drug interactions so riskaverse with such a nice place why did you go drink at ollies i would like to buy ollies bar as he said he wont sell two bars in one city brooklyn and manhattan are two different concepts she glanced around oh yes i like bars bluecut is really marvelous i like bars too good she said would you like this one i glanced at her i like this one just fine you misunderstand would you like to own it bluecut and all the bars we have the adrenaline in london the rode prins in amsterdam taverne chevalier in brussels we have many more in las vegas sydney miami paris moscow all around the world i think were up to thirty she had to be kidding so i laughed sure you and i can go have a drink in each one after i have my son back sam my employers are interested in retaining your services you did extraordinary work for us was bahjat zaid part of your round table one of the rich and powerful members she didnt show surprise that i knew the round table name she said yes he was he supplied us in the past he wasnt such a nice guy he was a desperate man trying to save a daughter he made poor choices i started to shake my head but mila deserved better than scorn i dont even know who you people are and i remembered what id said in london to the suits about networks that came together only to do work snapped apart and reformed in new shapes some so powerful and with such reach that they had infiltrated government id talked about criminal networks that way perhaps the round table was such an informal network but a force for good novem soles could be its opposite the dark to its light together we stopped edward we stopped howell you know were on the side of the angels ive had enough mystery i have enough mystery i have to find my son sam do you trust me yes that wasnt a hard decision i did trust mila she was halfway to crazy and she was unpredictable but i could see a core of decency that ran through her clear as iron in stone theres a reason certain people inside the company dont want you to find your child she said quietly what she slid a piece of paper over to me it read agent capra can only be controlled by his desire to find his child all files on capra are classified due to and then long black lines of redaction that is from a highestclassification file whoever has taken your child the powers that be wish to keep that persons identity a secret out of a desire to control you i stared at her i dont believe this i think the company would like to help you i am not at all indicting the cia but there is a secret cabal inside it i believe connected to howell perhaps he was only their tool these people will block you at every turn if you try and work inside with them your quest for daniel will be futile she took a long savoring sip of her whisky i do not like being the bearer of bad news why would this be so but then i thought of my work in london criminal networks tied into governments it had happened across europe now it was happening here because we dont yet know all their secrets sam lucys and howells maybe even yours i dont have secrets sometimes you dont know what you dont know she said what does that mean you need to find your son we need your talents from time to time you need a cover so i propose this to the public you will be given the ownership of the bars all of them run them keep them profitable she smiled the bars give you a reason to go wherever your search for your son or wherever our assignments take you a cover that the company cannot question you do after all have a background in working in bars and you need gainful employment you will do jobs for us when needed jobs that require your skill set your vision your sense of action it was a profound compliment theyll still suspect and now youre saying im working against the cia no against someoneprobably severalinside it who have no loyalty to the cia or to your government or to humanity for that matter have you not wondered if howell had a master only mila could say the word master and have it sound cruel rather than funny this novem soles howell was their boy even with his high rank he must have been nothing to them just a flunky being paid worse will come i think i studied the bottom of my whisky glass we will help you i swear to you sam please say yes here she slipped me a dvd security tape from the clinic lucy said she had the baby at you will see a tall dark woman leaving lucys room carrying a baby the day after your child was born i didnt dare to breathe we can help you id this woman pick up the thread find the line i thought just as i had raced to find it in the parkour run on that longago morning in london the last normal morning of my life find the line to have a life again i could take this secret life for a while to find my son i felt the old tickle of adrenaline begin again along my spine curling into my brain i stood turned to face the small scattering of customers in the bluecut i jumped without a wobble onto the fine leather bar stool and cleared my throat the elegant piano player stopped the sparse but cool midday crowd looked up at me startled i put on my hosts smile and held my whisky glass up in a toast ladies and gentlemen i just acquired this bar the drinks are on the house
