dan brown digital fortress for my parents my mentors and heroes a debt of gratitude to my editors at st martins press thomas dunne and the exceptionally talented melissa jacobs to my agents in new york george wieser olga wieser and jake elwell to all those who read and contributed to the manuscript along the way and especially to my wife blythe for her enthusiasm and patience also a quiet thank you to the two faceless exnsa cryptographers who made invaluable contributions via anonymous remailers without them this book would not have been written prologue plaza de espana seville spain am it is said that in death all things become clear ensei tankado now knew it was true as he clutched his chest and fell to the ground in pain he realized the horror of his mistake people appeared hovering over him trying to help but tankado did not want helpit was too late for that trembling he raised his left hand and held his fingers outward look at my hand the faces around him stared but he could tell they did not understand on his finger was an engraved golden ring for an instant the markings glimmered in the andalusian sun ensei tankado knew it was the last light he would ever see chapter they were in the smoky mountains at their favorite bedandbreakfast david was smiling down at her what do you say gorgeous marry me looking up from their canopy bed she knew he was the one forever as she stared into his deepgreen eyes somewhere in the distance a deafening bell began to ring it was pulling him away she reached for him but her arms clutched empty air it was the sound of the phone that fully awoke susan fletcher from her dream she gasped sat up in bed and fumbled for the receiver hello susan its david did i wake you she smiled rolling over in bed i was just dreaming of you come over and play he laughed its still dark out mmm she moaned sensuously then definitely come over and play we can sleep in before we head north david let out a frustrated sigh thats why im calling its about our trip ive got to postpone susan was suddenly wide awake what im sorry ive got to leave town ill be back by tomorrow we can head up first thing in the morning well still have two days but i made reservations susan said hurt i got our old room at stone manor i know but tonight was supposed to be specialto celebrate six months you do remember were engaged dont you susan he sighed i really cant go into it now theyve got a car waiting ill call you from the plane and explain everything plane she repeated whats going on why would the university its not the university ill phone and explain later ive really got to go theyre calling for me ill be in touch i promise david she cried whats but it was too late david had hung up susan fletcher lay awake for hours waiting for him to call back the phone never rang later that afternoon susan sat dejected in the tub she submerged herself in the soapy water and tried to forget stone manor and the smoky mountains where could he be she wondered why hasnt he called gradually the water around her went from hot to lukewarm and finally to cold she was about to get out when her cordless phone buzzed to life susan bolted upright sloshing water on the floor as she grappled for the receiver shed left on the sink david its strathmore the voice replied susan slumped oh she was unable to hide her disappointment good afternoon commander hoping for a younger man the voice chuckled no sir susan said embarrassed its not how it sure it is he laughed david beckers a good man dont ever lose him thank you sir the commanders voice turned suddenly stern susan im calling because i need you in here pronto she tried to focus its saturday sir we dont usually i know he said calmly its an emergency susan sat up emergency she had never heard the word cross commander strathmores lips an emergency in crypto she couldnt imagine yyes sir she paused ill be there as soon as i can make it sooner strathmore hung up susan fletcher stood wrapped in a towel and dripped on the neatly folded clothes shed set out the night before hiking shorts a sweater for the cool mountain evenings and the new lingerie shed bought for the nights depressed she went to her closet for a clean blouse and skirt an emergency in crypto as she went downstairs susan wondered how the day could get much worse she was about to find out chapter thirty thousand feet above a deadcalm ocean david becker stared miserably from the learjet s small oval window hed been told the phone on board was out of order and hed never had a chance to call susan what am i doing here he grumbled to himself but the answer was simplethere were men to whom you just didnt say no mr becker the loudspeaker crackled well be arriving in half an hour becker nodded gloomily to the invisible voice wonderful he pulled the shade and tried to sleep but he could only think of her chapter susans volvo sedan rolled to a stop in the shadow of the tenfoothigh barbed cyclone fence a young guard placed his hand on the roof id please susan obliged and settled in for the usual halfminute wait the officer ran her card through a computerized scanner finally he looked up thank you ms fletcher he gave an imperceptible sign and the gate swung open half a mile ahead susan repeated the entire procedure at an equally imposing electrified fence come on guys ive only been through here a million times as she approached the final checkpoint a stocky sentry with two attack dogs and a machine gun glanced down at her license plate and waved her through she followed canine road for another yards and pulled into employee lot c unbelievable she thought twentysix thousand employees and a twelvebilliondollar budget youd think they could make it through the weekend without me susan gunned the car into her reserved spot and killed the engine after crossing the landscaped terrace and entering the main building she cleared two more internal checkpoints and finally arrived at the windowless tunnel that led to the new wing a voicescan booth blocked her entry national security agency nsa crypto facility authorized personnel only the armed guard looked up afternoon ms fletcher susan smiled tiredly hi john didnt expect you today yeah me neither she leaned toward the parabolic microphone susan fletcher she stated clearly the computer instantly confirmed the frequency concentrations in her voice and the gate clicked open she stepped through the guard admired susan as she began her walk down the cement causeway he noticed that her strong hazel eyes seemed distant today but her cheeks had a flushed freshness and her shoulderlength auburn hair looked newly blown dry trailing her was the faint scent of johnsons baby powder his eyes fell the length of her slender torsoto her white blouse with the bra barely visible beneath to her kneelength khaki skirt and finally to her legs susan fletchers legs hard to imagine they support a iq he mused to himself he stared after her a long time finally he shook his head as she disappeared in the distance as susan reached the end of the tunnel a circular vaultlike door blocked her way the enormous letters read crypto sighing she placed her hand inside the recessed cipher box and entered her fivedigit pin seconds later the twelveton slab of steel began to revolve she tried to focus but her thoughts reeled back to him david becker the only man shed ever loved the youngest full professor at georgetown university and a brilliant foreignlanguage specialist he was practically a celebrity in the world of academia born with an eidetic memory and a love of languages hed mastered six asian dialects as well as spanish french and italian his university lectures on etymology and linguistics were standingroom only and he invariably stayed late to answer a barrage of questions he spoke with authority and enthusiasm apparently oblivious to the adoring gazes of his starstruck coeds becker was darka rugged youthful thirtyfive with sharp green eyes and a wit to match his strong jaw and taut features reminded susan of carved marble over six feet tall becker moved across a squash court faster than any of his colleagues could comprehend after soundly beating his opponent he would cool off by dousing his head in a drinking fountain and soaking his tuft of thick black hair then still dripping hed treat his opponent to a fruit shake and a bagel as with all young professors davids university salary was modest from time to time when he needed to renew his squash club membership or restring his old dunlop with gut he earned extra money by doing translating work for government agencies in and around washington it was on one of those jobs that hed met susan it was a crisp morning during fall break when becker returned from a morning jog to his threeroom faculty apartment to find his answering machine blinking he downed a quart of orange juice as he listened to the playback the message was like many he receiveda government agency requesting his translating services for a few hours later that morning the only strange thing was that becker had never heard of the organization theyre called the national security agency becker said calling a few of his colleagues for background the reply was always the same you mean the national security council becker checked the message no they said agency the nsa never heard of em becker checked the gao directory and it showed no listing either puzzled becker called one of his old squash buddies an expolitical analyst turned research clerk at the library of congress david was shocked by his friends explanation apparently not only did the nsa exist but it was considered one of the most influential government organizations in the world it had been gathering global electronic intelligence data and protecting us classified information for over half a century only percent of americans were even aware it existed nsa his buddy joked stands for no such agency with a mixture of apprehension and curiosity becker accepted the mysterious agencys offer he drove the thirtyseven miles to their eightysixacre headquarters hidden discreetly in the wooded hills of fort meade maryland after passing through endless security checks and being issued a sixhour holographic guest pass he was escorted to a plush research facility where he was told he would spend the afternoon providing blind support to the cryptography divisionan elite group of mathematical brainiacs known as the codebreakers for the first hour the cryptographers seemed unaware becker was even there they hovered around an enormous table and spoke a language becker had never heard they spoke of stream ciphers selfdecimated generators knapsack variants zero knowledge protocols unicity points becker observed lost they scrawled symbols on graph paper pored over computer printouts and continuously referred to the jumble of text on the overhead projector jhdjajkhdhmadoertwtjlwjgj jhalsfnhkhhhfafohhdfgaffjwe ohisdjfdhhhrtyfhlf jspjfjihjyhfiewrt jojrhroqjteutqefqeoujw uyihjtpwfiajerqujrgu ivjpduwhpertugvjwpeikkc mffuerhfgvqikjrmgunhvsoer rkyupoikiojpfqwerqi eventually one of them explained what becker had already surmised the scrambled text was a codea cipher textgroups of numbers and letters representing encrypted words the cryptographers job was to study the code and extract from it the original message or cleartext the nsa had called becker because they suspected the original message was written in mandarin chinese he was to translate the symbols as the cryptographers decrypted them for two hours becker interpreted an endless stream of mandarin symbols but each time he gave them a translation the cryptographers shook their heads in despair apparently the code was not making sense eager to help becker pointed out that all the characters theyd shown him had a common traitthey were also part of the kanji language instantly the bustle in the room fell silent the man in charge a lanky chainsmoker named morante turned to becker in disbelief you mean these symbols have multiple meanings becker nodded he explained that kanji was a japanese writing system based on modified chinese characters hed been giving mandarin translations because thats what theyd asked for jesus christ morante coughed lets try the kanji like magic everything fell into place the cryptographers were duly impressed but nonetheless they still made becker work on the characters out of sequence its for your own safety morante said this way you wont know what youre translating becker laughed then he noticed nobody else was laughing when the code finally broke becker had no idea what dark secrets hed helped reveal but one thing was for certainthe nsa took codebreaking seriously the check in beckers pocket was more than an entire months university salary on his way back out through the series of security check points in the main corridor beckers exit was blocked by a guard hanging up a phone mr becker wait here please whats the problem becker had not expected the meeting to take so long and he was running late for his standing saturday afternoon squash match the guard shrugged head of crypto wants a word shes on her way out now she becker laughed he had yet to see a female inside the nsa is that a problem for you a womans voice asked from behind him becker turned and immediately felt himself flush he eyed the id card on the womans blouse the head of the nsas cryptography division was not only a woman but an attractive woman at that no becker fumbled i just susan fletcher the woman smiled holding out her slender hand becker took it david becker congratulations mr becker i hear you did a fine job today might i chat with you about it becker hesitated actually im in a bit of a rush at the moment he hoped spurning the worlds most powerful intelligence agency wasnt a foolish act but his squash match started in fortyfive minutes and he had a reputation to uphold david becker was never late for squash class maybe but never squash ill be brief susan fletcher smiled right this way please ten minutes later becker was in the nsas commissary enjoying a popover and cranberry juice with the nsas lovely head cryptographer susan fletcher it quickly became evident to david that the thirtyeightyearolds highranking position at the nsa was no flukeshe was one of the brightest women he had ever met as they discussed codes and codebreaking becker found himself struggling to keep upa new and exciting experience for him an hour later after becker had obviously missed his squash match and susan had blatantly ignored three pages on the intercom both of them had to laugh there they were two highly analytical minds presumably immune to irrational infatuationsbut somehow while they sat there discussing linguistic morphology and pseudorandom number generators they felt like a couple of teenagerseverything was fireworks susan never did get around to the real reason shed wanted to speak to david beckerto offer him a trial post in their asiatic cryptography division it was clear from the passion with which the young professor spoke about teaching that he would never leave the university susan decided not to ruin the mood by talking business she felt like a schoolgirl all over again nothing was going to spoil it and nothing did their courtship was slow and romanticstolen escapes whenever their schedules permitted long walks through the georgetown campus latenight cappuccinos at merluttis occasional lectures and concerts susan found herself laughing more than shed ever thought possible it seemed there was nothing david couldnt twist into a joke it was a welcome release from the intensity of her post at the nsa one crisp autumn afternoon they sat in the bleachers watching georgetown soccer get pummeled by rutgers what sport did you say you play susan teased zucchini becker groaned its called squash she gave him a dumb look its like zucchini he explained but the courts smaller susan pushed him georgetowns left wing sent a cornerkick sailing out of bounds and a boo went up from the crowd the defensemen hurried back downfield how about you becker asked play any sports im a black belt in stairmaster becker cringed i prefer sports you can win susan smiled overachiever are we georgetowns star defenseman blocked a pass and there was a communal cheer in the stands susan leaned over and whispered in davids ear doctor he turned and eyed her lost doctor she repeated say the first thing that comes to mind becker looked doubtful word associations standard nsa procedure i need to know who im with she eyed him sternly doctor becker shrugged seuss susan gave him a frown okay try this one kitchen he didnt hesitate bedroom susan arched her eyebrows coyly okay how about this cat gut becker fired back gut yeah catgut squash racquet string of champions thats pleasant she groaned your diagnosis becker inquired susan thought a minute youre a childish sexually frustrated squash fiend becker shrugged sounds about right it went on like that for weeks over dessert at allnight diners becker would ask endless questions where had she learned mathematics how did she end up at the nsa how did she get so captivating susan blushed and admitted shed been a late bloomer lanky and awkward with braces through her late teens susan said her aunt clara had once told her gods apology for susans plainness was to give her brains a premature apology becker thought susan explained that her interest in cryptography had started in junior high school the president of the computer club a towering eighth grader named frank gutmann typed her a love poem and encrypted it with a numbersubstitution scheme susan begged to know what it said frank flirtatiously refused susan took the code home and stayed up all night with a flashlight under her covers until she figured out the secretevery number represented a letter she carefully deciphered the code and watched in wonder as the seemingly random digits turned magically into beautiful poetry in that instant she knew shed fallen in lovecodes and cryptography would become her life almost twenty years later after getting her masters in mathematics from johns hopkins and studying number theory on a full scholarship from mit she submitted her doctoral thesis cryptographic methods protocols and algorithms for manual applications apparently her professor was not the only one who read it shortly afterward susan received a phone call and a plane ticket from the nsa everyone in cryptography knew about the nsa it was home to the best cryptographic minds on the planet each spring as the privatesector firms descended on the brightest new minds in the workforce and offered obscene salaries and stock options the nsa watched carefully selected their targets and then simply stepped in and doubled the best standing offer what the nsa wanted the nsa bought trembling with anticipation susan flew to washingtons dulles international airport where she was met by an nsa driver who whisked her off to fort meade there were fortyone others who had received the same phone call that year at twentyeight susan was the youngest she was also the only female the visit turned out to be more of a public relations bonanza and a barrage of intelligence testing than an informational session in the week that followed susan and six others where invited back although hesitant susan returned the group was immediately separated they underwent individual polygraph tests background searches handwriting analyses and endless hours of interviews including taped inquiries into their sexual orientations and practices when the interviewer asked susan if shed ever engaged in sex with animals she almost walked out but somehow the mystery carried her throughthe prospect of working on the cutting edge of code theory entering the puzzle palace and becoming a member of the most secretive club in the worldthe national security agency becker sat riveted by her stories they actually asked you if youd had sex with animals susan shrugged part of the routine background check well becker fought off a grin what did you say she kicked him under the table i told them no then she added and until last night it was true in susans eyes david was as close to perfect as she could imagine he only had one unfortunate quality every time they went out he insisted on picking up the check susan hated seeing him lay down a full days salary on dinner for two but becker was immovable susan learned not to protest but it still bothered her i make more money than i know what to do with she thought i should be paying nonetheless susan decided that aside from davids outdated sense of chivalry he was ideal he was compassionate smart funny and best of all he had a sincere interest in her work whether it was during trips to the smithsonian bike rides or burning spaghetti in susans kitchen david was perpetually curious susan answered what questions she could and gave david the general unclassified overview of the national security agency what david heard enthralled him founded by president truman at am on november the nsa had been the most clandestine intelligence agency in the world for almost fifty years the nsas sevenpage inception doctrine laid out a very concise agenda to protect us government communications and to intercept the communications of foreign powers the roof of the nsas main operations building was littered with over five hundred antennas including two large radomes that looked like enormous golf balls the building itself was mammothover two million square feet twice the size of cia headquarters inside were eight million feet of telephone wire and eighty thousand square feet of permanently sealed windows susan told david about comint the agencys global reconnaissance divisiona mindboggling collection of listening posts satellites spies and wiretaps around the globe thousands of communiques and conversations were intercepted every day and they were all sent to the nsas analysts for decryption the fbi cia and us foreign policy advisors all depended on the nsas intelligence to make their decisions becker was mesmerized and codebreaking where do you fit in susan explained how the intercepted transmissions often originated from dangerous governments hostile factions and terrorist groups many of whom were inside us borders their communications were usually encoded for secrecy in case they ended up in the wrong handswhich thanks to comint they usually did susan told david her job was to study the codes break them by hand and furnish the nsa with the deciphered messages this was not entirely true susan felt a pang of guilt over lying to her new love but she had no choice a few years ago it would have been accurate but things had changed at the nsa the whole world of cryptography had changed susans new duties were classified even to many in the highest echelons of power codes becker said fascinated how do you know where to start i mean how do you break them susan smiled you of all people should know its like studying a foreign language at first the text looks like gibberish but as you learn the rules defining its structure you can start to extract meaning becker nodded impressed he wanted to know more with merluttis napkins and concert programs as her chalkboard susan set out to give her charming new pedagogue a mini course in cryptography she began with julius caesars perfect square cipher box caesar she explained was the first codewriter in history when his footmessengers started getting ambushed and his secret communiques stolen he devised a rudimentary way to encrypt this directives he rearranged the text of his messages such that the correspondence looked senseless of course it was not each message always had a lettercount that was a perfect squaresixteen twentyfive one hundreddepending on how much caesar needed to say he secretly informed his officers that when a random message arrived they should transcribe the text into a square grid if they did and read toptobottom a secret message would magically appear over time caesars concept of rearranging text was adopted by others and modified to become more difficult to break the pinnacle of non computerbased encryption came during world war ii the nazis built a baffling encryption machine named enigma the device resembled an oldfashioned typewriter with brass interlocking rotors that revolved in intricate ways and shuffled cleartext into confounding arrays of seemingly senseless character groupings only by having another enigma machine calibrated the exact same way could the recipient break the code becker listened spellbound the teacher had become the student one night at a university performance of the nutcracker susan gave david his first basic code to break he sat through the entire intermission pen in hand puzzling over the elevenletter message hl fkzc vd lds finally just as the lights dimmed for the second half he got it to encode susan had simply replaced each letter of her message with the letter preceding it in the alphabet to decrypt the code all becker had to do was shift each letter one space forward in the alphabeta became b b became c and so on he quickly shifted the remaining letters he never imagined four little syllables could make him so happy im glad we met he quickly scrawled his response and handed it to her ld snn susan read it and beamed becker had to laugh he was thirtyfive yearsold and his heart was doing back flips hed never been so attracted to a woman in his life her delicate european features and soft brown eyes reminded him of an ad for estee lauder if susans body had been lanky and awkward as a teenager it sure wasnt now somewhere along the way she had developed a willowy graceslender and tall with full firm breasts and a perfectly flat abdomen david often joked that she was the first swimsuit model hed ever met with a doctorate in applied mathematics and number theory as the months passed they both started to suspect theyd found something that could last a lifetime theyd been together almost two years when out of the blue david proposed to her it was on a weekend trip to the smoky mountains they were lying on a big canopy bed at stone manor he had no ringhe just blurted it out thats what she loved about himhe was so spontaneous she kissed him long and hard he took her in his arms and slipped off her nightgown ill take that as a yes he said and they made love all night by the warmth of the fire that magical evening had been six months agobefore davids unexpected promotion to chairman of the modern language department their relationship had been in a downhill slide ever since chapter the crypto door beeped once waking susan from her depressing reverie the door had rotated past its fully open position and would be closed again in five seconds having made a complete degree rotation susan gathered her thoughts and stepped through the opening a computer made note of her entry although she had practically lived in crypto since its completion three years ago the sight of it still amazed her the main room was an enormous circular chamber that rose five stories its transparent domed ceiling towered feet at its central peak the plexiglas cupola was embedded with a polycarbonate mesha protective web capable of withstanding a twomegaton blast the screen filtered the sunlight into delicate lacework across the walls tiny particles of dust drifted upward in wide unsuspecting spiralscaptives of the domes powerful deionizing system the rooms sloping sides arched broadly at the top and then became almost vertical as they approached eye level then they became subtly translucent and graduated to an opaque black as they reached the floora shimmering expanse of polished black tile that shone with an eerie luster giving one the unsettling sensation that the floor was transparent black ice pushing through the center of the floor like the tip of a colossal torpedo was the machine for which the dome had been built its sleek black contour arched twentythree feet in the air before plunging back into the floor below curved and smooth it was as if an enormous killer whale had been frozen mid breach in a frigid sea this was transltr the single most expensive piece of computing equipment in the worlda machine the nsa swore did not exist like an iceberg the machine hid percent of its mass and power deep beneath the surface its secret was locked in a ceramic silo that went six stories straight downa rocketlike hull surrounded by a winding maze of catwalks cables and hissing exhaust from the freon cooling system the power generators at the bottom droned in a perpetual lowfrequency hum that gave the acoustics in crypto a dead ghostlike quality transltr like all great technological advancements had been a child of necessity during the s the nsa witnessed a revolution in telecommunications that would change the world of intelligence reconnaissance foreverpublic access to the internet more specifically the arrival of email criminals terrorists and spies had grown tired of having their phones tapped and immediately embraced this new means of global communication email had the security of conventional mail and the speed of the telephone since the transfers traveled through underground fiberoptic lines and were never transmitted into the airwaves they were entirely interceptproofat least that was the perception in reality intercepting email as it zipped across the internet was childs play for the nsas technogurus the internet was not the new home computer revelation that most believed it had been created by the department of defense three decades earlieran enormous network of computers designed to provide secure government communication in the event of nuclear war the eyes and ears of the nsa were old internet pros people conducting illegal business via email quickly learned their secrets were not as private as theyd thought the fbi dea irs and other us law enforcement agenciesaided by the nsas staff of wily hackersenjoyed a tidal wave of arrests and convictions of course when the computer users of the world found out the us government had open access to their email communications a cry of outrage went up even pen pals using email for nothing more than recreational correspondence found the lack of privacy unsettling across the globe entrepreneurial programmers began working on a way to keep email more secure they quickly found one and publickey encryption was born publickey encryption was a concept as simple as it was brilliant it consisted of easytouse homecomputer software that scrambled personal email messages in such a way that they were totally unreadable a user could write a letter and run it through the encryption software and the text would come out the other side looking like random nonsensetotally illegiblea code anyone intercepting the transmission found only an unreadable garble on the screen the only way to unscramble the message was to enter the senders passkeya secret series of characters that functioned much like a pin number at an automatic teller the passkeys were generally quite long and complex they carried all the information necessary to instruct the encryption algorithm exactly what mathematical operations to follow torecreate the original message a user could now send email in confidence even if the transmission was intercepted only those who were given the key could ever decipher it the nsa felt the crunch immediately the codes they were facing were no longer simple substitution ciphers crackable with pencil and graph paperthey were computergenerated hash functions that employed chaos theory and multiple symbolic alphabets to scramble messages into seemingly hopeless randomness at first the passkeys being used were short enough for the nsas computers to guess if a desired passkey had ten digits a computer was programmed to try every possibility between and sooner or later the computer hit the correct sequence this method of trialanderror guessing was known as brute force attack it was timeconsuming but mathematically guaranteed to work as the world got wise to the power of bruteforce codebreaking the passkeys started getting longer and longer the computer time needed to guess the correct key grew from weeks to months and finally to years by the s passkeys were over fifty characters long and employed the full character ascii alphabet of letters numbers and symbols the number of different possibilities was in the neighborhood of ten with zeros after it correctly guessing a passkey was as mathematically unlikely as choosing the correct grain of sand from a threemile beach it was estimated that a successful bruteforce attack on a standard sixtyfourbit key would take the nsas fastest computerthe topsecret crayjosephson iiover nineteen years to break by the time the computer guessed the key and broke the code the contents of the message would be irrelevant caught in a virtual intelligence blackout the nsa passed a topsecret directive that was endorsed by the president of the united states buoyed by federal funds and a carte blanche to do whatever was necessary to solve the problem the nsa set out to build the impossible the worlds first universal codebreaking machine despite the opinion of many engineers that the newly proposed codebreaking computer was impossible to build the nsa lived by its motto everything is possible the impossible just takes longer five years half a million manhours and billion later the nsa proved it once again the last of the three million stampsize processors was handsoldered in place the final internal programming was finished and the ceramic shell was welded shut transltr had been born although the secret internal workings of transltr were the product of many minds and were not fully understood by any one individual its basic principle was simple many hands make light work its three million processors would all work in parallelcounting upward at blinding speed trying every new permutation as they went the hope was that even codes with unthinkably colossal passkeys would not be safe from transltrs tenacity this multibilliondollar masterpiece would use the power of parallel processing as well as some highly classified advances in clear text assessment to guess passkeys and break codes it would derive its power not only from its staggering number of processors but also from new advances in quantum computingan emerging technology that allowed information to be stored as quantummechanical states rather than solely as binary data the moment of truth came on a blustery thursday morning in october the first live test despite uncertainty about how fast the machine would be there was one thing on which the engineers agreedif the processors all functioned in parallel transltr would be powerful the question was how powerful the answer came twelve minutes later there was a stunned silence from the handful in attendance when the printout sprang to life and delivered the cleartextthe broken code transltr had just located a sixtyfourcharacter key in a little over ten minutes almost a million times faster than the two decades it would have taken the nsas secondfastest computer led by the deputy director of operations commander trevor j strathmore the nsas office of production had triumphed transltr was a success in the interest of keeping their success a secret commander strathmore immediately leaked information that the project had been a complete failure all the activity in the crypto wing was supposedly an attempt to salvage their billion fiasco only the nsa elite knew the truthtransltr was cracking hundreds of codes every day with word on the street that computerencrypted codes were entirely unbreakableeven by the allpowerful nsathe secrets poured in drug lords terrorists and embezzlers alikeweary of having their cellular phone transmissions interceptedwere turning to the exciting new medium of encrypted email for instantaneous global communications never again would they have to face a grand jury and hear their own voice rolling off tape proof of some longforgotten cellular phone conversation plucked from the air by an nsa satellite intelligence gathering had never been easier codes intercepted by the nsa entered transltr as totally illegible ciphers and were spit out minutes later as perfectly readable cleartext no more secrets to make their charade of incompetence complete the nsa lobbied fiercely against all new computer encryption software insisting it crippled them and made it impossible for lawmakers to catch and prosecute the criminals civil rights groups rejoiced insisting the nsa shouldnt be reading their mail anyway encryption software kept rolling off the presses the nsa had lost the battleexactly as it had planned the entire electronic global community had been fooled or so it seemed chapter where is everyone susan wondered as she crossed the deserted crypto floor some emergency although most nsa departments were fully staffed seven days a week crypto was generally quiet on saturdays cryptographic mathematicians were by nature highstrung workaholics and there existed an unwritten rule that they take saturdays off except in emergencies codebreakers were too valuable a commodity at the nsa to risk losing them to burnout as susan traversed the floor transltr loomed to her right the sound of the generators eight stories below sounded oddly ominous today susan never liked being in crypto during off hours it was like being trapped alone in a cage with some grand futuristic beast she quickly made her way toward the commanders office strathmores glasswalled workstation nicknamed the fishbowl for its appearance when the drapes were open stood high atop a set of catwalk stairs on the back wall of crypto as susan climbed the grated steps she gazed upward at strathmores thick oak door it bore the nsa seala bald eagle fiercely clutching an ancient skeleton key behind that door sat one of the greatest men shed ever met commander strathmore the fiftysixyearold deputy director of operations was like a father to susan he was the one whod hired her and he was the one whod made the nsa her home when susan joined the nsa over a decade ago strathmore was heading the crypto development divisiona training ground for new cryptographersnew male cryptographers although strathmore never tolerated the hazing of anyone he was especially protective of his sole female staff member when accused of favoritism he simply replied with the truth susan fletcher was one of the brightest young recruits hed ever seen and he had no intention of losing her to sexual harassment one of the cryptographers foolishly decided to test strathmores resolve one morning during her first year susan dropped by the new cryptographers lounge to get some paperwork as she left she noticed a picture of herself on the bulletin board she almost fainted in embarrassment there she was reclining on a bed and wearing only panties as it turned out one of the cryptographers had digitally scanned a photo from a pornographic magazine and edited susans head onto someone elses body the effect had been quite convincing unfortunately for the cryptographer responsible commander strathmore did not find the stunt even remotely amusing two hours later a landmark memo went out employee carl austin terminated for inappropriate conduct from that day on nobody messed with her susan fletcher was commander strathmores golden girl but strathmores young cryptographers were not the only ones who learned to respect him early in his career strathmore made his presence known to his superiors by proposing a number of unorthodox and highly successful intelligence operations as he moved up the ranks trevor strathmore became known for his cogent reductive analyses of highly complex situations he seemed to have an uncanny ability to see past the moral perplexities surrounding the nsas difficult decisions and to act without remorse in the interest of the common good there was no doubt in anyones mind that strathmore loved his country he was known to his colleagues as a patriot and a visionary a decent man in a world of lies in the years since susans arrival at the nsa strathmore had skyrocketed from head of crypto development to secondincommand of the entire nsa now only one man outranked commander strathmore theredirector leland fontaine the mythical overlord of the puzzle palacenever seen occasionally heard and eternally feared he and strathmore seldom saw eye to eye and when they met it was like the clash of the titans fontaine was a giant among giants but strathmore didnt seem to care he argued his ideas to the director with all the restraint of an impassioned boxer not even the president of the united states dared challenge fontaine the way strathmore did one needed political immunity to do thator in strathmores case political indifference susan arrived at the top of the stairs before she could knock strathmores electronic door lock buzzed the door swung open and the commander waved her in thanks for coming susan i owe you one not at all she smiled as she sat opposite his desk strathmore was a rangy thickfleshed man whose muted features somehow disguised his hardnosed efficiency and demand for perfection his gray eyes usually suggested a confidence and discretion born from experience but today they looked wild and unsettled you look beat susan said ive been better strathmore sighed ill say she thought strathmore looked as bad as susan had ever seen him his thinning gray hair was disheveled and even in the rooms crisp airconditioning his forehead was beaded with sweat he looked like hed slept in his suit he was sitting behind a modern desk with two recessed keypads and a computer monitor at one end it was strewn with computer printouts and looked like some sort of alien cockpit propped there in the center of his curtained chamber tough week she inquired strathmore shrugged the usual the effs all over me about civilian privacy rights again susan chuckled the eff or electronics frontier foundation was a worldwide coalition of computer users who had founded a powerful civil liberties coalition aimed at supporting free speech online and educating others to the realities and dangers of living in an electronic world they were constantly lobbying against what they called the orwellian eavesdropping capabilities of government agenciesparticularly the nsa the eff was a perpetual thorn in strathmores side sounds like business as usual she said so whats this big emergency you got me out of the tub for strathmore sat a moment absently fingering the computer trackball embedded in his desktop after a long silence he caught susans gaze and held it whats the longest youve ever seen transltr take to break a code the question caught susan entirely off guard it seemed meaningless this is what he called me in for well she hesitated we hit a comint intercept a few months ago that took about an hour but it had a ridiculously long keyten thousand bits or something like that strathmore grunted an hour huh what about some of the boundary probes weve run susan shrugged well if you include diagnostics its obviously longer how much longer susan couldnt imagine what strathmore was getting at well sir i tried an algorithm last march with a segmented millionbit key illegal looping functions cellular automata the works transltr still broke it how long three hours strathmore arched his eyebrows three hours that long susan frowned mildly offended her job for the last three years had been to finetune the most secret computer in the world most of the programming that made transltr so fast was hers a millionbit key was hardly a realistic scenario okay strathmore said so even in extreme conditions the longest a code has ever survived inside transltr is about three hours susan nodded yeah more or less strathmore paused as if afraid to say something he might regret finally he looked up transltrs hit something he stopped susan waited more than three hours strathmore nodded she looked unconcerned a new diagnostic something from the syssec department strathmore shook his head its an outside file susan waited for the punch line but it never came an outside file youre joking right i wish i queued it last night around eleven thirty it hasnt broken yet susans jaw dropped she looked at her watch and then back at strathmore its still going over fifteen hours strathmore leaned forward and rotated his monitor toward susan the screen was black except for a small yellow text box blinking in the middle time elapsed awaiting key emphasis susan stared in amazement it appeared transltr had been working on one code for over fifteen hours she knew the computers processors auditioned thirty million keys per secondone hundred billion per hour if transltr was still counting that meant the key had to be enormousover ten billion digits long it was absolute insanity its impossible she declared have you checked for error flags maybe transltr hit a glitch and the runs clean but the passkey must be huge strathmore shook his head standard commercial algorithm im guessing a sixtyfourbit key mystified susan looked out the window at transltr below she knew from experience that it could locate a sixtyfourbit key in under ten minutes theres got to be some explanation strathmore nodded there is youre not going to like it susan looked uneasy is transltr malfunctioning transltrs fine have we got a virus strathmore shook his head no virus just hear me out susan was flabbergasted transltr had never hit a code it couldnt break in under an hour usually the cleartext was delivered to strathmores printout module within minutes she glanced at the highspeed printer behind his desk it was empty susan strathmore said quietly this is going to be hard to accept at first but just listen a minute he chewed his lip this code that transltrs working onits unique its like nothing weve ever seen before strathmore paused as if the words were hard for him to say this code is unbreakable susan stared at him and almost laughed unbreakable what was that supposed to mean there was no such thing as an unbreakable codesome took longer than others but every code was breakable it was mathematically guaranteed that sooner or later transltr would guess the right key i beg your pardon the codes unbreakable he repeated flatly unbreakable susan couldnt believe the word had been uttered by a man with twentyseven years of code analysis experience unbreakable sir she said uneasily what about the bergofsky principle susan had learned about the bergofsky principle early in her career it was a cornerstone of bruteforce technology it was also strathmores inspiration for building transltr the principle clearly stated that if a computer tried enough keys it was mathematically guaranteed to find the right one a codes security was not that its passkey was unfindable but rather that most people didnt have the time or equipment to try strathmore shook his head this codes different different susan eyed him askance an unbreakable code is a mathematical impossibility he knows that strathmore ran a hand across his sweaty scalp this code is the product of a brandnew encryption algorithmone weve never seen before now susan was even more doubtful encryption algorithms were just mathematical formulas recipes for scrambling text into code mathematicians and programmers created new algorithms every day there were hundreds of them on the marketpgp diffiehellman zip idea el gamal transltr broke all of their codes every day no problem to transltr all codes looked identical regardless of which algorithm wrote them i dont understand she argued were not talking about reverseengineering some complex function were talking brute force pgp lucifer dsait doesnt matter the algorithm generates a key it thinks is secure and transltr keeps guessing until it finds it strathmores reply had the controlled patience of a good teacher yes susan transltr will always find the keyeven if its huge he paused a long moment unless susan wanted to speak but it was clear strathmore was about to drop his bomb unless what unless the computer doesnt know when its broken the code susan almost fell out of her chair what unless the computer guesses the correct key but just keeps guessing because it doesnt realize it found the right key strathmore looked bleak i think this algorithm has got a rotating cleartext susan gaped the notion of a rotating cleartext function was first put forth in an obscure paper by a hungarian mathematician josef harne because bruteforce computers broke codes by examining cleartext for identifiable word patterns harne proposed an encryption algorithm that in addition to encrypting shifted decrypted cleartext over a time variant in theory the perpetual mutation would ensure that the attacking computer would never locate recognizable word patterns and thus never know when it had found the proper key the concept was somewhat like the idea of colonizing marsfathomable on an intellectual level but at present well beyond human ability where did you get this thing she demanded the commanders response was slow a public sector programmer wrote it what susan collapsed back in her chair weve got the best programmers in the world downstairs all of us working together have never even come close to writing a rotating cleartext function are you trying to tell me some punk with a pc figured out how to do it strathmore lowered his voice in an apparent effort to calm her i wouldnt call this guy a punk susan wasnt listening she was convinced there had to be some other explanation a glitch a virus anything was more likely than an unbreakable code strathmore eyed her sternly one of the most brilliant cryptographic minds of all time wrote this algorithm susan was more doubtful than ever the most brilliant cryptographic minds of all time were in her department and she certainly would have heard about an algorithm like this who she demanded im sure you can guess strathmore said hes not too fond of the nsa well that narrows it down she snapped sarcastically he worked on the transltr project he broke the rules almost caused an intelligence nightmare i deported him susans face was blank only an instant before going white oh my god strathmore nodded hes been bragging all year about his work on a bruteforceresistant algorithm bbut susan stammered i thought he was bluffing he actually did it he did the ultimate unbreakable codewriter susan was silent a long moment but that means strathmore looked her dead in the eye yes ensei tankado just made transltr obsolete chapter although ensei tankado was not alive during the second world war he carefully studied everything about itparticularly about its culminating event the blast in which of his countrymen where incinerated by an atomic bomb hiroshima am august a vile act of destruction a senseless display of power by a country that had already won the war tankado had accepted all that but what he could never accept was that the bomb had robbed him of ever knowing his mother she had died giving birth to himcomplications brought on by the radiation poisoning shed suffered so many years earlier in before ensei was born his mother like many of her friends traveled to hiroshima to volunteer in the burn centers it was there that she became one of the hibakushathe radiated people nineteen years later at the age of thirtysix as she lay in the delivery room bleeding internally she knew she was finally going to die what she did not know was that death would spare her the final horrorher only child was to be born deformed enseis father never even saw his son bewildered by the loss of his wife and shamed by the arrival of what the nurses told him was an imperfect child who probably would not survive the night he disappeared from the hospital and never came back ensei tankado was placed in a foster home every night the young tankado stared down at the twisted fingers holding his daruma wishdoll and swore hed have revengerevenge against the country that had stolen his mother and shamed his father into abandoning him what he didnt know was that destiny was about to intervene in february of enseis twelfth year a computer manufacturer in tokyo called his foster family and asked if their crippled child might take part in a test group for a new keyboard theyd developed for handicapped children his family agreed although ensei tankado had never seen a computer it seemed he instinctively knew how to use it the computer opened worlds he had never imagined possible before long it became his entire life as he got older he gave classes earned money and eventually earned a scholarship to doshisha university soon ensei tankado was known across tokyo as fugusha kisaithe crippled genius tankado eventually read about pearl harbor and japanese war crimes his hatred of america slowly faded he became a devout buddhist he forgot his childhood vow of revenge forgiveness was the only path to enlightenment by the time he was twenty ensei tankado was somewhat of an underground cult figure among programmers ibm offered him a work visa and a post in texas tankado jumped at the chance three years later he had left ibm was living in new york and was writing software on his own he rode the new wave of publickey encryption he wrote algorithms and made a fortune like many of the top authors of encryption algorithms tankado was courted by the nsa the irony was not lost on himthe opportunity to work in the heart of the government in a country he had once vowed to hate he decided to go on the interview whatever doubts he had disappeared when he met commander strathmore they talked frankly about tankados background the potential hostility he might feel toward the us his plans for the future tankado took a polygraph test and underwent five weeks of rigorous psychological profiles he passed them all his hatred had been replaced by his devotion to buddha four months later ensei tankado went to work in the cryptography department of the national security agency despite his large salary tankado went to work on an old moped and ate a bag lunch alone at his desk instead of joining the rest of the department for prime rib and vichyssoise in the commissary the other cryptographers revered him he was brilliantas creative a programmer as any of them had ever seen he was kind and honest quiet and of impeccable ethics moral integrity was of paramount importance to him it was for this reason that his dismissal from the nsa and subsequent deportation had been such a shock tankado like the rest of the crypto staff had been working on the transltr project with the understanding that if successful it would be used to decipher email only in cases preapproved by the justice department the nsas use of transltr was to be regulated in much the same way the fbi needed a federal court order to install a wiretap transltr was to include programming that called for passwords held in escrow by the federal reserve and the justice department in order to decipher a file this would prevent the nsa from listening indiscriminately to the personal communications of lawabiding citizens around the globe however when the time came to enter that programming the transltr staff was told there had been a change of plans because of the time pressures often associated with the nsas antiterrorist work transltr was to be a freestanding decryption device whose daytoday operation would be regulated solely by the nsa ensei tankado was outraged this meant the nsa would in effect be able to open everyones mail and reseal it without their knowing it was like having a bug in every phone in the world strathmore attempted to make tankado see transltr as a lawenforcement device but it was no use tankado was adamant that it constituted a gross violation of human rights he quit on the spot and within hours violated the nsas code of secrecy by trying to contact the electronic frontier foundation tankado stood poised to shock the world with his story of a secret machine capable of exposing computer users around the world to unthinkable government treachery the nsa had had no choice but to stop him tankados capture and deportation widely publicized among online newsgroups had been an unfortunate public shaming against strathmores wishes the nsa damagecontrol specialistsnervous that tankado would try to convince people of transltrs existencegenerated rumors that destroyed his credibility ensei tankado was shunned by the global computer communitynobody trusted a cripple accused of spying particularly when he was trying to buy his freedom with absurd allegations about a us codebreaking machine the oddest thing of all was that tankado seemed to understand it was all part of the intelligence game he appeared to harbor no anger only resolve as security escorted him away tankado spoke his final words to strathmore with a chilling calm we all have a right to keep secrets hed said someday ill see to it we can chapter susans mind was racingensei tankado wrote a program that creates unbreakable codes she could barely grasp the thought digital fortress strathmore said thats what hes calling it its the ultimate counterintelligence weapon if this program hits the market every third grader with a modem will be able to send codes the nsa cant break our intelligence will be shot but susans thoughts were far removed from the political implications of digital fortress she was still struggling to comprehend its existence shed spent her life breaking codes firmly denying the existence of the ultimate code every code is breakablethe bergofsky principle she felt like an atheist coming face to face with god if this code gets out she whispered cryptography will become a dead science strathmore nodded thats the least of our problems can we pay tankado off i know he hates us but cant we offer him a few million dollars convince him not to distribute strathmore laughed a few million do you know what this thing is worth every government in the world will bid top dollar can you imagine telling the president that were still cablesnooping the iraqis but we cant read the intercepts anymore this isnt just about the nsa its about the entire intelligence community this facility provides support for everyonethe fbi cia dea theyd all be flying blind the drug cartels shipments would become untraceable major corporations could transfer money with no paper trail and leave the irs out in the cold terrorists could chat in total secrecyit would be chaos the eff will have field day susan said pale the eff doesnt have the first clue about what we do here strathmore railed in disgust if they knew how many terrorist attacks weve stopped because we can decrypt codes theyd change their tune susan agreed but she also knew the realities the eff would never know how important transltr was transltr had helped foil dozens of attacks but the information was highly classified and would never be released the rationale behind the secrecy was simple the government could not afford the mass hysteria caused by revealing the truth no one knew how the public would react to the news that there had been two nuclear close calls by fundamentalist groups on us soil in the last year nuclear attack however was not the only threat only last month transltr had thwarted one of the most ingeniously conceived terrorist attacks the nsa had ever witnessed an antigovernment organization had devised a plan codenamed sherwood forest it targeted the new york stock exchange with the intention of redistributing the wealth over the course of six days members of the group placed twentyseven nonexplosive flux pods in the buildings surrounding the exchange these devices when detonated create a powerful blast of magnetism the simultaneous discharge of these carefully placed pods would create a magnetic field so powerful that all magnetic media in the stock exchange would be erasedcomputer hard drives massive rom storage banks tape backups and even floppy disks all records of who owned what would disintegrate permanently because pinpoint timing was necessary for simultaneous detonation of the devices the flux pods were interconnected over internet telephone lines during the twoday countdown the pods internal clocks exchanged endless streams of encrypted synchronization data the nsa intercepted the datapulses as a network anomaly but ignored them as a seemingly harmless exchange of gibberish but after transltr decrypted the data streams analysts immediately recognized the sequence as a networksynchronized countdown the pods were located and removed a full three hours before they were scheduled to go off susan knew that without transltr the nsa was helpless against advanced electronic terrorism she eyed the runmonitor it still read over fifteen hours even if tankados file broke right now the nsa was sunk crypto would be relegated to breaking less than two codes a day even at the present rate of a day there was still a backlog of files awaiting decryption tankado called me last month strathmore said interrupting susans thoughts susan looked up tankado called you he nodded to warn me warn you he hates you he called to tell me he was perfecting an algorithm that wrote unbreakable codes i didnt believe him but why would he tell you about it susan demanded did he want you to buy it no it was blackmail things suddenly began falling into place for susan of course she said amazed he wanted you to clear his name no strathmore frowned tankado wanted transltr transltr yes he ordered me to go public and tell the world we have transltr he said if we admitted we can read public email he would destroy digital fortress susan looked doubtful strathmore shrugged either way its too late now hes posted a complimentary copy of digital fortress at his internet site everyone in the world can download it susan went white he what its a publicity stunt nothing to worry about the copy he posted is encrypted people can download it but nobody can open it its ingenious really the source code for digital fortress has been encrypted locked shut susan looked amazed of course so everybody can have a copy but nobody can open it exactly tankados dangling a carrot have you seen the algorithm the commander looked puzzled no i told you its encrypted susan looked equally puzzled but weve got transltr why not just decrypt it but when susan saw strathmores face she realized the rules had changed oh my god she gasped suddenly understanding digital fortress is encrypted with itself strathmore nodded bingo susan was amazed the formula for digital fortress had been encrypted using digital fortress tankado had posted a priceless mathematical recipe but the text of the recipe had been scrambled and it had used itself to do the scrambling its bigglemans safe susan stammered in awe strathmore nodded bigglemans safe was a hypothetical cryptography scenario in which a safe builder wrote blueprints for an unbreakable safe he wanted to keep the blueprints a secret so he built the safe and locked the blueprints inside tankado had done the same thing with digital fortress hed protected his blueprints by encrypting them with the formula outlined in his blueprints and the file in transltr susan asked i downloaded it from tankados internet site like everyone else the nsa is now the proud owner of the digital fortress algorithm we just cant open it susan marveled at ensei tankados ingenuity without revealing his algorithm he had proven to the nsa that it was unbreakable strathmore handed her a newspaper clipping it was a translated blurb from the nikkei shimbun the japanese equivalent of the wall street journal stating that the japanese programmer ensei tankado had completed a mathematical formula he claimed could write unbreakable codes the formula was called digital fortress and was available for review on the internet the programmer would be auctioning it off to the highest bidder the column went on to say that although there was enormous interest in japan the few us software companies who had heard about digital fortress deemed the claim preposterous akin to turning lead to gold the formula they said was a hoax and not to be taken seriously susan looked up an auction strathmore nodded right now every software company in japan has downloaded an encrypted copy of digital fortress and is trying to crack it open every second they cant the bidding price climbs thats absurd susan shot back all the new encrypted files are uncrackable unless you have transltr digital fortress could be nothing more than a generic publicdomain algorithm and none of these companies could break it but its a brilliant marketing ploy strathmore said think about itall brands of bulletproof glass stop bullets but if a company dares you to put a bullet through theirs suddenly everybodys trying and the japanese actually believe digital fortress is different better than everything else on the market tankado may have been shunned but everybody knows hes a genius hes practically a cult icon among hackers if tankado says the algorithms unbreakable its unbreakable but theyre all unbreakable as far as the public knows yes strathmore mused for the moment whats that supposed to mean strathmore sighed twenty years ago no one imagined wed be breaking twelvebit stream ciphers but technology progressed it always does software manufacturers assume at some point computers like transltr will exist technology is progressing exponentially and eventually current publickey algorithms will lose their security better algorithms will be needed to stay ahead of tomorrows computers and digital fortress is it exactly an algorithm that resists brute force will never become obsolete no matter how powerful codebreaking computers get it could become a world standard overnight susan pulled in a long breath god help us she whispered can we make a bid strathmore shook his head tankado gave us our chance he made that clear its too risky anyway if we get caught were basically admitting that were afraid of his algorithm wed be making a public confession not only that we have transltr but that digital fortress is immune whats the time frame strathmore frowned tankado planned to announce the highest bidder tomorrow at noon susan felt her stomach tighten then what the arrangement was that he would give the winner the passkey the passkey part of the ploy everybodys already got the algorithm so tankados auctioning off the passkey that unlocks it susan groaned of course it was perfect clean and simple tankado had encrypted digital fortress and he alone held the passkey that unlocked it she found it hard to fathom that somewhere out thereprobably scrawled on a piece of paper in tankados pocketthere was a sixtyfourcharacter passkey that could end us intelligence gathering forever susan suddenly felt ill as she imagined the scenario tankado would give his passkey to the highest bidder and that company would unlock the digital fortress file then it probably would embed the algorithm in a tamperproof chip and within five years every computer would come preloaded with a digital fortress chip no commercial manufacturer had ever dreamed of creating an encryption chip because normal encryption algorithms eventually become obsolete but digital fortress would never become obsolete with a rotating cleartext function no bruteforce attack would ever find the right key a new digital encryption standard from now until forever every code unbreakable bankers brokers terrorists spies one worldone algorithm anarchy what are the options susan probed she was well aware that desperate times called for desperate measures even at the nsa we cant remove him if thats what youre asking it was exactly what susan was asking in her years with the nsa susan had heard rumors of its loose affiliations with the most skilled assassins in the worldhired hands brought in to do the intelligence communitys dirty work strathmore shook his head tankados too smart to leave us an option like that susan felt oddly relieved hes protected not exactly in hiding strathmore shrugged tankado left japan he planned to check his bids by phone but we know where he is and you dont plan to make a move no hes got insurance tankado gave a copy of his passkey to an anonymous third party in case anything happened of course susan marveled a guardian angel and i suppose if anything happens to tankado the mystery man sells the key worse anyone hits tankado and his partner publishes susan looked confused his partner publishes the key strathmore nodded posts it on the internet puts it in newspapers on billboards in effect he gives it away susans eyes widened free downloads exactly tankado figured if he was dead he wouldnt need the moneywhy not give the world a little farewell gift there was a long silence susan breathed deeply as if to absorb the terrifying truth ensei tankado has created an unbreakable algorithm hes holding us hostage she suddenly stood her voice was determined we must contact tankado there must be a way to convince him not to release we can offer him triple the highest bid we can clear his name anything too late strathmore said he took a deep breath ensei tankado was found dead this morning in seville spain chapter the twinengine learjet touched down on the scorching runway outside the window the barren landscape of spains lower extremadura blurred and then slowed to a crawl mr becker a voice crackled were here becker stood and stretched after unlatching the overhead compartment he remembered he had no luggage there had been no time to pack it didnt matterhed been promised the trip would be brief in and out as the engines wound down the plane eased out of the sun and into a deserted hangar opposite the main terminal a moment later the pilot appeared and popped the hatch becker tossed back the last of his cranberry juice put the glass on the wet bar and scooped up his suit coat the pilot pulled a thick manila envelope from his flight suit i was instructed to give you this he handed it to becker on the front scrawled in blue pen were the words keep the change becker thumbed through the thick stack of reddish bills what the local currency the pilot offered flatly i know what it is becker stammered but its its too much all i need is taxi fare becker did the conversion in his head whats in here is worth thousands of dollars i have my orders sir the pilot turned and hoisted himself back into the cabin the door slid shut behind him becker stared up at the plane and then down at the money in his hand after standing a moment in the empty hangar he put the envelope in his breast pocket shouldered his suit coat and headed out across the runway it was a strange beginning becker pushed it from his mind with a little luck hed be back in time to salvage some of his stone manor trip with susan in and out he told himself in and out there was no way he could have known chapter systems security technician phil chartrukian had only intended to be inside crypto a minutejust long enough to grab some paperwork hed forgotten the day before but it was not to be after making his way across the crypto floor and stepping into the syssec lab he immediately knew something was not right the computer terminal that perpetually monitored transltrs internal workings was unmanned and the monitor was switched off chartrukian called out hello there was no reply the lab was spotlessas if no one had been there for hours although chartrukian was only twentythree and relatively new to the syssec squad hed been trained well and he knew the drill there was always a syssec on duty in crypto especially on saturdays when no cryptographers were around he immediately powered up the monitor and turned to the duty board on the wall whos on watch he demanded aloud scanning the list of names according to the schedule a young rookie named seidenberg was supposed to have started a double shift at midnight the night before chartrukian glanced around the empty lab and frowned so where the hell is he as he watched the monitor power up chartrukian wondered if strathmore knew the syssec lab was unmanned he had noticed on his way in that the curtains of strathmores workstation were closed which meant the boss was innot at all uncommon for a saturday strathmore despite requesting his cryptographers take saturdays off seemed to work days a year there was one thing chartrukian knew for certainif strathmore found out the syssec lab was unmanned it would cost the absent rookie his job chartrukian eyed the phone wondering if he should call the young techie and bail him out there was an unspoken rule among syssec that they would watch each others backs in crypto syssecs were secondclass citizens constantly at odds with the lords of the manor it was no secret that the cryptographers ruled this multibilliondollar roost syssecs were tolerated only because they kept the toys running smoothly chartrukian made his decision he grabbed the phone but the receiver never reached his ear he stopped short his eyes transfixed on the monitor now coming into focus before him as if in slow motion he set down the phone and stared in openmouthed wonder in eight months as a syssec phil chartrukian had never seen transltrs runmonitor post anything other than a double zero in the hours field today was a first time elapsed fifteen hours and seventeen minutes he choked impossible he rebooted the screen praying it hadnt refreshed properly but when the monitor came back to life it looked the same chartrukian felt a chill cryptos syssecs had only one responsibility keep transltr cleanvirus free chartrukian knew that a fifteenhour run could only mean one thinginfection an impure file had gotten inside transltr and was corrupting the programming instantly his training kicked in it no longer mattered that the syssec lab had been unmanned or the monitors switched off he focused on the matter at handtransltr he immediately called up a log of all the files that had entered transltr in the last fortyeight hours he began scanning the list did an infected file get through he wondered could the security filters have missed something as a precaution every file entering transltr had to pass through what was known as gauntleta series of powerful circuitlevel gateways packet filters and disinfectant programs that scanned inbound files for computer viruses and potentially dangerous subroutines files containing programming unknown to gauntlet were immediately rejected they had to be checked by hand occasionally gauntlet rejected entirely harmless files on the basis that they contained programming the filters had never seen before in that case the syssecs did a scrupulous manual inspection and only then on confirmation that the file was clean did they bypass gauntlets filters and send the file into transltr computer viruses were as varied as bacterial viruses like their physiological counterparts computer viruses had one goalto attach themselves to a host system and replicate in this case the host was transltr chartrukian was amazed the nsa hadnt had problems with viruses before gauntlet was a potent sentry but still the nsa was a bottom feeder sucking in massive amounts of digital information from systems all over the world snooping data was a lot like having indiscriminate sexprotection or no protection sooner or later you caught something chartrukian finished examining the file list before him he was now more puzzled than before every file checked out gauntlet had seen nothing out of the ordinary which meant the file in transltr was totally clean so what the hells taking so long he demanded of the empty room chartrukian felt himself break a sweat he wondered if he should go disturb strathmore with the news a virus probe chartrukian said firmly trying to calm himself down i should run a virus probe chartrukian knew that a virus probe would be the first thing strathmore would request anyway glancing out at the deserted crypto floor chartrukian made his decision he loaded the viral probe software and launched it the run would take about fifteen minutes come back clean he whispered squeaky clean tell daddy its nothing but chartrukian sensed it was not nothing instinct told him something very unusual was going on inside the great decoding beast chapter ensei tankado is dead susan felt a wave of nausea you killed him i thought you said we didnt touch him strathmore assured her he died of a heart attack comint phoned early this morning their computer flagged tankados name in a seville police log through interpol heart attack susan looked doubtful he was thirty years old thirtytwo strathmore corrected he had a congenital heart defect id never heard that turned up in his nsa physical not something he bragged about susan was having trouble accepting the serendipity of the timing a defective heart could kill himjust like that it seemed too convenient strathmore shrugged weak heart combine it with the heat of spain throw in the stress of blackmailing the nsa susan was silent a moment even considering the conditions she felt a pang of loss at the passing of such a brilliant fellow cryptographer strathmores gravelly voice interrupted her thoughts the only silver lining on this whole fiasco is that tankado was traveling alone chances are good his partner doesnt know yet hes dead the spanish authorities said theyd contain the information for as long as possible we only got the call because comint was on the ball strathmore eyed susan closely ive got to find the partner before he finds out tankados dead thats why i called you in i need your help susan was confused it seemed to her that ensei tankados timely demise had solved their entire problem commander she argued if the authorities are saying he died of a heart attack were off the hook his partner will know the nsa is not responsible not responsible strathmores eyes widened in disbelief somebody blackmails the nsa and turns up dead a few days laterand were not responsible id bet big money tankados mystery friend wont see it that way whatever happened we look guilty as hell it could easily have been poison a rigged autopsy any number of things strathmore paused what was your first reaction when i told you tankado was dead she frowned i thought the nsa had killed him exactly if the nsa can put five rhyolite satellites in geosynchronous orbit over the mideast i think its safe to assume we have the resources to pay off a few spanish policemen the commander had made his point susan exhaled ensei tankado is dead the nsa will be blamed can we find his partner in time i think so weve got a good lead tankado made numerous public announcements that he was working with a partner i think he hoped it would discourage software firms from doing him any harm or trying to steal his key he threatened that if there was any foul play his partner would publish the key and all firms would suddenly find themselves in competition with free software clever susan nodded strathmore went on a few times in public tankado referred to his partner by name he called him north dakota north dakota obviously an alias of some sort yes but as a precaution i ran an internet inquiry using north dakota as a search string i didnt think id find anything but i turned up an email account strathmore paused of course i assumed it wasnt the north dakota we were looking for but i searched the account just to be sure imagine my shock when i found the account was full of email from ensei tankado strathmore raised his eyebrows and the messages were full of references to digital fortress and tankados plans to blackmail the nsa susan gave strathmore a skeptical look she was amazed the commander was letting himself be played with so easily commander she argued tankado knows full well the nsa can snoop email from the internet he would never use email to send secret information its a trap ensei tankado gave you north dakota he knew youd run a search whatever information hes sending he wanted you to findits a false trail good instinct strathmore fired back except for a couple of things i couldnt find anything under north dakota so i tweaked the search string the account i found was under a variationndakota susan shook her head running permutations is standard procedure tankado knew youd try variations until you hit something ndakotas far too easy an alteration perhaps strathmore said scribbling words on apiece of paper and handing it to susan but look at this susan read the paper she suddenly understood the commanders thinking on the paper was north dakotas email address ndakotaaraanonorg it was the letters ara in the address that had caught susans eye ara stood for american remailers anonymous a wellknown anonymous server anonymous servers were popular among internet users who wanted to keep their identities secret for a fee these companies protected an emailers privacy by acting as a middleman for electronic mail it was like having a numbered post office boxa user could send and receive mail without ever revealing his true address or name the company received email addressed to aliases and then forwarded it to the clients real account the remailing company was bound by contract never to reveal the identity or location of its real users its not proof strathmore said but its pretty suspicious susan nodded suddenly more convinced so youre saying tankado didnt care if anybody searched for north dakota because his identity and location are protected by ara exactly susan schemed for a moment ara services mainly us accounts you think north dakota might be over here somewhere strathmore shrugged could be with an american partner tankado could keep the two passkeys separated geographically might be a smart move susan considered it she doubted tankado would have shared his passkey with anyone except a very close friend and as she recalled ensei tankado didnt have many friends in the states north dakota she mused her cryptological mind mulling over the possible meanings of the alias what does his email to tankado sound like no idea comint only caught tankados outbound at this point all we have on north dakota is an anonymous address susan thought a minute any chance its a decoy strathmore raised an eyebrow how so tankado could be sending bogus email to a dead account in hopes wed snoop it wed think hes protected and hed never have to risk sharing his passkey he could be working alone strathmore chuckled impressed tricky idea except for one thing hes not using any of his usual home or business internet accounts hes been dropping by doshisha university and logging on to their mainframe apparently hes got an account there that hes managed to keep secret its a very wellhidden account and i found it only by chance strathmore paused so if tankado wanted us to snoop his mail why would he use a secret account susan contemplated the question maybe he used a secret account so you wouldnt suspect a ploy maybe tankado hid the account just deep enough that youd stumble on to it and think you got lucky it gives his email credibility strathmore chuckled you should have been a field agent the ideas a good one unfortunately every letter tankado sends gets a response tankado writes his partner responds susan frowned fair enough so youre saying north dakotas for real afraid so and weve got to find him and quietly if he catches wind that were onto him its all over susan now knew exactly why strathmore had called her in let me guess she said you want me to snoop aras secure database and find north dakotas real identity strathmore gave her a tight smile ms fletcher you read my mind when it came to discreet internet searches susan fletcher was the woman for the job a year ago a senior white house official had been receiving email threats from someone with an anonymous email address the nsa had been asked to locate the individual although the nsa had the clout to demand the remailing company reveal the users identity it opted for a more subtle methoda tracer susan had created in effect a directional beacon disguised as a piece of email she could send it to the users phony address and the remailing company performing the duty for which it had been contracted would forward it to the users real address once there the program would record its internet location and send word back to the nsa then the program would disintegrate without a trace from that day on as far as the nsa was concerned anonymous remailers were nothing more than a minor annoyance can you find him strathmore asked sure why did you wait so long to call me actuallyhe frownedi hadnt planned on calling you at all i didnt want anyone else in the loop i tried to send a copy of your tracer myself but you wrote the damn thing in one of those new hybrid languages i couldnt get it to work it kept returning nonsensical data i finally had to bite the bullet and bring you in susan chuckled strathmore was a brilliant cryptographic programmer but his repertoire was limited primarily to algorithmic work the nuts and bolts of less lofty secular programming often escaped him what was more susan had written her tracer in a new crossbreed programming language called limbo it was understandable that strathmore had encountered problems ill take care of it she smiled turning to leave ill be at my terminal any idea on a time frame susan paused well it depends on how efficiently ara forwards their mail if hes here in the states and uses something like aol or compuserve ill snoop his credit card and get a billing address within the hour if hes with a university or corporation itll take a little longer she smiled uneasily after that the rest is up to you susan knew that the rest would be an nsa strike team cutting power to the guys house and crashing through his windows with stun guns the team would probably think it was on a drug bust strathmore would undoubtedly stride through the rubble himself and locate the sixtyfourcharacter passkey then he would destroy it digital fortress would languish forever on the internet locked for all eternity send the tracer carefully strathmore urged if north dakota sees were onto him hell panic and ill never get a team there before he disappears with the key hit and run she assured the moment this thing finds his account itll dissolve hell never know we were there the commander nodded tiredly thanks susan gave him a soft smile she was always amazed how even in the face of disaster strathmore could muster a quiet calm she was convinced it was this ability that had defined his career and lifted him to the upper echelons of power as susan headed for the door she took a long look down at transltr the existence of an unbreakable algorithm was a concept she was still struggling to grasp she prayed theyd find north dakota in time make it quick strathmore called and youll be in the smoky mountains by nightfall susan froze in her tracks she knew she had never mentioned her trip to strathmore she wheeled is the nsa tapping my phone strathmore smiled guiltily david told me about your trip this morning he said youd be pretty ticked about postponing it susan was lost you talked to david this morning of course strathmore seemed puzzled by susans reaction i had to brief him brief him she demanded for what for his trip i sent david to spain chapter spain i sent david to spain the commanders words stung davids in spain susan was incredulous you sent him to spain her tone turned angry why strathmore looked dumbfounded he was apparently not accustomed to being yelled at even by his head cryptographer he gave susan a confused look she was flexed like a mother tiger defending her cub susan he said you spoke to him didnt you david did explain she was too shocked to speak spain thats why david postponed our stone manor trip i sent a car for him this morning he said he was going to call you before he left im sorry i thought why would you send david to spain strathmore paused and gave her an obvious look to get the other passkey what other passkey tankados copy susan was lost what are you talking about strathmore sighed tankado surely would have had a copy of the passkey on him when he died i sure as hell didnt want it floating around the seville morgue so you sent david becker susan was beyond shock nothing was making sense david doesnt even work for you strathmore looked startled no one ever spoke to the deputy director of the nsa that way susan he said keeping his cool thats the point i needed the tiger lashed out youve got twenty thousand employees at your command what gives you the right to send my fiance i needed a civilian courier someone totally removed from government if i went through regular channels and someone caught wind and david becker is the only civilian you know no david becker is not the only civilian i know but at six this morning things were happening quickly david speaks the language hes smart i trust him and i thought id do him a favor a favor susan sputtered sending him to spain is a favor yes im paying him ten thousand for one days work hell pick up tankados belongings and hell fly home thats a favor susan fell silent she understood it was all about money her thoughts wheeled back five months to the night the president of georgetown university had offered david a promotion to the language department chair the president had warned him that his teaching hours would be cut back and that there would be increased paperwork but there was also a substantial raise in salary susan had wanted to cry out david dont do it youll be miserable we have plenty of moneywho cares which one of us earns it but it was not her place in the end she stood by his decision to accept as they fell asleep that night susan tried to be happy for him but something inside kept telling her it would be a disaster shed been rightbut shed never counted on being so right you paid him ten thousand dollars she demanded thats a dirty trick strathmore was fuming now trick it wasnt any goddamn trick i didnt even tell him about the money i asked him as a personal favor he agreed to go of course he agreed youre my boss youre the deputy director of the nsa he couldnt say no youre right strathmore snapped which is why i called him i didnt have the luxury of does the director know you sent a civilian susan strathmore said his patience obviously wearing thin the director is not involved he knows nothing about this susan stared at strathmore in disbelief it was as if she no longer knew the man she was talking to he had sent her fiancea teacheron an nsa mission and then failed to notify the director about the biggest crisis in the history of the organization leland fontaine hasnt been notified strathmore had reached the end of his rope he exploded susan now listen here i called you in here because i need an ally not an inquiry ive had one hell of morning i downloaded tankados file last night and sat here by the output printer for hours praying transltr could break it at dawn i swallowed my pride and dialed the directorand let me tell you that was a conversation i was really looking forward to good morning sir im sorry to wake you why am i calling i just found out transltr is obsolete its because of an algorithm my entire topdollar crypto team couldnt come close to writing strathmore slammed his fist on the desk susan stood frozen she didnt make a sound in ten years she had seen strathmore lose his cool only a handful of times and never once with her ten seconds later neither one of them had spoken finally strathmore sat back down and susan could hear his breathing slowing to normal when he finally spoke his voice was eerily calm and controlled unfortunately strathmore said quietly it turns out the director is in south america meeting with the president of colombia because theres absolutely nothing he could do from down there i had two optionsrequest he cut his meeting short and return or handle this myself there was along silence strathmore finally looked up and his tired eyes met susans his expression softened immediately susan im sorry im exhausted this is a nightmare come true i know youre upset about david i didnt mean for you to find out this way i thought you knew susan felt a wave of guilt i overreacted im sorry david is a good choice strathmore nodded absently hell be back tonight susan thought about everything the commander was going throughthe pressure of overseeing transltr the endless hours and meetings it was rumored his wife of thirty years was leaving him then on top of it there was digital fortressthe biggest intelligence threat in the history of the nsa and the poor guy was flying solo no wonder he looked about to crack considering the circumstances susan said i think you should probably call the director strathmore shook his head a bead of sweat dripping on his desk im not about to compromise the directors safety or risk a leak by contacting him about a major crisis he can do nothing about susan knew he was right even in moments like these strathmore was clearheaded have you considered calling the president strathmore nodded yes ive decided against it susan had figured as much senior nsa officials had the right to handle verifiable intelligence emergencies without executive knowledge the nsa was the only us intelligence organization that enjoyed total immunity from federal accountability of any sort strathmore often availed himself of this right he preferred to work his magic in isolation commander she argued this is too big to be handled alone youve got to let somebody else in on it susan the existence of digital fortress has major implications for the future of this organization i have no intention of informing the president behind the directors back we have a crisis and im handling it he eyed her thoughtfully i am the deputy director of operations a weary smile crept across his face and besides im not alone ive got susan fletcher on my team in that instant susan realized what she respected so much about trevor strathmore for ten years through thick and thin he had always led the way for her steadfast unwavering it was his dedication that amazed herhis unshakable allegiance to his principles his country and his ideals come what may commander trevor strathmore was a guiding light in a world of impossible decisions you are on my team arent you he asked susan smiled yes sir i am one hundred percent good now can we get back to work chapter david becker had been to funerals and seen dead bodies before but there was something particularly unnerving about this one it was not an immaculately groomed corpse resting in a silklined coffin this body had been stripped naked and dumped unceremoniously on an aluminum table the eyes had not yet found their vacant lifeless gaze instead they were twisted upward toward the ceiling in an eerie freezeframe of terror and regret donde estan sus efectos becker asked in fluent castillian spanish where are his belongings alli replied the yellowtoothed lieutenant he pointed to a counter of clothing and other personal items es todo is that all si becker asked for a cardboard box the lieutenant hurried off to find one it was saturday evening and the seville morgue was technically closed the young lieutenant had let becker in under direct orders from the head of the seville guardiait seemed the visiting american had powerful friends becker eyed the pile of clothes there was a passport wallet and glasses stuffed in one of the shoes there was also a small duffel the guardia had taken from the mans hotel beckers directions were clear touch nothing read nothing just bring it all back everything dont miss anything becker surveyed the pile and frowned what could the nsa possibly want with this junk the lieutenant returned with a small box and becker began putting the clothes inside the officer poked at the cadavers leg quienes who is he no idea looks chinese japanese becker thought poor bastard heart attack huh becker nodded absently thats what they told me the lieutenant sighed and shook his head sympathetically the seville sun can be cruel be careful out there tomorrow thanks becker said but im headed home the officer looked shocked you just got here i know but the guy paying my airfare is waiting for these items the lieutenant looked offended in the way only a spaniard can be offended you mean youre not going to experience seville i was here years ago beautiful city id love to stay so youve seen la giralda becker nodded hed never actually climbed the ancient moorish tower but hed seen it how about the alcazar becker nodded again remembering the night hed heard pacode lucia play guitar in the courtyardflamenco under the stars in a fifteenthcentury fortress he wished hed known susan back then and of course theres christopher columbus the officer beamed hes buried in our cathedral becker looked up really i thought columbus was buried in the dominican republic hell no who starts these rumors columbuss body is here in spain i thought you said you went to college becker shrugged i must have missed that day the spanish church is very proud to own his relics the spanish church becker knew here was only one church in spainthe roman catholic church catholicism was bigger here than in vatican city we dont of course have his entire body the lieutenant added solo el escroto becker stopped packing and stared at the lieutenant solo el escroto he fought off a grin just his scrotum the officer nodded proudly yes when the church obtains the remains of a great man they saint him and spread the relics to different cathedrals so everyone can enjoy their splendor and you got the becker stifled a laugh oye its a pretty important part the officer defended its not like we got a rib or a knuckle like those churches in galicia you should really stay and see it becker nodded politely maybe ill drop in on my way out of town mala suerte the officer sighed bad luck the cathedrals closed till sunrise mass another time then becker smiled hoisting the box i should probably get going my flights waiting he made a final glance around the room you want a ride to the airport the officer asked ive got a moto guzzi out front no thanks ill catch a cab becker had driven a motorcycle once in college and nearly killed himself on it he had no intention of getting on one again regardless of who was driving whatever you say the officer said heading for the door ill get the lights becker tucked the box under his arm have i got everything he took a last look at the body on the table the figure was stark naked face up under fluorescent lights clearly hiding nothing becker found his eyes drawn again to the strangely deformed hands he gazed a minute focusing more intently the officer killed the lights and the room went dark hold on becker said turn those back on the lights flickered back on becker set his box on the floor walked over to the corpse he leaned down and squinted at the mans left hand the officer followed beckers gaze pretty ugly huh but the deformity was not what had caught beckers eye hed seen something else he turned to the officer youre sure everythings in this box the officer nodded yeah thats it becker stood for moment with his hands on his hips then he picked up the box carried it back over to the counter and dumped it out carefully piece by piece he shook out the clothing then he emptied the shoes and tapped them as if trying to remove a pebble after going over everything a second time he stepped back and frowned problem asked the lieutenant yeah becker said were missing something chapter tokugen numataka stood in his plush penthouse office and gazed out at the tokyo skyline his employees and competitors knew him a sakuta samethe deadly shark for three decade shed outguessed outbid and out advertised all the japanese competition now he was on the brink of becoming a giant in the world market as well he was about to close the biggest deal of his lifea deal that would make his numatech corp the microsoft of the future his blood was alive with the cool rush of adrenaline business was warand war was exciting although tokugen numataka had been suspicious when the call had come three days ago he now knew the truth he was blessed with myourigood fortune the gods had chosen him i have a copy of the digital fortress passkey the american accent had said would you like to buy it numataka had almost laughed aloud he knew it was a ploy numatech corp had bid generously for ensei tankados new algorithm and now one of numatechs competitors was playing games trying to find out the amount of the bid you have the passkey numataka feigned interest i do my name is north dakota numataka stifled a laugh everyone knew about north dakota tankado had told the press about his secret partner it had been a wise move on tankados part to have a partner even in japan business practices had become dishonorable ensei tankado was not safe but one false move by an overeager firm and the passkey would be published every software firm on the market would suffer numataka took a long pull on his umami cigar and played along with the callers pathetic charade so youre selling your passkey interesting how does ensei tankado feel about this i have no allegiance to mr tankado mr tankado was foolish to trust me the passkey is worth hundreds of times what he is paying me to handle it for him im sorry numataka said your passkey alone is worth nothing to me when tankado finds out what youve done he will simply publish his copy and the market will be flooded you will receive both passkeys the voice said mr tankados and mine numataka covered the receiver and laughed aloud he couldnt help asking how much are you asking for both keys twenty million us dollars twenty million was almost exactly what numataka had bid twenty million he gasped in mock horror thats outrageous ive seen the algorithm i assure you its well worth it no shit thought numataka its worth ten times that unfortunately he said tiring of the game we both know mr tankado would never stand for this think of the legal repercussions the caller paused ominously what if mr tankado were no longer a factor numataka wanted to laugh but he noted an odd determination in the voice if tankado were no longer a factor numataka considered it then you and i would have a deal ill be in touch the voice said the line went dead chapter becker gazed down at the cadaver even hours after death the asians face radiated with a pinkish glow of a recent sunburn the rest of him was a pale yellowall except the small area of purplish bruising directly over his heart probably from the cpr becker mused too bad it didnt work he went back to studying the cadavers hands they were like nothing becker had ever seen each hand had only three digits and they were twisted and askew the disfigurement however was not what becker was looking at well ill be the lieutenant grunted from across the room hes japanese not chinese becker looked up the officer was thumbing through the dead mans passport id rather you didnt look at that becker requested touch nothing read nothing ensei tankado born january please becker said politely put it back the officer stared at the passport a moment longer and then tossed it back on the pile this guys got a class visa he could have stayed here for years becker poked at the victims hand with a pen maybe he lived here nope date of entry was last week maybe he was moving here becker offered curtly yeah maybe crummy first week sunstroke and a heart attack poor bastard becker ignored the officer and studied the hand youre positive he wasnt wearing any jewelry when he died the officer looked up startled jewelry yeah take a look at this the officer crossed the room the skin on tankados left hand showed traces of sunburn everywhere except a narrow band of flesh around the smallest finger becker pointed to the strip of pale flesh see how this isnt sunburned here looks like he was wearing a ring the officer seemed surprised a ring his voice sounded suddenly perplexed he studied the corpses finger then he flushed sheepishly my god he chuckled the story was true becker had a sudden sinking feeling i beg your pardon the officer shook his head in disbelief i would have mentioned it before but i thought the guy was nuts becker was not smiling what guy the guy who phoned in the emergency some canadian tourist kept talking about a ring babbling in the worst damn spanish i ever heard he said mr tankado was wearing a ring the officer nodded he pulled out a ducado cigarette eyed the no fumar sign and lit up anyway guess i should have said something but the guy sounded totally loco becker frowned strathmores words echoed in his ears i want everything ensei tankado had with him everything leave nothing not even a tiny scrap of paper where is the ring now becker asked the officer took a puff long story something told becker this was not good news tell me anyway chapter susan fletcher sat at her computer terminal inside node node was the cryptographers private soundproofed chamber just off the main floor a twoinch sheet of curved oneway glass gave the cryptographers a panorama of the crypto floor while prohibiting anyone else from seeing inside at the back of the expansive node chamber twelve terminals sat in a perfect circle the annular arrangement was intended to encourage intellectual exchange between cryptographers to remind them they were part of a larger teamsomething like a codebreakers knights of the round table ironically secrets were frowned on inside node nicknamed the playpen node had none of the sterile feel of the rest of crypto it was designed to feel like homeplush carpets hightech sound system fully stocked fridge kitchenette a nerf basketball hoop the nsa had a philosophy about crypto dont drop a couple billion bucks into a codebreaking computer without enticing the best of the best to stick around and use it susan slipped out of her salvatore ferragamo flats and dug her stockinged toes into the thick pile carpet wellpaid government employees were encouraged to refrain from lavish displays of personal wealth it was usually no problem for susanshe was perfectly happy with her modest duplex volvo sedan and conservative wardrobe but shoes were another matter even when susan was in college shed budgeted for the best you cant jump for the stars if your feet hurt her aunt had once told her and when you get where youre going you darn well better look great susan allowed herself a luxurious stretch and then settled down to business she pulled up her tracer and prepared to configure it she glanced at the email address strathmore had given her ndakotaaraanonorg the man calling himself north dakota had an anonymous account but susan knew it would not remain anonymous for long the tracer would pass through ara get forwarded to north dakota and then send information back containing the mans real internet address if all went well it would locate north dakota soon and strathmore could confiscate the passkey that would leave only david when he found tankados copy both passkeys could be destroyed tankados little time bomb would be harmless a deadly explosive without a detonator susan doublechecked the address on the sheet in front of her and entered the information in the correct data field she chuckled that strathmore had encountered difficulty sending the tracer himself apparently hed sent it twice both times receiving tankados address back rather than north dakotas it was a simple mistake susan thought strathmore had probably interchanged the data fields and the tracer had searched for the wrong account susan finished configuring her tracer and queued it for release then she hit return the computer beeped once tracer sent now came the waiting game susan exhaled she felt guilty for having been hard on the commander if there was anyone qualified to handle this threat singlehanded it was trevor strathmore he had an uncanny way of getting the best of all those who challenged him six months ago when the eff broke a story that an nsa submarine was snooping underwater telephone cables strathmore calmly leaked a conflicting story that the submarine was actually illegally burying toxic waste the eff and the oceanic environmentalists spent so much time bickering over which version was true the media eventually tired of the story and moved on every move strathmore made was meticulously planned he depended heavily on his computer when devising and revising his plans like many nsa employees strathmore used nsadeveloped software called brainstorma riskfree way to carry out whatif scenarios in the safety of a computer brainstorm was an artificial intelligence experiment described by its developers as a cause effect simulator it originally had been intended for use in political campaigns as a way to create realtime models of a given political environment fed by enormous amounts of data the program created a relationary weba hypothesized model of interaction between political variables including current prominent figures their staffs their personal ties to each other hot issues individuals motivations weighted by variables like sex ethnicity money and power the user could then enter any hypothetical event and brainstorm would predict the events effect on the environment commander strathmore worked religiously with brainstormnot for political purposes but as a tfm device timeline flowchart mapping software was a powerful tool for outlining complex strategies and predicting weaknesses susan suspected there were schemes hidden in strathmores computer that someday would change the world yes susan thought i was too hard on him her thoughts were jarred by the hiss of the node doors strathmore burst in susan he said david just called theres been a setback chapter a ring susan looked doubtful tankados missing a ring yes were lucky david caught it it was a real headsup play but youre after a passkey not jewelry i know strathmore said but i think they might be one and the same susan looked lost its a long story she motioned to the tracer on her screen im not going anywhere strathmore sighed heavily and began pacing apparently there were witnesses to tankados death according to the officer at the morgue a canadian tourist called the guardia this morning in a paniche said a japanese man was having a heart attack in the park when the officer arrived he found tankado dead and the canadian there with him so he radioed the paramedics while the paramedics took tankados body to the morgue the officer tried to get the canadian to tell him what happened all the old guy did was babble about some ring tankado had given away right before he died susan eyed him skeptically tankado gave away a ring yeah apparently he forced it in this old guys facelike he was begging him to take it sounds like the old guy got a close look at it strathmore stopped pacing and turned he said the ring was engravedwith some sort of lettering lettering yes and according to him it wasnt english strathmore raised his eyebrows expectantly japanese strathmore shook his head my first thought too but get thisthe canadian complained that the letters didnt spell anything japanese characters could never be confused with our roman lettering he said the engraving looked like a cat had gotten loose on a typewriter susan laughed commander you dont really think strathmore cut her off susan its crystal clear tankado engraved the digital fortress passkey on his ring gold is durable whether hes sleeping showering eatingthe passkey would always be with him ready at a moments notice for instant publication susan looked dubious on his finger in the open like that why not spain isnt exactly the encryption capital of the world nobody would have any idea what the letters meant besides if the key is a standard sixtyfourbiteven in broad daylight nobody could possibly read and memorize all sixtyfour characters susan looked perplexed and tankado gave this ring to a total stranger moments before he died why strathmores gaze narrowed why do you think it took susan only a moment before it clicked her eyes widened strathmore nodded tankado was trying to get rid of it he thought wed killed him he felt himself dying and logically assumed we were responsible the timing was too coincidental he figured wed gotten to him poison or something a slowacting cardiac arrestor he knew the only way wed dare kill him is if wed found north dakota susan felt a chill of course she whispered tankado thought that we neutralized his insurance policy so we could remove him too it was all coming clear to susan the timing of the heart attack was so fortunate for the nsa that tankado had assumed the nsa was responsible his final instinct was revenge ensei gave away his ring as a lastditch effort to publish the passkey now incredibly some unsuspecting canadian tourist held the key to the most powerful encryption algorithm in history susan sucked in a deep breath and asked the inevitable question so where is the canadian now strathmore frowned thats the problem the officer doesnt know where he is no the canadians story was so absurd that the officer figured he was either in shock or senile so he put the old guy on the back of his motorcycle to take him back to his hotel but the canadian didnt know enough to hang on he fell off before theyd gone three feetcracked his head and broke his wrist what susan choked the officer wanted to take him to a hospital but the canadian was furioussaid hed walk back to canada before hed get on the motorcycle again so all the officer could do was walk him to a small public clinic near the park he left him there to get checked out susan frowned i assume theres no need to ask where david is headed chapter david becker stepped out onto the scorching tile concourse of plaza de espana before him el ayunta mientothe ancient city council buildingrose from the trees on a threeacre bed of blue and white azulejo tiles its arabic spires and carved facade gave the impression it had been intended more as a palace than a public office despite its history of military coups fires and public hangings most tourists visited because the local brochures plugged it as the english military headquarters in the film lawrence of arabia it had been far cheaper for columbia pictures to film in spain than in egypt and the moorish influence on sevilles architecture was enough to convince moviegoers they were looking at cairo becker reset his seiko for local time pmstill afternoon by local standards a proper spaniard never ate dinner before sunset and the lazy andalusian sun seldom surrendered the skies before ten even in the earlyevening heat becker found himself walking across the park at a brisk clip strathmores tone had sounded a lot more urgent this time than it had that morning his new orders left no room for misinterpretation find the canadian get the ring do whatever is necessary just get that ring becker wondered what could possibly be so important about a ring with lettering all over it strathmore hadnt offered and becker hadnt asked nsa he thought never say anything on the other side of avenida isabela catolica the clinic was clearly visiblethe universal symbol of a red cross in a white circle painted on the roof the guardia officer had dropped the canadian off hours ago broken wrist bumped headno doubt the patient had been treated and discharged by now becker just hoped the clinic had discharge informationa local hotel or phone number where the man could be reached with a little luck becker figured he could find the canadian get the ring and be on his way home without any more complications strathmore had told becker use the ten thousand cash to buy the ring if you have to ill reimburse you thats not necessary becker had replied hed intended to return the money anyway he hadnt gone to spain for money hed gone for susan commander trevor strathmore was susans mentor and guardian susan owed him a lot a oneday errand was the least becker could do unfortunately things this morning hadnt gone quite as becker had planned hed hoped to call susan from the plane and explain everything he considered having the pilot radio strathmore so he could pass along a message but was hesitant to involve the deputy director in his romantic problems three times becker had tried to call susan himselffirst from a defunct cellular on board the jet next from a pay phone at the airport then again from the morgue susan was not in david wondered where she could be hed gotten her answering machine but had not left a message what he wanted to say was not a message for an answering machine as he approached the road he spotted a phone booth near the park entrance he jogged over snatched up the receiver and used his phone card to place the call there was a long pause as the number connected finally it began to ring come on be there after five rings the call connected hi this is susan fletcher sorry im not in right now but if you leave your name becker listened to the message where is she by now susan would be panicked he wondered if maybe shed gone to stone manor without him there was a beep hi its david he paused unsure what to say one of the things he hated about answering machines was that if you stopped to think they cut you off sorry i didnt call he blurted just in time he wondered if he should tell her what was going on he thought better of it call commander strathmore hell explain everything beckers heart was pounding this is absurd he thought i love you he added quickly and hung up becker waited for some traffic to pass on avenida borbolla he thought about how susan undoubtedly would have assumed the worst it was unlike him not to call when hed promised to becker stepped out onto the fourlane boulevard in and out he whispered to himself in and out he was too preoccupied to see the man in wirerim glasses watching from across the street chapter standing before the huge plateglass window in his tokyo skyrise numataka took a long pull on his cigar and smiled to himself he could scarcely believe his good fortune he had spoken to the american again and if all was going according to the timetable ensei tankado had been eliminated by now and his copy of the passkey had been confiscated it was ironic numataka thought that he himself would end up with ensei tankados passkey tokugen numataka had met tankado once many years ago the young programmer had come to numatech corp fresh out of college searching for a job numataka had denied him there was no question that tankado was brilliant but at the time there were other considerations although japan was changing numataka had been trained in the old school he lived by the code of menbokohonor and face imperfection was not to be tolerated if he hired a cripple he would bring shame on his company he had disposed of tankados resume without a glance numataka checked his watch again the american north dakota should have called by now numataka felt a tinge of nervousness he hoped nothing was wrong if the passkeys were as good as promised they would unlock the most soughtafter product of the computer agea totally invulnerable digital encryption algorithm numataka could embed the algorithm in tamperproof spraysealed vsli chips and mass market them to world computer manufacturers governments industries and perhaps even the darker markets the black market of world terrorists numataka smiled it appeared as usual that he had found favor with the shichigosanthe seven deities of good luck numatech corp was about to control the only copy of digital fortress that would ever exist twenty million dollars was a lot of moneybut considering the product it was the steal of the century chapter what if someone else is looking for the ring susan asked suddenly nervous could david be in danger strathmore shook his head nobody else knows the ring exists thats why i sent david i wanted to keep it that way curious spooks dont usually tail spanish teachers hes a professor susan corrected immediately regretting the clarification every now and again susan got the feeling david wasnt good enough for the commander that he thought somehow she could do better than a schoolteacher commander she said moving on if you briefed david by car phone this morning someone could have intercepted the oneinamillion shot strathmore interrupted his tone reassuring any eavesdropper had to be in the immediate vicinity and know exactly what to listen for he put his hand on her shoulder i would never have sent david if i thought it was dangerous he smiled trust me any sign of trouble and ill send in the pros strathmores words were punctuated by the sudden sound of someone pounding on the node glass susan and strathmore turned syssec phil chartrukian had his face pressed against the pane and was pounding fiercely straining to see through whatever he was excitedly mouthing was not audible through the soundproofed glass he looked like hed seen a ghost what the hell is chartrukian doing here strathmore growled hes not on duty today looks like trouble susan said he probably saw the runmonitor goddamn it the commander hissed i specifically called the scheduled syssec last night and told him not to come in susan was not surprised canceling a syssec duty was irregular but strathmore undoubtedly had wanted privacy in the dome the last thing he needed was some paranoid syssec blowing the lid off digital fortress we better abort transltr susan said we can reset the runmonitor and tell phil he was seeing things strathmore appeared to consider it then shook his head not yet transltr is fifteen hours into this attack i want to run it a full twentyfourjust to be sure this made sense to susan digital fortress was the first ever use of a rotating cleartext function maybe tankado had overlooked something maybe transltr would break it after twentyfour hours somehow susan doubted it transltr keeps running strathmore resolved i need to know for sure this algorithm is untouchable chartrukian continued pounding on the pane here goes nothing strathmore groaned back me up the commander took a deep breath and then strode to the sliding glass doors the pressure plate on the floor activated and the doors hissed open chartrukian practically fell into the room commander sir i im sorry to bother you but the runmonitor i ran a virus probe and phil phil phil the commander gushed pleasantly as he put a reassuring hand on chartrukians shoulder slow down what seems to be the problem from the easygoing tone in strathmores voice nobody would ever have guessed his world was falling in around him he stepped aside and ushered chartrukian into the sacred walls of node the syssec stepped over the threshold hesitantly like a welltrained dog that knew better from the puzzled look on chartrukians face it was obvious hed never seen the inside of this place whatever had been the source of his panic was momentarily forgotten he surveyed the plush interior the line of private terminals the couches the bookshelves the soft lighting when his gaze fell on the reigning queen of crypto susan fletcher he quickly looked away susan intimidated the hell out of him her mind worked on a different plane she was unsettlingly beautiful and his words always seemed to get jumbled around her susans unassuming air made it even worse what seems to be the problem phil strathmore said opening the refrigerator drink no ahno thank you sir he seemed tonguetied not sure he was truly welcome sir i think theres a problem with transltr strathmore closed the refrigerator and looked at chartrukian casually you mean the runmonitor chartrukian looked shocked you mean youve seen it sure its running at about sixteen hours if im not mistaken chartrukian seemed puzzled yes sir sixteen hours but thats not all sir i ran a virus probe and its turning up some pretty strange stuff really strathmore seemed unconcerned what kind of stuff susan watched impressed with the commanders performance chartrukian stumbled on transltrs processing something very advanced the filters have never seen anything like it im afraid transltr may have some sort of virus a virus strathmore chuckled with just a hint of condescension phil i appreciate your concern i really do but ms fletcher and i are running a new diagnostic some very advanced stuff i would have alerted you to it but i wasnt aware you were on duty today the syssec did his best to cover gracefully i switched with the new guy i took his weekend shift strathmores eyes narrowed thats odd i spoke to him last night i told him not to come in he said nothing about switching shifts chartrukian felt a knot rise in his throat there was a tense silence well strathmore finally sighed sounds like an unfortunate mixup he put a hand on the syssecs shoulder and led him toward the door the good news is you dont have to stay ms fletcher and i will be here all day well hold the fort you just enjoy your weekend chartrukian was hesitant commander i really think we should check the phil strathmore repeated a little more sternly transltr is fine if your probe saw something strange its because we put it there now if you dont mind strathmore trailed off and the syssec understood his time was up a diagnostic my ass chartrukian muttered as he fumed back into the syssec lab what kind of looping function keeps three million processors busy for sixteen hours chartrukian wondered if he should call the syssec supervisor goddamn cryptographers he thought they just dont understand security the oath chartrukian had taken when he joined syssec began running through his head he had sworn to use his expertise training and instinct to protect the nsas multibilliondollar investment instinct he said defiantly it doesnt take a psychic to know this isnt any goddamn diagnostic defiantly chartrukian strode over to the terminal and fired up transltrs complete array of system assessment software your babys in trouble commander he grumbled you dont trust instinct ill get you proof chapter la clinica de salud publica was actually a converted elementary school and didnt much resemble a hospital at all it was a long onestory brick building with huge windows and a rusted swing set out back becker headed up the crumbling steps inside it was dark and noisy the waiting room was a line of folding metal chairs that ran the entire length of a long narrow corridor a cardboard sign on a sawhorse read oficina with an arrow pointing down the hall becker walked the dimly lit corridor it was like some sort of eerie set conjured up for a hollywood horror flick the air smelled of urine the lights at the far end were blown out and the last forty or fifty feet revealed nothing but muted silhouettes a bleeding woman a young couple crying a little girl praying becker reached the end of the darkened hall the door to his left was slightly ajar and he pushed it open it was entirely empty except for an old withered woman naked on a cot struggling with her bedpan lovely becker groaned he closed the door where the hell is the office around a small dogleg in the hall becker heard voices he followed the sound and arrived at a translucent glass door that sounded as if a brawl were going on behind it reluctantly becker pushed the door open the office mayhem just as hed feared the line was about ten people deep everyone pushing and shouting spain was not known for its efficiency and becker knew he could be there all night waiting for discharge info on the canadian there was only one secretary behind the desk and she was fending off disgruntled patients becker stood in the doorway a moment and pondered his options there was a better way con permiso an orderly shouted a fastrolling gurney sailed by becker spun out of the way and called after the orderly donde esta el telefono without breaking stride the man pointed to a set of double doors and disappeared around the corner becker walked over to the doors and pushed his way through the room before him was enormousan old gymnasium the floor was a pale green and seemed to swim in and out of focus under the hum of the fluorescent lights on the wall a basketball hoop hung limply from its backboard scattered across the floor were a few dozen patients on low cots in the far corner just beneath a burnedout scoreboard was an old pay phone becker hoped it worked as he strode across the floor he fumbled in his pocket for a coin he found pesetas in cincoduros coins change from the taxijust enough for two local calls he smiled politely to an exiting nurse and made his way to the phone scooping up the receiver becker dialed directory assistance thirty seconds later he had the number for the clinics main office regardless of the country it seemed there was one universal truth when it came to offices nobody could stand the sound of an unanswered phone it didnt matter how many customers were waiting to be helped the secretary would always drop what she was doing to pick up the phone becker punched the sixdigit exchange in a moment hed have the clinics office there would undoubtedly be only one canadian admitted today with a broken wrist and a concussion his file would be easy to find becker knew the office would be hesitant to give out the mans name and discharge address to a total stranger but he had a plan the phone began to ring becker guessed five rings was all it would take it took nineteen clinica de salud publica barked the frantic secretary becker spoke in spanish with a thick francoamerican accent this is david becker im with the canadian embassy one of our citizens was treated by you today id like his information such that the embassy can arrange to pay his fees fine the woman said ill send it to the embassy on monday actually becker pressed its important i get it immediately impossible the woman snapped were very busy becker sounded as official as possible it is an urgent matter the man had a broken wrist and a head injury he was treated sometime this morning his file should be right on top becker thickened the accent in his spanishjust clear enough to convey his needs just confusing enough to be exasperating people had a way of bending the rules when they were exasperated instead of bending the rules however the woman cursed selfimportant north americans and slammed down the phone becker frowned and hung up strikeout the thought of waiting hours in line didnt thrill him the clock was tickingthe old canadian could be anywhere by now maybe he had decided to go back to canada maybe he would sell the ring becker didnt have hours to wait in line with renewed determination becker snatched up the receiver and redialed he pressed the phone to his ear and leaned back against the wall it began to ring becker gazed out into the room one ring two rings three a sudden surge of adrenaline coursed through his body becker wheeled and slammed the receiver back down into its cradle then he turned and stared back into the room in stunned silence there on a cot directly in front of him propped up on a pile of old pillows lay an elderly man with a clean white cast on his right wrist chapter the american on tokugen numatakas private line sounded anxious mr numatakai only have a moment fine i trust you have both passkeys there will be a small delay the american answered unacceptable numataka hissed you said i would have them by the end of today there is one loose end is tankado dead yes the voice said my man killed mr tankado but he failed to get the passkey tankado gave it away before he died to a tourist outrageous numataka bellowed then how can you promise me exclusive relax the american soothed you will have exclusive rights that is my guarantee as soon as the missing passkey is found digital fortress will be yours but the passkey could be copied anyone who has seen the key will be eliminated there was a long silence finally numataka spoke where is the key now all you need to know is that it will be found how can you be so certain because i am not the only one looking for it american intelligence has caught wind of the missing key for obvious reasons they would like to prevent the release of digital fortress they have sent a man to locate the key his name is david becker how do you know this that is irrelevant numataka paused and if mr becker locates the key my man will take it from him and after that you neednt be concerned the american said coldly when mr becker finds the key he will be properly rewarded chapter david becker strode over and stared down at the old man asleep on the cot the mans right wrist was wrapped in a cast he was between sixty and seventy years old his snowwhite hair was parted neatly to the side and in the center of his forehead was a deep purple welt that spread down into his right eye a little bump he thought recalling the lieutenants words becker checked the mans fingers there was no gold ring anywhere becker reached down and touched the mans arm sir he shook him lightly excuse me sir the man didnt move becker tried again a little louder sir the man stirred questce quelle heure est he slowly opened his eyes and focused on becker he scowled at having been disturbed questceque vous voulez yes becker thought a french canadian becker smiled down at him do you have a moment although beckers french was perfect he spoke in what he hoped would be the mans weaker language english convincing a total stranger to hand over a gold ring might be a little tricky becker figured he could use any edge he could get there was a long silence as the man got his bearings he surveyed his surroundings and lifted a long finger to smooth his limp white mustache finally he spoke what do you want his english carried a thin nasal accent sir becker said over pronouncing his words as if speaking to a deaf person i need to ask you a few questions the man glared up at him with a strange look on his face do you have some sort of problem becker frowned the mans english was impeccable he immediately lost the condescending tone im sorry to bother you sir but were you by any chance at the plaza de espana today the old mans eyes narrowed are you from the city council no actually im bureau of tourism no im look i know why youre here the old man struggled to sit up im not going to be intimidated if ive said it once ive said it a thousand timespierre cloucharde writes the world the way he lives the world some of your corporate guidebooks might sweep this under the table for a free night on the town but the montreal times is not for hire i refuse im sorry sir i dont think you under merde alors i understand perfectly he wagged a bony finger at becker and his voice echoed through the gymnasium youre not the first they tried the same thing at the moulin rouge browns palace and the golfigno in lagos but what went to press the truth the worst wellington ive ever eaten the filthiest tub ive ever seen and the rockiest beach ive ever walked my readers expect no less patients on nearby cots began sitting up to see what was going on becker looked around nervously for a nurse the last thing he needed was to get kicked out cloucharde was raging that miserable excuse for a police officer works for your city he made me get on his motorcycle look at me he tried to lift his wrist now whos going to write my column sir i ive never been so uncomfortable in my fortythree years of travel look at this place you know my column is syndicated in over sir becker held up both hands urgently signaling truce im not interested in your column im from the canadian consulate im here to make sure youre okay suddenly there was a dead quiet in the gymnasium the old man looked up from his bed and eyed the intruder suspiciously becker ventured on in almost a whisper im here to see if theres anything i can do to help like bring you a couple of valium after a long pause the canadian spoke the consulate his tone softened considerably becker nodded so youre not here about my column no sir it was as if a giant bubble had burst for pierre cloucharde he settled slowly back down onto his mound of pillows he looked heartbroken i thought you were from the city trying to get me to he faded off and then looked up if its not about my column then why are you here it was a good question becker thought picturing the smoky mountains just an informal diplomatic courtesy he lied the man looked surprised a diplomatic courtesy yes sir as im sure a man of your stature is well aware the canadian government works hard to protect its countrymen from the indignities suffered in these ershall we sayless refined countries clouchardes thin lips parted in a knowing smile but of course how pleasant you are a canadian citizen arent you yes of course how silly of me please forgive me someone in my position is often approached with well you understand yes mr cloucharde i certainly do the price one pays for celebrity indeed cloucharde let out a tragic sigh he was an unwilling martyr tolerating the masses can you believe this hideous place he rolled his eyes at the bizarre surroundings its a mockery and theyve decided to keep me overnight becker looked around i know its terrible im sorry it took me so long to get here cloucharde looked confused i wasnt even aware you were coming becker changed the subject looks like a nasty bump on your head does it hurt no not really i took a spill this morningthe price one pays for being a good samaritan the wrist is the thing thats hurting me stupid guardia i mean really putting a man of my age on a motorcycle its reprehensible is there anything i can get for you cloucharde thought a moment enjoying the attention well actually he stretched his neck and tilted his head left and right i could use another pillow if its not too much trouble not at all becker grabbed a pillow off a nearby cot and helped cloucharde get comfortable the old man sighed contentedly much better thank you pas du tout becker replied ah the man smiled warmly so you do speak the language of the civilized world thats about the extent of it becker said sheepishly not a problem cloucharde declared proudly my column is syndicated in the us my english is first rate so ive heard becker smiled he sat down on the edge of clouchardes cot now if you dont mind my asking mr cloucharde why would a man such as yourself come to a place like this there are far better hospitals in seville cloucharde looked angry that police officer he bucked me off his motorcycle and then left me bleeding in the street like a stuck pig i had to walk over here he didnt offer to take you to a better facility on that godawful bike of his no thanks what exactly happened this morning i told it all to the lieutenant ive spoken to the officer and i hope you reprimanded him cloucharde interrupted becker nodded in the severest terms my office will be following up i should hope so monsieur cloucharde becker smiled pulling a pen out of his jacket pocket id like to make a formal complaint to the city would you help a man of your reputation would be a valuable witness cloucharde looked buoyed by the prospect of being quoted he sat up why yes of course it would be my pleasure becker took out a small note pad and looked up okay lets start with this morning tell me about the accident the old man sighed it was sad really the poor asian fellow just collapsed i tried to help himbut it was no use you gave him cpr cloucharde looked ashamed im afraid i dont know how i called an ambulance becker remembered the bluish bruises on tankados chest did the paramedics administer cpr heavens no cloucharde laughed no reason to whip a dead horsethe fellow was long gone by the time the ambulance got there they checked his pulse and carted him off leaving me with that horrific policeman thats strange becker thought wondering where the bruise had come from he pushed it from his mind and got to the matter at hand what about the ring he said as nonchalantly as possible cloucharde looked surprised the lieutenant told you about the ring yes he did cloucharde seemed amazed really i didnt think he believed my story he was so rudeas if he thought i were lying but my story was accurate of course i pride myself on accuracy where is the ring becker pressed cloucharde didnt seem to hear he was glassyeyed staring into space strange piece really all those letterslooked like no language id ever seen japanese maybe becker offered definitely not so you got a good look at it heavens yes when i knelt down to help the man kept pushing his fingers in my face he wanted to give me the ring it was most bizarre horrible reallyhis hands were quite dreadful and thats when you took the ring cloucharde went wideeyed thats what the officer told you that i took the ring becker shifted uneasily cloucharde exploded i knew he wasnt listening thats how rumors get started i told him the jap fellow gave away the ringbut not to me theres no way i would take anything from a dying man my heavens the thought of it becker sensed trouble so you dont have the ring heavens no a dull ache crept through the pit of his stomach then who has it cloucharde glared at becker indignantly the german the german has it becker felt like the floor had been pulled out from under him german what german the german in the park i told the officer about him i refused the ring but the fascist swine accepted it becker set down his pen and paper the charade was over this was trouble so a german has the ring indeed where did he go no idea i ran to call the police when i got back he was gone do you know who he was some tourist are you sure my life is tourists cloucharde snapped i know one when i see one he and his lady friend were out strolling the park becker was more and more confused every moment lady friend there was somebody with the german cloucharde nodded an escort gorgeous redhead mon dieu beautiful an escort becker was stunned as in a prostitute cloucharde grimaced yes if you must use the vulgar term but the officer said nothing about of course not i never mentioned the escort cloucharde dismissed becker with a patronizing wave of his good hand they arent criminalsits absurd that theyre harassed like common thieves becker was still in a mild state of shock was there anyone else there no just the three of us it was hot and youre positive the woman was a prostitute absolutely no woman that beautiful would be with a manlike that unless she were well paid mon dieu he was fat fat fat a loudmouthed overweight obnoxious german cloucharde winced momentarily as he shifted his weight but he ignored the pain and plowed on this man was a beastthree hundred pounds at least he locked onto that poor dear like she was about to run awaynot that id blame her i mean really hands all over her bragged that he had her all weekend for three hundred dollars hes the one who should have dropped dead not that poor asian fellow cloucharde came up for air and becker jumped in did you get his name cloucharde thought for a moment and then shook his head no idea he winced in pain again and settled slowly back into his pillows becker sighed the ring had just evaporated before his eyes commander strathmore was not going to be happy cloucharde dabbed at his forehead his burst of enthusiasm had taken its toll he suddenly looked ill becker tried another approach mr cloucharde id like to get a statement from the german and his escort as well do you have any idea where theyre staying cloucharde closed his eyes his strength fading his breathing grew shallow anything at all becker pressed the escorts name there was a long silence cloucharde rubbed his right temple he was suddenly looking pale well ah no i dont believe his voice was shaky becker leaned toward him are you all right cloucharde nodded lightly yes fine just a little the excitement maybe he trailed off think mr cloucharde becker urged quietly its important cloucharde winced i dont know the woman the man kept calling her he closed his eyes and groaned what was her name i really dont recall cloucharde was fading fast think becker prodded its important that the consular file be as complete as possible ill need to support your story with statements from the other witnesses any information you can give me to help locate them but cloucharde was not listening he was dabbing his forehead with the sheet im sorry perhaps tomorrow he looked nauseated mr cloucharde its important you remember this now becker suddenly realized he was speaking too loudly people on nearby cots were still sitting up watching what was going on on the far side of the room a nurse appeared through the double doors and strode briskly toward them anything at all becker pressed urgently the german called the woman becker lightly shook cloucharde trying to bring him back clouchardes eyes flickered momentarily her name stay with me old fella dew clouchardes eyes closed again the nurse was closing in she looked furious dew becker shook clouchardes arm the old man groaned he called her cloucharde was mumbling now barely audible the nurse was less than ten feet away yelling at becker in angry spanish becker heard nothing his eyes were fixed on the old mans lips he shook cloucharde one last time as the nurse bore down on him the nurse grabbed david beckers shoulder she pulled him to his feet just as clouchardes lips parted the single word leaving the old mans mouth was not actually spoken it was softly sighedlike a distant sensual remembrance dewdrop the scolding grasp yanked becker away dewdrop becker wondered what the hell kind of name is dewdrop he spun away from the nurse and turned one last time to cloucharde dewdrop are you sure but pierre cloucharde was fast asleep chapter susan sat alone in the plush surroundings of node she nursed a lemon mist herb tea and awaited the return of her tracer as senior cryptographer susan enjoyed the terminal with the best view it was on the back side of the ring of computers and faced the crypto floor from this spot susan could oversee all of node she could also see on the other side of the oneway glass transltr standing deadcenter of the crypto floor susan checked the clock she had been waiting almost an hour american remailers anonymous was apparently taking their time forwarding north dakotas mail she sighed heavily despite her efforts to forget her morning conversation with david the words played over and over in her head she knew shed been hard on him she prayed he was okay in spain her thoughts were jarred by the loud hiss of the glass doors she looked up and groaned cryptographer greg hale stood in the opening greg hale was tall and muscular with thick blond hair and a deep cleft chin he was loud thickfleshed and perpetually overdressed his fellow cryptographers had nicknamed him haliteafter the mineral hale had always assumed it referred to some rare gemparalleling his unrivaled intellect and rockhard physique had his ego permitted him to consult an encyclopedia he would have discovered it was nothing more than the salty residue left behind when oceans dried up like all nsa cryptographers hale made a solid salary however he had a hard time keeping that fact to himself he drove a white lotus with a moon roof and a deafening subwoofer system he was a gadget junkie and his car was his showpiece hed installed a global positioning computer system voiceactivated door locks a fivepoint radar jammer and a cellular faxphone so hed never be out of touch with his message services his vanity plate read megabyte and was framed in violet neon greg hale had been rescued from a childhood of petty crime by the us marine corps it was there that hed learned about computers he was one of the best programmers the marines had ever seen well on his way to a distinguished military career but two days before the completion of his third tour of duty his future suddenly changed hale accidentally killed a fellow marine in a drunken brawl the korean art of selfdefense tae kwon do proved more deadly than defensive he was promptly relieved of his duty after serving a brief prison term halite began looking for work in the private sector as a programmer he was always up front about the incident in the marines and he courted prospective employers by offering a months work without pay to prove his worth he had no shortage of takers and once they found out what he could do with a computer they never wanted to let him go as his computer expertise grew hale began making internet connections all over the world he was one of the new breed of cyberfreaks with email friends in every nation moving in and out of seedy electronic bulletin boards and european chat groups hed been fired by two different employers for using their business accounts to upload pornographic photos to some of his friends what are you doing here hale demanded stopping in the doorway and staring at susan hed obviously expected to have node to himself today susan forced herself to stay cool its saturday greg i could ask you the same question but susan knew what hale was doing there he was the consummate computer addict despite the saturday rule he often slipped into crypto on weekends to use the nsas unrivalled computing power to run new programs he was working on just wanted to retweak a few lines and check my email hale said he eyed her curiously what was it you said youre doing here i didnt susan replied hale arched a surprised eyebrow no reason to be coy we have no secrets here in node remember all for one and one for all susan sipped her lemon mist and ignored him hale shrugged and strode toward the node pantry the pantry was always his first stop as hale crossed the room he sighed heavily and made a point of ogling susans legs stretched out beneath her terminal susan without looking up retracted her legs and kept working hale smirked susan had gotten used to hale hitting on her his favorite line was something about interfacing to check the compatibility of their hardware it turned susans stomach she was too proud to complain to strathmore about hale it was far easier just to ignore him hale approached the node pantry and pulled open the lattice doors like a bull he slid a tupperware container of tofu out of the fridge and popped a few pieces of the gelatinous white substance in his mouth then he leaned on the stove and smoothed his gray bellvienne slacks and wellstarched shirt you gonna be here long all night susan said flatly hmm halite cooed with his mouth full a cozy saturday in the playpen just the two of us just the three of us susan interjected commander strathmores upstairs you might want to disappear before he sees you hale shrugged he doesnt seem to mind you here he must really enjoy your company susan forced herself to keep silent hale chuckled to himself and put away his tofu then he grabbed a quart of virgin olive oil and took a few swigs he was a health fiend and claimed olive oil cleaned out his lower intestine when he wasnt pushing carrot juice on the rest of the staff he was preaching the virtues of high colonics hale replaced the olive oil and went to down his computer directly opposite susan even across the wide ring of terminals susan could smell his cologne she crinkled her nose nice cologne greg use the entire bottle hale flicked on his terminal only for you dear as he sat there waiting for his terminal to warm up susan had a sudden unsettling thought what if hale accessed transltrs runmonitor there was no logical reason why he would but nonetheless susan knew he would never fall for some halfbaked story about a diagnostic that stumped transltr for sixteen hours hale would demand to know the truth the truth was something susan had no intention of telling him she did not trust greg hale he was not nsa material susan had been against hiring him in the first place but the nsa had had no choice hale had been the product of damage control the skipjack fiasco four years ago in an effort to create a single publickey encryption standard congress charged the nations best mathematicians those at the nsa to write a new super algorithm the plan was for congress to pass legislation that made the new algorithm the nations standard thus alleviating the incompatibilities now suffered by corporations that used different algorithms of course asking the nsa to lend a hand in improving publickey encryption was somewhat akin to asking a condemned man to build his own coffin transltr had not yet been conceived and an encryption standard would only help to proliferate the use of codewriting and make the nsas already difficult job that much harder the eff understood this conflict of interest and lobbied vehemently that the nsa might create an algorithm of poor qualitysomething it could break to appease these fears congress announced that when the nsas algorithm was finished the formula would be published for examination by the worlds mathematicians to ensure its quality reluctantly the nsas crypto team led by commander strathmore created an algorithm they christened skipjack skipjack was presented to congress for their approval mathematicians from all over the world tested skipjack and were unanimously impressed they reported that it was a strong untainted algorithm and would make a superb encryption standard but three days before congress was to vote their certain approval of skipjack a young programmer from bell laboratories greg hale shocked the world by announcing hed found a back door hidden in the algorithm the back door consisted of a few lines of cunning programming that commander strathmore had inserted into the algorithm it had been added in so shrewd a way that nobody except greg hale had seen it strathmores covert addition in effect meant that any code written by skipjack could be decrypted via a secret password known only to the nsa strathmore had come within inches of turning the nations proposed encryption standard into the biggest intelligence coup the nsa had ever seen the nsa would have held the master key to every code written in america the computersavvy public was outraged the eff descended on the scandal like vultures ripping congress to shreds for their naivete and proclaiming the nsa the biggest threat to the free world since hitler the encryption standard was dead it had come as little surprise when the nsa hired greg hale two days later strathmore felt it was better to have him on the inside working for the nsa than on the outside working against it strathmore faced the skipjack scandal headon he defended his actions vehemently to congress he argued that the publics craving for privacy would come back to haunt them he insisted the public needed someone to watch over them the public needed the nsa to break codes in order to keep the peace groups like the eff felt differently and theyd been fighting him ever since chapter david becker stood in a phone booth across the street from la clinica de salud publica hed just been ejected for harassing patient number monsieur cloucharde things were suddenly more complicated than hed anticipated his little favor to strathmorepicking up some personal belongingshad turned into a scavenger hunt for some bizarre ring hed just called strathmore and told him about the german tourist the news had not been received well after demanding the specifics strathmore had fallen silent for a long time david he had finally said very gravely finding that ring is a matter of national security im leaving it in your hands dont fail me the phone had gone dead david stood in the phone booth and sighed he picked up the tattered guia telefonica and began scanning the yellow pages here goes nothing he muttered to himself there were only three listings for escort services in the directory and he didnt have much to go on all he knew was that the germans date had red hair which conveniently was rare in spain the delirious cloucharde had recalled the escorts name as dewdrop becker cringeddewdrop it sounded more like a cow than a beautiful girl not a good catholic name at all cloucharde must have been mistaken becker dialed the first number servicio social de sevilla a pleasant female voice answered becker affected his spanish with a thick german accent holahablas aleman no but i speak english came the reply becker continued in broken english thank you i wondering if you to help me how can we be of service the woman spoke slowly in an effort to aid her potential client perhaps you would like an escort yes please today my brother klaus he has girl very beautiful red hair i want same for tomorrow please your brother klaus comes here the voice was suddenly effervescent like they were old friends yes he very fat you remember him no he was here today you say becker could hear her checking the books there would be no klaus listed but becker figured clients seldom used their real names hmm im sorry she apologized i dont see him here what was the girls name your brother was with had red hair becker said avoiding the question red hair she repeated there was a pause this is servicio social de sevilla are you sure your brother comes here sure yes senor we have no redheads we have only pure andalusian beauties red hair becker repeated feeling stupid im sorry we have no redheads at all but if you name is dewdrop becker blurted feeling even stupider the ridiculous name apparently meant nothing to the woman she apologized suggested becker was confusing her with another agency and politely hung up strike one becker frowned and dialed the next number it connected immediately buenas noches mujeres espana may i help you becker launched into his same spiel a german tourist who was willing to pay top dollar for the redhaired girl who was out with his brother today this time the response was in polite german but again no redheads keine rotkopfe im sorry the woman hung up strike two becker looked down at the phone book there was only one number left the end of the rope already he dialed escortes belen a man answered in a very slick tone again becker told his story si si senor my name is senor roldan i would be pleased to help we have two redheads lovely girls beckers heart leapt very beautiful he repeated in his german accent red hair yes what is your brothers name i will tell you who was his escort today and we can send her to you tomorrow klaus schmidt becker blurted a name recalled from an old textbook a long pause well sir i dont see a klaus schmidt on our registry but perhaps your brother chose to be discreetperhaps a wife at home he laughed inappropriately yes klaus married but he very fat his wife no lie with him becker rolled his eyes at himself reflected in the booth if susan could hear me now he thought i fat and lonely too i want lie with her pay lots of money becker was giving an impressive performance but hed gone too far prostitution was illegal in spain and senor roldan was a careful man hed been burned before by guardia officials posing as eager tourists i want lie with her roldan knew it was a setup if he said yes he would be heavily fined and as always forced to provide one of his most talented escorts to the police commissioner free of charge for an entire weekend when roldan spoke his voice not quite as friendly sir this is escortes belen may i ask whos calling aah sigmund schmidt becker invented weakly where did you get our number la guia telefonica yellow pages yes sir thats because we are an escort service yes i want escort becker sensed something was wrong sir escortes belen is a service providing escorts to businessmen for luncheons and dinners this is why we are listed in the phone book what we do is legal what you are looking for is a prostitute the word slid off his tongue like a vile disease but my brother sir if your brother spent the day kissing a girl in the park she was not one of ours we have strict regulations about clientescort contact but you have us confused with someone else we only have two redheads inmaculada and rocio and neither would allow a man to sleep with them for money that is called prostitution and it is illegal in spain good night sir but click becker swore under his breath and dropped the phone back into its cradle strike three he was certain cloucharde had said the german had hired the girl for the entire weekend becker stepped out of the phone booth at the intersection of calle salado and avenida asuncion despite the traffic the sweet scent of seville oranges hung all around him it was twilightthe most romantic hour he thought of susan strathmores words invaded his mind find the ring becker flopped miserably on a bench and pondered his next move what move chapter inside the clinica de salud publica visiting hours were over the gymnasium lights had been turned out pierre cloucharde was fast asleep he did not see the figure hunched over him the needle of a stolen syringe glinted in the dark then it disappeared into the iv tube just above clouchardes wrist the hypodermic contained cc of cleaning fluid stolen from a janitors cart with great force a strong thumb rammed the plunger down and forced the bluish liquid into the old mans veins cloucharde was awake only for a few seconds he might have screamed in pain had a strong hand not been clamped across his mouth he lay trapped on his cot pinned beneath a seemingly immovable weight he could feel the pocket of fire searing its way up his arm there was an excruciating pain traveling through his armpit his chest and then like a million shattering pieces of glass it hit his brain cloucharde saw a brilliant flash of light and then nothing the visitor released his grip and peered through the darkness at the name on the medical chart then he slipped silently out on the street the man in wirerim glasses reached to a tiny device attached to his belt the rectangular pack was about the size of a credit card it was a prototype of the new monocle computer developed by the us navy to help technicians record battery voltages in cramped quarters on submarines the miniature computer packed a cellular modem and the newest advances in micro technology its visual monitor was a transparent liquid crystal display mounted in the left lens of a pair of eyeglasses the monocle reflected a whole new age in personal computing the user could now look through his data and still interact with the world around him the monocles real coup though was not its miniature display but rather its data entry system a user entered information via tiny contacts fixed to his fingertips touching the contacts together in sequence mimicked a shorthand similar to court stenography the computer would then translate the shorthand into english the killer pressed a tiny switch and his glasses flickered to life his hands inconspicuously at his sides he began touching different fingertips together in rapid succession a message appeared before his eyes subject p clouchardeterminated he smiled transmitting notification of kills was part of his assignment but including victims names that to the man in the wirerim glasses was elegance his fingers flashed again and his cellular modem activated message sent chapter sitting on the bench across from the public clinic becker wondered what he was supposed to do now his calls to the escort agencies had turned up nothing the commander uneasy about communication over unsecured public phones had asked david not to call again until he had the ring becker considered going to the local police for helpmaybe they had a record of a redheaded hookerbut strathmore had given strict orders about that too you are invisible no one is to know this ring exists becker wondered if he was supposed to wander the druggedout district of triana in search of this mystery woman or maybe he was supposed to check all the restaurants for an obese german everything seemed like a waste of time strathmores words kept coming back its a matter of national security you must find that ring a voice in the back of beckers head told him hed missed somethingsomething crucialbut for the life of him he couldnt think what it would be im a teacher not a damned secret agent he was beginning to wonder why strathmore hadnt sent a professional becker stood up and walked aimlessly down calle delicias pondering his options the cobblestone sidewalk blurred beneath his gaze night was falling fast dewdrop there was something about that absurd name that nagged at the back of his mind dewdrop the slick voice of senor roldan at escortes belen was on endless loop in his head we only have two redheads two redheads inmaculada and rocio rocio rocio becker stopped short he suddenly knew and i call myself a language specialist he couldnt believe hed missed it rocio was one of the most popular girls names in spain it carried all the right implications for a young catholic girlpurity virginity natural beauty the connotations of purity all stemmed from the names literal meaningdrop of dew the old canadians voice rang in beckers ears dewdrop rocio had translated her name to the only language she and her client had in commonenglish excited becker hurried off to find a phone across the street a man in wirerim glasses followed just out of sight chapter on the crypto floor the shadows were growing long and faint overhead the automatic lighting gradually increased to compensate susan was still at her terminal silently awaiting news from her tracer it was taking longer than expected her mind had been wanderingmissing david and willing greg hale to go home although hale hadnt budged thankfully hed been silent engrossed in whatever he was doing at his terminal susan couldnt care less what hale was doing as long as he didnt access the runmonitor he obviously hadntsixteen hours would have brought an audible yelp of disbelief susan was sipping her third cup of tea when it finally happenedher terminal beeped once her pulse quickened a flashing envelope icon appeared on her monitor announcing the arrival of email susan shot a quick glance toward hale he was absorbed in his work she held her breath and doubleclicked the envelope north dakota she whispered to herself lets see who you are when the email opened it was a single line susan read it and then she read it again dinner at alfredos pm across the room hale muffled a chuckle susan checked the message header from ghalecryptonsagov susan felt a surge of anger but fought it off she deleted the message very mature greg they make a great carpaccio hale smiled what do you say afterward we could forget it snob hale sighed and turned back to his terminal that was strike eightynine with susan fletcher the brilliant female cryptographer was a constant frustration to him hale had often fantasized about having sex with herpinning her against transltrs curved hull and taking her right there against the warm black tile but susan would have nothing to do with him in hales mind what made things worse was that she was in love with some university teacher who slaved for hours on end for peanuts it would be a pity for susan to dilute her superior gene pool procreating with some geekparticularly when she could have greg wed have perfect children he thought what are you working on hale asked trying a different approach susan said nothing some team player you are sure i cant have a peek hale stood and started moving around the circle of terminals toward her susan sensed that hales curiosity had the potential to cause some serious problems today she made a snap decision its a diagnostic she offered falling back on the commanders lie hale stopped in his tracks diagnostic he sounded doubtful youre spending saturday running a diagnostic instead of playing with the prof his name is david whatever susan glared at him havent you got anything better to do are you trying to get rid of me hale pouted actually yes gee sue im hurt susan fletchers eyes narrowed she hated being called sue she had nothing against the nickname but hale was the only one whod ever used it why dont i help you hale offered he was suddenly circling toward her again im great with diagnostics besides im dying to see what diagnostic could make the mighty susan fletcher come to work on a saturday susan felt a surge of adrenaline she glanced down at the tracer on her screen she knew she couldnt let hale see ithed have too many questions ive got it covered greg she said but hale kept coming as he circled toward her terminal susan knew she had to act fast hale was only a few yards away when she made her move she stood to meet his towering frame blocking his way his cologne was overpowering she looked him straight in the eye i said no hale cocked his head apparently intrigued by her odd display of secrecy he playfully stepped closer greg hale was not ready for what happened next with unwavering cool susan pressed a single index finger against his rockhard chest stopping his forward motion hale halted and stepped back in shock apparently susan fletcher was serious she had never touched him before ever it wasnt quite what hale had had in mind for their first contact but it was a start he gave her a long puzzled look and slowly returned to his terminal as he sat back down one thing became perfectly clear the lovely susan fletcher was working on something important and it sure as hell wasnt any diagnostic chapter senor roldan was sitting behind his desk at escortes belen congratulating himself for deftly sidestepping the guardias newest pathetic attempt to trap him having an officer fake a german accent and request a girl for the nightit was entrapment what would they think of next the phone on his desk buzzed loudly senor roldan scooped up the receiver with a confident flair buenas noches escortes belen buenas noches a mans voice said in lightningfast spanish he sounded nasal like he had a slight cold is this a hotel no sir what number are you dialing senor roldan was not going to fall for any more tricks this evening the voice said roldan frowned the voice sounded vaguely familiar he tried to place the accentburgos maybe youve dialed the correct number roldan offered cautiously but this is an escort service there was a pause on the line oh i see im sorry somebody wrote down this number i thought it was a hotel im visiting here from burgos my apologies for disturbing you good nigh espere wait senor roldan couldnt help himself he was a salesman at heart was this a referral a new client from up north he wasnt going to let a little paranoia blow a potential sale my friend roldan gushed into the phone i thought i recognized a bit of a burgos accent on you i myself am from valencia what brings you to seville i sell jewelry majorica pearls majoricas reeaally you must travel quite a bit the voice coughed sickly well yes i do in seville on business roldan pressed there was no way in hell this guy was guardia he was a customer with a capital c let me guessa friend gave you our number he told you to give us a call am i right the voice was obviously embarrassed well no actually its nothing like that dont be shy senor we are an escort service nothing to be ashamed of lovely girls dinner dates that is all who gave you our number perhaps he is a regular i can give you a special rate the voice became flustered ah nobody actually gave me this number i found it with a passport im trying to find the owner roldans heart sank this man was not a customer after all you found the number you say yes i found a mans passport in the park today your number was on a scrap of paper inside i thought perhaps it was the mans hotel i was hoping to return his passport to him my mistake ill just drop it off at a police station on my way out of perdon roldan interrupted nervously might i suggest a better idea roldan prided himself on discretion and visits to the guardia had a way of making his customers excustomers consider this he offered because the man with the passport had our number he is most likely a client here perhaps i could save you a trip to the police the voice hesitated i dont know i should probably just do not be too hasty my friend im ashamed to admit that the police here in seville are not always as efficient as the police up north it could be days before this mans passport is returned to him if you tell me his name i could see that he gets his passport immediately yes well i suppose theres no harm some paper rustled and the voice returned its a german name i cant quite pronounce it gusta gustafson roldan didnt recognize the name but he had clients from all over the world they never left their real names what does he look likein his photo perhaps i will recognize him well the voice said his face is very very fat roldan immediately knew he remembered the obese face well it was the man with rocio it was odd he thought to have two calls about the german in one night mr gustafson roldan forced a chuckle of course i know him well if you bring me his passport ill see he gets it im downtown without a car the voice interrupted maybe you could come to me actually roldan hedged i cant leave the phone but its really not that far if you im sorry its late to be out wandering about theres a guardia precinct nearby ill drop it there and when you see mr gustafson you can tell him where it is no wait roldan cried the police really neednt be involved you said youre downtown right do you know the alfonso xiii hotel its one of the citys finest yes the voice said i know the alfonso xiii its nearby wonderful mr gustafson is a guest there tonight hes probably there now the voice hesitated i see well then i suppose it would be no trouble superb hes having dinner with one of our escorts in the hotel restaurant roldan knew they were probably in bed by now but he needed to be careful not to offend the callers refined sensibilities just leave the passport with the concierge his name is manuel tell him i sent you ask him to give it to rocio rocio is mr gustafsons date for the evening she will see that the passport is returned you might slip your name and address insideperhaps mr gustafson will send you a little thank you a fine idea the alfonso xiii very well ill take it over right now thank you for your help david becker hung up the phone alfonso xiii he chuckled just have to know how to ask moments later a silent figure followed becker up calle deliciasinto the softly settling andalusian night chapter still unnerved from her encounter with hale susan gazed out through the oneway glass of node the crypto floor was empty hale was silent again engrossed she wished he would leave she wondered if she should call strathmore the commander could simply kick hale outafter all it was saturday susan knew however that if hale got kicked out he would immediately become suspicious once dismissed he probably would start calling other cryptographers asking what they thought was going on susan decided it was better just to let hale be he would leave on his own soon enough an unbreakable algorithm she sighed her thoughts returning to digital fortress it amazed her that an algorithm like that could really be createdthen again the proof was right there in front of her transltr appeared useless against it susan thought of strathmore nobly bearing the weight of this ordeal on his shoulders doing what was necessary staying cool in the face of disaster susan sometimes saw david in strathmore they had many of the same qualitiestenacity dedication intelligence sometimes susan thought strathmore would be lost without her the purity of her love for cryptography seemed to be an emotional lifeline to strathmore lifting him from the sea of churning politics and reminding him of his early days as a codebreaker susan relied on strathmore too he was her shelter in a world of powerhungry men nurturing her career protecting her and as he often joked making all her dreams come true there was some truth to that she thought as unintentional as it may have been the commander was the one whod made the call that brought david becker to the nsa that fateful afternoon her mind reeled back to him and her eyes fell instinctively to the pullslide beside her keyboard there was a small fax taped there the fax had been there for seven months it was the only code susan fletcher had yet to break it was from david she read it for the fivehundredth time please accept this humble fax my love for you is without wax hed sent it to her after a minor tiff shed begged him for months to tell her what it meant but he had refused without wax it was davids revenge susan had taught david a lot about codebreaking and to keep him on his toes she had taken to encoding all of her messages to him with some simple encryption scheme shopping lists love notesthey were all encrypted it was a game and david had become quite a good cryptographer then hed decided to return the favor hed started signing all his letters without wax david susan had over two dozen notes from david they were all signed the same way without wax susan begged to know the hidden meaning but david wasnt talking whenever she asked he simply smiled and said youre the codebreaker the nsas head cryptographer had tried everythingsubstitutions cipher boxes even anagrams shed run the letters without wax through her computer and asked for rearrangements of the letters into new phrases all shed gotten back was taxi hut wow it appeared ensei tankado was not the only one who could write unbreakable codes her thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the pneumatic doors hissing open strathmore strode in susan any word yet strathmore saw greg hale and stopped short well good evening mr hale he frowned his eyes narrowing on a saturday no less to what do we owe the honor hale smiled innocently just making sure i pull my weight i see strathmore grunted apparently weighing his options after a moment it seemed he too decided not to rock hales boat he turned coolly to susan ms fletcher could i speak to you for a moment outside susan hesitated ah yes sir she shot an uneasy glance at her monitor and then across the room at greg hale just a minute with a few quick keystrokes she pulled up a program called screenlock it was a privacy utility every terminal in node was equipped with it because the terminals stayed on around the clock screenlock enabled cryptographers to leave their stations and know that nobody would tamper with their files susan entered her fivecharacter privacy code and her screen went black it would remain that way until she returned and typed the proper sequence then she slipped on her shoes and followed the commander out what the hell is he doing here strathmore demanded as soon as he and susan were outside node his usual susan replied nothing strathmore looked concerned has he said anything about transltr no but if he accesses the runmonitor and sees it registering seventeen hours hell have something to say all right strathmore considered it theres no reason hed access it susan eyed the commander you want to send him home no well let him be strathmore glanced over at the syssec office has chartrukian left yet i dont know i havent seen him jesus strathmore groaned this is a circus he ran a hand across the beard stubble that had darkened his face over the past thirtysix hours any word yet on the tracer i feel like im sitting on my hands up there not yet any word from david strathmore shook his head i asked him not to call me until he has the ring susan looked surprised why not what if he needs help strathmore shrugged i cant help him from herehes on his own besides id rather not talk on unsecured lines just in case someones listening susans eyes widened in concern whats that supposed to mean strathmore immediately looked apologetic he gave her a reassuring smile davids fine im just being careful thirty feet away from their conversation hidden behind the oneway glass of node greg hale stood at susans terminal her screen was black hale glanced out at the commander and susan then he reached for his wallet he extracted a small index card and read it doublechecking that strathmore and susan were still talking hale carefully typed five keystrokes on susans keyboard a second later her monitor sprang to life bingo he chuckled stealing the node privacy codes had been simple in node every terminal had an identical detachable keyboard hale had simply taken his keyboard home one night and installed a chip that kept a record of every keystroke made on it then he had come in early swapped his modified keyboard for someone elses and waited at the end of the day he switched back and viewed the data recorded by the chip even though there were millions of keystrokes to sort through finding the access code was simple the first thing a cryptographer did every morning was type the privacy code that unlocked his terminal this of course made hales job effortlessthe privacy code always appeared as the first five characters on the list it was ironic hale thought as he gazed at susans monitor hed stolen the privacy codes just for kicks he was happy now hed done it the program on susans screen looked significant hale puzzled over it for a moment it was written in limbonot one of his specialties just by looking at it though hale could tell one thing for certainthis was not a diagnostic he could make sense of only two words but they were enough tracer searching tracer he said aloud searching for what hale felt suddenly uneasy he sat a moment studying susans screen then he made his decision hale understood enough about the limbo programming language to know that it borrowed heavily from two other languagesc and pascalboth of which he knew cold glancing up to check that strathmore and susan were still talking outside hale improvised he entered a few modified pascal commands and hit return the tracers status window responded exactly as he had hoped tracer abort he quickly typed yes are you sure again he typed yes after a moment the computer beeped tracer aborted hale smiled the terminal had just sent a message telling susans tracer to selfdestruct prematurely whatever she was looking for would have to wait mindful to leave no evidence hale expertly navigated his way into her system activity log and deleted all the commands hed just typed then he reentered susans privacy code the monitor went black when susan fletcher returned to node greg hale was seated quietly at his terminal chapter alfonso xiii was a small fourstar hotel set back from the puerta de jerez and surrounded by a thick wroughtiron fence and lilacs david made his way up the marble stairs as he reached for the door it magically opened and a bellhop ushered him inside baggage senor may i help you no thanks i need to see the concierge the bellhop looked hurt as if something in their twosecond encounter had not been satisfactory por aqui senor he led becker into the lobby pointed to the concierge and hurried off the lobby was exquisite small and elegantly appointed spains golden age had long since passed but for a while in the mids this small nation had ruled the world the room was a proud reminder of that erasuits of armor military etchings and a display case of gold ingots from the new world hovering behind the counter marked conserje was a trim wellgroomed man smiling so eagerly that it appeared hed waited his entire life to be of assistance en que puedo servirle senor how may i serve you he spoke with an affected lisp and ran his eyes up and down beckers body becker responded in spanish i need to speak to manuel the mans welltanned face smiled even wider si si senor i am manuel what is it you desire senor roldan at escortes belen told me you would the concierge silenced becker with a wave and glanced nervously around the lobby why dont you step over here he led becker to the end of the counter now he continued practically in a whisper how may i help you becker began again lowering his voice i need to speak to one of his escorts whom i believe is dining here her name is rocio the concierge let out his breath as though overwhelmed aaah rocioa beautiful creature i need to see her immediately but senor she is with a client becker nodded apologetically its important a matter of national security the concierge shook his head impossible perhaps if you left a it will only take a moment is she in the dining room the concierge shook his head our dining room closed half an hour ago im afraid rocio and her guest have retired for the evening if youd like to leave me a message i can give it to her in the morning he motioned to the bank of numbered message boxes behind him if i could just call her room and im sorry the concierge said his politeness evaporating the alfonso xiii has strict policies regarding client privacy becker had no intention of waiting ten hours for a fat man and a prostitute to wander down for breakfast i understand becker said sorry to bother you he turned and walked back into the lobby he strode directly to a cherry rolltop desk that had caught his eye on his way in it held a generous supply of alfonso xiii postcards and stationery as well as pens and envelopes becker sealed a blank piece of paper in an envelope and wrote one word on the envelope rocio then he went back to the concierge im sorry to trouble you again becker said approaching sheepishly im being a bit of a fool i know i was hoping to tell rocio personally how much i enjoyed our time together the other day but im leaving town tonight perhaps ill just leave her a note after all becker laid the envelope on the counter the concierge looked down at the envelope and clucked sadly to himself another lovesick heterosexual he thought what a waste he looked up and smiled but of course mr buisan becker said miguel buisan of course ill be sure rocio gets this in the morning thank you becker smiled and turned to go the concierge after discreetly checking out beckers backside scooped up the envelope off the counter and turned to the bank of numbered slots on the wall behind him just as the man slipped the envelope into one of the slots becker spun with one final inquiry where might i call a taxi the concierge turned from the wall of cubbyholes and answered but becker did not hear his response the timing had been perfect the concierges hand was just emerging from a box marked suite becker thanked the concierge and slowly wandered off looking for the elevator in and out he repeated to himself chapter susan returned to node her conversation with strathmore had made her increasingly anxious about davids safety her imagination was running wild so hale spouted from his terminal what did strathmore want a romantic evening alone with his head cryptographer susan ignored the comment and settled in at her terminal she typed her privacy code and the screen came to life the tracer program came into view it still had not returned any information on north dakota damn susan thought whats taking so long you seem uptight hale said innocently having trouble with your diagnostic nothing serious she replied but susan wasnt so sure the tracer was overdue she wondered if maybe shed made a mistake while writing it she began scanning the long lines of limbo programming on her screen searching for anything that could be holding things up hale observed her smugly hey i meant to ask you he ventured what do you make of that unbreakable algorithm ensei tankado said he was writing susans stomach did a flip she looked up unbreakable algorithm she caught herself oh yeah i think i read something about that pretty incredible claim yeah susan replied wondering why hale had suddenly brought it up i dont buy it though everyone knows an unbreakable algorithm is a mathematical impossibility hale smiled oh yeah the bergofsky principle and common sense she snapped who knows hale sighed dramatically there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy i beg your pardon shakespeare hale offered hamlet read a lot while you were in jail hale chuckled seriously susan did you ever think that maybe it is possible that maybe tankado really did write an unbreakable algorithm this conversation was making susan uneasy well we couldnt do it maybe tankados better than we are maybe susan shrugged feigning disinterest we corresponded for a while hale offered casually tankado and me did you know that susan looked up attempting to hide her shock really yeah after i uncovered the skipjack algorithm he wrote mesaid we were brothers in the global fight for digital privacy susan could barely contain her disbelief hale knows tankado personally she did her best to look uninterested hale went on he congratulated me for proving that skipjack had a back doorcalled it a coup for privacy rights of civilians all over the world you gotta admit susan the backdoor in skipjack was an underhanded play reading the worlds email if you ask me strathmore deserved to get caught greg susan snapped fighting her anger that back door was so the nsa could decode email that threatened this nations security oh really hale sighed innocently and snooping the average citizen was just a lucky byproduct we dont snoop average citizens and you know it the fbi can tap telephones but that doesnt mean they listen to every call thats ever made if they had the manpower they would susan ignored the remark governments should have the right to gather information that threatens the common good jesus christhale sighedyou sound like youve been brainwashed by strathmore you know damn well the fbi cant listen in whenever they wanttheyve got to get a warrant a spiked encryption standard would mean the nsa could listen in to anyone anytime anywhere youre rightas we should be able to susans voice was suddenly harsh if you hadnt uncovered the back door in skipjack wed have access to every code we need to break instead of just what transltr can handle if i hadnt found the back door hale argued someone else would have i saved your asses by uncovering it when i did can you imagine the fallout if skipjack had been in circulation when the news broke either way susan shot back now weve got a paranoid eff who think we put back doors in all our algorithms hale asked smugly well dont we susan eyed him coldly hey he said backing off the point is moot now anyway you built transltr youve got your instant information source you can read what you want when you wantno questions asked you win dont you mean we win last i heard you worked for the nsa not for long hale chirped dont make promises im serious someday im getting out of here ill be crushed in that moment susan found herself wanting to curse hale for everything that wasnt going right she wanted to curse him for digital fortress for her troubles with david for the fact that she wasnt in the smokysbut none of it was his fault hales only fault was that he was obnoxious susan needed to be the bigger person it was her responsibility as head cryptographer to keep the peace to educate hale was young and naive susan looked over at him it was frustrating she thought that hale had the talent to be an asset in crypto but he still hadnt grasped the importance of what the nsa did greg susan said her voice quiet and controlled im under a lot of pressure today i just get upset when you talk about the nsa like were some kind of hightech peeping tom this organization was founded for one purposeto protect the security of this nation that may involve shaking a few trees and looking for the bad apples from time to time i think most citizens would gladly sacrifice some privacy to know that the bad guys cant maneuver unchecked hale said nothing sooner or later susan argued the people of this nation need to put their trust somewhere theres a lot of good out therebut theres also a lot of bad mixed in someone has to have access to all of it and separate the right from wrong thats our job thats our duty whether we like it or not there is a frail gate separating democracy from anarchy the nsa guards that gate hale nodded thoughtfully quis custodiet ipsos custodes susan looked puzzled its latin hale said from satires of juvenal it means who will guard the guards i dont get it susan said who will guard the guards yeah if were the guards of society then who will watch us and make sure that were not dangerous susan nodded unsure how to respond hale smiled its how tankado signed all his letters to me it was his favorite saying chapter david becker stood in the hallway outside suite he knew that somewhere behind the ornately carved door was the ring a matter of national security becker could hear movement inside the room faint talking he knocked a deep german accent called out ja becker remained silent ja the door opened a crack and a rotund germanic face gazed down at him becker smiled politely he did not know the mans name deutscher ja he asked german right the man nodded uncertain becker continued in perfect german may i speak to you a moment the man looked uneasy was willst du what do you want becker realized he should have rehearsed this before brazenly knocking on a strangers door he searched for the right words you have something i need these were apparently not the right words the germans eyes narrowed ein ring becker said du hast einen ring you have a ring go away the german growled he started to close the door without thinking becker slid his foot into the crack and jammed the door open he immediately regretted the action the germans eyes went wide was tust du he demanded what are you doing becker knew he was in over his head he glanced nervously up and down the hall hed already been thrown out of the clinic he had no intention of going two for two nimm deinen fu weg the german bellowed remove your foot becker scanned the mans pudgy fingers for a ring nothing im so close he thought ein ring becker repeated as the door slammed shut david becker stood a long moment in the wellfurnished hallway a replica of a salvador dali hung nearby fitting becker groaned surrealism im trapped in an absurd dream hed woken up that morning in his own bed but had somehow ended up in spain breaking into a strangers hotel room on a quest for some magical ring strathmores stern voice pulled him back to reality you must find that ring becker took a deep breath and blocked out the words he wanted to go home he looked back to the door marked his ticket home was just on the other sidea gold ring all he had to do was get it he exhaled purposefully then he strode back to suite and knocked loudly on the door it was time to play hardball the german yanked open the door and was about to protest but becker cut him off he flashed his maryland squash club id and barked polizei then becker pushed his way into the room and threw on the lights wheeling the german squinted in shock was machst silence becker switched to english do you have a prostitute in this room becker peered around the room it was as plush as any hotel room hed ever seen roses champagne a huge canopy bed rocio was nowhere to be seen the bathroom door was closed prostituiert the german glanced uneasily at the closed bathroom door he was larger than becker had imagined his hairy chest began right under his triple chin and sloped outward to his colossal gut the drawstring of his white terrycloth alfonso xiii bathrobe barely reached around his waist becker stared up at the giant with his most intimidating look what is your name a look of panic rippled across the germans corpulent face was willst du what do you want i am with the tourist relations branch of the spanish guardia here in seville do you have a prostitute in this room the german glanced nervously at the bathroom door he hesitated ja he finally admitted do you know this is illegal in spain nein the german lied i did not know ill send her home right now im afraid its too late for that becker said with authority he strolled casually into the room i have a proposition for you ein vorschlag the german gasped a proposition yes i can take you to headquarters right now becker paused dramatically and cracked his knuckles or what the german asked his eyes widening in fear or we make a deal what kind of deal the german had heard stories about the corruption in the spanish guardia civil you have something i want becker said yes of course the german effused forcing a smile he went immediately to the wallet on his dresser how much becker let his jaw drop in mock indignation are you trying to bribe an officer of the law he bellowed no of course not i just thought the obese man quickly set down his wallet i i he was totally flustered he collapsed on the corner of the bed and wrung his hands the bed groaned under his weight im sorry becker pulled a rose from the vase in the center of the room and casually smelled it before letting it fall to the floor he spun suddenly what can you tell me about the murder the german went white mord murder yes the asian man this morning in the park it was an assassinationermordung becker loved the german word for assassination ermordung it was so chilling ermordung he he was yes but but thats impossible the german choked i was there he had a heart attack i saw it no blood no bullets becker shook his head condescendingly things are not always as they seem the german went whiter still becker gave an inward smile the lie had served its purpose the poor german was sweating profusely whwhat do you want he stammered i know nothing becker began pacing the murdered man was wearing a gold ring i need it ii dont have it becker sighed patronizingly and motioned to the bathroom door and rocio dewdrop the man went from white to purple you know dewdrop he wiped the sweat from his fleshy forehead and drenched his terrycloth sleeve he was about to speak when the bathroom door swung open both men looked up rocio eva granada stood in the doorway a vision long flowing red hair perfect iberian skin deepbrown eyes a high smooth forehead she wore a white terrycloth robe that matched the germans the tie was drawn snugly over her wide hips and the neck fell loosely open to reveal her tanned cleavage she stepped into the bedroom the picture of confidence may i help you she asked in throaty english becker gazed across the room at the stunning woman before him and did not blink i need the ring he said coldly who are you she demanded becker switched to spanish with a deadon andalusian accent guardia civil she laughed impossible she replied in spanish becker felt a knot rise in his throat rocio was clearly a little tougher than her client impossible he repeated keeping his cool shall i take you downtown to prove it rocio smirked i will not embarrass you by accepting your offer now who are you becker stuck to his story i am with the seville guardia rocio stepped menacingly toward him i know every police officer on the force they are my best clients becker felt her stare cutting right through him he regrouped i am with a special tourist task force give me the ring or ill have to take you down to the precinct and and what she demanded raising her eyebrows in mock anticipation becker fell silent he was in over his head the plan was backfiring why isnt she buying this rocio came closer i dont know who you are or what you want but if you dont get out of this suite right now i will call hotel security and the real guardia will arrest you for impersonating a police officer becker knew that strathmore could have him out of jail in five minutes but it had been made very clear to him that this matter was supposed to be handled discreetly getting arrested was not part of the plan rocio had stopped a few feet in front of becker and was glaring at him okay becker sighed accentuating the defeat in his voice he let his spanish accent slip i am not with the seville police a us government organization sent me to locate the ring thats all i can reveal ive been authorized to pay you for it there was a long silence rocio let his statement hang in the air a moment before parting her lips in a sly smile now that wasnt so hard was it she sat down on a chair and crossed her legs how much can you pay becker muffled his sigh of relief he wasted no time getting down to business i can pay you pesetas five thousand american dollars it was half what he had on him but probably ten times what the ring was actually worth rocio raised her eyebrows thats a lot of money yes it is do we have a deal rocio shook her head i wish i could say yes a million pesetas becker blurted its all i have my my she smiled you americans dont bargain very well you wouldnt last a day in our markets cash right now becker said reaching for the envelope in his jacket i just want to go home rocio shook her head i cant becker bristled angrily why not i no longer have the ring she said apologetically ive already sold it chapter tokugen numataka stared out his window and paced like a caged animal he had not yet heard from his contact north dakota damn americans no sense of punctuality he would have called north dakota himself but he didnt have a phone number for him numataka hated doing business this waywith someone else in control the thought had crossed numatakas mind from the beginning that the calls from north dakota could be a hoaxa japanese competitor playing him for the fool now the old doubts were coming back numataka decided he needed more information he burst from his office and took a left down numatechs main hallway his employees bowed reverently as he stormed past numataka knew better than to believe they actually loved himbowing was a courtesy japanese employees offered even the most ruthless of bosses numataka went directly to the companys main switchboard all calls were handled by a single operator on a corenco twelveline switchboard terminal the woman was busy but stood and bowed as numataka entered sit down he snapped she obeyed i received a call at four fortyfive on my personal line today can you tell me where it came from numataka kicked himself for not having done this earlier the operator swallowed nervously we dont have caller identification on this machine sir but i can contact the phone company im sure they can help numataka had no doubt the phone company could help in this digital age privacy had become a thing of the past there was a record of everything phone companies could tell you exactly who had called you and how long youd spoken do it he commanded let me know what you find out chapter susan sat alone in node waiting for her tracer hale had decided to step outside and get some aira decision for which she was grateful oddly however the solitude in node provided little asylum susan found herself struggling with the new connection between tankado and hale who will guard the guards she said to herself quis custodiet ipsos custodes the words kept circling in her head susan forced them from her mind her thoughts turned to david hoping he was all right she still found it hard to believe he was in spain the sooner they found the passkeys and ended this the better susan had lost track of how long shed been sitting there waiting for her tracer two hours three she gazed out at the deserted crypto floor and wished her terminal would beep there was only silence the latesummer sun had set overhead the automatic fluorescents had kicked on susan sensed time was running out she looked down at her tracer and frowned come on she grumbled youve had plenty of time she palmed her mouse and clicked her way into her tracers status window how long have you been running anyway susan opened the tracers status windowa digital clock much like the one on transltr it displayed the hours and minutes her tracer had been running susan gazed at the monitor expecting to see a readout of hours and minutes but she saw something else entirely what she saw stopped the blood in her veins tracer aborted tracer aborted she choked aloud why in a sudden panic susan scrolled wildly through the data searching the programming for any commands that might have told the tracer to abort but her search went in vain it appeared her tracer had stopped all by itself susan knew this could mean only one thingher tracer had developed a bug susan considered bugs the most maddening asset of computer programming because computers followed a scrupulously precise order of operations the most minuscule programming errors often had crippling effects simple syntactical errorssuch as a programmer mistakenly inserting a comma instead of a periodcould bring entire systems to their knees susan had always thought the term bug had an amusing origin it came from the worlds first computerthe mark a roomsize maze of electromechanical circuits built in in a lab at harvard university the computer developed a glitch one day and no one was able to locate the cause after hours of searching a lab assistant finally spotted the problem it seemed a moth had landed on one of the computers circuit boards and shorted it out from that moment on computer glitches were referred to as bugs i dont have time for this susan cursed finding a bug in a program was a process that could take days thousands of lines of programming needed to be searched to find a tiny errorit was like inspecting an encyclopedia for a single typo susan knew she had only one choiceto send her tracer again she also knew the tracer was almost guaranteed to hit the same bug and abort all over again debugging the tracer would take time time she and the commander didnt have but as susan stared at her tracer wondering what error shed made she realized something didnt make sense she had used this exact same tracer last month with no problems at all why would it develop a glitch all of a sudden as she puzzled a comment strathmore made earlier echoed in her mind susan i tried to send the tracer myself but the data it returned was nonsensical susan heard the words again the data it returned she cocked her head was it possible the data it returned if strathmore had received data back from the tracer then it obviously was working his data was nonsensical susan assumed because he had entered the wrong search stringsbut nonetheless the tracer was working susan immediately realized that there was one other possible explanation for why her tracer aborted internal programming flaws were not the only reasons programs glitched sometimes there were external forcespower surges dust particles on circuit boards faulty cabling because the hardware in node was so well tuned she hadnt even considered it susan stood and strode quickly across node to a large bookshelf of technical manuals she grabbed a spiral binder marked sysop and thumbed through she found what she was looking for carried the manual back to her terminal and typed a few commands then she waited while the computer raced through a list of commands executed in the past three hours she hoped the search would turn up some sort of external interruptan abort command generated by a faulty power supply or defective chip moments later susans terminal beeped her pulse quickened she held her breath and studied the screen error code susan felt a surge of hope it was good news the fact that the inquiry had found an error code meant her tracer was fine the trace had apparently aborted due to an external anomaly that was unlikely to repeat itself error code susan racked her memory trying to remember what code stood for hardware failures were so rare in node that she couldnt remember the numerical codings susan flipped through the sysop manual scanning the list of error codes corrupt hard partition dc spike media failure when she reached number she stopped and stared a long moment baffled she doublechecked her monitor error code susan frowned and returned to the sysop manual what she saw made no sense the explanation simply read manual abort chapter becker stared in shock at rocio you sold the ring the woman nodded her silky red hair falling around her shoulders becker willed it not to be true pero but she shrugged and said in spanish a girl near the park becker felt his legs go weak this cant be rocio smiled coyly and motioned to the german el queria que lo guardara he wanted to keep it but i told him no ive got gitana blood in me gypsy blood we gitanas in addition to having red hair are very superstitious a ring offered by a dying man is not a good sign did you know the girl becker interrogated rocio arched her eyebrows vaya you really want this ring dont you becker nodded sternly who did you sell it to the enormous german sat bewildered on the bed his romantic evening was being ruined and he apparently had no idea why was passiert he asked nervously whats happening becker ignored him i didnt actually sell it rocio said i tried to but she was just a kid and had no money i ended up giving it to her had i known about your generous offer i would have saved it for you why did you leave the park becker demanded somebody had died why didnt you wait for the police and give them the ring i solicit many things mr becker but trouble is not one of them besides that old man seemed to have things under control the canadian yes he called the ambulance we decided to leave i saw no reason to involve my date or myself with the police becker nodded absently he was still trying to accept this cruel twist of fate she gave the damn thing away i tried to help the dying man rocio explained but he didnt seem to want it he started with the ringkept pushing it in our faces he had these three crippled fingers sticking up he kept pushing his hand at uslike we were supposed to take the ring i didnt want to but my friend here finally did then the guy died and you tried cpr becker guessed no we didnt touch him my friend got scared hes big but hes a wimp she smiled seductively at becker dont worryhe cant speak a word of spanish becker frowned he was wondering again about the bruises on tankados chest did the paramedics give cpr i have no idea as i told you we left before they arrived you mean after you stole the ring becker scowled rocio glared at him we did not steal the ring the man was dying his intentions were clear we gave him his last wish becker softened rocio was right he probably would have done the same damn thing but then you gave the ring to some girl i told you the ring made me nervous the girl had lots of jewelry on i thought she might like it and she didnt think it was strange that youd just give her a ring no i told her i found it in the park i thought she might offer to pay me for it but she didnt i didnt care i just wanted to get rid of it when did you give it to her rocio shrugged this afternoon about an hour after i got it becker checked his watch pm the trail was eight hours old what the hell am i doing here im supposed to be in the smokys he sighed and asked the only question he could think of what did the girl look like era un punki rocio replied becker looked up puzzled un punki si punki a punk yes a punk she said in rough english and then immediately switched back to spanish mucha joyeria lots of jewelry a weird pendant in one ear a skull i think there are punk rockers in seville rocio smiled todo bajo el sol everything under the sun it was the motto of sevilles tourism bureau did she give you her name no did she say where she was going no her spanish was poor she wasnt spanish becker asked no she was english i think she had wild hairred white and blue becker winced at the bizarre image maybe she was american he offered i dont think so rocio said she was wearing a tshirt that looked like the british flag becker nodded dumbly okay red white and blue hair a british flag tshirt a skull pendant in her ear what else nothing just your average punk average punk becker was from a world of collegiate sweatshirts and conservative haircutshe couldnt even picture what the woman was talking about can you think of anything else at all he pressed rocio thought a moment no thats it just then the bed creaked loudly rocios client shifted his weight uncomfortably becker turned to him and spoke influent german noch et was anything else anything to help me find the punk rocker with the ring there was a long silence it was as if the giant man had something he wanted to say but he wasnt sure how to say it his lower lip quivered momentarily there was a pause and then he spoke the four words that came out were definitely english but they were barely intelligible beneath his thick german accent fock off und die becker gaped in shock i beg your pardon fock off und die the man repeated patting his left palm against his fleshy right forearma crude approximation of the italian gesture for fuck you becker was too drained to be offended fuck off and die what happened to das wimp he turned back to rocio and spoke in spanish sounds like ive overstayed my welcome dont worry about him she laughed hes just a little frustrated hell get whats coming to him she tossed her hair and winked is there anything else becker asked anything you can tell me that might help rocio shook her head thats all but youll never find her seville is a big cityit can be very deceptive ill do the best i can its a matter of national security if you have no luck rocio said eyeing the bulging envelope in beckers pocket please stop back my friend will be sleeping no doubt knock quietly ill find us an extra room youll see a side of spain youll never forget she pouted lusciously becker forced a polite smile i should be going he apologized to the german for interrupting his evening the giant smiled timidly keine ursache becker headed out the door no problem whatever happened to fuck off and die chapter manual abort susan stared at her screen mystified she knew she hadnt typed any manual abort commandat least not intentionally she wondered if maybe shed hit the wrong sequence of keys by mistake impossible she muttered according to the headers the abort command had been sent less than twenty minutes ago susan knew the only thing shed typed in the last twenty minutes washer privacy code when shed stepped out to talk to the commander it was absurd to think the privacy code could have been misinterpreted as an abort command knowing it was a waste of time susan pulled up her screenlock log and doublechecked that her privacy code had been entered properly sure enough it had then where she demanded angrily where did it get a manual abort susan scowled and closed the screenlock window unexpectedly however in the split second as the window blipped away something caught her eye she reopened the window and studied the data it made no sense there was a proper locking entry when shed left node but the timing of the subsequent unlock entry seemed strange the two entries were less than one minute apart susan was certain shed been outside with the commander for more than one minute susan scrolled down the page what she saw left her aghast registering three minutes later a second set of lockunlock entries appeared according to the log someone had unlocked her terminal while she was gone not possible she choked the only candidate was greg hale and susan was quite certain shed never given hale her privacy code following good cryptographic procedure susan had chosen her code at random and never written it down hales guessing the correct fivecharacter alphanumeric was out of the questionit was thirtysix to the fifth power over sixty million possibilities but the screenlock entries were as clear as day susan stared at them in wonder hale had somehow been on her terminal while she was gone he had sent her tracer a manual abort command the questions of how quickly gave way to questions of why hale had no motive to break into her terminal he didnt even know susan was running a tracer even if he did know susan thought why would he object to her tracking some guy named north dakota the unanswered questions seemed to be multiplying in her head first things first she said aloud she would deal with hale in a moment focusing on the matter at hand susan reloaded her tracer and hit the enter key her terminal beeped once tracer sent susan knew the tracer would take hours to return she cursed hale wondering how in the world hed gotten her privacy code wondering what interest he had in her tracer susan stood up and strode immediately for hales terminal the screen was black but she could tell it was not lockedthe monitor was glowing faintly around the edges cryptographers seldom locked their terminals except when they left node for the night instead they simply dimmed the brightness on their monitorsa universal honorcode indication that no one should disturb the terminal susan reached for hales terminal screw the honor code she said what the hell are you up to throwing a quick glance out at the deserted crypto floor susan turned up hales brightness controls the monitor came into focus but the screen was entirely empty susan frowned at the blank screen uncertain how to proceed she called up a search engine and typed search for tracer it was a long shot but if there were any references to susans tracer in hales computer this search would find them it might shed some light on why hale had manually aborted her program seconds later the screen refreshed no matches found susan sat a moment unsure what she was even looking for she tried again search for screenlock the monitor refreshed and provided a handful of innocuous referencesno hint that hale had any copies of susans privacy code on his computer susan sighed loudly so what programs has he been using today she went to hales recent applications menu to find the last program he had used it was his email server susan searched his hard drive and eventually found his email folder hidden discreetly inside some other directories she opened the folder and additional folders appeared it seemed hale had numerous email identities and accounts one of them susan noticed with little surprise was an anonymous account she opened the folder clicked one of the old inbound messages and read it she instantly stopped breathing the message read to ndakotaaraanonorg from etdoshishaedu great progress digital fortress is almost done this thing will set the nsa back decades as if in a dream susan read the message over and over then trembling she opened another to ndakotaaraanonorg from etdoshishaedu rotating cleartext works mutation strings are the trick it was unthinkable and yet there it was email from ensei tankado he had been writing to greg hale they were working together susan went numb as the impossible truth stared up at her from the terminal greg hale is ndakota susans eyes locked on the screen her mind searched desperately for some other explanation but there was none it was proofsudden and inescapable tankado had used mutation strings to create a rotating cleartext function and hale had conspired with him to bring down the nsa its susan stammered its not possible as if to disagree hales voice echoed from the past tankado wrote me a few times strathmore took a gamble hiring me im getting out of here someday still susan could not accept what she was seeing true greg hale was obnoxious and arrogantbut he wasnt a traitor he knew what digital fortress would do to the nsa there was no way he was involved in a plot to release it and yet susan realized there was nothing to stop himnothing except honor and decency she thought of the skipjack algorithm greg hale had ruined the nsas plans once before what would prevent him from trying again but tankado susan puzzled why would someone as paranoid as tankado trust someone as unreliable as hale she knew that none of it mattered now all that mattered was getting to strathmore by some ironic stroke of fate tankados partner was right there under their noses she wondered if hale knew yet that ensei tankado was dead she quickly began closing hales email files in order to leave the terminal exactly as she had found it hale could suspect nothingnot yet the digital fortress passkey she realized in amazement was probably hidden somewhere inside that very computer but as susan closed the last of the files a shadow passed outside the node window her gaze shot up and she saw greg hale approaching her adrenaline surged he was almost to the doors damn she cursed eyeing the distance back to her seat she knew shed never make it hale was almost there she wheeled desperately searching node for options the doors behind her clicked then they engaged susan felt instinct takeover digging her shoes into the carpet she accelerated in long reaching strides toward the pantry as the doors hissed open susan slid to a stop in front of the refrigerator and yanked open the door a glass pitcher on top tipped precariously and then rocked to a stop hungry hale asked entering node and walking toward her his voice was calm and flirtatious want to share some tofu susan exhaled and turned to face him no thanks she offered i think ill just but the words got caught in her throat she went white hale eyed her oddly whats wrong susan bit her lip and locked eyes with him nothing she managed but it was a lie across the room hales terminal glowed brightly shed forgotten to dim it chapter downstairs at the alfonso xiii becker wandered tiredly over to the bar a dwarflike bartender lay a napkin in front of him que bebe usted what are you drinking nothing thanks becker replied i need to know if there are any clubs in town for punk rockers the bartender eyed him strangely clubs for punks yeah is there anyplace in town where they all hangout no lo se senor i dont now but certainly not here he smiled how about a drink becker felt like shaking the guy nothing was going quite the way hed planned quiere vd algo the bartender repeated finojerez faint strains of classical music were being piped in overhead brandenburg concertos becker thought number four he and susan had seen the academy of st martin in the fields play the brandenburgs at the university last year he suddenly wished she were with him now the breeze from an overhead airconditioning vent reminded becker what it was like outside he pictured himself walking the sweaty druggedout streets of triana looking for some punk in a british flag tshirt he thought of susan again zumo de arandano he heard himself say cranberry juice the bartender looked baffled solo cranberry juice was a popular drink in spain but drinking it alone was unheard of si becker said solo echo un poco de smirnoff the bartender pressed a splash of vodka no gracias gratis he coaxed on the house through the pounding in his head becker pictured the filthy streets of triana the stifling heat and the long night ahead of him what the hell he nodded si echame un poco de vodka the bartender seemed much relieved and hustled off to make the drink becker glanced around the ornate bar and wondered if he was dreaming anything would make more sense than the truth im a university teacher he thought on a secret mission the bartender returned with a flourish and presented beckers beverage a su gusto senor cranberry with a splash of vodka becker thanked him he took a sip and gagged thats a splash chapter hale stopped halfway to the node pantry and stared at susan whats wrong sue you look terrible susan fought her rising fear ten feet away hales monitor glowed brightly im im okay she managed her heart pounding hale eyed her with a puzzled look on his face you want some water susan could not answer she cursed herself how could i forget to dim his damn monitor susan knew the moment hale suspected her of searching his terminal hed suspect she knew his real identity north dakota she feared hale would do anything to keep that information inside node susan wondered if she should make a dash for the door but she never got the chance suddenly there was a pounding at the glass wall both hale and susan jumped it was chartrukian he was banging his sweaty fists against the glass again he looked like hed seen armageddon hale scowled at the crazed syssec outside the window then turned back to susan ill be right back get yourself a drink you look pale hale turned and went outside susan steadied herself and moved quickly to hales terminal she reached down and adjusted the brightness controls the monitor went black her head was pounding she turned and eyed the conversation now taking place on the crypto floor apparently chartrukian had not gone home after all the young syssec was now in a panic spilling his guts to greg hale susan knew it didnt matterhale knew everything there was to know ive got to get to strathmore she thought and fast chapter room rocio eva granada stood naked in front of the bathroom mirror this was the moment shed been dreading all day the german was on the bed waiting for her he was the biggest man shed ever been with reluctantly she took an ice cube from the water bucket and rubbed it across her nipples they quickly hardened this was her giftto make men feel wanted its what kept them coming back she ran her hands across her supple welltanned body and hoped it would survive another four or five more years until she had enough to retire senor roldan took most of her pay but without him she knew shed be with the rest of the hookers picking up drunks in triana these men at least had money they never beat her and they were easy to satisfy she slipped into her lingerie took a deep breath and opened the bathroom door as rocio stepped into the room the germans eyes bulged she was wearing a black negligee her chestnut skin radiated in the soft light and her nipples stood at attention beneath the lacy fabric komm doch hierher he said eagerly shedding his robe and rolling onto his back rocio forced a smile and approached the bed she gazed down at the enormous german she chuckled in relief the organ between his legs was tiny he grabbed at her and impatiently ripped off her negligee his fat fingers groped at every inch of her body she fell on top of him and moaned and writhed in false ecstasy as he rolled her over and climbed on top of her she thought she would be crushed she gasped and choked against his puttylike neck she prayed he would be quick si si she gasped in between thrusts she dug her fingernails into his backside to encourage him random thoughts cascaded through her mindfaces of the countless men shed satisfied ceilings shed stared at for hours in the dark dreams of having children suddenly without warning the germans body arched stiffened and almost immediately collapsed on top of her thats all she thought surprised and relieved she tried to slide out from under him darling she whispered huskily let me get on top but the man did not move she reached up and pushed at his massive shoulders darling i i cant breathe she began feeling faint she felt her ribs cracking despiertate her fingers instinctively started pulling at his matted hair wake up it was then that she felt the warm sticky liquid it was matted in his hairflowing onto her cheeks into her mouth it was salty she twisted wildly beneath him above her a strange shaft of light illuminated the germans contorted face the bullet hole in his temple was gushing blood all over her she tried to scream but there was no air left in her lungs he was crushing her delirious she clawed toward the shaft of light coming from the doorway she saw a hand a gun with a silencer a flash of light and then nothing chapter outside node chartrukian looked desperate he was trying to convince hale that transltr was in trouble susan raced by them with only one thought in mindto find strathmore the panicked syssec grabbed susans arm as she passed ms fletcher we have a virus im positive you have to susan shook herself free and glared ferociously i thought the commander told you to go home but the runmonitor its registering eighteen commander strathmore told you to go home fuck strathmore chartrukian screamed the words resounding throughout the dome a deep voice boomed from above mr chartrukian the three crypto employees froze high above them strathmore stood at the railing outside his office for a moment the only sound inside the dome was the uneven hum of the generators below susan tried desperately to catch strathmores eye commander hale is north dakota but strathmore was fixated on the young syssec he descended the stairs without so much as a blink keeping his eyes trained on chartrukian the whole way down he made his way across the crypto floor and stopped six inches in front of the trembling technician what did you say sir chartrukian choked transltrs in trouble commander susan interjected if i could strathmore waved her off his eyes never left the syssec phil blurted we have an infected file sir im sure of it strathmores complexion turned a deep red mr chartrukian weve been through this there is no file infecting transltr yes there is he cried and if it makes its way to the main databank where the hell is this infected file strathmore bellowed show it to me chartrukian hesitated i cant of course you cant it doesnt exist susan said commander i must again strathmore silenced her with an angry wave susan eyed hale nervously he seemed smug and detached it makes perfect sense she thought hale wouldnt be worried about a virus he knows whats really going on inside transltr chartrukian was insistent the infected file exists sir but gauntlet never picked it up if gauntlet never picked it up strathmore fumed then how the hell do you know it exists chartrukian suddenly sounded more confident mutation strings sir i ran a full analysis and the probe turned up mutation strings susan now understood why the syssec was so concerned mutation strings she mused she knew mutation strings were programming sequences that corrupted data in extremely complex ways they were very common in computer viruses particularly viruses that altered large blocks of data of course susan also knew from tankados email that the mutation strings chartrukian had seen were harmlesssimply part of digital fortress the syssec went on when i first saw the strings sir i thought gauntlets filters had failed but then i ran some tests and found out he paused looking suddenly uneasy i found out that somebody manually bypassed gauntlet the statement met with a sudden hush strathmores face turned an even deeper shade of crimson there was no doubt whom chartrukian was accusing strathmores terminal was the only one in crypto with clearance to bypass gauntlets filters when strathmore spoke his voice was like ice mr chartrukian not that it is any concern of yours but i bypassed gauntlet he went on his temper hovering near the boiling point as i told you earlier im running a very advanced diagnostic the mutation strings you see in transltr are part of that diagnostic they are there because i put them there gauntlet refused to let me load the file so i bypassed its filters strathmores eyes narrowed sharply at chartrukian now will there be anything else before you go in a flash it all clicked for susan when strathmore had downloaded the encrypted digital fortress algorithm from the internet and tried to run it through transltr the mutation strings had tripped gauntlets filters desperate to know whether digital fortress was breakable strathmore decided to bypass the filters normally bypassing gauntlet was unthinkable in this situation however there was no danger in sending digital fortress directly into transltr the commander knew exactly what the file was and where it came from with all due respect sir chartrukian pressed ive never heard of a diagnostic that employs mutation commander susan interjected not able to wait another moment i really need to this time her words were cut short by the sharp ring of strathmores cellular phone the commander snatched up the receiver what is it he barked then he fell silent and listened to the caller susan forgot about hale for an instant she prayed the caller was david tell me hes okay she thought tell me he found the ring but strathmore caught her eye and he gave her a frown it was not david susan felt her breath grow short all she wanted to know was that the man she loved was safe strathmore susan knew was impatient for other reasons if david took much longer the commander would have to send backupnsa field agents it was a gamble he had hoped to avoid commander chartrukian urged i really think we should check hold on strathmore said apologizing to his caller he covered his mouthpiece and leveled a fiery stare at his young syssec mr chartrukian he growled this discussion is over you are to leave crypto now thats an order chartrukian stood stunned but sir mutation str now strathmore bellowed chartrukian stared a moment speechless then he stormed off toward the syssec lab strathmore turned and eyed hale with a puzzled look susan understood the commanders mystification hale had been quiettoo quiet hale knew very well there was no such thing as a diagnostic that used mutation strings much less one that could keep transltr busy eighteen hours and yet hale hadnt said a word he appeared indifferent to the entire commotion strathmore was obviously wondering why susan had the answer commander she said insistently if i could just speak in a minute he interjected still eyeing hale quizzically i need to take this call with that strathmore turned on his heel and headed for his office susan opened her mouth but the words stalled on the tip of her tongue hale is north dakota she stood rigid unable to breathe she felt hale staring at her susan turned hale stepped aside and swung his arm graciously toward the node door after you sue chapter in a linen closet on the third floor of the alfonso xiii a maid lay unconscious on the floor the man with wirerim glasses was replacing a hotel master key in her pocket he had not sensed her scream when he struck her but he had no way of knowing for surehe had been deaf since he was twelve he reached to the battery pack on his belt with a certain kind of reverence a gift from a client the machine had given him new life he could now receive his contracts anywhere in the world all communications arrived instantaneously and untraceably he was eager as he touched the switch his glasses flickered to life once again his fingers carved into the empty air and began clicking together as always he had recorded the names of his victimsa simple matter of searching a wallet or purse the contacts on his fingers connected and the letters appeared in the lens of his glasses like ghosts in the air subject rocio eva granadaterminated subject hans huberterminated three stories below david becker paid his tab and wandered across the lobby his halffinished drink in hand he headed toward the hotels open terrace for some fresh air in and out he mused things hadnt panned out quite as he expected he had a decision to make should he just give up and go back to the airport a matter of national security he swore under his breath so why the hell had they sent a schoolteacher becker moved out of sight of the bartender and dumped the remaining drink in a potted jasmine the vodka had made him lightheaded cheapest drunk in history susan often called him after refilling the heavy crystal glass from a water fountain becker took a long swallow he stretched a few times trying to shake off the light haze that had settled over him then he set down his glass and walked across the lobby as he passed the elevator the doors slid opened there was a man inside all becker saw were thick wirerim glasses the man raised a handkerchief to blow his nose becker smiled politely and moved on out into the stifling sevillian night chapter inside node susan caught herself pacing frantically she wished shed exposed hale when shed had the chance hale sat at his terminal stress is a killer sue something you want to get off your chest susan forced herself to sit she had thought strathmore would be off the phone by now and return to speak to her but he was nowhere to be seen susan tried to keep calm she gazed at her computer screen the tracer was still runningfor the second time it was immaterial now susan knew whose address it would return ghalecryptonsagov susan gazed up toward strathmores workstation and knew she couldnt wait any longer it was time to interrupt the commanders phone call she stood and headed for the door hale seemed suddenly uneasy apparently noticing susans odd behavior he strode quickly across the room and beat her to the door he folded his arms and blocked her exit tell me whats going on he demanded theres something going on here today what is it let me out susan said as evenly as possible feeling a sudden twinge of danger come on hale pressed strathmore practically fired chartrukian for doing his job whats going on inside transltr we dont have any diagnostics that run eighteen hours thats bullshit and you know it tell me whats going on susans eyes narrowed you know damn well whats going on back off greg she demanded i need to use the bathroom hale smirked he waited a long moment and then stepped aside sorry sue just flirting susan pushed by him and left node as she passed the glass wall she sensed hales eyes boring into her from the other side reluctantly she circled toward the bathrooms she would have to make a detour before visiting the commander greg hale could suspect nothing chapter

race the fact that he worked side by side with the single most powerful man in american intelligence was little consolation brinkerhoff had graduated with honors from andover and williams and yet here he was middleaged with no real powerno real stake he spent his days arranging someone elses calendar there were definite benefits to being the directors personal aidebrinkerhoff had a plush office in the directorial suite full access to all the nsa departments and a certain level of distinction that came from the company he kept he ran errands for the highest echelons of power deep down brinkerhoff knew he was born to be a pasmart enough to take notes handsome enough to give press conferences and lazy enough to be content with it the stickysweet chime of his mantel clock accented the end of another day of his pathetic existence shit he thought five oclock on a saturday what the hell am i doing here chad a woman appeared in his doorway brinkerhoff looked up it was midge milken fontaines internal security analyst she was sixty slightly heavy and much to the puzzlement of brinkerhoff quite appealing a consummate flirt and an exwife three times over midge prowled the sixroom directorial suite with a saucy authority she was sharp intuitive worked ungodly hours and was rumored to know more about the nsas inner workings than god himself damn brinkerhoff thought eyeing her in her gray cashmeredress either im getting older or shes looking younger weekly reports she smiled waving a fanfold of paper you need to check the figures brinkerhoff eyed her body figures look good from here really chad she laughed im old enough to be your mother dont remind me he thought midge strode in and sidled up to his desk im on my way out but the director wants these compiled by the time he gets back from south america thats monday bright and early she dropped the printouts in front of him what am i an accountant no hon youre a cruise director thought you knew that so what am i doing crunching numbers she ruffled his hair you wanted more responsibility here it is he looked up at her sadly midge i have no life she tapped her finger on the paper this is your life chad brinkerhoff she looked down at him and softened anything i can get you before i go he eyed her pleadingly and rolled his aching neck my shoulders are tight midge didnt bite take an aspirin he pouted no back rub she shook her head cosmopolitan says twothirds of backrubs end in sex brinkerhoff looked indignant ours never do precisely she winked thats the problem midge night chad she headed for the door youre leaving you know id stay midge said pausing in the doorway but i do have some pride i just cant see playing second fiddleparticularly to a teenager my wifes not a teenager brinkerhoff defended she just acts like one midge gave him a surprised look i wasnt talking about your wife she battered her eyes innocently i was talking about carmen she spoke the name with a thick puerto rican accent brinkerhoffs voice cracked slightly who carmen in food services brinkerhoff felt himself flush carmen huerta was a twentysevenyearold pastry chef who worked in the nsa commissary brinkerhoff had enjoyed a number of presumably secret afterhours flings with her in the stockroom she gave him a wicked wink remember chad big brother knows all big brother brinkerhoff gulped in disbelief big brother watches the stockrooms too big brother or brother as midge often called it was a centrex that sat in a small closetlike space off the suites central room brother was midges whole world it received data from closed circuit video cameras electronic doors phones taps and freestanding bugs in the nsa complex the directors of the nsa had learned the hard way that employees were not only a great asset but a great liability every major security breach in the nsas history had come from within it was midges job as internal security analyst to watch everything that went on within the walls of the nsa including apparently the commissary stockroom brinkerhoff stood to defend himself but midge was already on her way out hands above the desk she called over her shoulder no funny stuff after i go the walls have eyes brinkerhoff sat and listened to the sound of her heels fading down the corridor at least he knew midge would never tell she was not without her weaknesses midge had indulged in a few indiscretions of her ownmostly wandering back rubs with brinkerhoff his thoughts turned back to carmen he pictured her lissome body those dark thighs that am radio she played full blasthot san juan salsa he smiled maybe ill drop by for a snack when im done he opened the first printout cryptoproductionexpenditure his mood immediately lightened midge had given him a freebie the crypto report was always a piece of cake technically he was supposed to compile the whole thing but the only figure the director ever asked for was the mcdthe mean cost per decryption the mcd represented the estimated amount it cost transltr to break a single code as long as the figure was below per code fontaine didnt flinch a grand a pop brinkerhoff chuckled our tax dollars at work as he began plowing through the document and checking the daily mcds images of carmen huerta smearing herself with honey and confectioners sugar began playing in his head thirty seconds later he was almost done the crypto data was perfectas always but just before moving on to the next report something caught his eye at the bottom of the sheet the last mcd was off the figure was so large that it had carried over into the next column and made a mess of the page brinkerhoff stared at the figure in shock he gasped a billion dollars the images of carmen vanished a billiondollar code brinkerhoff sat there a minute paralyzed then in a burst of panic he raced out into the hallway midge comeback chapter phil chartrukian stood fuming in the syssec lab strathmores words echoed in his head leave now thats an order he kicked the trash can and swore in the empty lab diagnostic my ass since when does the deputy director bypass gauntlets filters the syssecs were well paid to protect the computer systems at the nsa and chartrukian had learned that there were only two job requirements be utterly brilliant and exhaustively paranoid hell he cursed this isnt paranoia the fucking runmonitors reading eighteen hours it was a virus chartrukian could feel it there was little doubt in his mind what was going on strathmore had made a mistake by bypassing gauntlets filters and now he was trying to cover it up with some halfbaked story about a diagnostic chartrukian wouldnt have been quite so edgy had transltr been the only concern but it wasnt despite its appearance the great decoding beast was by no means an island although the cryptographers believed gauntlet was constructed for the sole purpose of protecting their codebreaking masterpiece the syssecs understood the truth the gauntlet filters served a much higher god the nsas main databank the history behind the databanks construction had always fascinated chartrukian despite the efforts of the department of defense to keep the internet to themselves in the late s it was too useful a tool not to attract the publicsector eventually universities pried their way on shortly after that came the commercial servers the floodgates opened and the public poured in by the early s the governments oncesecure internet was a congested wasteland of public email and cyberporn following a number of unpublicized yet highly damaging computer infiltrations at the office of naval intelligence it became increasingly clear that government secrets were no longer safe on computers connected to the burgeoning internet the president in conjunction with the department of defense passed a classified decree that would fund a new totally secure government network to replace the tainted internet and function as a link between us intelligence agencies to prevent further computer pilfering of government secrets all sensitive data was relocated to one highly secure locationthe newly constructed nsa databankthe fort knox of us intelligence data literally millions of the countrys most classified photos tapes documents and videos were digitized and transferred to the immense storage facility and then the hard copies were destroyed the databank was protected by a triplelayer power relay and a tiered digital backup system it was also feet underground to shield it from magnetic fields and possible explosions activities within the control room were designated top secret umbra the countrys highest level of security the secrets of the country had never been safer this impregnable databank now housed blueprints for advanced weaponry witness protection lists aliases of field agents detailed analyses and proposals for covert operations the list was endless there would be no more blackbag jobs damaging us intelligence of course the officers of the nsa realized that stored data had value only if it was accessible the real coup of the databank was not getting the classified data off the streets it was making it accessible only to the correct people all stored information had a security rating and depending on the level of secrecy was accessible to government officials on a compartmentalized basis a submarine commander could dial in and check the nsas most recent satellite photos of russian ports but he would not have access to the plans for an antidrug mission in south america cia analysts could access histories of known assassins but could not access launch codes reserved for the president syssecs of course had no clearance for the information in the databank but they were responsible for its safety like all large databanksfrom insurance companies to universitiesthe nsa facility was constantly under attack by computer hackers trying to sneak a peek at the secrets waiting inside but the nsa security programmers were the best in the world no one had ever come close to infiltrating the nsa databankand the nsa had no reason to think anybody ever would inside the syssec lab chartrukian broke into a sweat trying to decide whether to leave trouble in transltr meant trouble in the databank too strathmores lack of concern was bewildering everyone knew that transltr and the nsa main databank were inextricably linked each new code once broken was fired from crypto through yards of fiberoptic cable to the nsa databank for safe keeping the sacred storage facility had limited points of entryand transltr was one of them gauntlet was supposed to be the impregnable threshold guardian and strathmore had bypassed it chartrukian could hear his own heart pounding transltrs been stuck eighteen hours the thought of a computer virus entering transltr and then running wild in the basement of the nsa proved too much ive got to report this he blurted aloud in a situation like this chartrukian knew there was only one person to call the nsas senior syssec officer the shortfused pound computer guru who had built gauntlet his nickname was jabba he was a demigod at the nsaroaming the halls putting out virtual fires and cursing the feeblemindedness of the inept and the ignorant chartrukian knew that as soon as jabba heard strathmore had bypassed gauntlets filters all hell would break loose too bad he thought ive got a job to do he grabbed the phone and dialed jabbas twentyfourhour cellular chapter david becker wandered aimlessly down avenida del cid and tried to collect his thoughts muted shadows played on the cobblestones beneath his feet the vodka was still with him nothing about his life seemed in focus at the moment his mind drifted back to susan wondering if shed gotten his phone message yet up ahead a seville transit bus screeched to a halt in front of a bus stop becker looked up the buss doors cranked open but no one disembarked the diesel engine roared back to life but just as the bus was pulling out three teenagers appeared out of a bar up the street and ran after it yelling and waving the engines wound down again and the kids hurried to catch up thirty yards behind them becker stared in utter incredulity his vision was suddenly focused but he knew what he was seeing was impossible it was a oneinamillion chance im hallucinating but as the bus doors opened the kids crowded around to board becker saw it again this time he was certain clearly illuminated in the haze of the corner streetlight hed seen her the passengers climbed on and the buss engines revved up again becker suddenly found himself at a full sprint the bizarre image fixed in his mindblack lipstick wild eye shadow and that hair spiked straight up in three distinctive spires red white and blue as the bus started to move becker dashed up the street into awake of carbon monoxide espera he called running behind the bus beckers cordovan loafers skimmed the pavement his usual squash agility was not with him though he felt off balance his brain was having trouble keeping track of his feet he cursed the bartender and his jet lag the bus was one of sevilles older diesels and fortunately for becker first gear was a long arduous climb becker felt the gap closing he knew he had to reach the bus before it downshifted the twin tailpipes choked out a cloud of thick smoke as the driver prepared to drop the bus into second gear becker strained for more speed as he surged even with the rear bumper becker moved right racing up beside the bus he could see the rear doorsand as on all seville buses it was propped wide open cheap airconditioning becker fixed his sights on the opening and ignored the burning sensation in his legs the tires were beside him shoulder high humming at a higher and higher pitch every second he surged toward the door missing the handle and almost losing his balance he pushed harder underneath the bus the clutch clicked as the driver prepared to change gears hes shifting i wont make it but as the engine cogs disengaged to align the larger gears the bus let up ever so slightly becker lunged the engine reengaged just as his fingertips curled around the door handle beckers shoulder almost ripped from its socket as the engine dug in catapulting him up onto the landing david becker lay collapsed just inside the vehicles doorway the pavement raced by only inches away he was now sober his legs and shoulder ached wavering he stood steadied himself and climbed into the darkened bus in the crowd of silhouettes only a few seats away were the three distinctive spikes of hair red white and blue i made it beckers mind filled with images of the ring the waiting learjet and at the end of it all susan as becker came even with the girls seat wondering what to say to her the bus passed beneath a streetlight the punks face was momentarily illuminated becker stared in horror the makeup on her face was smeared across a thick stubble she was not a girl at all but a young man he wore a silver stud in his upper lip a black leather jacket and no shirt what the fuck do you want the hoarse voice asked his accent was new york with the disorientated nausea of a slowmotion free fall becker gazed at the busload of passengers staring back at him they were all punks at least half of them had red white and blue hair sientate the driver yelled becker was too dazed to hear sientate the driver screamed sit down becker turned vaguely to the angry face in the rearview mirror but he had waited too long annoyed the driver slammed down hard on the brakes becker felt his weight shift he reached for a seat back but missed for an instant david becker was airborne then he landed hard on the gritty floor on avenida del cid a figure stepped from the shadows he adjusted his wirerim glasses and peered after the departing bus david becker had escaped but it would not be for long of all the buses in seville mr becker had just boarded the infamous number bus had only one destination chapter phil chartrukian slammed down his receiver jabbas line was busy jabba spurned callwaiting as an intrusive gimmick that was introduced by at t to increase profits by connecting every call the simple phrase im on the other line ill call you back made phone companies millions annually jabbas refusal of callwaiting was his own brand of silent objection to the nsas requirement that he carry an emergency cellular at all times chartrukian turned and looked out at the deserted crypto floor the hum of the generators below sounded louder every minute he sensed that time was running out he knew he was supposed to leave but from out of the rumble beneath crypto the syssec mantra began playing in his head act first explain later in the highstakes world of computer security minutes often meant the difference between saving a system or losing it there was seldom time to justify a defensive procedure before taking it syssecs were paid for their technical expertise and their instinct act first explain later chartrukian knew what he had to do he also knew that when the dust settled he would be either an nsa hero or in the unemployment line the great decoding computer had a virusof that the syssec was certain there was one responsible course of action shut it down chartrukian knew there were only two ways to shut down transltr one was the commanders private terminal which was locked in his officeout of the question the other was the manual killswitch located on one of the sublevels beneath the crypto floor chartrukian swallowed hard he hated the sublevels hed only been there once during training it was like something out of an alien world with its long mazes of catwalks freon ducts and a dizzy foot drop to the rumbling power supplies below it was the last place he felt like going and strathmore was the last person he felt like crossing but duty was duty theyll thank me tomorrow he thought wondering if he was right taking a deep breath chartrukian opened the senior syssecs metal locker on a shelf of disassembled computer parts hidden behind a media concentrator and lan tester was a stanford alumni mug without touching the rim he reached inside and lifted out a single medeco key its amazing he grumbled what systemsecurity officers dont know about security chapter a billiondollar code midge snickered accompanying brinkerhoff back up the hallway thats a good one i swear it he said she eyed him askance this better not be some ploy to get me out of this dress midge i would never he said selfrighteously i know chad dont remind me thirty seconds later midge was sitting in brinkerhoffs chair and studying the crypto report see he said leaning over her and pointing to the figure in question this mcd a billion dollars midge chuckled it does appear to be a touch on the high side doesnt it yeah he groaned just a touch looks like a dividebyzero a who a dividebyzero she said scanning the rest of the data the mcds calculated as a fractiontotal expense divided by number of decryptions of course brinkerhoff nodded blankly and tried not to peer down the front of her dress when the denominators zero midge explained the quotient goes to infinity computers hate infinity so they type all nines she pointed to a different column see this yeah brinkerhoff refocused on the paper its todays raw production data take a look at the number of decryptions brinkerhoff dutifully followed her finger down the column number of decryptions midge tapped on the figure its just as i suspected dividebyzero brinkerhoff arched his eyebrows so everythings okay she shrugged just means we havent broken any codes today transltr must be taking a break a break brinkerhoff looked doubtful hed been with the director long enough to know that breaks were not part of his preferred modus operandiparticularly with respect to transltr fontaine had paid billion for the codebreaking behemoth and he wanted his moneys worth every second transltr sat idle was money down the toilet ah midge brinkerhoff said transltr doesnt take any breaks it runs day and night you know that she shrugged maybe strathmore didnt feel like hanging out last night to prepare the weekend run he probably knew fontaine was away and ducked out early to go fishing come on midge brinkerhoff gave her disgusted look give the guy a break it was no secret midge milken didnt like trevor strathmore strathmore had attempted a cunning maneuver rewriting skipjack but hed been caught despite strathmores bold intentions the nsa had paid dearly the eff had gained strength fontaine had lost credibility with congress and worst of all the agency had lost a lot of its anonymity there were suddenly housewives in minnesota complaining to america online and prodigy that the nsa might be reading their emaillike the nsa gave a damn about a secret recipe for candied yams strathmores blunder had cost the nsa and midge felt responsiblenot that she could have anticipated the commanders stunt but the bottom line was that an unauthorized action had taken place behind director fontaines back a back midge was paid to cover fontaines handsoff attitude made him susceptible and it made midge nervous but the director had learned long ago to stand back and let smart people do their jobs thats exactly how he handled trevor strathmore midge you know damn well strathmores not slacking brinkerhoff argued he runs transltr like a fiend midge nodded deep down she knew that accusing strathmore of shirking was absurd the commander was as dedicated as they camededicated to a fault he bore the evils of the world as his own personal cross the nsas skipjack plan had been strathmores brainchilda bold attempt to change the world unfortunately like so many divine quests this crusade ended in crucifixion okay she admitted so im being a little harsh a little brinkerhoff eyes narrowed strathmores got a backlog of files a mile long hes not about to let transltr sit idle for a whole weekend okay okay midge sighed my mistake she furrowed her brow and puzzled why transltr hadnt broken any codes all day let me doublecheck something she said and began flipping through the report she located what she was looking for and scanned the figures after a moment she nodded youre right chad transltrs been running full force raw consumables are even a little on the high side were at over half a million kilowatthours since midnight last night so where does that leave us midge was puzzled im not sure its odd you want to rerun the data she gave him a disapproving stare there were two things one never questioned about midge milken one of them was her data brinkerhoff waited while midge studied the figures huh she finally grunted yesterdays stats look fine codes broken mcd average time per code a little over six minutes raw consumables average last code entering transltr she stopped what is it thats funny she said last file on yesterdays queue log ran at pm so so transltr breaks codes every six minutes or so the last file of the day usually runs closer to midnight it sure doesnt look like midge suddenly stopped short and gasped brinkerhoff jumped what midge was staring at the readout in disbelief this file the one that entered transltr last night yeah it hasnt broken yet its queue time was but it lists no decrypt time midge fumbled with the sheets yesterday or today brinkerhoff shrugged maybe those guys are running a tough diagnostic midge shook her head eighteen hours tough she paused not likely besides the queue data says its an outside file we should call strathmore at home brinkerhoff swallowed on a saturday night no midge said if i know strathmore hes on top of this ill bet good money hes here just a hunch midges hunches were the other thing one never questioned come on she said standing up lets see if im right brinkerhoff followed midge to her office where she sat down and began to work big brothers keypads like a virtuoso pipe organist brinkerhoff gazed up at the array of closedcaption video monitors on her wall their screens all freeze frames of the nsa seal youre gonna snoop crypto he asked nervously nope midge replied wish i could but cryptos a sealed deal its got no video no sound no nothing strathmores orders all ive got is approach stats and basic transltr stuff were lucky weve even got that strathmore wanted total isolation but fontaine insisted on the basics brinkerhoff looked puzzled crypto hasnt got video why she asked without turning from her monitor you and carmen looking for a little more privacy brinkerhoff grumbled something inaudible midge typed some more keys im pulling strathmores elevator log she studied her monitor a moment and then rapped her knuckle on the desk hes here she said matteroffactly hes in crypto right now look at this talk about long hourshe went in yesterday morning bright and early and his elevator hasnt budged since im showing no magnocard use for him on the main door so hes definitely in there brinkerhoff breathed a slight sigh of relief so if strathmores in there everythings okay right midge thought a moment maybe she finally decided maybe we should call him and doublecheck brinkerhoff groaned midge hes the deputy director im sure he has everything under control lets not secondguess oh come on chaddont be such a child were just doing our job weve got a snag in the stats and were following up besides she added id like to remind strathmore that big brothers watching make him think twice before planning any more of his harebrained stunts to save the world midge picked up the phone and began dialing brinkerhoff looked uneasy you really think you should bother him im not bothering him midge said tossing him the receiver you are chapter what midge sputtered in disbelief strathmore claims our data is wrong brinkerhoff nodded and hung up the phone strathmore denied that transltrs been stuck on one file for eighteen hours he was quite pleasant about the whole thing brinkerhoff beamed pleased with himself for surviving the phone call he assured me transltr was working fine said it was breaking codes every six minutes even as we speak thanked me for checking up on him hes lying midge snapped ive been running these crypto stats for two years the data is never wrong first time for everything he said casually she shot him a disapproving look i run all data twice well you know what they say about computers when they screw up at least theyre consistent about it midge spun and faced him this isnt funny chad the ddo just told a blatant lie to the directors office i want to know why brinkerhoff suddenly wished he hadnt called her back in strathmores phone call had set her off ever since skipjack whenever midge had a sense that something suspicious was going on she made an eerie transition from flirt to fiend there was no stopping her until she sorted it out midge it is possible our data is off brinkerhoff said firmly i mean think about ita file that ties up transltr for eighteen hours its unheard of go home its late she gave him a haughty look and tossed the report on the counter i trust the data instinct says its right brinkerhoff frowned not even the director questioned midge milkens instincts anymoreshe had an uncanny habit of always being right somethings up she declared and i intend to find out what it is chapter becker dragged himself off the floor of the bus and collapsed in an empty seat nice move dipshit the kid with the three spikes sneered becker squinted in the stark lighting it was the kid hed chased onto the bus he glumly surveyed the sea of red white and blue coiffures whats with the hair becker moaned motioning to the others its all red white and blue the kid offered becker nodded trying not to stare at the infected perforation in the kids upper lip judas taboo the kid said matteroffactly becker looked bewildered the punk spit in the aisle obviously disgusted with beckers ignorance judas taboo greatest punk since sid vicious blew his head off here a year ago today its his anniversary becker nodded vaguely obviously missing the connection taboo did his hair this way the day he signed off the kid spit again every fan worth his weight in piss has got red white and blue hair today for a long moment becker said nothing slowly as if he had been shot with a tranquilizer he turned and faced front becker surveyed the group on the bus every last one was a punk most were staring at him every fan has red white and blue hair today becker reached up and pulled the driveralert cord on the wall it was time to get off he pulled again nothing happened he pulled a third time more frantically nothing they disconnect em on bus the kid spat again so we dont fuck with em becker turned you mean i cant get off the kid laughed not till the end of the line five minutes later the bus was barreling along an unlit spanish country road becker turned to the kid behind him is this thing ever going to stop the kid nodded few more miles where are we going he broke into a sudden wide grin you mean you dont know becker shrugged the kid started laughing hysterically oh shit youre gonna love it chapter only yards from transltrs hull phil chartrukian stood over a patch of white lettering on the crypto floor crypto sublevels authorized personnel only he knew he was definitely not authorized personnel he shot a quick glance up at strathmores office the curtains were still pulled chartrukian had seen susan fletcher go into the bathrooms so he knew she wasnt a problem the only other question was hale he glanced toward node wondering if the cryptographer were watching fuck it he grumbled below his feet the outline of a recessed trapdoor was barely visible in the floor chartrukian palmed the key hed just taken from the syssec lab he knelt down inserted the key in the floor and turned the bolt beneath clicked then he unscrewed the large external butterfly latch and freed the door checking once again over his shoulder he squatted down and pulled the panel was small only three feet by three feet but it was heavy when it finally opened the syssec stumbled back a blast of hot air hit him in the face it carried with it the sharp bite of freon gas billows of steam swirled out of the opening illuminated by the red utility lighting below the distant hum of the generators became a rumble chartrukian stood up and peered into the opening it looked more like the gateway to hell than a service entrance for a computer a narrow ladder led to a platform under the floor beyond that there were stairs but all he could see was swirling red mist greg hale stood behind the oneway glass of node he watched as phil chartrukian eased himself down the ladder toward the sublevels from where hale was standing the syssecs head appeared to have been severed from his body and left out on the crypto floor then slowly it sank into the swirling mist gutsy move hale muttered he knew where chartrukian was headed an emergency manual abort of transltr was a logical action if he thought the computer had a virus unfortunately it was also a sure way to have crypto crawling with syssecs in about ten minutes emergency actions raised alert flags at the main switchboard a syssec investigation of crypto was something hale could not afford hale left node and headed for the trapdoor chartrukian had to be stopped chapter jabba resembled a giant tadpole like the cinematic creature for whom he was nicknamed the man was a hairless spheroid as resident guardian angel of all nsa computer systems jabba marched from department to department tweaking soldering and reaffirming his credo that prevention was the best medicine no nsa computer had ever been infected under jabbas reign he intended to keep it that way jabbas home base was a raised workstation overlooking the nsas underground ultrasecret databank it was there that a virus would do the most damage and there that he spent the majority of his time at the moment however jabba was taking a break and enjoying pepperoni calzones in the nsas allnight commissary he was about to dig into his third when his cellular phone rang go he said coughing as he swallowed a mouthful jabba a womans voice cooed its midge data queen the huge man gushed hed always had a soft spot for midge milken she was sharp and she was also the only woman jabba had ever met who flirted with him how the hell are you no complaints jabba wiped his mouth you on site yup care to join me for a calzone love to jabba but im watching these hips really he snickered mind if i join you youre bad you have no idea glad i caught you in she said i need some advice he took a long swallow of dr pepper shoot it might be nothing midge said but my crypto stats turned up something odd i was hoping you could shed some light what ya got he took another sip ive got a report saying transltrs been running the same file for eighteen hours and hasnt cracked it jabba sprayed dr pepper all over his calzone you what any ideas he dabbed at his calzone with a napkin what report is this production report basic cost analysis stuff midge quickly explained what she and brinkerhoff had found have you called strathmore yes he said everythings fine in crypto said transltrs running full speed ahead said our datas wrong jabba furrowed his bulbous forehead so whats the problem your report glitched midge did not respond jabba caught her drift he frowned you dont think your report glitched correct so you think strathmores lying its not that midge said diplomatically knowing she was on fragile ground its just that my stats have never been wrong in the past i thought id get a second opinion well jabba said i hate to be the one to break it to you but your datas fried you think so id bet my job on it jabba took a big bite of soggy calzone and spoke with his mouth full longest a file has ever lasted inside transltr is three hours that includes diagnostics boundary probes everything only thing that could lock it down for eighteen hours would have to be viral nothing else could do it viral yeah some kind of redundant cycle something that got into the processors created a loop and basically gummed up the works well she ventured strathmores been in crypto for about thirtysix hours straight any chance hes fighting a virus jabba laughed strathmores been in there for thirtysix hours poor bastard his wife probably said he cant come home i hear shes bagging his ass midge thought a moment shed heard that too she wondered if maybe she was being paranoid midge jabba wheezed and took another long drink if strathmores toy had a virus he would have called me strathmores sharp but he doesnt know shit about viruses transltrs all hes got first sign of trouble he would have pressed the panic buttonand around here that means me jabba sucked in a long strand of mozzarella besides theres no way in hell transltr has a virus gauntlets the best set of package filters ive ever written nothing gets through after a long silence midge sighed any other thoughts yup your datas fried you already said that exactly she frowned you havent caught wind of anything anything at all jabba laughed harshly midge listen up skipjack sucked strathmore blew it but move onits over there was a long silence on the line and jabba realized hed gone too far sorry midge i know you took heat over that whole mess strathmore was wrong i know how you feel about him this has nothing to do with skipjack she said firmly yeah sure jabba thought listen midge i dont have feelings for strathmore one way or another i mean the guys a cryptographer theyre basically all selfcentered assholes they need their data yesterday every damn file is the one that could save the world so what are you saying jabba sighed im saying strathmores a psycho like the rest of them but im also saying he loves transltr more than his own goddamn wife if there were a problem he would have called me midge was quiet a long time finally she let out a reluctant sigh so youre saying my datas fried jabba chuckled is there an echo in here she laughed look midge drop me a work order ill be up on monday to doublecheck your machine in the meantime get the hell out of here its saturday night go get yourself laid or something she sighed im trying jabba believe me im trying chapter club embrujowarlock in englishwas situated in the suburbs at the end of the number bus line looking more like a fortification than a dance club it was surrounded on all sides by high stucco walls into which were embedded shards of shattered beer bottlesa crude security system preventing anyone from entering illegally without leaving behind a good portion of flesh during the ride becker had resolved himself to the fact that hed failed it was time to call strathmore with the bad newsthe search was hopeless he had done the best he could now it was time to go home but now gazing out at the mob of patrons pushing their way through the clubs entrance becker was not so sure his conscience would allow him to give up the search he was staring at the biggest crowd of punks hed ever seen there were coiffures of red white and blue everywhere becker sighed weighing his options he scanned the crowd and shrugged where else would she be on a saturday night cursing his good fortune becker climbed off the bus the access to club embrujo was a narrow stone corridor as becker entered he immediately felt himself caught up in the inward surge of eager patrons outta my way faggot a human pincushion pawed past him giving becker an elbow in the side nice tie someone gave beckers necktie a hard yank wanna fuck a teenage girl stared up at him looking like something out of dawn of the dead the darkness of the corridor spilled out into a huge cement chamber that reeked of alcohol and body odor the scene was surreala deep mountain grotto in which hundreds of bodies moved as one they surged up and down hands pressed firmly to their sides heads bobbing like lifeless bulbs on top of rigid spines crazed souls took running dives off a stage and landed on a sea of human limbs bodies were passed back and forth like human beach balls overhead the pulsating strobes gave the whole thing the look of an old silent movie on the far wall speakers the size of minivans shook so deeply that not even the most dedicated dancers could get closer than thirty feet from the pounding woofers becker plugged his ears and searched the crowd everywhere he looked was another red white and blue head the bodies were packed so closely together that he couldnt see what they were wearing he saw no hint of a british flag anywhere it was obvious hed never be able to enter the crowd without getting trampled someone nearby started vomiting lovely becker groaned he moved off down a spraypainted hallway the hall turned into a narrow mirrored tunnel which opened to an outdoor patio scattered with tables and chairs the patio was crowded with punk rockers but to becker it was like the gateway to shangrilathe summer sky opened up above him and the music faded away ignoring the curious stares becker walked out into the crowd he loosened his tie and collapsed into a chair at the nearest unoccupied table it seemed like a lifetime since strathmores earlymorning call after clearing the empty beer bottles from his table becker laid his head in his hands just for a few minutes he thought five miles away the man in wirerim glasses sat in the back of a fiat taxi as it raced headlong down a country road embrujo he grunted reminding the driver of their destination the driver nodded eyeing his curious new fare in the rearview mirror embrujo he grumbled to himself weirder crowd every night chapter tokugen numataka lay naked on the massage table in his penthouse office his personal masseuse worked out the kinks in his neck she ground her palms into the fleshy pockets surrounding his shoulder blades slowly working her way down to the towel covering his backside her hands slipped lower beneath his towel numataka barely noticed his mind was elsewhere he had been waiting for his private line to ring it had not there was a knock at the door enter numataka grunted the masseuse quickly pulled her hands from beneath the towel the switchboard operator entered and bowed honored chairman speak the operator bowed a second time i spoke to the phone exchange the call originated from country code the united states numataka nodded this was good news the call came from the states he smiled it was genuine where in the us he demanded theyre working on it sir very well tell me when you have more the operator bowed again and left numataka felt his muscles relax country code good news indeed chapter susan fletcher paced impatiently in the crypto bathroom and counted slowly to fifty her head was throbbing just a little longer she told herself hale is north dakota susan wondered what hales plans were would he announce the passkey would he be greedy and try to sell the algorithm susan couldnt bear to wait any longer it was time she had to get to strathmore cautiously she cracked the door and peered out at the reflective wall on the far side of crypto there was no way to know if hale was still watching shed have to move quickly to strathmores office not too quickly of courseshe could not let hale suspect she was on to him she reached for the door and was about to pull it open when she heard something voices mens voices the voices were coming through the ventilation shaft near the floor she released the door and moved toward the vent the words were muffled by the dull hum of the generators below the conversation sounded like it was coming up from the sublevel catwalks one voice was shrill angry it sounded like phil chartrukian you dont believe me the sound of more arguing rose we have a virus then the sound of harsh yelling we need to call jabba then there were sounds of a struggle let me go the noise that followed was barely human it was a long wailing cry of horror like a tortured animal about to die susan froze beside the vent the noise ended as abruptly as it had begun then there was a silence an instant later as if choreographed for some cheap horror matinee the lights in the bathroom slowly dimmed then they flickered and went out susan fletcher found herself standing in total blackness chapter youre in my seat asshole becker lifted his head off his arms doesnt anyone speak spanish in this damn country glaring down at him was a short pimplefaced teenager with a shaved head half of his scalp was red and half was purple he looked like an easter egg i said youre in my seat asshole i heard you the first time becker said standing up he was in no mood for a fight it was time to go whered you put my bottles the kid snarled there was a safety pin in his nose becker pointed to the beer bottles hed set on the ground they were empty they were my fuckin empties my apologies becker said and turned to go the punk blocked his way pick em up becker blinked not amused youre kidding right he was a full foot taller and outweighed the kid by about fifty pounds do i fuckin look like im kidding becker said nothing pick em up the kids voice cracked becker attempted to step around him but the teenager blocked his way i said fuckin pick em up stoned punks at nearby tables began turning to watch the excitement you dont want to do this kid becker said quietly im warning you the kid seethed this is my table i come here every night now pick em up beckers patience ran out wasnt he supposed to be in the smokys with susan what was he doing in spain arguing with a psychotic adolescent without warning becker caught the kid under the armpits lifted him up and slammed his rear end down on the table look you runnynosed little runt youre going to back off right now or im going to rip that safety pin out of your nose and pin your mouth shut the kids face went pale becker held him a moment then he released his grip without taking his eyes off the frightened kid becker stooped down picked up the bottles and returned them to the table what do you say he asked the kid was speechless youre welcome becker snapped this kids a walking billboard for birth control go to hell the kid yelled now aware of his peers laughing at him asswipe becker didnt move something the kid had said suddenly registered i come here every night becker wondered if maybe the kid could help him im sorry becker said i didnt catch your name twotone he hissed as if he were giving a death sentence twotone becker mused let me guess because of your hair no shit sherlock catchy name make that up yourself damn straight he said proudly im gonna patent it becker scowled you mean trademark it the kid looked confused youd need a trademark for a name becker said not a patent whatever the punk screamed in frustration the motley assortment of drunken and druggedout kids at the nearby tables were now in hysterics twotone stood up and sneered at becker what the fuck do you want from me becker thought a moment i want you to wash your hair cleanup your language and get a job becker figured it was too much to ask on a first meeting i need some information he said fuck you im looking for someone i aint seen him havent seen him becker corrected as he flagged a passing waitress he bought two aguila beers and handed one to twotone the boy looked shocked he took a swig of beer and eyed becker warily you hitting on me mister becker smiled im looking for a girl twotone let out a shrill laugh you sure as hell aint gonna get any action dressed like that becker frowned im not looking for action i just need to talk to her maybe you could help me find her twotone set down his beer you a cop becker shook his head the kids eyes narrowed you look like a cop kid im from maryland if i were a cop id be a little out of my jurisdiction dont you think the question seemed to stump him my names david becker becker smiled and offered his hand across the table the punk recoiled in disgust back off fag boy becker retracted the hand the kid sneered ill help you but itll cost you becker played along how much a hundred bucks becker frowned ive only got pesetas whatever make it a hundred pesetas foreign currency exchange was obviously not one of twotones fortes a hundred pesetas was about eightyseven cents deal becker said rapping his bottle on the table the kid smiled for the first time deal okay becker continued in his hushed tone i figure the girl im looking for might hang out here shes got red white and blue hair twotone snorted its judas taboos anniversary everybodys got shes also wearing a british flag tshirt and has a skull pendant in one ear a faint look of recognition crossed twotones face becker saw it and felt a surge of hope but a moment later twotones expression turned stern he slammed his bottle down and grabbed beckers shirt shes eduardos you asshole id watch it you touch her and hell kill you chapter midge milken prowled angrily into the conference room across from her office in addition to the thirtytwo foot mahogany table with the nsa seal inlaid in black cherry and walnut the conference room contained three marion pike watercolors a boston fern a marble wet bar and of course the requisite sparkletts water cooler midge helped herself to a glass of water hoping it might calm her nerves as she sipped at the liquid she gazed across at the window the moonlight was filtering through the open venetian blind and playing on the grain of the table shed always thought this would make a nicer directors office than fontaines current location on the front of the building rather than looking out over the nsa parking lot the conference room looked out over an impressive array of nsa outbuildingsincluding the crypto dome a hightech island floating separate from the main building on three wooded acres purposefully situated behind the natural cover of a grove of maples crypto was difficult to see from most windows in the nsa complex but the view from the directorial suite was perfect to midge the conference room seemed the perfect vantage point for a king to survey his domain she had suggested once that fontaine move his office but the director had simply replied not on the rear fontaine was not a man to be found on the back end of anything midge pulled apart the blinds she stared out at the hills sighing ruefully she let her eyes fall toward the spot where crypto stood midge had always felt comforted by the sight of the crypto domea glowing beacon regardless of the hour but tonight as she gazed out there was no comfort instead she found herself staring into a void as she pressed her face to the glass she was gripped by a wild girlish panic below her there was nothing but blackness crypto had disappeared chapter the crypto bathrooms had no windows and the darkness surrounding susan fletcher was absolute she stood dead still for a moment trying to get her bearings acutely aware of the growing sense of panic gripping her body the horrible cry from the ventilation shaft seemed to hang all around her despite her effort to fight off a rising sense of dread fear swept across her flesh and took control in a flurry of involuntary motion susan found herself groping wildly across stall doors and sinks disoriented she spun through the blackness with her hands out in front of her and tried to picture the room she knocked over a garbage can and found herself against a tiled wall following the wall with her hand she scrambled toward the exit and fumbled for the door handle she pulled it open and stumbled out onto the crypto floor there she froze for a second time the crypto floor looked nothing like it had just moments ago transltr was a gray silhouette against the faint twilight coming in through the dome all of the overhead lighting was dead not even the electronic keypads on the doors were glowing as susans eyes became accustomed to the dark she saw that the only light in crypto was coming through the open trapdoora faint red glow from the utility lighting below she moved toward it there was the faint smell of ozone in the air when she made it to the trapdoor she peered into the hole the freon vents were still belching swirling mist through the redness and from the higherpitched drone of the generators susan knew crypto was running on backup power through the mist she could make out strathmore standing on the platform below he was leaning over the railing and staring into the depths of transltrs rumbling shaft commander there was no response susan eased onto the ladder the hot air from below rushed in under her skirt the rungs were slippery with condensation she set herself down on the grated landing commander strathmore did not turn he continued staring down with a blank look of shock as if in a trance susan followed his gaze over the banister for a moment she could see nothing except wisps of steam then suddenly she saw it a figure six stories below it appeared briefly in the billows of steam there it was again a tangled mass of twisted limbs lying ninety feet below them phil chartrukian was sprawled across the sharp iron fins of the main generator his body was darkened and burned his fall had shorted out cryptos main power supply but the most chilling image of all was not of chartrukian but of someone else another body halfway down the long staircase crouched hiding in the shadows the muscular frame was unmistakable it was greg hale chapter the punk screamed at becker megan belongs to my friend eduardo you stay away from her where is she beckers heart was racing out of control fuck you its an emergency becker snapped he grabbed the kids sleeve shes got a ring that belongs tome ill pay her for it a lot twotone stopped dead and burst into hysterics you mean that ugly gold piece of shit is yours beckers eyes widened youve seen it twotone nodded coyly where is it becker demanded no clue twotone chuckled megan was up here trying to hock it she was trying to sell it dont worry man she didnt have any luck youve got shitty taste in jewelry are you sure nobody bought it are you shitting me for four hundred bucks i told her id give her fifty but she wanted more she was trying to buy a plane ticketstandby becker felt the blood drain from his face whereto fuckin connecticut twotone snapped eddies bummin connecticut shit yeah going back to mommy and daddys mansion in the burbs hated her spanish homestay family three spic brothers always hitting on her no fucking hot water becker felt a knot rise in his throat when is she leaving twotone looked up when he laughed shes long gone by now went to the airport hours ago best spot to hock the ringrich tourists and shit once she got the cash she was flying out a dull nausea swept through beckers gut this is some kind of sick joke isnt it he stood a long moment whats her last name twotone pondered the question and shrugged what flight was she taking she said something about the roach coach roach coach yeah weekend redeyeseville madrid la guardia that s what they call it college kids take it cause its cheap guess they sit in back and smoke roaches great becker groaned running a hand through his hair what time did it leave two am sharp every saturday night shes somewhere over the atlantic by now becker checked his watch it read pm he turned to twotone confused you said its a two am flight the punk nodded laughing looks like youre fucked ol man becker pointed angrily to his watch but its only quarter to two twotone eyed the watch apparently puzzled well ill be damned he laughed im usually not this buzzed till four am whats the fastest way to the airport becker snapped taxi stand out front becker grabbed a peseta note from his pocket and stuff edit in twotones hand hey man thanks the punk called after him if you see megan tell her i said hi but becker was already gone twotone sighed and staggered back toward the dance floor he was too drunk to notice the man in wirerim glasses following him outside becker scanned the parking lot for a taxi there was none he ran over to a stocky bouncer taxi the bouncer shook his head demasiado temprano too early too early becker swore its two oclock in the morning pidame uno call me one the man pulled out a walkietalkie he said a few words and then signed off veinte minutos he offered twenty minutes becker demanded y elautobus the bouncer shrugged fortyfive minutos becker threw up his hands perfect the sound of a small engine turned beckers head it sounded like a chainsaw a big kid and his chainclad date pulled into the parking lot on an old vespa motorcycle the girls skirt had blown high on her thighs she didnt seem to notice becker dashed over i cant believe im doing this he thought i hate motorcycles he yelled to the driver ill pay you ten thousand pesetas to take me to the airport the kid ignored him and killed the engine twenty thousand becker blurted i need to get to the airport the kid looked up scusi he was italian aeroporto per favore sulla vespa venti mille pesete the italian eyed his crummy little bike and laughed venti mille pesete la vespa cinquanta mille fifty thousand becker offered it was about four hundred dollars the italian laughed doubtfully dove la plata wheres the cash becker pulled five peseta notes from his pocket and held them out the italian looked at the money and then at his girlfriend the girl grabbed the cash and stuffed it in her blouse grazie the italian beamed he tossed becker the keys to his vespa then he grabbed his girlfriends hand and they ran off laughing into the building aspetta becker yelled wait i wanted a ride chapter susan reached for commander strathmores hand as he helped her up the ladder onto the crypto floor the image of phil chartrukian lying broken on the generators was burned into her mind the thought of hale hiding in the bowels of crypto had left her dizzy the truth was inescapablehale had pushed chartrukian susan stumbled past the shadow of transltr back toward cryptos main exitthe door shed come through hours earlier her frantic punching on the unlit keypad did nothing to move the huge portal she was trapped crypto was a prison the dome sat like a satellite yards away from the main nsa structure accessible only through the main portal since crypto made its own power the switchboard probably didnt even know they were in trouble the main powers out strathmore said arriving behind her were on aux the backup power supply in crypto was designed so that transltr and its cooling systems took precedence over all other systems including lights and doorways that way an untimely power outage would not interrupt transltr during an important run it also meant transltr would never run without its freon cooling system in an uncooled enclosure the heat generated by three million processors would rise to treacherous levelsperhaps even igniting the silicon chips and resulting in a fiery meltdown it was an image no one dared consider susan fought to get her bearings her thoughts were consumed by the single image of the syssec on the generators she stabbed at the keypad again still no response abort the run she demanded telling transltr to stop searching for the digital fortress passkey would shut down its circuits and free up enough backup power to get the doors working again easy susan strathmore said putting a steadying hand on her shoulder the commanders reassuring touch lifted susan from her daze she suddenly remembered why she had been going to get him she wheeled commander greg hale is north dakota there was a seemingly endless beat of silence in the dark finally strathmore replied his voice sounded more confused than shocked what are you talking about hale susan whispered hes north dakota there was more silence as strathmore pondered susans words the tracer he seemed confused it fingered hale the tracer isnt back yet hale aborted it susan went on to explain how hale had stopped her tracer and how shed found email from tankado in hales account another long moment of silence followed strathmore shook his head in disbelief theres no way greg hale is tankados insurance its absurd tankado would never trust hale commander she said hale sank us once beforeskipjack tankado trusted him strathmore could not seem to find words abort transltr susan begged him weve got north dakota call building security lets get out of here strathmore held up his hand requesting a moment to think susan looked nervously in the direction of the trapdoor the opening was just out of sight behind transltr but the reddish glow spilled out over the black tile like fire on ice come on call security commander abort transltr get us out of here suddenly strathmore sprang to action follow me he said he strode toward the trapdoor commander hale is dangerous he but strathmore disappeared into the dark susan hurried to follow his silhouette the commander circled around transltr and arrived over the opening in the floor he peered into the swirling steaming pit silently he looked around the darkened crypto floor then he bent down and heaved the heavy trapdoor it swung in a low arc when he let go it slammed shut with a deadening thud crypto was once again a silent blackened cave it appeared north dakota was trapped strathmore knelt down he turned the heavy butterfly lock it spun into place the sublevels were sealed neither he nor susan heard the faint steps in the direction of node chapter twotone headed through the mirrored corridor that led from the outside patio to the dance floor as he turned to check his safety pin in the reflection he sensed a figure looming up behind him he spun but it was too late a pair of rocklike arms pinned his body facefirst against the glass the punk tried to twist around eduardo hey man is that you twotone felt a hand brush over his wallet before the figure leaned firmly into his back eddie the punk cried quit fooling around some guy was lookin for megan the figure held him firmly hey eddie man cut it out but when twotone looked up into the mirror he saw the figure pinning him was not his friend at all the face was pockmarked and scarred two lifeless eyes stared out like coal from behind wirerim glasses the man leaned forward placing his mouth against twotones ear a strange voice choked adonde fue whered he go the words sounded somehow misshapen the punk froze paralyzed with fear adonde fue the voice repeated el americano the the airport aeropuerto twotone stammered aeropuerto the man repeated his dark eyes watching twotones lips in the mirror the punk nodded tenia el anillo did he have the ring terrified twotone shook his head no viste el anillo did you see the ring twotone paused what was the right answer viste el anillo the muffled voice demanded twotone nodded affirmatively hoping honesty would pay it did not seconds later he slid to the floor his neck broken chapter jabba lay on his back lodged halfway inside a dismantled mainframe computer there was a penlight in his mouth a soldering iron in his hand and a large schematic blueprint propped on his belly he had just finished attaching a new set of attenuators to a faulty motherboard when his cellular phone sprang to life shit he swore groping for the receiver through a pile of cables jabba here jabba its midge he brightened twice in one night people are gonna start talking cryptos got problems her voice was tense jabba frowned we been through this already remember its a power problem im not an electrician call engineering the domes dark youre seeing things go home he turned back to his schematic pitch black she yelled jabba sighed and set down his penlight midge first of all weve got aux power in there it would never be pitch black second strathmores got a slightly better view of crypto than i do right now why dont you call him because this has to do with him hes hiding something jabba rolled his eyes midge sweetie im up to my armpits in serial cable here if you need a date ill cut loose otherwise call engineering jabba this is serious i can feel it she can feel it it was official jabba thought midge was in one of her moods if strathmores not worried im not worried cryptos pitch black dammit so maybe strathmores stargazing jabba im not kidding around here okay okay he grumbled propping himself up on an elbow maybe a generator shorted out as soon as im done here ill stop by crypto and what about aux power midge demanded if a generator blew why is there no aux power i dont know maybe strathmores got transltr running and aux power is tapped out so why doesnt he abort maybe its a virus you said something earlier about a virus damn it midge jabba exploded i told you theres no virus in crypto stop being so damned paranoid there was a long silence on the line aw shit midge jabba apologized let me explain his voice was tight first of all weve got gauntletno virus could possibly get through second if theres a power failure its hardwarerelatedviruses dont kill power they attack software and data whatevers going on in crypto its not a virus silence midge you there midges response was icy jabba i have a job to do i dont expect to be yelled at for doing it when i call to ask why a multi billiondollar facility is in the dark i expect a professional response yes maam a simple yes or no will suffice is it possible the problem in crypto is virusrelated midge i told you yes or no could transltr have a virus jabba sighed no midge its totally impossible thank you he forced a chuckle and tried to lighten the mood unless you think strathmore wrote one himself and bypassed my filters there was a stunned silence when midge spoke her voice had an eerie edge strathmore can bypass gauntlet jabba sighed it was a joke midge but he knew it was too late chapter the commander and susan stood beside the closed trapdoor and debated what to do next weve got phil chartrukian dead down there strathmore argued if we call for help crypto will turn into a circus so what do you propose we do susan demanded wanting only to leave strathmore thought a moment dont ask me how it happened he said glancing down at the locked trapdoor but it looks like weve inadvertently located and neutralized north dakota he shook his head in disbelief damn lucky break if you ask me he still seemed stunned by the idea that hale was involved in tankados plan my guess is that hales got the passkey hidden in his terminal somewheremaybe hes got a copy at home either way hes trapped so why not call building security and let them cart him away not yet strathmore said if the syssecs uncover stats of this endless transltr run weve got a whole new set of problems i want all traces of digital fortress deleted before we open the doors susan nodded reluctantly it was a good plan when security finally pulled hale from the sublevels and charged him with chartrukians death he probably would threaten to tell the world about digital fortress but the proof would be erasedstrathmore could play dumb an endless run an unbreakable algorithm but thats absurd hasnt hale heard of the bergofsky principle heres what we need to do strathmore coolly outlined his plan we erase all of hales correspondence with tankado we erase all records of my bypassing gauntlet all of chartrukians syssec analysis the runmonitor records everything digital fortress disappears it was never here we bury hales key and pray to god david finds tankados copy david susan thought she forced him from her mind she needed to stay focused on the matter at hand ill handle the syssec lab strathmore said runmonitor stats mutation activity stats the works you handle node delete all of hales email any records of correspondence with tankado anything that mentions digital fortress okay susan replied focusing ill erase hales whole drive reformat everything no strathmores response was stern dont do that hale most likely has a copy of the passkey in there i want it susan gaped in shock you want the passkey i thought the whole point was to destroy the passkeys it is but i want a copy i want to crack open this damn file and have a look at tankados program susan shared strathmores curiosity but instinct told her unlocking the digital fortress algorithm was not wise regardless of how interesting it would be right now the deadly program was locked safely in its encrypted vaulttotally harmless as soon as he decrypted it commander wouldnt we be better off just to i want the key he replied susan had to admit ever since hearing about digital fortress shed felt a certain academic curiosity to know how tankado had managed to write it its mere existence contradicted the most fundamental rules of cryptography susan eyed the commander youll delete the algorithm immediately after we see it without a trace susan frowned she knew that finding hales key would not happen instantly locating a random passkey on one of the node hard drives was somewhat like trying to find a single sock in a bedroom the size of texas computer searches only worked when you knew what you were looking for this passkey was random fortunately however because crypto dealt with so much random material susan and some others had developed a complex process known as a nonconformity search the search essentially asked the computer to study every string of characters on its hard drive compare each string against an enormous dictionary and flag any strings that seemed nonsensical or random it was tricky work to refine the parameters continually but it was possible susan knew she was the logical choice to find the passkey she sighed hoping she wouldnt regret it if all goes well it will take me about half an hour then lets get to work strathmore said putting a hand on her shoulder and leading her through the darkness toward node above them a starfilled sky had stretched itself across the dome susan wondered if david could see the same stars from seville as they approached the heavy glass doors of node strathmore swore under his breath the node keypad was unlit and the doors were dead damn it he said no power i forgot strathmore studied the sliding doors he placed his palms flat against the glass then he leaned sideways trying to slide them open his hands were sweaty and slipped he wiped them on his pants and tried again this time the doors slid open a tiny crack susan sensing progress got in behind strathmore and they both pushed together the doors slid open about an inch they held it a moment but the pressure was too great the doors sprang shut again hold on susan said repositioning herself in front of strathmore okay now try they heaved again the door opened only about an inch a faint ray of blue light appeared from inside node the terminals were still on they were considered critical to transltr and were receiving aux power susan dug the toe of her ferragamos into the floor and pushed harder the door started to move strathmore moved to get a better angle centering his palms on the left slider he pushed straight back susan pushed the right slider in the opposite direction slowly arduously the doors began to separate they were now almost a foot apart dont let go strathmore said panting as they pushed harder just a little farther susan repositioned herself with her shoulder in the crack she pushed again this time with a better angle the doors fought back against her before strathmore could stop her susan squeezed her slender body into the opening strathmore protested but she was intent she wanted out of crypto and she knew strathmore well enough to know she wasnt going anywhere until hales passkey was found she centered herself in the opening and pushed with all her strength the doors seemed to push back suddenly susan lost her grip the doors sprang toward her strathmore fought to hold them off but it was too much just as the doors slammed shut susan squeezed through and collapsed on the other side the commander fought to reopen the door a tiny sliver he put his face to the narrow crack jesus susanare you okay susan stood up and brushed herself off fine she looked around node was deserted lit only by the computer monitors the bluish shadows gave the place a ghostly ambiance she turned to strathmore in the crack of the door his face looked pallid and sickly in the blue light susan he said give me twenty minutes to delete the files in syssec when all traces are gone ill go up to my terminal and abort transltr you better susan said eyeing the heavy glass doors she knew that until transltr stopped hoarding aux power she was a prisoner in node strathmore let go of the doors and they snapped shut susan watched through the glass as the commander disappeared into the crypto darkness chapter beckers newly purchased vespa motorcycle struggled up the entry road to aeropuerto de sevilla his knuckles had been white the whole way his watch read just after am local time as he approached the main terminal he rode up on the sidewalk and jumped off the bike while it was still moving it clattered to the pavement and sputtered to a stop becker dashed on rubbery legs through the revolving door never again he swore to himself the terminal was sterile and starkly lit except for a janitor buffing the floor the place was deserted across the concourse a ticket agent was closing down the iberia airlines counter becker took it as a bad sign he ran over el vuelo a los estados unidos the attractive andalusian woman behind the counter looked up and smiled apologetically acaba de salir you just missed it her words hung in the air for a long moment i missed it beckers shoulders slumped was there standby room on the flight plenty the woman smiled almost empty but tomorrows eight am also has i need to know if a friend of mine made that flight she was flying standby the woman frowned im sorry sir there were several standby passengers tonight but our privacy clause states its very important becker urged i just need to know if she made the flight thats all the woman gave a sympathetic nod lovers quarrel becker thought a moment then he gave her a sheepish grin its that obvious she gave him a wink whats her name megan he replied sadly the agent smiled does your lady friend have a last name becker exhaled slowly yes but i dont know it actually its kind of a complicated situation you said the plane was almost empty maybe you could without a last name i really cant actually becker interrupted having another idea have you been on all night the woman nodded seven to seven then maybe you saw her shes a young girl maybe fifteen or sixteen her hair was before the words left his mouth becker realized his mistake the agents eyes narrowed your lover is fifteen years old no becker gasped i mean shit if you could just help me its very important im sorry the woman said coldly its not the way it sounds if you could just good night sir the woman yanked the metal grate down over the counter and disappeared into a back room becker groaned and stared skyward smooth david very smooth he scanned the open concourse nothing she must have sold the ring and made the flight he headed for the custodian has visto a una nina he called over the sound of the tile buffer have you seen a girl the old man reached down and killed the machine eh una nina becker repeated pelo rojo azul y blanco red white and blue hair the custodian laughed que fea sounds ugly he shook his head and went back to work david becker stood in the middle of the deserted airport concourse and wondered what to do next the evening had been a comedy of errors strathmores words pounded in his head dont call until you have the ring a profound exhaustion settled over him if megan sold the ring and made the flight there was no telling who had the ring now becker closed his eyes and tried to focus whats my next move he decided to consider it in a moment first he needed to make a longoverdue trip to a rest room chapter susan stood alone in the dimly lit silence of node the task at hand was simple access hales terminal locate his key and then delete all of his communication with tankado there could be no hint of digital fortress anywhere susans initial fears of saving the key and unlocking digital fortress were nagging at her again she felt uneasy tempting fate theyd been lucky so far north dakota had miraculously appeared right under their noses and been trapped the only remaining question was david he had to find the other passkey susan hoped he was making progress as she made her way deeper into node susan tried to clear her mind it was odd that she felt uneasy in such a familiar space everything in node seemed foreign in the dark but there was something else susan felt a momentary hesitation and glanced back at the inoperable doors there was no escape twenty minutes she thought as she turned toward hales terminal she noticed a strange musky odorit was definitely not a node smell she wondered if maybe the deionizer was malfunctioning the smell was vaguely familiar and with it came an unsettling chill she pictured hale locked below in his enormous steaming cell did he set something on fire she looked up at the vents and sniffed but the odor seemed to be coming from nearby susan glanced toward the latticed doors of the kitchenette and in an instant she recognized the smell it was cologne and sweat she recoiled instinctively not prepared for what she saw from behind the lattice slats of the kitchenette two eyes stared out at her it only took an instant for the horrifying truth to hit her greg hale was not locked on the sublevelshe was in node hed slipped upstairs before strathmore closed the trapdoor hed been strong enough to open the doors all by himself susan had once heard that raw terror was paralyzingshe now knew that was a myth in the same instant her brain grasped what was happening she was in motionstumbling backward through the dark with a single thought in mind escape the crash behind her was instantaneous hale had been sitting silently on the stove and extended his legs like two battering rams the doors exploded off their hinges hale launched himself into the room and thundered after her with powerful strides susan knocked over a lamp behind her attempting to trip hale as he moved toward her she sensed him vault it effortlessly hale was gaining quickly when his right arm circled her waist from behind it felt like shed hit a steel bar she gasped in pain as the wind went out of her his biceps flexed against her rib cage susan resisted and began twisting wildly somehow her elbow struck cartilage hale released his grip his hands clutching his nose he fell to his knees hands cupped over his face son of a he screamed in pain susan dashed onto the doors pressure plates saying a fruitless prayer that strathmore would in that instant restore power and the doors would spring open instead she found herself pounding against the glass hale lumbered toward her his nose covered with blood in an instant his hands were around her againone of them clamped firmly on her left breast and the other on her midsection he yanked her away from the door she screamed her hand outstretched in futile attempt to stop him he pulled her backward his belt buckle digging into her spine susan couldnt believe his strength he dragged her back across the carpet and her shoes came off in one fluid motion hale lifted her and dumped her on the floor next to his terminal susan was suddenly on her back her skirt bunched high on her hips the top button of her blouse had released and her chest was heaving in the bluish light she stared up in terror as hale straddled her pinning her down she couldnt decipher the look in his eyes it looked like fear or was it anger his eyes bore into her body she felt a new wave of panic hale sat firmly on her midsection staring down at her with an icy glare everything susan had ever learned about selfdefense was suddenly racing through her mind she tried to fight but her body did not respond she was numb she closed her eyes oh please god no chapter brinkerhoff paced midges office nobody bypasses gauntlet its impossible wrong she fired back i just talked to jabba he said he installed a bypass switch last year the pa looked doubtful i never heard that nobody did it was hushhush midge brinkerhoff argued jabbas compulsive about security he would never put in a switch to bypass strathmore made him do it she interrupted brinkerhoff could almost hear her mind clicking remember last year she asked when strathmore was working on that antisemitic terrorist ring in california brinkerhoff nodded it had been one of strathmores major coups last year using transltr to decrypt an intercepted code he had uncovered a plot to bomb a hebrew school in los angeles he decrypted the terrorists message only twelve minutes before the bomb went off and using some fast phone work he saved three hundred schoolchildren get this midge said lowering her voice unnecessarily jabba said strathmore intercepted that terrorist code six hours before that bomb went off brinkerhoffs jaw dropped but then why did he wait because he couldnt get transltr to decrypt the file he tried but gauntlet kept rejecting it it was encrypted with some new public key algorithm that the filters hadnt seen yet it took jabba almost six hours to adjust them brinkerhoff looked stunned strathmore was furious he made jabba install a bypass switch in gauntlet in case it ever happened again jesus brinkerhoff whistled i had no idea then his eyes narrowed so whats your point i think strathmore used the switch today to process a file that gauntlet rejected so thats what the switch is for right midge shook her head not if the file in question is a virus brinkerhoff jumped a virus who said anything about a virus its the only explanation she said jabba said a virus is the only thing that could keep transltr running this long so wait a minute brinkerhoff flashed her the timeout sign strathmore said everythings fine hes lying brinkerhoff was lost youre saying strathmore intentionally let a virus into transltr no she snapped i dont think he knew it was a virus i think he was tricked brinkerhoff was speechless midge milken was definitely losing it it explains a lot she insisted it explains what hes been doing in there all night planting viruses in his own computer no she said annoyed trying to cover up his mistake and now he cant abort transltr and get aux power back because the virus has the processors locked down brinkerhoff rolled his eyes midge had gone nuts in the past but never like this he tried to calm her jabba doesnt seem to be too worried jabbas a fool she hissed brinkerhoff looked surprised nobody had ever called jabba a foola pig maybe but never a fool youre trusting feminine intuition over jabbas advanced degrees in antiinvasive programming she eyed him harshly brinkerhoff held up his hands in surrender never mind i take it back he didnt need to be reminded of midges uncanny ability to sense disaster midge he begged i know you hate strathmore but this has nothing to do with strathmore midge was in overdrive the first thing we need to do is confirm strathmore bypassed gauntlet then we call the director great brinkerhoff moaned ill call strathmore and ask him to send us a signed statement no she replied ignoring his sarcasm strathmores lied to us once already today she glanced up her eyes probing his do you have keys to fontaines office of course im his pa i need them brinkerhoff stared in disbelief midge theres no way in hell im letting you into fontaines office you have to she demanded midge turned and started typing on big brothers keyboard im requesting a transltr queue list if strathmore manually bypassed gauntlet itll show up on the printout what does that have to do with fontaines office she spun and glared at him the queue list only prints to fontaines printer you know that thats because its classified midge this is an emergency i need to see that list brinkerhoff put his hands on her shoulders midge please settle down you know i cant she huffed loudly and spun back to her keyboard im printing a queue list im going to walk in pick it up and walk out now give me the key midge she finished typing and spun back to him chad the report prints in thirty seconds heres the deal you give me the key if strathmore bypassed we call security if im wrong i leave and you can go smear marmalade all over carmen huerta she gave him a malicious glare and held out her hands for the keys im waiting brinkerhoff groaned regretting that he had called her back to check the crypto report he eyed her outstretched hand youre talking about classified information inside the directors private quarters do you have any idea what would happen if we got caught the director is in south america im sorry i just cant brinkerhoff crossed his arms and walked out midge stared after him her gray eyes smoldering oh yes you can she whispered then she turned back to big brother and called up the video archives midgell get over it brinkerhoff told himself as he settled in at his desk and started going over the rest of his reports he couldnt be expected to hand out the directors keys whenever midge got paranoid he had just begun checking the comsec breakdowns when his thoughts were interrupted by the sound of voices coming from the other room he set down his work and walked to his doorway the main suite was darkall except a dim shaft of grayish light from midges halfopen door he listened the voices continued they sounded excited midge no response he strode through the darkness to her workspace the voices were vaguely familiar he pushed the door open the room was empty midges chair was empty the sound was coming from overhead brinkerhoff looked up at the video monitors and instantly felt ill the same image was playing on each one of the twelve screensa kind of perversely choreographed ballet brinkerhoff steadied himself on the back of midges chair and watched in horror chad the voice was behind him he spun and squinted into the darkness midge was standing kittycorner across the main suites reception area in front of the directors double doors her palm was outstretched the key chad brinkerhoff flushed he turned back to the monitors he tried to block out the images overhead but it was no use he was everywhere groaning with pleasure and eagerly fondling carmen huertas small honeycovered breasts chapter becker crossed the concourse toward the rest room doors only to find the door marked caballeros blocked by an orange pylon and a cleaning cart filled with detergent and mops he eyed the other door damas he strode over and rapped loudly hola he called pushing the ladies room door open an inch con permiso silence he went in the rest room was typical spanish institutionalperfectly square white tile one incandescent bulb overhead as usual there was one stall and one urinal whether the urinals were ever used in the womens bathrooms was immaterialadding them saved the contractors the expense of having to build the extra stall becker peered into the rest room in disgust it was filthy the sink was clogged with murky brown water dirty paper towels were strewn everywhere the floor was soaked the old electric hand blower on the wall was smeared with greenish fingerprints becker stepped in front of the mirror and sighed the eyes that usually stared back with fierce clarity were not so clear tonight how long have i been running around over here he wondered the math escaped him out of professorial habit he shimmied his neckties windsor knot up on his collar then he turned to the urinal behind him as he stood there he found himself wondering if susan was home yet where could she have gone to stone manor without me hey a female voice behind him said angrily becker jumped iim he stammered hurrying to zip up im sorry i becker turned to face the girl who had just entered she was a young sophisticate right off the pages of seventeen magazine she wore conservative plaid pants and a white sleeveless blouse in her hand was a red l l bean duffel her blond hair was perfectly blowdried im sorry becker fumbled buckling his belt the mens room was anyway im leaving fuckin weirdo becker did a doubletake the profanity seemed inappropriate coming from her lipslike sewage flowing from a polished decanter but as becker studied her he saw that she was not as polished as hed first thought her eyes were puffy and bloodshot and her left forearm was swollen underneath the reddish irritation on her arm the flesh was blue jesus becker thought intravenous drugs who would have guessed get out she yelled just get out becker momentarily forgot all about the ring the nsa all of it his heart went out to the young girl her parents had probably sent her over here with some prep school study program and a visa cardand shed ended up all alone in a bathroom in the middle of the night doing drugs are you okay he asked backing toward the door im fine her voice was haughty you can leave now becker turned to go he shot her forearm a last sad glance theres nothing you can do david leave it alone now she hollered becker nodded as he left he gave her a sad smile be careful chapter susan hale panted his face in hers he was sitting one leg on either side of her his full weight on her midsection his tailbone ground painfully into her pubis through the thin fabric of her skirt his nose was dripping blood all over her she tasted vomit in the back of her throat his hands were at her chest she felt nothing is he touching me it took a moment for susan to realize hale was buttoning her top button and covering her up susan hale gasped breathless youve got to get me out of here susan was in a daze nothing made sense susan youve got to help me strathmore killed chartrukian i saw it it took a moment for the words to register strathmore killed chartrukian hale obviously had no idea susan had seen him downstairs strathmore knows i saw him hale spat hell kill me too had susan not been breathless with fear she would have laughed in his face she recognized the divideandconquer mentality of an exmarine invent liespit your enemies against each other its true he yelled weve got to call for help i think were both in danger she did not believe a word he said hales muscular legs were cramping and he rolled up on his haunches to shift his weight slightly he opened his mouth to speak but he never got the chance as hales body rose susan felt the circulation surge back into her legs before she knew what had happened a reflex instinct jerked her left leg back hard into hales crotch she felt her kneecap crush the soft sac of tissue between his legs hale whimpered in agony and instantly went limp he rolled onto his side clutching himself susan twisted out from under his deadweight she staggered toward the door knowing shed never be strong enough to get out making a splitsecond decision susan positioned herself behind the long maple meeting table and dug her feet into the carpet mercifully the table had casters she strode with all her might toward the arched glass wall pushing the table before her the casters were good and the table rolled well halfway across node she was at a full sprint five feet from the glass wall susan heaved and let go she leapt to one side and covered her eyes after a sickening crack the wall exploded in a shower of glass the sounds of crypto rushed into node for the first time since its construction susan looked up through the jagged hole she could see the table it was still rolling it spun wide circles out across the crypto floor and eventually disappeared into the darkness susan rammed her mangled ferragamos back on her feet shot a last glance at the stillwrithing greg hale and dashed across the sea of broken glass out onto the crypto floor chapter now wasnt that easy midge said with a sneer as brinkerhoff handed over the key to fontaines office brinkerhoff looked beaten ill erase it before i go midge promised unless you and your wife want it for your private collection just get the damned printout he snapped and then get out si senor midge cackled in a thick puerto rican accent she winked and headed across the suite to fontaines double doors leland fontaines private office looked nothing like the rest of the directorial suite there were no paintings no overstuffed chairs no ficus plants no antique clocks his space was streamlined for efficiency his glasstopped desk and black leather chair sat directly in front of his enormous picture window three file cabinets stood in the corner next to a small table with a french press coffeepot the moon had risen high over fort meade and the soft light filtering through the window accentuated the starkness of the directors furnishings what the hell am i doing brinkerhoff wondered midge strode to the printer and scooped up the queue list she squinted in the darkness i cant read the data she complained turn on the lights youre reading it outside now come on but midge was apparently having too much fun she toyed with brinkerhoff walking to the window and angling the readout for a better view midge she kept reading brinkerhoff shifted anxiously in the doorway midge come on these are the directors private quarters its here somewhere she muttered studying the printout strathmore bypassed gauntlet i know it she moved closer to the window brinkerhoff began to sweat midge kept reading after a few moments she gasped i knew it strathmore did it he really did the idiot she held up the paper and shook it he bypassed gauntlet have a look brinkerhoff stared dumbfounded a moment and then raced across the directors office he crowded in next to midge in front of the window she pointed to the end of the readout brinkerhoff read in disbelief what the the printout contained a list of the last thirtysix files that had entered transltr after each file was a fourdigit gauntlet clearance code however the last file on the sheet had no clearance codeit simply read manual bypass jesus brinkerhoff thought midge strikes again the idiot midge sputtered seething look at this gauntlet rejected the file twice mutation strings and he still bypassed what the hell was he thinking brinkerhoff felt weakkneed he wondered why midge was always right neither of them noticed the reflection that had appeared in the window beside them a massive figure was standing in fontaines open doorway jeez brinkerhoff choked you think we have a virus midge sighed nothing else it could be could be none of your damn business the deep voice boomed from behind them midge knocked her head against the window brinkerhoff tipped over the directors chair and wheeled toward the voice he immediately knew the silhouette director brinkerhoff gasped he strode over and extended his hand welcome home sir the huge man ignored it ii thought brinkerhoff stammered retracting his hand i thought you were in south america leland fontaine glared down at his aide with eyes like bullets yes and now im back chapter hey mister becker had been walking across the concourse toward a bank of pay phones he stopped and turned coming up behind him was the girl hed just surprised in the bathroom she waved for him to wait mister wait now what becker groaned she wants to press invasionofprivacy charges the girl dragged her duffel toward him when she arrived she was now wearing a huge smile sorry to yell at you back there you just kind of startled me no problem becker assured somewhat puzzled i was in the wrong place this will sound crazy she said batting her bloodshot eyes but you wouldnt happen to have some money you can lend me would you becker stared at her in disbelief money for what he demanded im not funding your drug habit if thats what youre asking im trying to get back home the blonde said can you help miss your flight she nodded lost my ticket they wouldnt let me get on airlines can be such assholes i dont have the cash to buy another where are your parents becker asked states can you reach them nope already tried i think theyre weekending on somebodys yacht becker scanned the girls expensive clothing you dont have a credit card yeah but my dad canceled it he thinks im on drugs are you on drugs becker asked deadpan eyeing her swollen forearm the girl glared indignant of course not she gave becker an innocent huff and he suddenly got the feeling he was being played come on she said you look like a rich guy cant you spot me some cash to get home i could send it to you later becker figured any cash he gave this girl would end up in the hands of some drug dealer in triana first of all he said im not a rich guyim a teacher but ill tell you what ill do ill call your bluff thats what ill do why dont i charge the ticket for you the blonde stared at him in utter shock youd do that she stammered eyes wide with hope youd buy me a ticket home oh god thank you becker was speechless he had apparently misjudged the moment the girl threw her arms around him its been a shitty summer she choked almost bursting into tears oh thank you ive got to get out of here becker returned her embrace halfheartedly the girl let go of him and he eyed her forearm again she followed his gaze to the bluish rash gross huh becker nodded i thought you said you werent on drugs the girl laughed its magic marker i took off half my skin trying to scrub it off the ink smeared becker looked closer in the fluorescent light he could see blurred beneath the reddish swelling on her arm the faint outline of writingwords scrawled on flesh but but your eyes becker said feeling dumb theyre all red she laughed i was crying i told you i missed my flight becker looked back at the words on her arm she frowned embarrassed oops you can still kind of read it cant you becker leaned closer he could read it all right the message was crystal clear as he read the four faint words the last twelve hours flashed before his eyes david becker found himself back in the alfonso xiii hotel room the obese german was touching his own forearm and speaking broken english fock off und die you okay the girl asked eyeing the dazed becker becker did not look up from her arm he was dizzy the four words smeared across the girls flesh carried a very simple message fuck off and die the blonde looked down at it embarrassed this friend of mine wrote it pretty stupid huh becker couldnt speak fock off und die he couldnt believe it the german hadnt been insulting him hed been trying to help becker lifted his gaze to the girls face in the fluorescent light of the concourse he could see faint traces of red and blue in the girls blond hair yyou becker stammered staring at her unpierced ears you wouldnt happen to wear earrings would you the girl eyed him strangely she fished a tiny object from her pocket and held it out becker gazed at the skull pendant dangling in her hand a clipon he stammered hell yes the girl replied im scared shitless of needles chapter david becker stood in the deserted concourse and felt his legs go weak he eyed the girl before him and knew his search was over she had washed her hair and changed clothesmaybe in hopes of having better luck selling the ringbut shed never boarded for new york becker fought to keep his cool his wild journey was about to end he scanned her fingers they were bare he gazed down at her duffel its in there he thought its got to be he smiled barely containing his excitement this is going to sound crazy he said but i think youve got something i need oh megan seemed suddenly uncertain becker reached for his wallet of course id be happy to pay you he looked down and started sorting through the cash in his billfold as megan watched him count out his money she drew a startled gasp apparently misunderstanding his intentions she shot a frightened glance toward the revolving door measuring the distance it was fifty yards i can give you enough to buy your ticket home if dont say it megan blurted offering a forced smile i think i know exactly what you need she bent down and started rifling through her duffel becker felt a surge of hope shes got it he told himself shes got the ring he didnt know how the hell she knew what it was he wanted but he was too tired to care every muscle in his body relaxed he pictured himself handing the ring to the beaming deputy director of the nsa then he and susan would lie in the big canopy bed at stone manor and make up for lost time the girl finally found what she was looking forher pepperguardthe environmentally safe alternative to mace made from a potent blend of cayenne and chili peppers in one swift motion she swung around and fired a direct stream into beckers eyes she grabbed her duffel and dashed for the door when she looked back david becker was on the floor holding his face writhing in agony chapter tokugen numataka lit his fourth cigar and kept pacing he snatched up his phone and buzzed the main switchboard any word yet on that phone number he demanded before the operator could speak nothing yet sir its taking a bit longer than expectedit came from a cellular a cellular numataka mused figures fortunately for the japanese economy the americans had an insatiable appetite for electronic gadgets the boosting station the operator added is in the area code but we have no number yet wheres that where in the vast american expanse is this mysterious north dakota hiding somewhere near washington d c sir numataka arched his eyebrows call me as soon as you have a number chapter susan fletcher stumbled across the darkened crypto floor toward strathmores catwalk the commanders office was as far from hale as susan could get inside the locked complex when susan reached the top of the catwalk stairs she found the commanders door hanging loosely the electronic lock rendered ineffective by the power outage she barged in commander the only light inside was the glow of strathmores computer monitors commander she called once again commander susan suddenly remembered that the commander was in the syssec lab she turned circles in his empty office the panic of her ordeal with hale still in her blood she had to get out of crypto digital fortress or no digital fortress it was time to acttime to abort the transltr run and escape she eyed strathmores glowing monitors then dashed to his desk she fumbled with his keypad abort transltr the task was simple now that she was on an authorized terminal susan called up the proper command window and typed abort run her finger hovered momentarily over the enter key susan a voice barked from the doorway susan wheeled scared fearing it was hale but it was not it was strathmore he stood pale and eerie in the electronic glow his chest heaving what the hells going on com mander susan gasped hales in node he just attacked me what impossible hales locked down in no hes not hes loose we need security inhere now im aborting transltr susan reached for the keypad dont touch that strathmore lunged for the terminal and pulled susans hands away susan recoiled stunned she stared at the commander and for the second time that day did not recognize him susan felt suddenly alone strathmore saw the blood on susans shirt and immediately regretted his outburst jesus susan are you okay she didnt respond he wished he hadnt jumped on her unnecessarily his nerves were frayed he was juggling too much there were things on his mindthings susan fletcher did not know aboutthings he had not told her and prayed hed never have to im sorry he said softly tell me what happened she turned away it doesnt matter the bloods not mine just get me out of here are you hurt strathmore put a hand on her shoulder susan recoiled he dropped his hand and looked away when he looked back at susans face she seemed to be staring over his shoulder at something on the wall there in the darkness a small keypad glowed full force strathmore followed her gaze and frowned hed hoped susan wouldnt notice the glowing control panel the illuminated keypad controlled his private elevator strathmore and his highpowered guests used it to come and go from crypto without advertising the fact to the rest of the staff the personal lift dropped down fifty feet below the crypto dome and then moved laterally yards through a reinforced underground tunnel to the sublevels of the main nsa complex the elevator connecting crypto to the nsa was powered from the main complex it was online despite cryptos power outage strathmore had known all along it was online but even as susan had been pounding on the main exit downstairs he hadnt mentioned it he could not afford to let susan outnot yet he wondered how much hed have to tell her to make her want to stay susan pushed past strathmore and raced to the back wall she jabbed furiously at the illuminated buttons please she begged but the door did not open susan strathmore said quietly the lift takes a password a password she repeated angrily she glared at the controls below the main keypad was a second keypada smaller one with tiny buttons each button was marked with a letter of the alphabet susan wheeled to him what is the password she demanded strathmore thought a moment and sighed heavily susan have a seat susan looked as if she could hardly believe her ears have a seat the commander repeated his voice firm let me out susan shot an uneasy glance toward the commanders open office door strathmore eyed the panicked susan fletcher calmly he moved to his office door he stepped out onto the landing and peered into the darkness hale was nowhere to be seen the commander stepped back inside and pulled the door shut then he propped a chair in front to keep it closed went to his desk and removed something from a drawer in the pale glow of the monitors susan saw what he was holding her face went pale it was a gun strathmore pulled two chairs into the middle of the room he rotated them to face the closed office door then he sat he lifted the glittering beretta semiautomatic and aimed steadily at the slightly open door after a moment he laid the gun back in his lap he spoke solemnly susan were safe here we need to talk if greg hale comes through that door he let it hang susan was speechless strathmore gazed at her in the dim light of his office he patted the seat beside him susan sit i have something to tell you she did not move when im done he said ill give you the password to the elevator you can decide whether to leave or not there was a long silence in a daze susan moved across the office and sat next to strathmore susan he began i havent been entirely honest with you chapter david becker felt as if his face had been doused in turpentine and ignited he rolled over on the floor and squinted through bleary tunnel vision at the girl halfway to the revolving doors she was running in short terrified bursts dragging her duffel behind her across the tile becker tried to pull himself to his feet but he could not he was blinded by redhot fire she cant get away he tried to call out but there was no air in his lungs only a sickening pain no he coughed the sound barely left his lips becker knew the second she went through the door she would disappear forever he tried to call out again but his throat was searing the girl had almost reached the revolving door becker staggered to his feet gasping for breath he stumbled after her the girl dashed into the first compartment of the revolving door dragging her duffel behind her twenty yards back becker was staggering blindly toward the door wait he gasped wait the girl pushed furiously on the inside of the door the door began to rotate but then it jammed the blonde wheeled in terror and saw her duffel snagged in the opening she knelt and pulled furiously to free it becker fixed his bleary vision on the fabric protruding through the door as he dove the red corner of nylon protruding from the crack was all he could see he flew toward it arms outstretched as david becker fell toward the door his hands only inches away the fabric slipped into the crack and disappeared his fingers clutched empty air as the door lurched into motion the girl and the duffel tumbled into the street outside megan becker wailed as hit the floor whitehot needles shot through the back of his eye sockets his vision tunneled to nothing and a new wave of nausea rolled in his own voice echoed in the blackness megan david becker wasnt sure how long hed been lying there before he became aware of the hum of fluorescent bulbs overhead everything else was still through the silence came a voice someone was calling he tried to lift his head off the floor the world was cockeyed watery again the voice he squinted down the concourse and saw a figure twenty yards away mister becker recognized the voice it was the girl she was standing at another entrance farther down the concourse clutching her duffel to her chest she looked more frightened now than she had before mister she asked her voice trembling i never told you my name how come you know my name chapter director leland fontaine was a mountain of a man sixtythree years old with a closecropped military haircut and a rigid demeanor his jetblack eyes were like coal when he was irritated which was almost always hed risen through the ranks of the nsa through hard work good planning and the wellearned respect of his predecessors he was the first african american director of the national security agency but nobody ever mentioned the distinction fontaines politics were decidedly colorblind and his staff wisely followed suit fontaine had kept midge and brinkerhoff standing as he went through the silent ritual of making himself a mug of guatemalan java then hed settled at his desk left them standing and questioned them like schoolchildren in the principals office midge did the talkingexplaining the unusual series of events that led them to violate the sanctity of fontaines office a virus the director asked coldly you two think weve got a virus brinkerhoff winced yes sir midge snapped because strathmore bypassed gauntlet fontaine eyed the printout in front of him yes she said and theres a file that hasnt broken in over twenty hours fontaine frowned or so your data says midge was about to protest but she held her tongue instead she went for the throat theres a blackout in crypto fontaine looked up apparently surprised midge confirmed with a curt nod all powers down jabba thought maybe you called jabba yes sir i jabba fontaine stood up furious why the hell didnt you call strathmore we did midge defended he said everything was fine fontaine stood his chest heaving then we have no reason to doubt him there was closure in his voice he took a sip of coffee now if youll excuse me i have work to do midges jaw dropped i beg your pardon brinkerhoff was already headed for the door but midge was cemented in place i said good night ms milken fontaine repeated you are excused butbut sir she stammered i i have to protest i think you protest the director demanded he set down his coffee i protest i protest to your presence in my office i protest to your insinuations that the deputy director of this agency is lying i protest we have a virus sir my instincts tell me well your instincts are wrong ms milken for once theyre wrong midge stood fast but sir commander strathmore bypassed gauntlet fontaine strode toward her barely controlling his anger that is his prerogative i pay you to watch analysts and service employeesnot spy on the deputy director if it werent for him wed still be breaking codes with pencil and paper now leave me he turned to brinkerhoff who stood in the doorway colorless and trembling both of you with all due respect sir midge said id like to recommend we send a syssec team to crypto just to ensure we will do no such thing after a tense beat midge nodded very well goodnight she turned and left as she passed brinkerhoff could see in her eyes that she had no intention of letting this restnot until her intuition was satisfied brinkerhoff gazed across the room at his boss massive and seething behind his desk this was not the director he knew the director he knew was a stickler for detail for neatly tied packages he always encouraged his staff to examine and clarify any inconsistencies in daily procedure no matter how minute and yet here he was asking them to turn their backs on a very bizarre series of coincidences the director was obviously hiding something but brinkerhoff was paid to assist not to question fontaine had proven over and over that he had everyones best interests at heart if assisting him now meant turning a blind eye then so be it unfortunately midge was paid to question and brinkerhoff feared she was headed for crypto to do just that time to get out the resumes brinkerhoff thought as he turned to the door chad fontaine barked from behind him fontaine had seen the look in midges eyes when she left dont let her out of this suite brinkerhoff nodded and hustled after midge fontaine sighed and put his head in his hands his sable eyes were heavy it had been a long unexpected trip home the past month had been one of great anticipation for leland fontaine there were things happening right now at the nsa that would change history and ironically director fontaine had found out about them only by chance three months ago fontaine had gotten news that commander strathmores wife was leaving him hed also heard reports that strathmore was working absurd hours and seemed about to crack under the pressure despite differences of opinion with strathmore on many issues fontaine had always held his deputy director in the highest esteem strathmore was a brilliant man maybe the best the nsa had at the same time ever since the skipjack fiasco strathmore had been under tremendous stress it made fontaine uneasy the commander held a lot of keys around the nsaand fontaine had an agency to protect fontaine needed someone to keep tabs on the wavering strathmore and make sure he was percentbut it was not that simple strathmore was a proud and powerful man fontaine needed a way to check up on the commander without undermining his confidence or authority fontaine decided out of respect for strathmore to do the job himself he had an invisible tap installed on commander strathmores crypto accounthis email his interoffice correspondence his brainstorms all of it if strathmore was going to crack the director would see warning signs in his work but instead of signs of a breakdown fontaine uncovered the ground work for one of the most incredible intelligence schemes hed ever encountered it was no wonder strathmore was busting his ass if he could pull this plan off it would make up for the skipjack fiasco a hundred times over fontaine had concluded strathmore was fine working at percentas sly smart and patriotic as ever the best thing the director could do would be to stand clear and watch the commander work his magic strathmore had devised a plan a plan fontaine had no intention of interrupting chapter strathmore fingered the berretta in his lap even with the rage boiling in his blood he was programmed to think clearly the fact that greg hale had dared lay a finger on susan fletcher sickened him but the fact that it was his own fault made him even sicker susan going into node had been his idea strathmore knew enough to compartmentalize his emotionit could in no way affect his handling of digital fortress he was the deputy director of the national security agency and today his job was more critical than it had ever been strathmore slowed his breathing susan his voice was efficient and unclouded did you delete hales email no she said confused do you have the passkey she shook her head strathmore frowned chewing his lip his mind was racing he had a dilemma he could easily enter his elevator password and susan would be gone but he needed her there he needed her help to find hales passkey strathmore hadnt told her yet but finding that passkey was far more than a matter of academic interestit was an absolute necessity strathmore suspected he could run susans nonconformity search and find the passkey himself but hed already encountered problems running her tracer he was not about to risk it again susan he sighed resolutely id like you to help me find hales passkey what susan stood up her eyes wild strathmore fought off the urge to stand along with her he knew a lot about negotiatingthe position of power was always seated he hoped she would follow suit she did not susan sit down she ignored him sit down it was an order susan remained standing commander if youve still got some burning desire to check out tankados algorithm you can do it alone i want out strathmore hung his head and took a deep breath it was clear she would need an explanation she deserves one he thought strathmore made his decisionsusan fletcher would hear it all he prayed he wasnt making a mistake susan he began it wasnt supposed to come to this he ran his hand across his scalp there are some things i havent told you sometimes a man in my position the commander wavered as if making a painful confession sometimes a man in my position is forced to lie to the people he loves today was one of those days he eyed her sadly what im about to tell you i never planned to have to say to you or to anyone susan felt a chill the commander had a deadly serious look on his face there was obviously some aspect of his agenda to which she was not privy susan sat down there was a long pause as strathmore stared at the ceiling gathering his thoughts susan he finally said his voice frail i have no family he returned his gaze to her i have no marriage to speak of my life has been my love for this country my life has been my work here at the nsa susan listened in silence as you may have guessed he continued i planned to retire soon but i wanted to retire with pride i wanted to retire knowing that id truly made a difference but you have made a difference susan heard herself say you built transltr strathmore didnt seem to hear over the past few years our work here at the nsa has gotten harder and harder weve faced enemies i never imagined would challenge us im talking about our own citizens the lawyers the civil rights fanatics the efftheyve all played a part but its more than that its the people theyve lost faith theyve become paranoid they suddenly see us as the enemy people like you and me people who truly have the nations best interests at heart we find ourselves having to fight for our right to serve our country were no longer peacekeepers were eavesdroppers peeping toms violators of peoples rights strathmore heaved a sigh unfortunately there are naive people in the world people who cant imagine the horrors theyd face if we didnt intervene i truly believe its up to us to save them from their own ignorance susan waited for his point the commander stared wearily at the floor and then looked up susan hear me out he said smiling tenderly at her youll want to stop me but hear me out ive been decrypting tankados email for about two months now as you can imagine i was shocked when i first read his messages to north dakota about an unbreakable algorithm called digital fortress i didnt believe it was possible but every time i intercepted anew message tankado sounded more and more convincing when i read that hed used mutation strings to write a rotating keycode i realized he was lightyears ahead of us it was an approach no one here had never tried why would we susan asked it barely makes sense strathmore stood up and started pacing keeping one eye on the door a few weeks ago when i heard about the digital fortress auction i finally accepted the fact that tankado was serious i knew if he sold his algorithm to a japanese software company we were sunk so i tried to think of any way i could stop him i considered having him killed but with all the publicity surrounding the algorithm and all his recent claims about transltr we would be prime suspects thats when it dawned on me he turned to susan i realized that digital fortress should not be stopped susan stared at him apparently lost strathmore went on i suddenly saw digital fortress as the opportunity of a lifetime it hit me that with a few changes digital fortress could work for us instead of against us susan had never heard anything so absurd digital fortress was an unbreakable algorithm it would destroy them if strathmore continued if i could just make a small modification in the algorithm before it was released he gave her a cunning glint of the eye it took only an instant strathmore saw the amazement register in susans eyes he excitedly explained his plan if i could get the passkey i could unlock our copy of digital fortress and insert a modification a back door susan said forgetting the commander had ever lied to her she felt a surge of anticipation just like skipjack strathmore nodded then we could replace tankados giveaway file on the internet with our altered version because digital fortress is a japanese algorithm no one will ever suspect the nsa had any part in it all we have to do is make the switch susan realized the plan was beyond ingenious it was pure strathmore he planned to facilitate the release of an algorithm the nsa could break full access strathmore said digital fortress will become the encryption standard overnight overnight susan said how do you figure that even if digital fortress becomes available everywhere for free most computer users will stick with their old algorithms for convenience why would they switch to digital fortress strathmore smiled simple we have a security leak the whole world finds out about transltr susans jaw dropped quite simply susan we let the truth hit the street we tell the world that the nsa has a computer that can break every algorithm except digital fortress susan was amazed so everyone jumps ship to digital fortress not knowing we can break it strathmore nodded exactly there was a long silence im sorry i lied to you trying to rewrite digital fortress is a pretty big play i didnt want you involved i understand she replied slowly still reeling from the brilliance of it all youre not a bad liar strathmore chuckled years of practice lying was the only way to keep you out of the loop susan nodded and how big a loop is it youre looking at it susan smiled for the first time in an hour i was afraid youd say that he shrugged once digital fortress is in place ill brief the director susan was impressed strathmores plan was a global intelligence coup the magnitude of which had never before been imagined and hed attempted it singlehandedly it looked like he might pull it off too the passkey was downstairs tankado was dead tankados partner had been located susan paused tankado is dead that seemed very convenient she thought of all the lies that strathmore had told her and felt a sudden chill she looked uneasily at the commander did you kill ensei tankado strathmore looked surprised he shook his head of course not there was no need to kill tankado in fact id prefer he were alive his death could cast suspicion on digital fortress i wanted this switch to go as smoothly and inconspicuously as possible the original plan was to make the switch and let tankado sell his key susan had to admit it made sense tankado would have no reason to suspect the algorithm on the internet was not the original nobody had access to it except himself and north dakota unless tankado went back and studied the programming after it was released hed never know about the back door hed slaved over digital fortress for long enough that hed probably never want to see the programming again susan let it all soak in she suddenly understood the commanders need for privacy in crypto the task at hand was timeconsuming and delicatewriting a concealed back door in a complex algorithm and making an undetected internet switch concealment was of paramount importance the simple suggestion that digital fortress was tainted could ruin the commanders plan only now did she fully grasp why he had decided to let transltr keep running if digital fortress is going to be the nsas new baby strathmore wanted to be sure it was unbreakable still want out he asked susan looked up somehow sitting there in the dark with the great trevor strathmore her fears were swept away rewriting digital fortress was a chance to make historya chance to do incredible goodand strathmore could use her help susan forced a reluctant smile whats our next move strathmore beamed he reached over and put a hand on her shoulder thanks he smiled and then got down to business well go downstairs together he held up his berretta youll search hales terminal ill cover you susan bristled at the thought of going downstairs cant we wait for david to call with tankados copy strathmore shook his head the sooner we make the switch the better we have no guarantees that david will even find the other copy if by some fluke the ring falls into the wrong hands over there id prefer wed already made the algorithm switch that way whoever ends up with the key will download our version of the algorithm strathmore fingered his gun and stood we need to go for hales key susan fell silent the commander had a point they needed hales passkey and they needed it now when susan stood her legs were jittery she wished shed hit hale harder she eyed strathmores weapon and suddenly felt queasy youd actually shoot greg hale no strathmore frowned striding to the door but lets hope he doesnt know that chapter outside the seville airport terminal a taxi sat idle the meter running the passenger in the wirerim glasses gazed through the plateglass windows of the welllit terminal he knew hed arrived in time he could see a blond girl she was helping david becker to a chair becker was apparently in pain he does not yet know pain the passenger thought the girl pulled a small object from her pocket and held it out becker held it up and studied it in the light then he slipped it on his finger he pulled a stack of bills from his pocket and paid the girl they talked a few minutes longer and then the girl hugged him she waved shouldered her duffel and headed off across the concourse at last the man in the taxi thought at last chapter strathmore stepped out of his office onto the landing with his gun leveled susan trailed close behind wondering if hale was still in node the light from strathmores monitor behind them threw eerie shadows of their bodies out across the grated platform susan inched closer to the commander as they moved away from the door the light faded and they were plunged into darkness the only light on the crypto floor came from the stars above and the faint haze from behind the shattered node window strathmore inched forward looking for the place where the narrow staircase began switching the berretta to his left hand he groped for the banister with his right he figured he was probably just as bad a shot with his left and he needed his right for support falling down this particular set of stairs could cripple someone for life and strathmores dreams for his retirement did not involve a wheelchair susan blinded by the blackness of the crypto dome descended with a hand on strathmores shoulder even at the distance of two feet she could not see the commanders outline as she stepped onto each metal tread she shuffled her toes forward looking for the edge susan began having second thoughts about risking a visit to node to get hales passkey the commander insisted hale wouldnt have the guts to touch them but susan wasnt so sure hale was desperate he had two options escape crypto or go to jail a voice kept telling susan they should wait for davids call and use his passkey but she knew there was no guarantee he would even find it she wondered what was taking david so long susan swallowed her apprehension and kept going strathmore descended silently there was no need to alert hale they were coming as they neared the bottom strathmore slowed feeling for the final step when he found it the heel of his loafer clicked on hard black tile susan felt his shoulder tense theyd entered the danger zone hale could be anywhere in the distance now hidden behind transltr was their destinationnode susan prayed hale was still there lying on the floor whimpering in pain like the dog he was strathmore let go of the railing and switched the gun back to his right hand without a word he moved out into the darkness susan held tight to his shoulder if she lost him the only way shed find him again was to speak hale might hear them as they moved away from the safety of the stairs susan recalled latenight games of tag as a kidshed left home base she was in the open she was vulnerable transltr was the only island in the vast black sea every few steps strathmore stopped gun poised and listened the only sound was the faint hum from below susan wanted to pull him back back to safety back to home base there seemed to be faces in the dark all around her halfway to transltr the silence of crypto was broken somewhere in the darkness seemingly right on top of them a highpitched beeping pierced the night strathmore spun and susan lost him fearful susan shot her arm out groping for him but the commander was gone the space where his shoulder had been was now just empty air she staggered forward into the emptiness the beeping noise continued it was nearby susan wheeled in the darkness there was a rustle of clothing and suddenly the beeping stopped susan froze an instant later as if from one of her worst childhood nightmares a vision appeared a face materialized directly in front of her it was ghostly and green it was the face of a demon sharp shadows jutting upward across deformed features she jumped back she turned to run but it grabbed her arm dont move it commanded for an instant she thought she saw hale in those two burning eyes but the voice was not hales and the touch was too soft it was strathmore he was lit from beneath by a glowing object that hed just pulled from his pocket her body sagged with relief she felt herself start breathing again the object in strathmores hand had some sort of electronic led that was giving off a greenish glow damn strathmore cursed under his breath my new pager he stared in disgust at the skypager in his palm hed forgotten to engage the silentring feature ironically hed gone to a local electronics store to buy the device hed paid cash to keep it anonymous nobody knew better than strathmore how closely the nsa watched their ownand the digital messages sent and received from this pager were something strathmore definitely needed to keep private susan looked around uneasily if hale hadnt known they were coming he knew now strathmore pressed a few buttons and read the incoming message he groaned quietly it was more bad news from spainnot from david becker but from the other party strathmore had sent to seville three thousand miles away a mobile surveillance van sped along the darkened seville streets it had been commissioned by the nsa under umbra secrecy from a military base in rota the two men inside were tense it was not the first time theyd received emergency orders from fort meade but the orders didnt usually come from so high up the agent at the wheel called over his shoulder any sign of our man the eyes of his partner never left the feed from the wideangle video monitor on the roof no keep driving chapter underneath the twisting mass of cables jabba was sweating he was still on his back with a penlight clenched in his teeth hed gotten used to working late on weekends the less hectic nsa hours were often the only times he could perform hardware maintenance as he maneuvered the redhot soldering iron through the maze of wires above him he moved with exceptional care singeing any of the dangling sheathes would be disaster just another few inches he thought the job was taking far longer than hed imagined just as he brought the tip of the iron against the final thread of raw solder his cellular phone rang sharply jabba startled his arm twitched and a large glob of sizzling liquefied lead fell on his arm shit he dropped the iron and practically swallowed his penlight shit shit shit he scrubbed furiously at the drop of cooling solder it rolled off leaving an impressive welt the chip he was trying to solder in place fell out and hit him in the head goddamn it jabbas phone summoned him again he ignored it midge he cursed under his breath damn you cryptos fine the phone rang on jabba went back to work reseating the new chip a minute later the chip was in place but his phone was still ringing for christs sake midge give it up the phone rang another fifteen seconds and finally stopped jabba breathed a sigh of relief sixty seconds later the intercom overhead crackled would the chief syssec please contact the main switchboard for a message jabba rolled his eyes in disbelief she just doesnt give up does she he ignored the page chapter strathmore replaced his skypager in his pocket and peered through the darkness toward node he reached for susans hand come on but their fingers never touched there was a long guttural cry from out of the darkness a thundering figure loomeda mack truck bearing down with no headlights an instant later there was a collision and strathmore was skidding across the floor it was hale the pager had given them away susan heard the berretta fall for a moment she was planted in place unsure where to run what to do her instincts told her to escape but she didnt have the elevator code her heart told her to help strathmore but how as she spun in desperation she expected to hear the sounds of a lifeanddeath struggle on the floor but there was nothing everything was suddenly silentas if hale had hit the commander and then disappeared back into the night susan waited straining her eyes into the darkness hoping strathmore wasnt hurt after what seemed like an eternity she whispered commander even as she said it she realized her mistake an instant later hales odor welled up behind her she turned too late without warning she was twisting gasping for air she found herself crushed in a familiar headlock her face against hales chest my balls are killing me hale panted in her ear susans knees buckled the stars in the dome began to spin above her chapter hale clamped down on susans neck and yelled into the darkness commander ive got your sweetheart i want out his demands were met with silence hales grip tightened ill break her neck a gun cocked directly behind them strathmores voice was calm and even let her go susan winced in pain commander hale spun susans body toward the sound you shoot and youll hit your precious susan you ready to take that chance strathmores voice moved closer let her go no way youll kill me im not going to kill anyone oh yeah tell that to chartrukian strathmore moved closer chartrukians dead no shit you killed him i saw it give it up greg strathmore said calmly hale clutched at susan and whispered in her ear strathmore pushed chartrukiani swear it shes not going to fall for your divideandconquer technique strathmore said moving closer let her go hale hissed into the darkness chartrukian was just a kid for christs sake whyd you do it to protect your little secret strathmore stayed cool and what little secret is that you know damnfuckingwell what secret that is digital fortress my my strathmore muttered condescendingly his voice like an iceberg so you do know about digital fortress i was starting to think youd deny that too fuck you a witty defense youre a fool hale spat for your information transltr is overheating really strathmore chuckled let me guessi should open the doors and call in the syssecs exactly hale fired back youd be an idiot not to this time strathmore laughed out loud thats your big play transltrs overheating so open the doors and let us out its true dammit ive been down to the sublevels the aux power isnt pulling enough freon thanks for the tip strathmore said but transltrs got automatic shutdown if its overheating digital fortress will quit all by itself hale sneered youre insane what the fuck do i care if transltr blows the damn machine should be outlawed anyway strathmore sighed child psychology only works on children greg let her go so you can shoot me i wont shoot you i just want the passkey what passkey strathmore sighed again the one tankado sent you i have no idea what youre talking about liar susan managed i saw tankados mail in your account hale went rigid he spun susan around you went in my account and you aborted my tracer she snapped hale felt his blood pressure skyrocket he thought hed covered his tracks he had no idea susan knew what hed done it was no wonder she wasnt buying a word he said hale felt the walls start to close in he knew he could never talk his way out of that onenot in time he whispered to her in desperation susan strathmore killed chartrukian let her go the commander said evenly she doesnt believe you why should she hale fired back you lying bastard youve got her brainwashed you only tell her what suits your needs does she know what you really plan to do with digital fortress and whats that strathmore taunted hale knew what he was about to say would either be his ticket to freedom or his death warrant he took a deep breath and went for broke you plan to write a back door in digital fortress the words met with a bewildered silence from the darkness hale knew he had hit a bullseye apparently strathmores unflappable cool was being put to the test who told you that he demanded his voice rough around the edges i read it hale said smugly trying to capitalize on the change of momentum in one of your brainstorms impossible i never print my brainstorms i know i read it directly off your account strathmore seemed doubtful you got into my office no i snooped you from node hale forced a selfassured chuckle he knew hed need all the negotiating skills hed learned in the marines to get out of crypto alive strathmore edged closer the berretta leveled in the darkness how do you know about my back door i told you i snooped your account impossible hale forced a cocky sneer one of the problems of hiring the best commandersometimes theyre better than you young man strathmore seethed i dont know where you get your information but youre in way over your head you will let ms fletcher go right now or ill call in security and have you thrown in jail for life you wont do it hale stated matteroffactly calling security ruins your plans ill tell them everything hale paused but let me out clean and ill never say a word about digital fortress no deal strathmore fired back i want the passkey i dont have any fucking passkey enough lies strathmore bellowed where is it hale clamped down on susans neck let me out or she dies trevor strathmore had done enough highstakes bargaining in his life to know that hale was in a very dangerous state of mind the young cryptographer had painted himself into a corner and a cornered opponent was always the most dangerous kinddesperate and unpredictable strathmore knew his next move was a critical one susans life depended on itand so did the future of digital fortress strathmore knew the first thing he had to do was release the tension of the situation after a long moment he sighed reluctantly okay greg you win what do you want me to do silence hale seemed momentarily unsure how to handle the commanders cooperative tone he let up a bit on susans neck wwell he stammered his voice wavering suddenly first thing you do is give me your gun youre both coming with me hostages strathmore laughed coldly greg youll have to do better than that there are about a dozen armed guards between here and the parking lot im not a fool hale snapped im taking your elevator susan comes with me you stay i hate to tell you this strathmore replied but theres no power to the elevator bullshit hale snapped the lift runs on power from the main building ive seen the schematics we tried it already susan choked trying to help its dead youre both so full of shit its incredible hale tightened his grip if the elevators dead ill abort transltr and restore power the elevator takes a password susan managed feistily big deal hale laughed im sure the commander will share wont you commander no chance strathmore hissed hale boiled over now you listen to me old manheres the deal you let susan and me out through your elevator we drive a few hours and then i let her go strathmore felt the stakes rising hed gotten susan into this and he needed to get her out his voice stayed steady as a rock what about my plans for digital fortress hale laughed you can write your back doori wont say a word then his voice turned ominous but the day i think youre tracking me i go to the press with the whole story i tell them digital fortress is tainted and i sink this whole fucking organization strathmore considered hales offer it was clean and simple susan lived and digital fortress got its back door as long as strathmore didnt chase hale the back door stayed a secret strathmore knew hale couldnt keep his mouth shut for long but still the knowledge of digital fortress was hales only insurancemaybe hed be smart whatever happened strathmore knew hale could be removed later if necessary make up your mind old man hale taunted are we leaving or not hales arms tightened around susan like a vice strathmore knew that if he picked up the phone right now and called security susan would live hed bet his life on it he could see the scenario clearly the call would take hale completely by surprise he would panic and in the end faced with a small army hale would be unable to act after a brief standoff he would give in but if i call security strathmore thought my plan is ruined hale clamped down again susan cried out in pain whats it gonna be hale yelled do i kill her strathmore considered his options if he let hale take susan out of crypto there were no guarantees hale might drive for a while park in the woods hed have a gun strathmores stomach turned there was no telling what would happen before hale set susan free if he set her free ive got to call security strathmore decided what else can i do he pictured hale in court spilling his guts about digital fortress my plan will be ruined there must be some other way decide hale yelled dragging susan toward the staircase strathmore wasnt listening if saving susan meant his plans were ruined then so be itnothing was worth losing her susan fletcher was a price trevor strathmore refused to pay hale had susans arm twisted behind her back and her neck bent to one side this is your last chance old man give me the gun strathmores mind continued to race searching for another option there are always other options finally he spokequietly almost sadly no greg im sorry i just cant let you go hale choked in apparent shock what im calling security susan gasped commander no hale tightened his grip you call security and she dies strathmore pulled the cellular off his belt and flicked it on greg youre bluffing youll never do it hale yelled ill talk ill ruin your plan youre only hours away from your dream controlling all the data in the world no more transltr no more limitsjust free information its a chance of a lifetime you wont let it slip by strathmore voice was like steel watch me butbut what about susan hale stammered you make that call and she dies strathmore held firm thats a chance im ready to take bullshit youve got a bigger hardon for her than you do for digital fortress i know you you wont risk it susan began to make an angry rebuttal but strathmore beat her to it young man you dont know me i take risks for a living if youre looking to play hardball lets play he started punching keys on his phone you misjudged me son nobody threatens the lives of my employees and walks out he raised the phone and barked into the receiver switchboard get me security hale began to torque susans neck iill kill her i swear it youll do no such thing strathmore proclaimed killing susan will just make things wor he broke off and rammed the phone against his mouth security this is commander trevor strathmore weve got a hostage situation in crypto get some men in here yes now goddamn it we also have a generator failure i want power routed from all available external sources i want all systems online in five minutes greg hale killed one of my junior syssecs hes holding my senior cryptographer hostage youre cleared to use tear gas on all of us if necessary if mr hale doesnt cooperate have snipers shoot him dead ill take full responsibility do it now hale stood motionlessapparently limp in disbelief his grip on susan eased strathmore snapped his phone shut and shoved it back onto his belt your move greg chapter becker stood blearyeyed beside the telephone booth on the terminal concourse despite his burning face and a vague nausea his spirits were soaring it was over truly over he was on his way home the ring on his finger was the grail hed been seeking he held his hand up in the light and squinted at the gold band he couldnt focus well enough to read but the inscription didnt appear to be in english the first symbol was either a q an o or a zero his eyes hurt too much to tell becker studied the first few characters they made no sense this was a matter of national security becker stepped into the phone booth and dialed strathmore before he had finished the international prefix he got a recording todos los circuitos estan ocupados the voice said please hang up and try your call later becker frowned and hung up hed forgotten getting an international connection from spain was like roulette all a matter of timing and luck hed have to try again in a few minutes becker fought to ignore the waning sting of the pepper in his eyes megan had told him rubbing his eyes would only make them worse he couldnt imagine impatient he tried the phone again still no circuits becker couldnt wait any longerhis eyes were on fire he had to flush them with water strathmore would have to wait a minute or two half blind becker made his way toward the bathrooms the blurry image of the cleaning cart was still in front of the mens room so becker turned again toward the door marked damas he thought he heard sounds inside he knocked hola silence probably megan he thought she had five hours to kill before her flight and had said she was going to scrub her arm till it was clean megan he called he knocked again there was no reply becker pushed the door open hello he went in the bathroom appeared empty he shrugged and walked to the sink the sink was still filthy but the water was cold becker felt his pores tighten as he splashed the water in his eyes the pain began to ease and the fog gradually lifted becker eyed himself in the mirror he looked like hed been crying for days he dried his face on the sleeve of his jacket and then it suddenly occurred to him in all the excitement hed forgotten where he was he was at the airport somewhere out thereon the tarmac in one of the seville airports three private hangars there was a learjet waiting to take him home the pilot had stated very clearly i have orders to stay here until you return it was hard to believe becker thought that after all this he had ended up right back where hed started what am i waiting for he laughed im sure the pilot can radio a message to strathmore chuckling to himself becker glanced in the mirror and straightened his tie he was about to go when the reflection of something behind him caught his eye he turned it appeared to be one end of megans duffel protruding from under a partially open stall door megan he called there was no reply megan becker walked over he rapped loudly on the side of the stall no answer he gently pushed the door it swung open becker fought back a cry of horror megan was on the toilet her eyes rolled skyward dead center of her forehead a bullet hole oozed bloody liquid down her face oh jesus becker cried in shock esta muerta a barely human voice croaked behind him shes dead it was like a dream becker turned senor becker the eerie voice asked dazed becker studied the man stepping into the rest room he looked oddly familiar soy hulohot the killer said i am hulohot the misshapen words seemed to emerge from the depths of his stomach hulohot held out his hand el anillo the ring becker stared blankly the man reached in his pocket and produced a gun he raised the weapon and trained it on beckers head el anillo in an instant of clarity becker felt a sensation he had never known as if cued by some subconscious survival instinct every muscle in his body tensed simultaneously he flew through the air as the shot spat out becker crashed down on top of megan a bullet exploded against the wall behind him mierda hulohot seethed somehow at the last possible instant david becker had dived out of the way the assassin advanced becker pulled himself off the lifeless teenager there were approaching footsteps breathing the cock of a weapon adios the man whispered as he lunged like a panther swinging his weapon into the stall the gun went off there was a flash of red but it was no tblood it was something else an object had materialized as if out of nowhere sailing out of the stall and hitting the killer in the chest causing his gun to fire a split second early it was megans duffel becker exploded from the stall he buried his shoulder in the mans chest and drove him back into the sink there was a bonecrushing crash a mirror shattered the gun fell free the two men collapsed to the floor becker tore himself away and dashed for the exit hulohot scrambled for his weapon spun and fired the bullet ripped into the slamming bathroom door the empty expanse of the airport concourse loomed before becker like an uncrossable desert his legs surged beneath him faster than hed ever known they could move as he skidded into the revolving door a shot rang out behind him the glass panel in front of him exploded in a shower of glass becker pushed his shoulder into the frame and the door rotated forward a moment later he stumbled onto the pavement outside a taxi stood waiting dejame entrar becker screamed pounding on the locked door let me in the driver refused his fare with the wirerim glasses had asked him to wait becker turned and saw hulohot streaking across he concourse gun in hand becker eyed his little vespa on the sidewalk im dead hulohot blasted through the revolving doors just in time to see becker trying in vain to kick start his vespa hulohot smiled and raised his weapon the choke becker fumbled with the levers under the gas tank he jumped on the starter again it coughed and died el anillo the ring the voice was close becker looked up he saw the barrel of a gun the chamber was rotating he rammed his foot on the starter once again hulohots shot just missed beckers head as the little bike sprang to life and lurched forward becker hung on for his life as the motorcycle bounced down a grassy embankment and wobbled around the corner of the building onto the runway enraged hulohot raced toward his waiting taxi seconds later the driver lay stunned on the curb watching his taxi peel out in a cloud of dust chapter as the implications of the commanders phone call to security began to settle on the dazed greg hale he found himself weakened by a wave of panic security is coming susan began to slip away hale recovered clutching at her midsection pulling her back let me go she cried her voice echoing though the dome hales mind was in overdrive the commanders call had taken him totally by surprise strathmore phoned security hes sacrificing his plans for digital fortress not in a million years had hale imagined the commander would let digital fortress slip by this back door was the chance of a lifetime as the panic rushed in hales mind seemed to play tricks on him he saw the barrel of strathmores berretta everywhere he looked he began to spin holding susan close trying to deny the commander a shot driven by fear hale dragged susan blindly toward the stairs in five minutes the lights would come on the doors would open and a swat team would pour in youre hurting me susan choked she gasped for breath as she stumbled through hales desperate pirouettes hale considered letting her go and making a mad dash for strathmores elevator but it was suicide he had no password besides once outside the nsa without a hostage hale knew he was as good as dead not even his lotus could outrun a fleet of nsa helicopters susan is the only thing that will keep strathmore from blowing me off the road susan hale blurted dragging her toward the stairs come with me i swear i wont hurt you as susan fought him hale realized he had new problems even if he somehow managed to get strathmores elevator open and take susan with him she would undoubtedly fight him all the way out of the building hale knew full well that strathmores elevator made only one stop the underground highway a restricted labyrinth of underground access tunnels through which nsa powerbrokers moved in secrecy hale had no intention of ending up lost in the basement corridors of the nsa with a struggling hostage it was a death trap even if he got out he realized he had no gun how would he get susan across the parking lot how would he drive it was the voice of one of hales marine militarystrategy professors that gave him his answer force a hand the voice warned and it will fight you but convince a mind to think as you want it to think and you have an ally susan hale heard himself saying strathmores a killer youre in danger here susan didnt seem to hear hale knew it was an absurd angle anyway strathmore would never hurt susan and she knew it hale strained his eyes into the darkness wondering where the commander was hidden strathmore had fallen silent suddenly which made hale even more panicky he sensed his time was up security would arrive at any moment with a surge of strength hale wrapped his arms around susans waist and pulled her hard up the stairs she hooked her heels on the first step and pulled back it was no use hale overpowered her carefully hale backed up the stairs with susan in tow pushing her up might have been easier but the landing at the top was illuminated from strathmores computer monitors if susan went first strathmore would have a clear shot at hales back pulling susan behind him hale had a human shield between himself and the crypto floor about a third of the way up hale sensed movement at the bottom of the stairs strathmores making his move dont try it commander he hissed youll only get her killed hale waited but there was only silence he listened closely nothing the bottom of the stairs was still was he imagining things it didnt matter strathmore would never risk a shot with susan in the way but as hale backed up the stairs dragging susan behind him something unexpected happened there was a faint thud on the landing behind him hale stopped adrenaline surging had strathmore slipped upstairs instinct told him strathmore was at the bottom of the stairs but then suddenly it happened againlouder this time a distinct step on the upper landing in terror hale realized his mistake strathmores on the landing behind me he has a clear shot of my back in desperation he spun susan back to his uphill side and started retreating backwards down the steps as he reached the bottom step he stared wildly up at the landing and yelled back off commander back off or ill break her the butt of a berretta came slicing through the air at the foot of the stairs and crashed down into hales skull as susan tore free of the slumping hale she wheeled in confusion strathmore grabbed her and reeled her in cradling her shaking body shhh he soothed its me youre okay susan was trembling com mander she gasped disoriented i thought i thought you were upstairs i heard easy now he whispered you heard me toss my loafers up onto the landing susan found herself laughing and crying at the same time the commander had just saved her life standing there in the darkness susan felt an overwhelming sense of relief it was not however without guilt security was coming she had foolishly let hale grab her and he had used her against strathmore susan knew the commander had paid a huge price to save her im sorry she said what for your plans for digital fortress theyre ruined strathmore shook his head not at all but but what about security theyll be here any minute we wont have time to securitys not coming susan weve got all the time in the world susan was lost not coming but you phoned strathmore chuckled oldest trick in the book i faked the call chapter beckers vespa was no doubt the smallest vehicle ever to tear down the seville runway its top speed a whining mph sounded more like a chainsaw than a motorcycle and was unfortunately well below the necessary power to become airborne in his side mirror becker saw the taxi swing out onto the darkened runway about four hundred yards back it immediately started gaining becker faced front in the distance the contour of the airplane hangars stood framed against the night sky about a half mile out becker wondered if the taxi would overtake him in that distance he knew susan could do the math in two seconds and calculate his odds becker suddenly felt fear like he had never known he lowered his head and twisted the throttle as far as it would go the vespa was definitely topped out becker guessed the taxi behind him was doing almost ninety twice his speed he set his sights on the three structures looming in the distance the middle one thats where the learjet is a shot rang out the bullet buried itself in the runway yards behind him becker looked back the assassin was hanging out the window taking aim becker swerved and his side mirror exploded in a shower of glass he could feel the impact of the bullet all the way up the handlebars he lay his body flat on the bike god help me im not going to make it the tarmac in front of beckers vespa was growing brighter now the taxi was closing the headlights throwing ghostly shadows down the runway a shot fired the bullet ricocheted off the hull of the bike becker struggled to keep from going into a swerve ive got to make the hangar he wondered if the learjet pilot could see them coming does he have a weapon will he open the cabin doors in time but as becker approached the lit expanse of the open hangars he realized the question was moot the learjet was nowhere to be seen he squinted through blurred vision and prayed he was hallucinating he was not the hangar was bare oh my god wheres the plane as the two vehicles rocketed into the empty hangar becker desperately searched for an escape there was none the buildings rear wall an expansive sheet of corrugated metal had no doors or windows the taxi roared up beside him and becker looked left to see hulohot raising his gun reflex took over becker slammed down on his brakes he barely slowed the hangar floor was slick with oil the vespa went into a headlong skid beside him there was a deafening squeal as the taxis brakes locked and the balding tires hydroplaned on the slippery surface the car spun around in a cloud of smoke and burning rubber only inches to the left of beckers skidding vespa now side by side the two vehicles skimmed out of control on a collision course with the rear of the hangar becker desperately pumped his brakes but there was no traction it was like driving on ice in front of him the metal wall loomed it was coming fast as the taxi spiraled wildly beside him becker faced the wall and braced for the impact there was an earsplitting crash of steel and corrugated metal but there was no pain becker found himself suddenly in the open air still on his vespa bouncing across a grassy field it was as if the hangars back wall had vanished before him the taxi was still beside him careening across the field an enormous sheet of corrugated metal from the hangars back wall billowed off the taxis hood and sailed over beckers head heart racing becker gunned the vespa and took off into the night chapter jabba let out a contented sigh as he finished the last of his solder points he switched off the iron put down his penlight and lay a moment in the darkness of the mainframe computer he was beat his neck hurt internal work was always cramped especially for a man of his size and they just keep building them smaller he mused as he closed his eyes for a welldeserved moment of relaxation someone outside began pulling on his boots jabba get out here a womans voice yelled midge found me he groaned jabba get out here reluctantly he slithered out for the love of god midge i told you but it was not midge jabba looked up surprised soshi soshi kuta was a ninetypound live wire she was jabbas righthand assistant a razorsharp syssec techie from mit she often worked late with jabba and was the one member of his staff who seemed unintimidated by him she glared at him and demanded why the hell didnt you answer your phone or my page your page jabba repeated i thought it was never mind theres something strange going on in the main databank jabba checked his watch strange now he was growing concerned can you be any more specific two minutes later jabba was dashing down the hall toward the databank chapter greg hale lay curled on the node floor strathmore and susan had just dragged him across crypto and bound his hands and feet with twelvegauge printer cable from the node laserprinters susan couldnt get over the artful maneuver the commander had just executed he faked the call somehow strathmore had captured hale saved susan and bought himself the time needed to rewrite digital fortress susan eyed the bound cryptographer uneasily hale was breathing heavily strathmore sat on the couch with the berretta propped awkwardly in his lap susan returned her attention to hales terminal and continued her randomstring search her fourth string search ran its course and came up empty still no luck she sighed we may need to wait for david to find tankados copy strathmore gave her a disapproving look if david fails and tankados key falls into the wrong hands strathmore didnt need to finish susan understood until the digital fortress file on the internet had been replaced with strathmores modified version tankados passkey was dangerous after we make the switch strathmore added i dont care how many passkeys are floating around the more the merrier he motioned for her to continue searching but until then were playing beattheclock susan opened her mouth to acknowledge but her words were drowned out by a sudden deafening blare the silence of crypto was shattered by a warning horn from the sublevels susan and strathmore exchanged startled looks whats that susan yelled timing her question between the intermittent bursts transltr strathmore called back looking troubled its too hot maybe hale was right about the aux power not pulling enough freon what about the autoabort strathmore thought a moment then yelled something must have shorted a yellow siren light spun above the crypto floor and swept a pulsating glare across his face you better abort susan called strathmore nodded there was no telling what would happen if three million silicon processors overheated and decided to ignite strathmore needed to get upstairs to his terminal and abort the digital fortress runparticularly before anyone outside of crypto noticed the trouble and decided to send in the cavalry strathmore shot a glance at the stillunconscious hale he laid the berretta on a table near susan and yelled over the sirens be right back as he disappeared through the hole in the node wall strathmore called over his shoulder and find me that passkey susan eyed the results of her unproductive passkey search and hoped strathmore would hurry up and abort the noise and lights in crypto felt like a missile launch on the floor hale began to stir with each blast of the horn he winced susan surprised herself by grabbing the berretta hale opened his eyes to susan fletcher standing over him with the gun leveled at his crotch wheres the passkey susan demanded hale was having trouble getting his bearings whwhat happened you blew it thats what happened now wheres the passkey hale tried to move his arms but realized he was tied his face became taut with panic let me go i need the passkey susan repeated i dont have it let me go hale tried to getup he could barely roll over susan yelled between blasts of the horn youre north dakota and ensei tankado gave you a copy of his key i need it now youre crazy hale gasped im not north dakota he struggled unsuccessfully to free himself susan charged angrily dont lie to me why the hell is all of north dakotas mail in your account i told you before hale pleaded as the horns blared on i snooped strathmore that email in my account was mail i copied out of strathmores accountemail comint stole from tankado bull you could never snoop the commanders account you dont understand hale yelled there was already a tap on strathmores account hale delivered his words in short bursts between the sirens someone else put the tap there i think it was director fontaine i just piggybacked youve got to believe me thats how i found out about his plan to rewrite digital fortress ive been reading strathmores brainstorms brain storms susan paused strathmore had undoubtedly outlined his plans for digital fortress using his brainstorm software if anyone had snooped the commanders account all the information would have been available rewriting digital fortress is sick hale cried you know damn well what it impliestotal nsa access the sirens blasted drowning him out but hale was possessed you think were ready for that responsibility you think anyone is its fucking shortsighted you say our government has the peoples best interests at heart great but what happens when some future government doesnt have our best interests at heart this technology is forever susan could barely hear him the noise in crypto was deafening hale struggled to get free he looked susan in the eye and kept yelling how the hell do civilians defend themselves against a police state when the guy at the top has access to all their lines of communication how do they plan a revolt susan had heard this argument many times the futuregovernments argument was a stock eff complaint strathmore had to be stopped hale screamed as the sirens blasted i swore id do it thats what ive been doing here all daywatching his account waiting for him to make his move so i could record the switch in progress i needed proofevidence that hed written in a back door thats why i copied all his email into my account it was evidence that hed been watching digital fortress i planned to go to the press with the information susans heart skipped had she heard correctly suddenly this did sound like greg hale was it possible if hale had known about strathmores plan to release a tainted version of digital fortress he could wait until the whole world was using it and then drop his bombshellcomplete with proof susan imagined the headlines cryptographer greg hale unveils secret us plan to control global information was it skipjack all over uncovering an nsa back door again would make greg hale famous beyond his wildest dreams it would also sink the nsa she suddenly found herself wondering if maybe hale was telling the truth no she decided of course not hale continued to plead i aborted your tracer because i thought you were looking for me i thought you suspected strathmore was being snooped i didnt want you to find the leak and trace it back to me it was plausible but unlikely then whyd you kill chartrukian susan snapped i didnt hale screamed over the noise strathmore was the one who pushed him i saw the whole thing from downstairs chartrukian was about to call the syssecs and ruin strathmores plans for the back door hales good susan thought hes got an angle for everything let me go hale begged i didnt do anything didnt do anything susan shouted wondering what was taking strathmore so long you and tankado were holding the nsa hostage at least until you doublecrossed him tell me she pressed did tankado really die of a heart attack or did you have one of your buddies take him out youre so blind hale yelled cant you see im not involved untie me before security gets here securitys not coming she snapped flatly hale turned white what strathmore faked the phone call hales eyes went wide he seemed momentarily paralyzed then he began writhing fiercely strathmorell kill me i know he will i know too much easy greg the sirens blared as hale yelled out but im innocent youre lying and i have proof susan strode around the ring of terminals remember that tracer you aborted she asked arriving at her own terminal i sent it again shall we see if its back yet sure enough on susans screen a blinking icon alerted her that her tracer had returned she palmed her mouse and opened the message this data will seal hales fate she thought hale is north dakota the databox opened hale is susan stopped the tracer materialized and susan stood in stunned silence there had to be some mistake the tracer had fingered someone elsea most unlikely person susan steadied herself on the terminal and reread the databox before her it was the same information strathmore said hed received when he ran the tracer susan had figured strathmore had made a mistake but she knew shed configured the tracer perfectly and yet the information on the screen was unthinkable ndakota etdoshishaedu et susan demanded her head swimming ensei tankado is north dakota it was inconceivable if the data was correct tankado and his partner were the same person susans thoughts were suddenly disconnected she wished the blaring horn would stop why doesnt strathmore turn that damn thing off hale twisted on the floor straining to see susan what does it say tell me susan blocked out hale and the chaos around her ensei tankado is north dakota she reshuffled the pieces trying to make them fit if tankado was north dakota then he was sending email to himself which meant north dakota didnt exist tankados partner was a hoax north dakota is a ghost she said to herself smoke and mirrors the ploy was a brilliant one apparently strathmore had been watching only one side of a tennis match since the ball kept coming back he assumed there was someone on the other side of the net but tankado had been playing against a wall he had been proclaiming the virtues of digital fortress in email hed sent to himself he had written letters sent them to an anonymous remailer and a few hours later the remailer had sent them right back to him now susan realized it was all so obvious tankado had wanted the commander to snoop him hed wanted him to read the email ensei tankado had created an imaginary insurance policy without ever having to trust another soul with his passkey of course to make the whole farce seem authentic tankado had used a secret account just secret enough to allay any suspicions that the whole thing was a setup tankado was his own partner north dakota did not exist ensei tankado was a oneman show a oneman show a terrifying thought gripped susan tankado could have used his fake correspondence to convince strathmore of just about anything she remembered her first reaction when strathmore told her about the unbreakable algorithm shed sworn it was impossible the unsettling potential of the situation settled hard in susans stomach what proof did they actually have that tankado had really created digital fortress only a lot of hype in his email and of course transltr the computer had been locked in an endless loop for almost twenty hours susan knew however that there were other programs that could keep transltr busy that long programs far easier to create than an unbreakable algorithm viruses the chill swept across her body but how could a virus get into transltr like a voice from the grave phil chartrukian gave the answer strathmore bypassed gauntlet in a sickening revelation susan grasped the truth strathmore had downloaded tankados digital fortress file and tried to send it into transltr to break it but gauntlet had rejected the file because it contained dangerous mutation strings normally strathmore would have been concerned but he had seen tankados emailmutation strings are the trick convinced digital fortress was safe to load strathmore bypassed gauntlets filters and sent the file into transltr susan could barely speak there is no digital fortress she choked as the sirens blared on slowly weakly she leaned against her terminal tankado had gone fishing for fools and the nsa had taken the bait then from upstairs came a long cry of anguish it was strathmore chapter trevor strathmore was hunched at his desk when susan arrived breathless at his door his head was down his sweaty head glistening in the light of his monitor the horns on the sublevels blared susan raced over to his desk commander strathmore didnt move commander weve got to shut down transltr weve got a he got us strathmore said without looking up tankado fooled us all she could tell by the tone of his voice he understood all of tankados hype about the unbreakable algorithm auctioning off the passkeyit was all an act a charade tankado had tricked the nsa into snooping his mail tricked them into believing he had a partner and tricked them into downloading a very dangerous file the mutation strings strathmore faltered i know the commander looked up slowly the file i downloaded off the internet it was a susan tried to stay calm all the pieces in the game had shifted there had never been any unbreakable algorithmnever any digital fortress the file tankado had posted on the internet was an encrypted virus probably sealed with some generic massmarket encryption algorithm strong enough to keep everyone out of harms wayeveryone except the nsa transltr had cracked the protective seal and released the virus the mutation strings the commander croaked tankado said they were just part of the algorithm strathmore collapsed back onto his desk susan understood the commanders pain he had been completely taken in tankado had never intended to let any computer company buy his algorithm there was no algorithm the whole thing was a charade digital fortress was a ghost a farce a piece of bait created to tempt the nsa every move strathmore had made tankado had been behind the scenes pulling the strings i bypassed gauntlet the commander groaned you didnt know strathmore pounded his fist on his desk i should have known his screen name for christs sake ndakota look at it what do you mean hes laughing at us its a goddamn anagram susan puzzled a moment ndakota is an anagram she pictured the letters and began reshuffling them in her mind ndakota kadotan oktadan tandoka her knees went weak strathmore was right it was as plain as day how could they have missed it north dakota wasnt a reference to the us state at allit was tankado rubbing salt in the wound hed even sent the nsa a warning a blatant clue that he himself was ndakota the letters spelled tankado but the best codebreakers in the world had missed it just as he had planned tankado was mocking us strathmore said youve got to abort transltr susan declared strathmore stared blankly at the wall commander shut it down god only knows whats going on in there i tried strathmore whispered sounding as faint as shed ever heard him what do you mean you tried strathmore rotated his screen toward her his monitor had dimmed to a strange shade of maroon at the bottom the dialogue box showed numerous attempts to shut down transltr they were all followed by the same response sorry unable to abort sorry unable to abort sorry unable to abort susan felt a chill unable to abort but why she feared she already knew the answer so this is tankados revenge destroying transltr for years ensei tankado had wanted the world to know about transltr but no one had believed him so hed decided to destroy the great beast himself hed fought to the death for what he believedthe individuals right to privacy downstairs the sirens blared weve got to kill all power susan demanded now susan knew that if they hurried they could save the great parallel processing machine every computer in the worldfrom radio shack pcs to nasas satellite control systemshad a builtin failsafe for situations like this it wasnt a glamorous fix but it always worked it was known as pulling the plug by shutting off the remaining power in crypto they could force transltr to shut down they could remove the virus later it would be a simple matter of reformatting transltrs hard drives reformatting would completely erase the computers memorydata programming virus everything in most cases reformatting resulted in the loss of thousands of files sometimes years of work but transltr was differentit could be reformatted with virtually no loss at all parallel processing machines were designed to think not to remember nothing was actually stored inside transltr once it broke a code it sent the results to the nsas main databank in order to susan froze in a stark instant of realization she brought her hand to her mouth and muffled a scream the main databank strathmore stared into the darkness his voice disembodied hed apparently already made this realization yes susan the main databank susan nodded blankly tankado used transltr to put a virus in our main databank strathmore motioned sickly to his monitor susan returned her gaze to the screen in front of her and looked beneath the dialogue box across the bottom of the screen were the words tell the world about transltr only the truth will save you now susan felt cold the nations most classified information was stored at the nsa military communication protocols sigint confirmation codes identities of foreign spies blueprints for advanced weaponry digitized documents trade agreementsthe list was unending tankado wouldnt dare she declared corrupting a countrys classified records susan couldnt believe even ensei tankado would dare attack the nsa databank she stared at his message only the truth will save you now the truth she asked the truth about what strathmore was breathing heavily transltr he croaked the truth about transltr susan nodded it made perfect sense tankado was forcing the nsa to tell the world about transltr it was blackmail after all he was giving the nsa a choiceeither tell the world about transltr or lose your databank she stared in awe at the text before her at the bottom of the screen a single line was blinked menacingly enter pass key staring at the pulsating words susan understoodthe virus the passkey tankados ring the ingenious blackmail plot the passkey had nothing to do with unlocking an algorithm it was an antidote the passkey stopped the virus susan had read a lot about viruses like thisdeadly programs that included a builtin cure a secret key that could be used to deactivate them tankado never planned to destroy the nsa databankhe just wanted us go public with transltr then he would give us the passkey so we could stop the virus it was now clear to susan that tankados plan had gone terribly wrong he had not planned on dying hed planned on sitting in a spanish bar and listening to the cnn press conference about americas topsecret codebreaking computer then hed planned on calling strathmore reading the passkey off the ring and saving the databank in the nick of time after a good laugh hed disappear into oblivion an eff hero susan pounded her fist on the desk we need that ring its the only passkey she now understoodthere was no north dakota no second passkey even if the nsa went public with transltr tankado was no longer around to save the day strathmore was silent the situation was more serious than susan had ever imagined the most shocking thing of all was that tankado had allowed it to go this far he had obviously known what would happen if the nsa didnt get the ringand yet in his final seconds of life hed given the ring away he had deliberately tried to keep it from them then again susan realized what could she expect tankado to dosave the ring for them when he thought the nsa had killed him still susan couldnt believe that tankado would have allowed this to happen he was a pacifist he didnt want to wreak destruction all he wanted was to set the record straight this was about transltr this was about everyones right to keep a secret this was about letting the world know that the nsa was listening deleting the nsas databank was an act of aggression susan could not imagine ensei tankado committing the sirens pulled her back to reality susan eyed the debilitated commander and knew what he was thinking not only were his plans for a back door in digital fortress shot but his carelessness had put the nsa on the brink of what could turn out to be the worst security disaster in us history commander this is not your fault she insisted over the blare of the horns if tankado hadnt died wed have bargaining powerwed have options but commander strathmore heard nothing his life was over hed spent thirty years serving his country this was supposed to be his moment of glory his piece de resistanceaback door in the world encryption standard but instead he had sent a virus into the main databank of the national security agency there was no way to stop itnot without killing power and erasing every last one of the billions of bytes of irretrievable data only the ring could save them and if david hadnt found the ring by now i need to shut down transltr susan took control im going down to the sublevels to throw the circuit breaker strathmore turned slowly to face her he was a broken man ill do it he croaked he stood up stumbling as he tried to slide out from behind his desk susan sat him back down no she barked im going her tone left no room for debate strathmore put his face in his hands okay bottom floor beside the freon pumps susan spun and headed for the door halfway there she turned and looked back commander she yelled this is not over were not beaten yet if david finds the ring in time we can save the databank strathmore said nothing call the databank susan ordered warn them about the virus youre the deputy director of the nsa youre a survivor in slow motion strathmore looked up like a man making the decision of a lifetime he gave her a tragic nod determined susan tore into the darkness chapter the vespa lurched into the slow lane of the carretera de huelva it was almost dawn but there was plenty of trafficyoung sevillians returning from their allnight beach verbenas a van of teenagers laid on its horn and flew by beckers motorcycle felt like a toy out there on the freeway a quarter of a mile back a demolished taxi swerved out onto the freeway in a shower of sparks as it accelerated it sideswiped a peugeot and sent it careening onto the grassy median becker passed a freeway marker sevilla centro km if he could just reach the cover of downtown he knew he might have a chance his speedometer read kilometers per hour two minutes to the exit he knew he didnt have that long somewhere behind him the taxi was gaining becker gazed out at the nearing lights of downtown seville and prayed he would reach them alive he was only halfway to the exit when the sound of scraping metal loomed up behind him he hunched on his bike wrenching the throttle as far as it would go there was a muffled gunshot and a bullet sailed by becker cut left weaving back and forth across the lanes in hopes of buying more time it was no use the exit ramp was still three hundred yards when the taxi roared to within a few car lengths behind him becker knew that in a matter of seconds he would be either shot or run down he scanned ahead for any possible escape but the highway was bounded on both sides by steep gravel slopes another shot rang out becker made his decision in a scream of rubber and sparks he leaned violently to his right and swerved off the road the bikes tires hit the bottom of the embankment becker strained to keep his balance as the vespa threw up a cloud of gravel and began fishtailing its way up the slope the wheels spun wildly clawing at the loose earth the little engine whimpered pathetically as it tried to dig in becker urged it on hoping it wouldnt stall he didnt dare look behind him certain at any moment the taxi would be skidding to a stop bullets flying the bullets never came beckers bike broke over the crest of the hill and he saw itthe centro the downtown lights spread out before him like a starfilled sky he gunned his way through some underbrush and out over the curb his vespa suddenly felt faster the avenue luis montoto seemed to race beneath his tires the soccer stadium zipped past on the left he was in the clear it was then that becker heard the familiar screech of metal on concrete he looked up a hundred yards ahead of him the taxi came roaring up the exit ramp it skidded out onto luis montoto and accelerated directly toward him becker knew he should have felt a surge of panic but he did not he knew exactly where he was going he swerved left on menendez pelayo and opened the throttle the bike lurched across a small park and into the cobblestoned corridor of mateus gagothe narrow oneway street that led to the portal of barrio santa cruz just a little farther he thought the taxi followed thundering closer it trailed becker through the gateway of santa cruz ripping off its side mirror on the narrow archway becker knew he had won santa cruz was the oldest section of seville it had no roads between the buildings only mazes of narrow walkways built in roman times they were only wide enough for pedestrians and the occasional moped becker had once been lost for hours in the narrow caverns as becker accelerated down the final stretch of mateus gago sevilles eleventhcentury gothic cathedral rose like a mountain before him directly beside it the giralda tower shot feet skyward into the breaking dawn this was santa cruz home to the second largest cathedral in the world as well as sevilles oldest most pious catholic families becker sped across the stone square there was a single shot but it was too late becker and his motorcycle disappeared down a tiny passagewaycallita de la virgen chapter the headlight of beckers vespa threw stark shadows on the walls of the narrow passageways he struggled with the gear shift and roared between the whitewashed buildings giving the inhabitants of santa cruz an early wakeup call this sunday morning it had been less than thirty minutes since beckers escape from the airport hed been on the run ever since his mind grappling with endless questions whos trying to kill me whats so special about this ring where is the nsa jet he thought of megan dead in the stall and the nausea crept back becker had hoped to cut directly across the barrio and exit on the other side but santa cruz was a bewildering labyrinth of alleyways it was peppered with false starts and dead ends becker quickly became disoriented he looked up for the tower of the giralda to get his bearings but the surrounding walls were so high he could see nothing except a thin slit of breaking dawn above him becker wondered where the man in wirerim glasses was he knew better than to think the assailant had given up the killer probably was after him on foot becker struggled to maneuver his vespa around tight corners the sputtering of the engine echoed up and down the alleys becker knew he was an easy target in the silence of santa cruz at this point all he had in his favor was speed got to get to the other side after a long series of turns and straightaways becker skidded into a threeway intersection marked esquina de los reyes he knew he was in troublehe had been there already as he stood straddling the idling bike trying to decide which way to turn the engine sputtered to a stop the gas gauge read vacio as if on cue a shadow appeared down an alley on his left the human mind is the fastest computer in existence in the next fraction of a second beckers mind registered the shape of the mans glasses searched his memory for a match found one registered danger and requested a decision he got one he dropped the useless bike and took off at a full sprint unfortunately for becker hulohot was now on solid ground rather than in a lurching taxi he calmly raised his weapon and fired the bullet caught becker in the side just as he stumbled around the corner out of range he took five or six strides before the sensation began to register at first it felt like a muscle pull just above the hip then it turned to a warm tingling when becker saw the blood he knew there was no pain no pain anywhere just a headlong race through the winding maze of santa cruz hulohot dashed after his quarry he had been tempted to hit becker in the head but he was a professional he played the odds becker was a moving target and aiming at his midsection provided the greatest margin of error both vertically and horizontally the odds had paid off becker had shifted at the last instant and rather than missing his head hulohot had caught a piece of his side although he knew the bullet had barely grazed becker and would do no lasting damage the shot had served its purpose contact had been made the prey had been touched by death it was a whole new game becker raced forward blindly turning winding staying out of the straightaways the footsteps behind him seemed relentless beckers mind was blank blank to everythingwhere he was who was chasing himall that was left was instinct self preservation no pain only fear and raw energy a shot exploded against the azulejo tile behind him shards of glass sprayed across the back of his neck he stumbled left into another alley he heard himself call for help but except for the sound of footsteps and strained breathing the morning air remained deathly still beckers side was burning now he feared he was leaving a crimson trail on the whitewashed walks he searched everywhere for an open door an open gate any escape from the suffocating canyons nothing the walkway narrowed socorro beckers voice was barely audible help the walls grew closer on each side the walkway curved becker searched for an intersection a tributary any way out the passageway narrowed locked doors narrowing locked gates the footsteps were closing he was in a straightaway and suddenly the alley began to slope upward steeper becker felt his legs straining he was slowing and then he was there like a freeway that had run out of funding the alley just stopped there was a high wall a wooden bench and nothing else no escape becker looked up three stories to the top of the building and then spun and started back down the long alley but he had only taken a few steps before he stopped short at the foot of the inclined straightaway a figure appeared the man moved toward becker with a measured determination in his hand a gun glinted in the early morning sun becker felt a sudden lucidity as he backed up toward the wall the pain in his side suddenly registered he touched the spot and looked down there was blood smeared across his fingers and across ensei tankados golden ring he felt dizzy he stared at the engraved band puzzled hed forgotten he was wearing it hed forgotten why he had come to seville he looked up at the figure approaching he looked down at the ring was this why megan had died was this why he would die the shadow advanced up the inclined passageway becker saw walls on all sidesa dead end behind him a few gated entryways between them but it was too late to call for help becker pressed his back against the dead end suddenly he could feel every piece of grit beneath the soles of his shoes every bump in the stucco wall behind him his mind was reeling backward his childhood his parents susan oh god susan for the first time since he was a kid becker prayed he did not pray for deliverance from death he did not believe in miracles instead he prayed that the woman he left behind would find strength that she would know without a doubt that she had been loved he closed his eyes the memories came like a torrent they were not memories of department meetings university business and the things that made up percent of his life they were memories of her simple memories teaching her to use chopsticks sailing on cape cod i love you he thought know that forever it was as if every defense every facade every insecure exaggeration of his life had been stripped away he was standing nakedflesh and bones before god i am a man he thought and in a moment of irony he thought a man without wax he stood eyes closed as the man in wirerim glasses drew nearer somewhere nearby a bell began to toll becker waited in darkness for the sound that would end his life chapter the morning sun was just breaking over the seville rooftops and shining down into the canyons below the bells atop the giralda cried out for sunrise mass this was the moment inhabitants had all been waiting for everywhere in the ancient barrio gates opened and families poured into the alleyways like lifeblood through the veins of old santa cruz they coursed toward the heart of their pueblo toward the core of their history toward their god their shrine their cathedral somewhere in beckers mind a bell was tolling am i dead almost reluctantly he opened his eyes and squinted into the first rays of sunlight he knew exactly where he was he leveled his gaze and searched the alley for his assailant but the man in wirerims was not there instead there were others spanish families in their finest clothes stepping from their gated portals into the alleyways talking laughing at the bottom of the alley hidden from beckers view hulohot cursed in frustration at first there had been only a single couple separating him from his quarry hulohot had been certain they would leave but the sound of the bells kept reverberating down the alley drawing others from their homes a second couple with children they greeted each another talking laughing kissing three times on the cheek another group appeared and hulohot could no longer see his prey now in a boiling rage he raced into the quickly growing crowd he had to get to david becker the killer fought his way toward the end of the alley he found himself momentarily lost in a sea of bodiescoats and ties black dresses lace mantles over hunched women they all seemed oblivious to hulohots presence they strolled casually all in black shuffling moving as one blocking his way hulohot dug his way through the crowd and dashed up the alley into the dead end his weapon raised then he let out a muted inhuman scream david becker was gone becker stumbled and sidestepped his way through the crowd follow the crowd he thought they know the way out he cut right at the intersection and the alley widened everywhere gates were opening and people were pouring out the pealing of the bells grew louder beckers side was still burning but he sensed the bleeding had stopped he raced on somewhere behind him closing fast was a man with a gun becker ducked in and out of the groups of churchgoers and tried to keep his head down it was not much farther he could sense it the crowd had thickened the alley had widened they were no longer in a little tributary this was the main river as he rounded a bend becker suddenly saw it rising before themthe cathedral and giralda tower the bells were deafening the reverberations trapped in the highwalled plaza the crowds converged everyone in black pushing across the square toward the gaping doors of the seville cathedral becker tried to break away toward mateus gago but he was trapped he was shoulder to shoulder heel to toe with the shoving throngs the spaniards had always had a different idea of closeness than the rest of the world becker was wedged between two heavyset women both with their eyes closed letting the crowd carry them they mumbled prayers to themselves and clutched rosary beads in their fingers as the crowd closed on the enormous stone structure becker tried to cut left again but the current was stronger now the anticipation the pushing and shoving the blind mumbled prayers he turned into the crowd trying to fight backward against the eager throngs it was impossible like swimming upstream in a miledeep river he turned the cathedral doors loomed before himlike the opening to some dark carnival ride he wished he hadnt taken david becker suddenly realized he was going to church chapter the crypto sirens were blaring strathmore had no idea how long susan had been gone he sat alone in the shadows the drone of transltr calling to him youre a survivor youre a survivor yes he thought im a survivorbut survival is nothing without honor id rather die than live in the shadow of disgrace and disgrace was what was waiting for him he had kept information from the director he had sent a virus into the nations most secure computer there was no doubt he would be hung out to dry his intentions had been patriotic but nothing had gone as hed planned there had been death and treachery there would be trials accusations public outrage he had served his country with honor and integrity for so many years he couldnt allow it to end this way im a survivor he thought youre a liar his own thoughts replied it was true he was a liar there were people he hadnt been honest with susan fletcher was one of them there were so many things he hadnt told herthings he was now desperately ashamed of for years shed been his illusion his living fantasy he dreamed of her at night he cried out for her in his sleep he couldnt help it she was as brilliant and as beautiful as any woman he could imagine his wife had tried to be patient but when she finally met susan she immediately lost hope bev strathmore never blamed her husband for his feelings she tried to endure the pain as long as possible but recently it had become too much shed told him their marriage was ending another womans shadow was no place to spend the rest of her life gradually the sirens lifted strathmore from his daze his analytical powers searched for any way out his mind reluctantly confirmed what his heart had suspected there was only one true escape only one solution strathmore gazed down at the keyboard and began typing he didnt bother to turn the monitor so he could see it his fingers pecked out the words slowly and decisively dearest friends i am taking my life today this way no one would ever wonder there would be no questions there would be no accusations he would spell out for the world what had happened many had died but there was still one life to take chapter in a cathedral it is always night the warmth of the day turns to damp coolness the traffic is silenced behind thick granite walls no number of candelabras can illuminate the vast darkness overhead shadows fall everywhere theres only the stained glass high above filtering the ugliness of the outside world into rays of muted reds and blues the seville cathedral like all great cathedrals of europe is laid out in the shape of a cross the sanctuary and altar are located just above the midpoint and open downward onto the main sanctuary wooden pews fill the vertical axis a staggering yards from the altar to the base of the cross to the left and right of the altar the transept of the cross houses confessionals sacred tombs and additional seating becker found himself wedged in the middle of a long pew about halfway back overhead in the dizzying empty space a silver censer the size of a refrigerator swung enormous arcs on a frayed rope leaving a trail of frankincense the bells of the giralda kept ringing sending low rumbling shock waves through the stone becker lowered his gaze to the gilded wall behind the altar he had a lot to be thankful for he was breathing he was alive it was a miracle as the priest prepared to give the opening prayer becker checked his side there was a red stain on his shirt but the bleeding had stopped the wound was small more of a laceration than a puncture becker tucked his shirt back in and craned his neck behind him the doors were cranking shut he knew if hed been followed he was now trapped the seville cathedral had a single functional entrance a design popularized in the days when churches were used as fortresses a safe haven against moorish invasion with a single entrance there was only one door to barricade now the single entrance had another functionit ensured all tourists entering the cathedral had purchased a ticket the twentytwofoothigh gilded doors slammed with a decisive crash becker was sealed in the house of god he closed his eyes and slid low in his pew he was the only one in the building not dressed in black somewhere voices began to chant toward the back of the church a figure moved slowly up the side aisle keeping to the shadows he had slipped in just before the doors closed he smiled to himself the hunt was getting interesting becker is here i can feel it he moved methodically one row at a time overhead the frankincense decanter swung its long lazy arcs a fine place to die hulohot thought i hope i do as well becker knelt on the cold cathedral floor and ducked his head out of sight the man seated next to him glared downit was most irregular behavior in the house of god enfermo becker apologized sick becker knew he had to stay low he had glimpsed a familiar silhouette moving up the side aisle its him hes here despite being in the middle of an enormous congregation becker feared he was an easy targethis khaki blazer was like a roadside flare in the crowd of black he considered removing it but the white oxford shirt underneath was no better instead he huddled lower the man beside him frowned turista he grunted then he whispered half sarcastically llamo un medico shall i call a doctor becker looked up at the old mans moleridden face no gracias estoy bien the man gave him an angry look pues sientate then sit down there were scattered shushes around them and the old man bit his tongue and faced front becker closed his eyes and huddled lower wondering how long the service would last becker raised protestant had always had the impression catholics were longwinded he prayed it was trueas soon as the service ended he would be forced to stand and let the others out in khaki he was dead becker knew he had no choice at the moment he simply knelt there on the cold stone floor of the great cathedral eventually the old man lost interest the congregation was standing now singing a hymn becker stayed down his legs were starting to cramp there was no room to stretch them patience he thought patience he closed his eyes and took a deep breath it felt like only minutes later that becker felt someone kicking him he looked up the molefaced man was standing to his right waiting impatiently to leave the pew becker panicked he wants to leave already ill have to stand up becker motioned for the man to step over him the man could barely control his anger he grabbed the tails of his black blazer pulled them down in a huff and leaned back to reveal the entire row of people waiting to leave becker looked left and saw that the woman who had been seated there was gone the length of pew to his left was empty all the way to the center aisle the service cant be over its impossible we just got here but when becker saw the altar boy at the end of the row and the two singlefile lines moving up the center aisle toward the altar he knew what was happening communion he groaned the damn spaniards do it first chapter susan climbed down the ladder into the sublevels thick steam was now boiling up around transltrs hull the catwalks were wet with condensation she almost fell her flats providing very little traction she wondered how much longer transltr would survive the sirens continued their intermittent warning the emergency lights spun in twosecond intervals three stories below the aux generators shook in a taxed whine susan knew somewhere at the bottom in the foggy dimness there was a circuit breaker she sensed time was running out upstairs strathmore held the beretta in his hand he reread his note and laid it on the floor of the room where he was standing what he was about to do was a cowardly act there was no doubt im a survivor he thought he thought of the virus in the nsa databank he thought of david becker in spain he thought of his plans for a back door he had told so many lies he was guilty of so much he knew this was the only way to avoid accountability the only way to avoid the shame carefully he aimed the gun then he closed his eyes and pulled the trigger susan had only descended six flights when she heard the muffled shot it was far off barely audible over the generators she had never heard a gunshot except on television but she had no doubt what it was she stopped short the sound resounding in her ears in a wave of horror she feared the worst she pictured the commanders dreamsthe back door in digital fortress the incredible coup it would have been she pictured the virus in the databank his failing marriage that eerie nod he had given her her footing faltered she spun on the landing grappling for the banister commander no susan was momentarily frozen her mind blank the echo of the gunshot seemed to drown out the chaos around her her mind told her to keep on going but her legs refused commander an instant later she found herself stumbling back up the stairs entirely forgetting the danger around her she ran blindly slipping on the slick metal above her the humidity fell like rain when she reached the ladder and began climbing she felt herself lifted from below by a tremendous surge of steam that practically jettisoned her through the trapdoor she rolled onto the crypto floor and felt the cool air wash over her her white blouse clung to her body soaked through it was dark susan paused trying to get her bearings the sound of the gunshot was on endless loop in her head hot steam billowed up through the trapdoor like gases from a volcano about to explode susan cursed herself for leaving the beretta with strathmore she had left it with him hadnt she or was it in node as her eyes adjusted to the dark she glanced toward the gaping hole in the node wall the glow from the monitors was faint but in the distance she could see hale lying motionless on the floor where shed left him there was no sign of strathmore terrified of what shed find she turned toward the commanders office but as she began to move something registered as strange she backpedaled a few steps and peered into node again in the soft light she could see hales arm it was not at his side he was no longer tied like a mummy his arm was up over his head he was sprawled backward on the floor had he gotten free there was no movement hale was deathly still susan gazed up at strathmores workstation perched high on the wall commander silence tentatively she moved toward node there was an object in hales hand it glimmered in the light of the monitors susan moved closer closer suddenly she could see what hale was holding it was the beretta susan gasped following the arch of hales arm her eyes moved to his face what she saw was grotesque half of greg hales head was soaked in blood the dark stain had spread out across the carpet oh my god susan staggered backward it wasnt the commanders shot shed heard it was hales as if in a trance susan moved toward the body apparently hale had managed to free himself the printer cables were piled on the floor beside him i must have left the gun on the couch she thought the blood flowing through the hole in his skull looked black in the bluish light on the floor beside hale was a piece of paper susan went over unsteadily and picked it up it was a letter dearest friends i am taking my life today in penance for the following sins in utter disbelief susan stared at the suicide note in her hand she read slowly it was surrealso unlike halea laundry list of crimes he was admitting to everythingfiguring out that ndakota was a hoax hiring a mercenary to kill ensei tankado and take the ring pushing phil chartrukian planning to sell digital fortress susan reached the final line she was not prepared for what she read the letters final words delivered a numbing blow above all im truly sorry about david becker forgive me i was blinded by ambition as susan stood trembling over hales body the sound of running footsteps approached behind her in slow motion she turned strathmore appeared in the broken window pale and out of breath he stared down at hales body in apparent shock oh my god he said what happened chapter communion hulohot spotted becker immediately the khaki blazer was impossible to miss particularly with the small bloodstain on one side the jacket was moving up the center aisle in a sea of black he must not know im here hulohot smiled hes a dead man he fanned the tiny metal contacts on his fingertips eager to tell his american contact the good news soon he thought very soon like a predator moving downwind hulohot moved to the back of the church then he began his approachstraight up the center aisle hulohot was in no mood to track becker through the crowds leaving the church his quarry was trapped a fortunate turn of events hulohot just needed a way to eliminate him quietly his silencer the best money could buy emitted no more than a tiny spitting cough that would be fine as hulohot closed on the khaki blazer he was unaware of the quiet murmurs coming from those he was passing the congregation could understand this mans excitement to receive the blessing of god but nevertheless there were strict rules of protocoltwo lines single file hulohot kept moving he was closing quickly he thumbed the revolver in his jacket pocket the moment had arrived david becker had been exceptionally fortunate so far there was no need to tempt fortune any further the khaki blazer was only ten people ahead facing front head down hulohot rehearsed the kill in his mind the image was clearcutting in behind becker keeping the gun low and out of sight firing two shots into beckers back becker slumping hulohot catching him and helping him into a pew like a concerned friend then hulohot would move quickly to the back of the church as if going for help in the confusion he would disappear before anyone knew what had happened five people four three hulohot fingered the gun in his pocket keeping it low he would fire from hip level upward into beckers spine that way the bullet would hit either the spine or a lung before finding the heart even if the bullet missed the heart becker would die a punctured lung was fatal maybe not in more medically advanced parts of the world but in spain it was fatal two people one and then hulohot was there like a dancer performing a wellrehearsed move he turned to his right he laid his hand on the shoulder of the khaki blazer aimed the gun and fired two muffled spats instantly the body was rigid then it was falling hulohot caught his victim under the armpits in a single motion he swung the body into a pew before any bloodstains spread across his back nearby people turned hulohot paid no heedhe would be gone in an instant he groped the mans lifeless fingers for the ring nothing he felt again the fingers were bare hulohot spun the man around angrily the horror was instantaneous the face was not david beckers rafael de la maza a banker from the suburbs of seville had died almost instantly he was still clutching the pesetas the strange american had paid him for a cheap black blazer chapter midge milken stood fuming at the water cooler near the entrance to the conference room what the hell is fontaine doing she crumpled her paper cup and threw it forcefully into the trash can theres something happening in crypto i can feel it midge knew there was only one way to prove herself right shed go check out crypto herselftrack down jabba if need be she spun on her heel and headed for the door brinkerhoff appeared out of nowhere blocking her way where are you headed home midge lied brinkerhoff refused to let her pass midge glared fontaine told you not to let me out didnt he brinkerhoff looked away chad im telling you theres something happening in cryptosomething big i dont know why fontaines playing dumb but transltrs in trouble something is not right down there tonight midge he soothed walking past her toward the curtained conference room windows lets let the director handle it midges gaze sharpened do you have any idea what happens to transltr if the cooling system fails brinkerhoff shrugged and approached the window powers probably back online by now anyway he pulled apart the curtains and looked still dark midge asked but brinkerhoff did not reply he was spellbound the scene below in the crypto dome was unimaginable the entire glass cupola was filled with spinning lights flashing strobes and swirling steam brinkerhoff stood transfixed teetering lightheaded against the glass then in a frenzy of panic he raced out director director chapter the blood of christ the cup of salvation people gathered around the slumped body in the pew overhead the frankincense swung its peaceful arcs hulohot wheeled wildly in the center aisle and scanned the church hes got to be here he spun back toward the altar thirty rows ahead holy communion was proceeding uninterrupted padre gustaphes herrera the head chalice bearer glanced curiously at the quiet commotion in one of the center pews he was not concerned sometimes some of the older folks were overcome by the holy spirit and passed out a little air usually did the trick meanwhile hulohot was searching frantically becker was nowhere in sight a hundred or so people were kneeling at the long altar receiving communion hulohot wondered if becker was one of them he scanned their backs he was prepared to shoot from fifty yards away and make a dash for it el cuerpo de jesus el pan del cielo the young priest serving becker communion gave him a disapproving stare he could understand the strangers eagerness to receive communion but it was no excuse to cut inline becker bowed his head and chewed the wafer as best he could he sensed something was happening behind him some sort of disturbance he thought of the man from whom hed bought the jacket and hoped he had listened to his warning and not taken beckers in exchange he started to turn and look but he feared the wirerim glasses would be staring back he crouched in hopes his black jacket was covering the back of his khaki pants it was not the chalice was coming quickly from his right people were already swallowing their wine crossing themselves and standing to leave slow down becker was in no hurry to leave the altar but with two thousand people waiting for communion and only eight priests serving it was considered bad form to linger over a sip of wine the chalice was just to the right of becker when hulohot spotted the mismatched khaki pants estas ya muerto he hissed softly youre already dead hulohot moved up the center aisle the time for subtlety had passed two shots in the back and he would grab the ring and run the biggest taxi stand in seville was half a block away on mateus gago he reached for his weapon adios senor becker la sangre de cristo la copa de la salvacion the thick scent of red wine filled beckers nostrils as padre herrera lowered the handpolished silver chalice little early for drinking becker thought as he leaned forward but as the silver goblet dropped past eye level there was a blur of movement a figure coming fast his shape warped in the reflection of the cup becker saw a flash of metal a weapon being drawn instantly unconsciously like a runner from a starting block at the sound of a gun becker was vaulting forward the priest fell back in horror as the chalice sailed through the air and red wine rained down on white marble priests and altar boys went scattering as becker dove over the communion rail a silencer coughed out a single shot becker landed hard and the shot exploded in the marble floor beside him an instant later he was tumbling down three granite stairs into the valle a narrow passageway through which the clergy entered allowing them to rise onto the altar as if by divine grace at the bottom of the steps he stumbled and dove becker felt himself sliding out of control across the slick polished stone a dagger of pain shot though his gut as he landed on his side a moment later he was stumbling through a curtained entryway and down a set of wooden stairs pain becker was running through a dressing room it was dark there were screams from the altar loud footsteps in pursuit becker burst through a set of double doors and stumbled into some sort of study it was dark furnished with rich orientals and polished mahogany on the far wall was a lifesize crucifix becker staggered to a stop dead end he was at the tip of the cross he could hear hulohot closing fast becker stared at the crucifix and cursed his bad luck goddamn it he screamed there was the sudden sound of breaking glass to beckers left he wheeled a man in red robes gasped and turned to eye becker in horror like a cat caught with a canary the holy man wiped his mouth and tried to hide the broken bottle of holy communion wine at his feet salida becker demanded salida let me out cardinal guerra reacted on instinct a demon had entered his sacred chambers screaming for deliverance from the house of god guerra would grant him that wishimmediately the demon had entered at a most inopportune moment pale the cardinal pointed to a curtain on the wall to his left hidden behind the curtain was a door hed installed it three years ago it led directly to the courtyard outside the cardinal had grown tired of exiting the church through the front door like a common sinner chapter susan was wet and shivering huddled on the node couch strathmore draped his suit coat over her shoulders hales body lay a few yards away the sirens blared like ice thawing on a frozen pond transltrs hull let out a sharp crack im going down to kill power strathmore said laying a reassuring hand on her shoulder ill be right back susan stared absently after the commander as he dashed across the crypto floor he was no longer the catatonic man shed seen ten minutes before commander trevor strathmore was backlogical controlled doing whatever was necessary to get the job done the final words of hales suicide note ran through her mind like a train out of control above all im truly sorry about david becker forgive me i was blinded by ambition susan fletchers nightmare had just been confirmed david was in danger or worse maybe it was already too late im truly sorry about david becker she stared at the note hale hadnt even signed ithed just typed his name at the bottom greg hale hed poured out his guts pressed print and then shot himselfjust like that hale had sworn hed never go back to prison hed kept his vowhed chosen death instead david she sobbed david at that moment ten feet below the crypto floor commander strathmore stepped off the ladder onto the first landing it had been a day of fiascoes what had started out as a patriotic mission had swerved wildly out of control the commander had been forced to make impossible decisions commit horrific actsacts hed never imagined himself capable of it was a solution it was the only damn solution there was duty to think of country and honor strathmore knew there was still time he could shut down transltr he could use the ring to save the countrys most valuable databank yes he thought there was still time strathmore looked out over the disaster around him the overhead sprinklers were on transltr was groaning the sirens blared the spinning lights looked like helicopters closing in through dense fog with every step all he could see was greg halethe young cryptographer gazing up his eyes pleading and then the shot hales death was for country for honor the nsa could not afford another scandal strathmore needed a scapegoat besides greg hale was a disaster waiting to happen strathmores thoughts were jarred free by the sound of his cellular it was barely audible over the sirens and hissing fumes he snatched it off his belt without breaking stride speak wheres my passkey a familiar voice demanded who is this strathmore yelled over the din its numataka the angry voice bellowed back you promised me a passkey strathmore kept moving i want digital fortress numataka hissed there is no digital fortress strathmore shot back what there is no unbreakable algorithm of course there is ive seen it on the internet my people have been trying to unlock it for days its an encrypted virus you fooland youre damn lucky you cant open it but the deal is off strathmore yelled im not north dakota there is no north dakota forget i ever mentioned it he clamped the cellular shut turned off the ringer and rammed it back on his belt there would be no more interruptions twelve thousand miles away tokugen numataka stood stunned at his plateglass window his umami cigar hung limply in his mouth the deal of his lifetime had just disintegrated before his eyes strathmore kept descending the deal is off numatech corp would never get the unbreakable algorithm and the nsa would never get its back door strathmores dream had been a long time in the planninghed chosen numatech carefully numatech was wealthy a likely winner of the passkey auction no one would think twice if it ended up with the key conveniently there was no company less likely to be suspected of consorting with the us government tokugen numataka was oldworld japandeath before dishonor he hated americans he hated their food he hated their customs and most of all he hated their grip on the worlds software market strathmores vision had been bolda world encryption standard with a back door for the nsa hed longed to share his dream with susan to carry it out with her by his side but he knew he could not even though ensei tankados death would save thousands of lives in the future susan would never have agreed she was a pacifist im a pacifist too thought strathmore i just dont have the luxury of acting like one there had never been any doubt in the commanders mind who would kill tankado tankado was in spainand spain meant hulohot the fortytwoyearold portuguese mercenary was one of the commanders favorite pros hed been working for the nsa for years born and raised in lisbon hulohot had done work for the nsa all over europe never once had his kills been traced back to fort meade the only catch was that hulohot was deaf telephone communication was impossible recently strathmore had arranged for hulohot to receive the nsas newest toy the monocle computer strathmore bought himself a skypager and programmed it to the same frequency from that moment on his communication with hulohot was not only instantaneous but also entirely untraceable the first message strathmore had sent hulohot left little room for misunderstanding they had already discussed it kill ensei tankado obtain passkey strathmore never asked how hulohot worked his magic but somehow he had done it again ensei tankado was dead and the authorities were convinced it was a heart attack a textbook killexcept for one thing hulohot had misjudged the location apparently tankado dying in a public place was a necessary part of the illusion but unexpectedly the public had appeared too soon hulohot was forced into hiding before he could search the body for the passkey when the dust settled tankados body was in the hands of sevilles coroner strathmore was furious hulohot had blown a mission for the first time everand hed picked an inauspicious time to do it getting tankados passkey was critical but strathmore knew that sending a deaf assassin into the seville morgue was a suicide mission he had pondered his other options a second scheme began to materialize strathmore suddenly saw a chance to win on two frontsa chance to realize two dreams instead of just one at sixthirty that morning he had called david becker chapter fontaine burst into the conference room at a full sprint brinkerhoff and midge were close at his heels look midge choked motioning frantically to the window fontaine looked out the window at the strobes in the crypto dome his eyes went wide this was definitely not part of the plan brinkerhoff sputtered its a goddamn disco down there fontaine stared out trying to make sense of it in the few years transltr had been operational it had never done this its overheating he thought he wondered why the hell strathmore hadnt shut it down it took fontaine only an instant to make up his mind he snatched an interoffice phone off the conference table and punched the extension for crypto the receiver began beeping as if the extension were out of order fontaine slammed down the receiver damn it he immediately picked up again and dialed strathmores private cellular line this time the line began to ring six rings went by brinkerhoff and midge watched as fontaine paced the length of his phone cable like a tiger on a chain after a full minute fontaine was crimson with rage he slammed down the receiver again unbelievable he bellowed cryptos about to blow and strathmore wont answer his goddamn phone chapter hulohot burst out of cardinal guerras chambers into the blinding morning sun he shielded his eyes and cursed he was standing outside the cathedral in a small patio bordered by a high stone wall the west face of the giralda tower and two wroughtiron fences the gate was open outside the gate was the square it was empty the walls of santa cruz were in the distance there was no way becker could have made it so far so quickly hulohot turned and scanned the patio hes in here he must be the patio jardin de los naranjos was famous in seville for its twenty blossoming orange trees the trees were renowned in seville as the birthplace of english marmalade an eighteenthcentury english trader had purchased three dozen bushels of oranges from the seville church and taken them back to london only to find the fruit inedibly bitter he tried to make jam from the rinds and ended up having to add pounds of sugar just to make it palatable orange marmalade had been born hulohot moved forward through the grove gun leveled the trees were old and the foliage had moved high on their trunks their lowest branches were unreachable and the thin bases provided no cover hulohot quickly saw the patio was empty he looked straight up the giralda the entrance to the giraldas spiral staircase was cordoned off by a rope and small wooden sign the rope hung motionless hulohots eyes climbed the foot tower and immediately knew it was a ridiculous thought there was no way becker would have been that stupid the single staircase wound straight up to a square stone cubicle there were narrow slits in the wall for viewing but there was no way out david becker climbed the last of the steep stairs and staggered breathless into a tiny stone cubicle there were high walls all around him and narrow slits in the perimeter no exit fate had done becker no favors this morning as hed dashed from the cathedral into the open courtyard his jacket had caught on the door the fabric had stopped him mid stride and swung him hard left before tearing becker was suddenly stumbling off balance into the blinding sun when hed looked up he was heading straight for a staircase hed jumped over the rope and dashed up by the time he realized where it led it was too late now he stood in the confined cell and caught his breath his side burned narrow slats of morning sun streamed through the openings in the wall he looked out the man in the wirerim glasses was far below his back to becker staring out at the plaza becker shifted his body in front of the crack for a better view cross the plaza he willed him the shadow of the giralda lay across the square like a giant felled sequoia hulohot stared the length of it at the far end three slits of light cut through the towers viewing apertures and fell in crisp rectangles on the cobblestone below one of those rectangles had just been blotted out by the shadow of a man without so much as a glance toward the top of the tower hulohot spun and dashed toward the giralda stairs chapter fontaine pounded his fist into his hand he paced the conference room and stared out at the spinning crypto lights abort goddamn it abort midge appeared in the doorway waving a fresh readout director strathmore cant abort what brinkerhoff and fontaine gasped in unison he tried sir midge held up the report four times already transltrs locked in some sort of endless loop fontaine spun and stared back out the window jesus christ the conference room phone rang sharply the director threw up his arms its got to be strathmore about goddamn time brinkerhoff scooped up the phone directors office fontaine held out his hand for the receiver brinkerhoff looked uneasy and turned to midge its jabba he wants you the director swung his gaze over to midge who was already crossing the room she activated the speaker phone go ahead jabba jabbas metallic voice boomed into the room midge im in the main databank were showing some strange stuff down here i was wondering if dammit jabba midge came unglued thats what ive been trying to tell you it could be nothing jabba hedged but stop saying that its not nothing whatevers going on down there take it seriously very seriously my data isnt friednever has been never will she started to hang up and then added oh and jabba just so there arent any surprises strathmore bypassed gauntlet chapter hulohot took the giralda stairs three at a time the only light in the spiral passage was from small openair windows every degrees hes trapped david becker will die hulohot circled upward gun drawn he kept to the outside wall in case becker decided to attack from above the iron candle poles on each landing would make good weapons if becker decided to use one but by staying wide hulohot would be able to spot him in time hulohots gun had a range significantly longer than a fivefoot candle pole hulohot moved quickly but carefully the stairs were steep tourists had died here this was not americano safety signs no handrails no insurance disclaimers this was spain if you were stupid enough to fall it was your own damn fault regardless of who built the stairs hulohot paused at one of the shoulderhigh openings and glanced out he was on the north face and from the looks of things about halfway up the opening to the viewing platform was visible around the corner the staircase to the top was empty david becker had not challenged him hulohot realized maybe becker had not seen him enter the tower that meant the element of surprise was on hulohots side as wellnot that hed need it hulohot held all the cards even the layout of the tower was in his favor the staircase met the viewing platform in the southwest cornerhulohot would have a clear line of fire to every point of the cell with no possibility that becker could get behind him and to top things off hulohot would be moving out of the dark into the light a killing box he mused hulohot measured the distance to the doorway seven steps he practiced the kill in his mind if he stayed right as he approached the opening he would be able to see the leftmost corner of the platform before he reached it if becker was there hulohot would fire if not he would shift inside and enter moving east facing the right corner the only place remaining that becker could be he smiled subject david beckerterminated the time had come he checked his weapon with a violent surge hulohot dashed up the platform swung into view the left corner was empty as rehearsed hulohot shifted inside and burst through the opening facing right he fired into the corner the bullet ricocheted back off the bare wall and barely missed him hulohot wheeled wildly and let out a muted scream there was no one there david becker had vanished three flights below suspended feet over the jardin de los naranjos david becker hung on the outside of the giralda like a man doing chinups on a window ledge as hulohot had been racing up the staircase becker had descended three flights and lowered himself out one of the openings hed dropped out of sight just in time the killer had run right by him hed been in too much of a hurry to notice the white knuckles grasping the window ledge hanging outside the window becker thanked god that his daily squash routine involved twenty minutes on the nautilus machine to develop his biceps for a harder overhead serve unfortunately despite his strong arms becker was now having trouble pulling himself back in his shoulders burned his side felt as if it were tearing open the roughcut stone ledge provided little grip grating into his fingertips like broken glass becker knew it was only a matter of seconds before his assailant would come running down from above from the higher ground the killer would undoubtedly see beckers fingers on the ledge becker closed his eyes and pulled he knew he would need a miracle to escape death his fingers were losing their leverage he glanced down past his dangling legs the drop was the length of a football field to the orange trees below unsurvivable the pain in his side was getting worse footsteps now thundered above him loud leaping footsteps rushing down the stairs becker closed his eyes it was now or never he gritted his teeth and pulled the stone tore against the skin on his wrists as he yanked himself upward the footsteps were coming fast becker grappled at the inside of the opening trying to secure his hold he kicked his feet his body felt like lead as if someone had a rope tied to his legs and were pulling him down he fought it he surged up onto his elbows he was in plain view now his head half through the window like a man in a guillotine he wriggled his legs kicking himself into the opening he was halfway through his torso now hung into the stairwell the footsteps were close becker grabbed the sides of the opening and in a single motion launched his body through he hit the staircase hard hulohot sensed beckers body hit the floor just below him he leapt forward gun leveled a window spun into view this is it hulohot moved to the outside wall and aimed down the staircase beckers legs dashed out of sight just around the curve hulohot fired in frustration the bullet ricocheted down the stairwell as hulohot dashed down the stairs after his prey he kept to the outside wall for the widest angle view as the staircase revolved into view before him it seemed becker was always degrees ahead of him just out of sight becker had taken the inside track cutting off the angle and leaping four or five stairs at a time hulohot stayed with him it would take only a single shot hulohot was gaining he knew that even if becker made the bottom there was nowhere to run hulohot could shoot him in the back as he crossed the open patio the desperate race spiraled downward hulohot moved inside to the faster track he sensed he was gaining he could see beckers shadow every time they passed an opening down down spiraling it seemed that becker was always just around the corner hulohot kept one eye on his shadow and one eye on the stairs suddenly it appeared to hulohot that beckers shadow had stumbled it made an erratic lurch left and then seemed to spin in midair and sail back toward the center of the stairwell hulohot leapt forward ive got him on the stairs in front of hulohot there was a flash of steel it jabbed into the air from around the corner it thrust forward like a fencers foil at ankle level hulohot tried to shift left but it was too late the object was between his ankles his back foot came forward caught it hard and the post slammed across his shin hulohots arms went out for support but found only empty air he was abruptly airborne turning on his side as hulohot sailed downward he passed over david becker prone on his stomach arms outstretched the candle pole in his hands was now caught up in hulohots legs as he spun downward hulohot crashed into the outside wall before he hit the staircase when he finally found the floor he was tumbling his gun clattered to the floor hulohots body kept going head over heels he spiraled five complete degree rotations before he rolled to a stop twelve more steps and he would have tumbled out onto the patio chapter david becker had never held a gun but he was holding one now hulohots body was twisted and mangled in the darkness of the giralda staircase becker pressed the barrel of the gun against his assailants temple and carefully knelt down one twitch and becker would fire but there was no twitch hulohot was dead becker dropped the gun and collapsed on the stairs for the first time in ages he felt tears well up he fought them he knew there would be time for emotion later now it was time to go home becker tried to stand but he was too tired to move he sat a long while exhausted on the stone staircase absently he studied the twisted body before him the killers eyes began to glaze over gazing out at nothing in particular somehow his glasses were still intact they were odd glasses becker thought with a wire protruding from behind the earpiece and leading to a pack of some sort on his belt becker was too exhausted to be curious as he sat alone in the staircase and collected his thoughts becker shifted his gaze to the ring on his finger his vision had cleared somewhat and he could finally read the inscription as he had suspected it was not english he stared at the engraving along moment and then frowned this is worth killing for the morning sun was blinding when becker finally stepped out of the giralda onto the patio the pain in his side had subsided and his vision was returning to normal he stood a moment in a daze enjoying the fragrance of the orange blossoms then he began moving slowly across the patio as becker strode away from the tower a van skidded to a stop nearby two men jumped out they were young and dressed in military fatigues they advanced on becker with the stiff precision of welltuned machines david becker one demanded becker stopped short amazed they knew his name who who are you come with us please right away there was something unreal about the encountersomething that made beckers nerve endings start to tingle again he found himself backing away from them the shorter man gave becker an icy stare this way mr becker right now becker turned to run but he only took one step one of the men drew a weapon there was a shot a searing lance of pain erupted in beckers chest it rocketed to his skull his fingers went stiff and becker fell an instant later there was nothing but blackness chapter strathmore reached the transltr floor and stepped off the catwalk into an inch of water the giant computer shuddered beside him huge droplets of water fell like rain through the swirling mist the warning horns sounded like thunder the commander looked across at the failed main generators phil chartrukian was there his charred remains splayed across a set of coolant fins the scene looked like some sort of perverse halloween display although strathmore regretted the mans death there was no doubt it had been a warranted casualty phil chartrukian had left strathmore no choice when the syssec came racing up from the depths screaming about a virus strathmore met him on the landing and tried to talk sense to him but chartrukian was beyond reason weve got a virus im calling jabba when he tried to push past the commander blocked his way the landing was narrow they struggled the railing was low it was ironic strathmore thought that chartrukian had been right about the virus all along the mans plunge had been chillinga momentary howl of terror and then silence but it was not half as chilling as the next thing commander strathmore saw greg hale was staring up at him from the shadows below a look of utter horror on his face it was then that strathmore knew greg hale would die transltr crackled and strathmore turned his attention back to the task at hand kill power the circuit breaker was on the other side of the freon pumps to the left of the body strathmore could see it clearly all he had to do was pull a lever and the remaining power in crypto would die then after a few seconds he could restart the main generators all doorways and functions would comeback online the freon would start flowing again and transltr would be safe but as strathmore slogged toward the breaker he realized there was one final obstacle chartrukians body was still on the main generators cooling fins killing and then restarting the main generator would only cause another power failure the body had to be moved strathmore eyed the grotesque remains and made his way over reaching up he grabbed a wrist the flesh was like styrofoam the tissue had been fried the whole body was devoid of moisture the commander closed his eyes tightened his grip around the wrist and pulled the body slid an inch or two strathmore pulled harder the body slid again the commander braced himself and pulled with all his might suddenly he was tumbling backward he landed hard on his backside up against a power casement struggling to sit up in the rising water strathmore stared down in horror at the object in his fist it was chartrukians forearm it had broken off at the elbow upstairs susan continued her wait she sat on the node couch feeling paralyzed hale lay at her feet she couldnt imagine what was taking the commander so long minutes passed she tried to push david from her thoughts but it was no use with every blast of the horns hales words echoed inside her head im truly sorry about david becker susan thought she would lose her mind she was about to jump up and race onto the crypto floor when finally it happened strathmore had thrown the switch and killed all power the silence that engulfed crypto was instantaneous the horns choked off mid blare and the node monitors flickered to black greg hales corpse disappeared into the darkness and susan instinctively yanked her legs up onto the couch she wrapped strathmores suit coat around her darkness silence she had never heard such quiet in crypto thered always been the low hum of the generators but now there was nothing only the great beast heaving and sighing in relief crackling hissing slowly cooling down susan closed her eyes and prayed for david her prayer was a simple onethat god protect the man she loved not being a religious woman susan had never expected to hear a response to her prayer but when there was a sudden shuddering against her chest she jolted upright she clutched her chest a moment later she understood the vibrations she felt were not the hand of god at allthey were coming from the commanders jacket pocket he had set the vibrating silentring feature on his skypager someone was sending commander strathmore a message six stories below strathmore stood at the circuit breaker the sublevels of crypto were now as dark as the deepest night he stood a moment enjoying the blackness the water poured down from above it was a midnight storm strathmore tilted his head back and let the warm droplets wash away his guilt im a survivor he knelt and washed the last of chartrukians flesh from his hands his dreams for digital fortress had failed he could accept that susan was all that mattered now for the first time in decades he truly understood that there was more to life than country and honor i sacrificed the best years of my life for country and honor but what about love he had deprived himself for far too long and for what to watch some young professor steal away his dreams strathmore had nurtured susan he had protected her he had earned her and now at last he would have her susan would seek shelter in his arms when there was nowhere else to turn she would come to him helpless wounded by loss and in time he would show her that love heals all honor country love david becker was about to die for all three chapter the commander rose through the trapdoor like lazarus back from the dead despite his soggy clothes his step was light he strode toward node toward susan toward his future the crypto floor was again bathed in light freon was flowing downward through the smoldering transltr like oxygenated blood strathmore knew it would take a few minutes for the coolant to reach the bottom of the hull and prevent the lowest processors from igniting but he was certain hed acted in time he exhaled in victory never suspecting the truththat it was already too late im a survivor he thought ignoring the gaping hole in the node wall he strode to the electronic doors they hissed open he stepped inside susan was standing before him damp and tousled in his blazer she looked like a freshman coed whod been caught in the rain he felt like the senior whod lent her his varsity sweater for the first time in years he felt young his dream was coming true but as strathmore moved closer he felt he was staring into the eyes of a woman he did not recognize her gaze was like ice the softness was gone susan fletcher stood rigid like an immovable statue the only perceptible motion were the tears welling in her eyes susan a single tear rolled down her quivering cheek what is it the commander pleaded the puddle of blood beneath hales body had spread across the carpet like an oil spill strathmore glanced uneasily at the corpse then back at susan could she possibly know there was no way strathmore knew he had covered every base susan he said stepping closer what is it susan did not move are you worried about david there was a slight quiver in her upper lip strathmore stepped closer he was going to reach for her but he hesitated the sound of davids name had apparently cracked the dam of grief slowly at firsta quiver a tremble and then a thundering wave of misery seemed to course through her veins barely able to control her shuddering lips susan opened her mouth to speak nothing came without ever breaking the icy gaze shed locked on strathmore she took her hand from the pocket of his blazer in her hand was an object she held it out shaking strathmore half expected to look down and see the beretta leveled at his gut but the gun was still on the floor propped safely in hales hand the object susan was holding was smaller strathmore stared down at it and an instant later he understood as strathmore stared reality warped and time slowed to a crawl he could hear the sound of his own heart the man who had triumphed over giants for so many years had been outdone in an instant slain by loveby his own foolishness in a simple act of chivalry he had given susan his jacket and with it his skypager now it was strathmore who went rigid susans hand was shaking the pager fell at hales feet with a look of astonishment and betrayal that strathmore would never forget susan fletcher raced past him out of node the commander let her go in slow motion he bent and retrieved the pager there were no new messagessusan had read them all strathmore scrolled desperately through the list subject ensei tankadoterminated subject pierre clouchardeterminated subject hans huberterminated subject rocio eva granadaterminated the list went on strathmore felt a wave of horror i can explain she will understand honor country but there was one message he had not yet seenone message he could never explain trembling he scrolled to the final transmission subject david beckerterminated strathmore hung his head his dream was over chapter susan staggered out of node subject david beckerterminated as if in a dream she moved toward cryptos main exit greg hales voice echoed in her mind susan strathmores going to kill me susan the commanders in love with you susan reached the enormous circular portal and began stabbing desperately at the keypad the door did not move she tried again but the enormous slab refused to rotate susan let out a muted screamapparently the power outage had deleted the exit codes she was still trapped without warning two arms closed around her from behind grasping her halfnumb body the touch was familiar yet repulsive it lacked the brute strength of greg hale but there was a desperate roughness to it an inner determination like steel susan turned the man restraining her was desolate frightened it was a face she had never seen susan strathmore begged holding her i can explain she tried to pull away the commander held fast susan tried to scream but she had no voice she tried to run but strong hands restrained her pulling her backward i love you the voice was whispering ive loved you forever susans stomach turned over and over stay with me susans mind whirled with grisly imagesdavids brightgreen eyes slowly closing for the last time greg hales corpse seeping blood onto the carpet phil chartrukians burned and broken on the generators the pain will pass the voice said youll love again susan heard nothing stay with me the voice pleaded ill heal your wounds she struggled helpless i did it for us were made for each other susan i love you the words flowed as if he had waited a decade to speak them i love you i love you in that instant thirty yards away as if rebutting strathmores vile confession transltr let out a savage pitiless hiss the sound was an entirely new onea distant ominous sizzling that seemed to grow like a serpent in the depths of the silo the freon it appeared had not reached its mark in time the commander let go of susan and turned toward the billion computer his eyes went wide with dread no he grabbed his head no the sixstory rocket began to tremble strathmore staggered a faltering step toward the thundering hull then he fell to his knees a sinner before an angry god it was no use at the base of the silo transltrs titaniumstrontium processors had just ignited chapter a fireball racing upward through three million silicon chips makes a unique sound the crackling of a forest fire the howling of a tornado the steaming gush of a geyser all trapped within a reverberant hull it was the devils breath pouring through a sealed cavern looking for escape strathmore knelt transfixed by the horrific noise rising toward them the worlds most expensive computer was about to become an eightstory inferno in slow motion strathmore turned back toward susan she stood paralyzed beside the crypto door strathmore stared at her tearstreaked face she seemed to shimmer in the fluorescent light shes an angel he thought he searched her eyes for heaven but all he could see was death it was the death of trust love and honor were gone the fantasy that had kept him going all these years was dead he would never have susan fletcher never the sudden emptiness that gripped him was overwhelming susan gazed vaguely toward transltr she knew that trapped within the ceramic shell a fireball was racing toward them she sensed it rising faster and faster feeding on the oxygen released by the burning chips in moments the crypto dome would be a blazing inferno susans mind told her to run but davids dead weight pressed down all around her she thought she heard his voice calling to her telling her to escape but there was nowhere to go crypto was a sealed tomb it didnt matter the thought of death did not frighten her death would stop the pain she would be with david the crypto floor began to tremble as if below it an angry sea monster were rising out of the depths davids voice seemed to be calling run susan run strathmore was moving toward her now his face a distant memory his cool gray eyes were lifeless the patriot who had lived in her mind a hero had dieda murderer his arms were suddenly around her again clutching desperately he kissed her cheeks forgive me he begged susan tried to pull away but strathmore held on transltr began vibrating like a missile preparing to launch the crypto floor began to shake strathmore held tighter hold me susan i need you a violent surge of fury filled susans limbs davids voice called out again i love you escape in a sudden burst of energy susan tore free the roar from transltr became deafening the fire was at the silos peak transltr groaned straining at its seams davids voice seemed to lift susan guide her she dashed across the crypto floor and started up strathmores catwalk stairs behind her transltr let out a deafening roar as the last of the silicon chips disintegrated a tremendous updraft of heat tore through the upper casing of the silo and sent shards of ceramic thirty feet into the air instantly the oxygenrich air of crypto rushed in to fill the enormous vacuum susan reached the upper landing and grabbed the banister when the tremendous rush of wind ripped at her body it spun her around in time to see the deputy director of operations far below staring up at her from beside transltr there was a storm raging all around him and yet there was peace in his eyes his lips parted and he mouthed his final word susan the air rushing into transltr ignited on contact in a brilliant flash of light commander trevor strathmore passed from man to silhouette to legend when the blast hit susan it blew her back fifteen feet into strathmores office all she remembered was a searing heat chapter in the window of the directors conference room high above the crypto dome three faces appeared breathless the explosion had shaken the entire nsa complex leland fontaine chad brinkerhoff and midge milken all stared out in silent horror seventy feet below the crypto dome was blazing the polycarbonate roof was still intact but beneath the transparent shell a fire raged black smoke swirled like fog inside the dome the three stared down without a word the spectacle had an eerie grandeur to it fontaine stood a long moment he finally spoke his voice faint but unwavering midge get a crew down there now across the suite fontaines phone began to ring it was jabba chapter susan had no idea how much time had passed a burning in her throat pulled her to her senses disoriented she studied her surroundings she was on a carpet behind a desk the only light in the room was a strange orange flickering the air smelled of burning plastic the room she was standing in was not really a room at all it was a devastated shell the curtains were on fire and the plexiglas walls were smoldering then she remembered it all david in a rising panic she pulled herself to her feet the air felt caustic in her windpipe she stumbled to the doorway looking for away out as she crossed the threshold her leg swung out over an abyss she grabbed the door frame just in time the catwalk had disappeared fifty feet below was a twisted collapse of steaming metal susan scanned the crypto floor in horror it was a sea of fire the melted remains of three million silicon chips had erupted from transltr like lava thick acrid smoke billowed upward susan knew the smell silicon smoke deadly poison retreating into the remains of strathmores office she began to feel faint her throat burned the entire place was filled with a fiery light crypto was dying so will i she thought for a moment she considered the only possible exitstrathmores elevator but she knew it was useless the electronics never would have survived the blast but as susan made her way through the thickening smoke she recalled hales words the elevator runs on power from the main building ive seen the schematics susan knew that was true she also knew the entire shaft was encased in reinforced concrete the fumes swirled all around her she stumbled through the smoke toward the elevator door but when she got there she saw that the elevators call button was dark susan jabbed fruitlessly at the darkened panel then she fell to her knees and pounded on the door she stopped almost instantly something was whirring behind the doors startled she looked up it sounded like the carriage was right there susan stabbed at the button again again a whirring behind the doors suddenly she saw it the call button was not deadit had just been covered with black soot it now glowed faintly beneath her smudged fingerprints theres power with a surge of hope she punched at the button over and over something behind the doors engaged she could hear the ventilation fan in the elevator car the carriage is here why wont the damn doors open through the smoke she spied the tiny secondary keypadlettered buttons a through z in a wave of despair susan remembered the password the smoke was starting to curl in through the melted window frames again she banged on the elevator doors they refused to open the password she thought strathmore never told me the password silicon smoke was now filling the office choking susan fell against the elevator in defeat the ventilation fan was running just a few feet away she lay there dazed gulping for air she closed her eyes but again davids voice woke her escape susan open the door escape she opened her eyes expecting to see his face those wild green eyes that playful smile but the letters az came into focus the password susan stared at the letters on the keypad she could barely keep them in focus on the led below the keypad five empty spots awaited entry a fivecharacter password she thought she instantly knew the odds twentysix to the fifth power possible choices at one guess every second it would take nineteen weeks as susan fletcher lay choking on the floor beneath the keypad the commanders pathetic voice came to her he was calling to her again i love you susan ive always loved you susan susan susan she knew he was dead and yet his voice was relentless she heard her name over and over susan susan then in a moment of chilling clarity she knew trembling weakly she reached up to the keypad and typed the password s u s a n an instant later the doors slid open chapter strathmores elevator dropped fast inside the carriage susan sucked deep breaths of fresh air into her lungs dazed she steadied herself against the wall as the car slowed to a stop a moment later some gears clicked and the conveyor began moving again this time horizontally susan felt the carriage accelerate as it began rumbling toward the main nsa complex finally it whirred to a stop and the doors opened coughing susan fletcher stumbled into a darkened cement corridor she found herself in a tunnellowceilinged and narrow a double yellow line stretched out before her the line disappeared into an empty dark hollow the underground highway she staggered toward the tunnel holding the wall for guidance behind her the elevator door slid shut once again susan fletcher was plunged into darkness silence nothing except a faint humming in the walls a humming that grew louder suddenly it was as if dawn were breaking the blackness thinned to a hazy gray the walls of the tunnel began to take shape all at once a small vehicle whipped around the corner its headlight blinding her susan stumbled back against the wall and shielded her eyes there was a gust of air and the transport whipped past an instant later there was a deafening squeal of rubber on cement the hum approached once again this time in reverse seconds later the vehicle came to a stop beside her ms fletcher an astonished voice exclaimed susan gazed at a vaguely familiar shape in the drivers seat of an electric golf cart jesus the man gasped are you okay we thought you were dead susan stared blankly chad brinkerhoff he sputtered studying the shellshocked cryptographer directorial pa susan could only manage a dazed whimper transltr brinkerhoff nodded forget it get on the beam of the golf carts headlights whipped across the cement walls theres a virus in the main databank brinkerhoff blurted i know susan heard herself whisper we need you to help us susan was fighting back the tears strathmore he we know brinkerhoff said he bypassed gauntlet yes and the words got stuck in her throat he killed david brinkerhoff put a hand on her shoulder almost there ms fletcher just hold on the highspeed kensington golf cart rounded a corner and skidded to a stop beside them branching off perpendicular to the tunnel was a hallway dimly lit by red floor lighting come on brinkerhoff said helping her out he guided her into the corridor susan drifted behind him in a fog the tiled passageway sloped downward at a steep incline susan grabbed the handrail and followed brinkerhoff down the air began to grow cooler they continued their descent as they dropped deeper into the earth the tunnel narrowed from somewhere behind them came the echo of footstepsa strong purposeful gait the footsteps grew louder both brinkerhoff and susan stopped and turned striding toward them was an enormous black man susan had never seen him before as he approached he fixed her with a penetrating stare whos this he demanded susan fletcher brinkerhoff replied the enormous man arched his eyebrows even sooty and soaked susan fletcher was more striking than he had imagined and the commander he demanded brinkerhoff shook his head the man said nothing he stared off a moment then he turned back to susan leland fontaine he said offering her his hand glad youre okay susan stared shed always known shed meet the director someday but this was not the introduction shed envisioned come along ms fletcher fontaine said leading the way well need all the help we can get looming in the reddish haze at the bottom of the tunnel a steel wall blocked their way fontaine approached and typed an entry code into a recessed cipher box he then placed his right hand against a small glass panel a strobe flashed a moment later the massive wall thundered left there was only one nsa chamber more sacred than crypto and susan fletcher sensed she was about to enter it chapter the command center for the nsas main databank looked like a scaleddown nasa mission control a dozen computer workstations faced the thirtyfoot by fortyfoot video wall at the far end of the room on the screen numbers and diagrams flashed in rapid succession appearing and disappearing as if someone were channel surfing a handful of technicians raced wildly from station to station trailing long sheets of printout paper and yelling commands it was chaos susan stared at the dazzling facility she vaguely remembered that metric tons of earth had been excavated to create it the chamber was located feet below ground where it would be totally impervious to flux bombs and nuclear blasts on a raised workstation in the center of the room stood jabba he bellowed orders from his platform like a king to his subjects illuminated on the screen directly behind him was a message the message was all too familiar to susan the billboardsize text hung ominously over jabbas head only the truth will save you now enter passkey as if trapped in some surreal nightmare susan followed fontaine toward the podium her world was a slowmotion blur jabba saw them coming and wheeled like an enraged bull i built gauntlet for a reason gauntlets gone fontaine replied evenly old news director jabba spat the shock wave knocked me on my ass wheres strathmore commander strathmore is dead poetic fucking justice cool it jabba the director ordered bring us up to speed how bad is this virus jabba stared at the director a long moment and then without warning he burst out laughing a virus his harsh guffaw resonated through the underground chamber is that what you think this is fontaine kept his cool jabbas insolence was way out of line but fontaine knew this was not the time or place to handle it down here jabba outranked god himself computer problems had away of ignoring the normal chain of command its not a virus brinkerhoff exclaimed hopefully jabba snorted in disgust viruses have replication strings pretty boy this doesnt susan hovered nearby unable to focus then whats going on fontaine demanded i thought we had a virus jabba sucked in a long breath and lowered his voice viruses he said wiping sweat from his face viruses reproduce they create clones theyre vain and stupidbinary egomaniacs they pump out babies faster than rabbits thats their weaknessyou can crossbreed them into oblivion if you know what youre doing unfortunately this program has no ego no need to reproduce its clearheaded and focused in fact when its accomplished its objective here it will probably commit digital suicide jabba held out his arms reverently to the projected havoc on the enormous screen ladies and gentlemen he sighed meet the kamikaze of computer invaders the worm worm brinkerhoff groaned it seemed like a mundane term to describe the insidious intruder worm jabba smoldered no complex structures just instincteat shit crawl thats it simplicity deadly simplicity it does what its programmed to do and then checks out fontaine eyed jabba sternly and what is this worm programmed to do no clue jabba replied right now its spreading out and attaching itself to all our classified data after that it could do anything it might decide to delete all the files or it might just decide to print smiley faces on certain white house transcripts fontaines voice remained cool and collected can you stop it jabba let out a long sigh and faced the screen i have no idea it all depends on how pissed off the author is he pointed to the message on the wall anybody want to tell me what the hell that means only the truth will save you now enter pass key jabba waited for a response and got none looks like someones messing with us director blackmail this is a ransom note if i ever saw one susans voice was a whisper empty and hollow its ensei tankado jabba turned to her he stared a moment wideeyed tankado susan nodded weakly he wanted our confession about transltr but it cost him his confession brinkerhoff interrupted looking stunned tankado wants us to confess we have transltr id say its a bit late for that susan opened her mouth to speak but jabba took over looks like tankados got a killcode he said gazing up at the message on the screen everyone turned kill code brinkerhoff demanded jabba nodded yeah a passkey that stops the worm simply put if we admit we have transltr tankado gives us a killcode we type it in and save the databank welcome to digital extortion fontaine stood like rock unwavering how long have we got about an hour jabba said just time enough to call a press conference and spill our guts recommendation fontaine demanded what do you propose we do a recommendation jabba blurted in disbelief you want a recommendation ill give you a recommendation you quit fucking around thats what you do easy the director warned director jabba sputtered right now ensei tankado owns this databank give him whatever he wants if he wants the world to know about transltr call cnn and drop your shorts transltrs a hole in the ground now anywaywhat the hell do you care there was a silence fontaine seemed to be considering his options susan began to speak but jabba beat her to it what are you waiting for director get tankado on the phone tell him youll play ball we need that killcode or this whole place is going down nobody moved are you all insane jabba screamed call tankado tell him we fold get me that killcode now jabba whipped out his cellular phone and switched it on never mind get me his number ill call the little prick myself dont bother susan said in a whisper tankados dead after a moment of confused astonishment the implications hit jabba like a bullet to the gut the huge syssec looked like he was about to crumble dead but then that means we cant that means well need a new plan fontaine said matteroffactly jabbas eyes were still glazed with shock when someone in the back of the room began shouting wildly jabba jabba it was soshi kuta his head techie she came running toward the podium trailing a long printout she looked terrified jabba she gasped the worm i just found out what its programmed to do soshi thrust the paper into jabbas hands i pulled this from the systemactivity probe we isolated the worms execute commandshave a look at the programming look what its planning to do dazed the chief syssec read the printout then he grabbed the handrail for support oh jesus jabba gasped tankado you bastard chapter jabba stared blankly at the printout soshi had just handed him pale he wiped his forehead on his sleeve director we have no choice weve got to kill power to the databank unacceptable fontaine replied the results would be devastating jabba knew the director was right there were over three thousand isdn connections tying into the nsa databank from all over the world every day military commanders accessed uptotheinstant satellite photos of enemy movement lockheed engineers downloaded compartmentalized blueprints of new weaponry field operatives accessed mission updates the nsa databank was the backbone of thousands of us government operations shutting it down without warning would cause lifeanddeath intelligence blackouts all over the globe im aware of the implications sir jabba said but we have no choice explain yourself fontaine ordered he shot a quick glance at susan standing beside him on the podium she seemed miles away jabba took a deep breath and wiped his brow again from the look on his face it was clear to the group on the podium that they were not going to like what he had to say this worm jabba began this worm is not an ordinary degenerative cycle its a selective cycle in other words its a worm with taste brinkerhoff opened his mouth to speak but fontaine waved him off most destructive applications wipe a databank clean jabba continued but this one is more complex it deletes only those files that fall within certain parameters you mean it wont attack the whole databank brinkerhoff asked hopefully thats good right no jabba exploded its bad its very fucking bad cool it fontaine ordered what parameters is this worm looking for military covert ops jabba shook his head he eyed susan who was still distant and then jabbas eyes rose to meet the directors sir as you know anyone who wants to tie into this databank from the outside has to pass a series of security gates before theyre admitted fontaine nodded the databanks access hierarchies were brilliantly conceived authorized personnel could dial in via the internet and world wide web depending on their authorization sequence they were permitted access to their own compartmentalized zones because were tied to the global internet jabba explained hackers foreign governments and eff sharks circle this databank twentyfour hours a day and try to break in yes fontaine said and twentyfour hours a day our security filters keep them out whats your point jabba gazed down at the printout my point is this tankados worm is not targeting our data he cleared his throat its targeting our security filters fontaine blanched apparently he understood the implicationsthis worm was targeting the filters that kept the nsa databank confidential without filters all of the information in the databank would become accessible to everyone on the outside we need to shut down jabba repeated in about an hour every third grader with a modem is going to have top us security clearance fontaine stood a long moment without saying a word jabba waited impatiently and finally turned to soshi soshi vr now soshi dashed off jabba relied on vr often in most computer circles vr meant virtual reality but at the nsa it meant visrepvisual representation in a world full of technicians and politicians all having different levels of technical understanding a graphic representation was often the only way to make a point a single plummeting graph usually aroused ten times the reaction inspired by volumes of spreadsheets jabba knew a vr of the current crisis would make its point instantly vr soshi yelled from a terminal at the back of the room a computergenerated diagram flashed to life on the wall before them susan gazed up absently detached from the madness around her everyone in the room followed jabbas gaze to the screen the diagram before them resembled a bullseye in the center was a red circle marked data around the center were five concentric circles of differing thickness and color the outermost circle was faded almost transparent weve got a fivetier level of defense jabba explained a primary bastion host two sets of packet filters for ftp and xeleven a tunnel block and finally a pembased authorization window right off the truffle project the outside shield thats disappearing represents the exposed host its practically gone within the hour all five shields will follow after that the world pours in every byte of nsa data becomes public domain fontaine studied the vr his eyes smoldering brinkerhoff let out a weak whimper this worm can open our databank to the world childs play for tankado jabba snapped gauntlet was our failsafe strathmore blew it its an act of war fontaine whispered an edge in his voice jabba shook his head i really doubt tankado ever meant for it to go this far i suspect he intended to be around to stop it fontaine gazed up at the screen and watched the first of the five walls disappear entirely bastion host is toast a technician yelled from the back of the room second shields exposed weve got to start shutting down jabba urged from the looks of the vr weve got about fortyfive minutes shutdown is a complex process it was true the nsa databank had been constructed in such a way as to ensure it would never lose poweraccidentally or if attacked multiple failsafes for phone and power were buried in reinforced steel canisters deep underground and in addition to the feeds from within the nsa complex there were multiple backups off main public grids shutting down involved a complex series of confirmations and protocolssignificantly more complicated than the average nuclear submarine missile launch we have time jabba said if we hurry manual shutdown should take about thirty minutes fontaine continued staring up at the vr apparently pondering his options director jabba exploded when these firewalls fall every user on the planet will be issued topsecurity clearance and im talking upper level records of covert ops overseas agents names and locations of everyone in the federal witness protection program launch code confirmations we must shut down now the director seemed unmoved there must be some other way yes jabba spat there is the killcode but the only guy who knows it happens to be dead how about brute force brinkerhoff blurted can we guess the killcode jabba threw up his arms for christ sake killcodes are like encryption keysrandom impossible to guess if you think you can type trillion entries in the next fortyfive minutes be my guest the killcodes in spain susan offered weakly everyone on the podium turned it was the first thing she had said in a long time susan looked up blearyeyed tankado gave it away when he died everyone looked lost the passkey susan shivered as she spoke commander strathmore sent someone to find it and jabba demanded did strathmores man find it susan tried to fight it but the tears began to flow yes she choked i think so chapter an earsplitting yell cut through the control room sharks it was soshi jabba spun toward the vr two thin lines had appeared outside the concentric circles they looked like sperm trying to breach a reluctant egg bloods in the water folks jabba turned back to the director i need a decision either we start shutting down or well never make it as soon as these two intruders see the bastion host is down theyll send up a war cry fontaine did not respond he was deep in thought susan fletchers news of the passkey in spain seemed promising to him he shot a glance toward susan in the back of the room she appeared to be in her own world collapsed in a chair her head buried in her hands fontaine was unsure exactly what had triggered the reaction but whatever it was he had no time for it now i need a decision jabba demanded now fontaine looked up he spoke calmly okay youve got one we are not shutting down were going to wait jabbas jaw dropped what but thats a gamble fontaine interrupted a gamble we just might win he took jabbas cellular and punched a few keys midge he said its leland fontaine listen carefully chapter you better know what the hell youre doing director jabba hissed were about to lose shutdown capability fontaine did not respond as if on cue the door at the back of the control room opened and midge came dashing in she arrived breathless at the podium director the switchboard is patching it through right now fontaine turned expectantly toward the screen on the front wall fifteen seconds later the screen crackled to life the image on screen was snowy and stilted at first and gradually grew sharper it was a quicktime digital transmissiononly five frames per second the image revealed two men one was pale with a buzz cut the other a blond allamerican they were seated facing the camera like two newscasters waiting to go on the air what the hell is this jabba demanded sit tight fontaine ordered the men appeared to be inside a van of some sort electronic cabling hung all around them the audio connection crackled to life suddenly there was background noise inbound audio a technician called from behind them five seconds till twoway who are they brinkerhoff asked uneasily eye in the sky fontaine replied gazing up at the two men he had sent to spain it had been a necessary precaution fontaine had believed in almost every aspect of strathmores planthe regrettable but necessary removal of ensei tankado rewriting digital fortressit was all solid but there was one thing that made fontaine nervous the use of hulohot hulohot was skilled but he was a mercenary was he trustworthy would he take the passkey for himself fontaine wanted hulohot covered just incase and he had taken the requisite measures chapter absolutely not the man with the buzz cut yelled into the camera we have orders we report to director leland fontaine and leland fontaine only fontaine looked mildly amused you dont know who i am do you doesnt matter does it the blond fired hotly let me explain fontaine interjected let me explain something right now seconds later the two men were redfaced spilling their guts to the director of the national security agency ddirector the blond stammered im agent coliander this is agent smith fine fontaine said just brief us at the back of the room susan fletcher sat and fought the suffocating loneliness that pressed down around her eyes closed and ears ringing she wept her body had gone numb the mayhem in the control room faded to a dull murmur the gathering on the podium listened restless as agent smith began his briefing on your orders director smith began weve been here in seville for two days trailing mr ensei tankado tell me about the kill fontaine said impatiently smith nodded we observed from inside the van at about fifty meters the kill was smooth hulohot was obviously a pro but afterward his directive went awry company arrived hulohot never got the item fontaine nodded the agents had contacted him in south america with news that something had gone wrong so fontaine had cut his trip short coliander took over we stayed with hulohot as you ordered but he never made a move for the morgue instead he picked up the trail of some other guy looked private coat and tie private fontaine mused it sounded like a strathmore playwisely keeping the nsa out of it ftp filters failing a technician called out we need the item fontaine pressed where is hulohot now smith looked over his shoulder well hes with us sir fontaine exhaled where it was the best new shed heard all day smith reached toward the lens to make an adjustment the camera swept across the inside of the van to reveal two limp bodies propped against the back wall both were motionless one was a large man with twisted wirerim glasses the other was young with a shock of dark hair and a bloody shirt hulohots the one on the left smith offered hulohots dead the director demanded yes sir fontaine knew there would be time for explanations later he glanced up at the thinning shields agent smith he said slowly and clearly the item i need it smith looked sheepish sir we still have no idea what the item is were on a needtoknow chapter then look again fontaine declared the director watched in dismay as the stilted image of the agents searched the two limp bodies in the van for a list of random numbers and letters jabba was pale oh my god they cant find it were dead losing ftp filters a voice yelled third shields exposed there was a new flurry of activity on the front screen the agent with the buzz cut held out his arms in defeat sir the passkey isnt here weve searched both men pockets clothing wallets no sign at all hulohot was wearing a monocle computer and weve checked that too it doesnt look like he ever transmitted anything remotely resembling random charactersonly a list of kills dammit fontaine seethed suddenly losing his cool its got to be there keep looking jabba had apparently seen enoughfontaine had gambled and lost jabba took over the huge syssec descended from his pulpit like a storm off a mountain he swept through his army of programmers calling out commands access auxiliary kills start shutting it down do it now well never make it soshi yelled we need a half hour by the time we shut down it will be too late jabba opened his mouth to reply but he was cut short by a scream of agony from the back of the room everyone turned like an apparition susan fletcher rose from her crouched position in the rear of the chamber her face was white her eyes transfixed on the freezeframe of david becker motionless and bloody propped up on the floor of the van you killed him she screamed you killed him she stumbled toward the image and reached out david everyone looked up in confusion susan advanced still calling her eyes never leaving the projection of davids body david she gasped staggering forward oh david how could they fontaine seemed lost you know this man susan swayed unsteadily as she passed the podium she stopped a few feet in front of the enormous projection and stared up bewildered and numb calling over and over to the man she loved chapter the emptiness in david beckers mind was absolute i am dead and yet there was a sound a distant voice david there was a dizzying burning beneath his arm his blood was filled with fire my body is not my own and yet there was a voice calling to him it was thin distant but it was part of him there were other voices toounfamiliar unimportant calling out he fought to block them out there was only one voice that mattered it faded in and out david im sorry there was a mottled light faint at first a single slit of grayness growing becker tried to move pain he tried to speak silence the voice kept calling someone was near him lifting him becker moved toward the voice or was he being moved it was calling he gazed absently at the illuminated image he could see her on a small screen it was a woman staring up at him from another world is she watching me die david the voice was familiar she was an angel she had come for him the angel spoke david i love you suddenly he knew susan reached out toward the screen crying laughing lost in a torrent of emotions she wiped fiercely at her tears david ii thought field agent smith eased david becker into the seat facing the monitor hes a little woozy maam give him a second bbut susan was stammering i saw a transmission it said smith nodded we saw it too hulohot counted his chickens a little early but the blood flesh wound smith replied we slapped a gauze on it susan couldnt speak agent coliander piped in from off camera we hit him with the new jlongacting stun gun probably hurt like hell but we got him off the street dont worry maam smith assured hell be fine david becker stared at the tv monitor in front of him he was disoriented lightheaded the image on the screen was of a rooma room filled with chaos susan was there she was standing on an open patch of floor gazing up at him she was crying and laughing david thank god i thought i had lost you he rubbed his temple he moved in front of the screen and pulled the gooseneck microphone toward his mouth susan susan gazed up in wonder davids rugged features now filled the entire wall before her his voice boomed susan i need to ask you something the resonance and volume of beckers voice seemed to momentarily suspend the action in the databank everyone stopped midstride and turned susan fletcher the voice resonated will you marry me a hush spread across the room a clipboard clattered to the floor along with a mug of pencils no one bent to pick them up there was only the faint hum of the terminal fans and the sound of david beckers steady breathing in his microphone ddavid susan stammered unaware that thirtyseven people stood riveted behind her you already asked me remember five months ago i said yes i know he smiled but this timehe extended his left hand into the camera and displayed a golden band on his fourth fingerthis time i have a ring chapter read it mr becker fontaine ordered jabba sat sweating hands poised over his keyboard yes he said read the blessed inscription susan fletcher stood with them weakkneed and aglow everyone in the room had stopped what they were doing and stared up at the enormous projection of david becker the professor twisted the ring in his fingers and studied the engraving and read carefully jabba commanded one typo and were screwed fontaine gave jabba a harsh look if there was one thing the director of the nsa knew about it was pressure situations creating additional tension was never wise relax mr becker if we make a mistake well reenter the code till we get it right bad advice mr becker jabba snapped get it right the first time killcodes usually have a penalty clauseto prevent trialanderror guessing make an incorrect entry and the cycle will probably accelerate make two incorrect entries and it will lock us out permanently game over the director frowned and turned back to the screen mr becker my mistake read carefullyread extremely carefully becker nodded and studied the ring for a moment then he calmly began reciting the inscription q u i s space c jabba and susan interrupted in unison space jabba stopped typing theres a space becker shrugged checking the ring yeah theres a bunch of them am i missing something fontaine demanded what are we waiting for sir susan said apparently puzzled its its just i agree jabba said its strange passwords never have spaces brinkerhoff swallowed hard so what are you saying hes saying susan interjected that this may not be a killcode brinkerhoff cried out of course its the killcode what else could it be why else would tankado give it away who the hell inscribes a bunch of random letters on a ring fontaine silenced brinkerhoff with a sharp glare ah folks becker interjected appearing hesitant to get involved you keep mentioning random letters i think i should let you know the letters on this ring arent random everyone on the podium blurted in unison what becker looked uneasy sorry but there are definitely words here ill admit theyre inscribed pretty close together at first glance it appears random but if you look closely youll see the inscription is actually well its latin jabba gaped youre shitting me becker shook his head no it reads quis custodiet ipsos custodes it translates roughly to who will guard the guards susan interrupted finishing davids sentence becker did a doubletake susan i didnt know you could its from satires of juvenal she exclaimed who will guard the guards who will guard the nsa while we guard the world it was tankados favorite saying so midge demanded is it the passkey or not it must be the passkey brinkerhoff declared fontaine stood silent apparently processing the information i dont know if its the key jabba said it seems unlikely to me that tankado would use a nonrandom construction just omit the spaces brinkerhoff cried and type the damn code fontaine turned to susan whats your take ms fletcher she thought a moment she couldnt quite put her finger on it but something didnt feel right susan knew tankado well enough to know he thrived on simplicity his proofs and programming were always crystalline and absolute the fact that the spaces needed to be removed seemed odd it was a minor detail but it was a flaw definitely not cleannot what susan would have expected as ensei tankados crowning blow it doesnt feel right susan finally said i dont think its the key fontaine sucked in a long breath his dark eyes probing hers ms fletcher in your mind if this is not the key why would ensei tankado have given it away if he knew wed murdered himdont you assume hed want to punish us by making the ring disappear a new voice interrupted the dialogue ah director all eyes turned to the screen it was agent coliander in seville he was leaning over beckers shoulder and speaking into the mic for whatever its worth im not so sure mr tankado knew he was being murdered i beg your pardon fontaine demanded hulohot was a pro sir we saw the killonly fifty meters away all evidence suggests tankado was unaware evidence brinkerhoff demanded what evidence tankado gave away this ring thats proof enough agent smith fontaine interrupted what makes you think ensei tankado was unaware he was being killed smith cleared his throat hulohot killed him with an ntba noninvasive trauma bullet its a rubber pod that strikes the chest and spreads out silent very clean mr tankado would only have felt a sharp thump before going into cardiac arrest a trauma bullet becker mused to himself that explains the bruising its doubtful smith added that tankado associated the sensation with a gunman and yet he gave away his ring fontaine stated true sir but he never looked for his assailant a victim always looks for his assailant when hes been shot its instinct fontaine puzzled and youre saying tankado didnt look for hulohot no sir we have it on film if youd like xeleven filters going a technician yelled the worms halfway there forget the film brinkerhoff declared type in the damn killcode and finish this jabba sighed suddenly the cool one director if we enter the wrong code yes susan interrupted if tankado didnt suspect we killed him weve got some questions to answer whats our time frame jabba fontaine demanded jabba looked up at the vr about twenty minutes i suggest we use the time wisely fontaine was silent a long moment then sighed heavily all right run the film chapter transmitting video in ten seconds agent smiths voice crackled were dropping every other frame as well as audiowell run as close to real time as possible everyone on the podium stood silent watching waiting jabba typed a few keys and rearranged the video wall tankados message appeared on the far left only the truth will save you now on the right of the wall was the static interior shot of the van with becker and the two agents huddled around the camera in the center a fuzzy frame appeared it dissolved into static and then into a black and white image of a park transmitting agent smith announced the shot looked like an old movie it was stilted and jerkya byproduct of framedropping a process that halved the amount of information sent and enabled faster transmission the shot panned out across an enormous concourse enclosed on one end by a semicircular facadethe seville ayuntamiento there were trees in the foreground the park was empty xelevens are down a technician called out this bad boys hungry smith began to narrate his commentary had the detachment of a seasoned agent this is shot from the van he said about fifty meters from the kill zone tankado is approaching from the right hulohots in the trees to the left weve got a time crunch here fontaine pressed lets get to the meat of it agent coliander touched a few buttons and the frame speed increased everyone on the podium watched in anticipation as their former associate ensei tankado came into the frame the accelerated video made the whole image seem comic tankado shuffled jerkily out onto the concourse apparently taking in the scenery he shielded his eyes and gazed up at the spires of the huge facade this is it smith warned hulohots a pro he took his first open shot smith was right there was a flash of light from behind the trees on the left of the screen an instant later tankado clutched his chest he staggered momentarily the camera zoomed in on him unstablein and out of focus as the footage rolled in high speed smith coldly continued his narration as you can see tankado is instantly in cardiac arrest susan felt ill watching the images tankado clutched at his chest with crippled hands a confused look of terror on his face youll notice smith added his eyes are focused downward at himself not once does he look around and thats important jabba half stated half inquired very smith said if tankado suspected foul play of any kind he would instinctively search the area but as you can see he does not on the screen tankado dropped to his knees still clutching his chest he never once looked up ensei tankado was a man alone dying a private natural death its odd smith said puzzled trauma pods usually wont kill this quickly sometimes if the targets big enough they dont kill at all bad heart fontaine said flatly smith arched his eyebrows impressed fine choice of weapon then susan watched as tankado toppled from his knees to his side and finally onto his back he lay staring upward grabbing at his chest suddenly the camera wheeled away from him back toward the grove of trees a man appeared he was wearing wirerim glasses and carrying an oversize briefcase as he approached the concourse and the writhing tankado his fingers began tapping in a strange silent dance on a mechanism attached to his hand hes working his monocle smith announced sending a message that tankado is terminated smith turned to becker and chuckled looks like hulohot had a bad habit of transmitting kills before his victim actually expired coliander sped the film up some more and the camera followed hulohot as he began moving toward his victim suddenly an elderly man rushed out of a nearby courtyard ran over to tankado and knelt beside him hulohot slowed his approach a moment later two more people appeared from the courtyardan obese man and a redhaired woman they also came to tankados side unfortunate choice of kill zone smith said hulohot thought he had the victim isolated on the screen hulohot watched for a moment and then shrank back into the trees apparently to wait here comes the handoff smith prompted we didnt notice it the first time around susan gazed up at the sickening image on the screen tankado was gasping for breath apparently trying communicate something to the samaritans kneeling beside him then in desperation he thrust his left hand above him almost hitting the old man in the face he held the crippled appendage outward before the old mans eyes the camera tightened on tankados three deformed fingers and on one of them clearly glistening in the spanish sun was the golden ring tankado thrust it out again the old man recoiled tankado turned to the woman he held his three deformed fingers directly in front of her face as if begging her to understand the ring glinted in the sun the woman looked away tankado now choking unable to make a sound turned to the obese man and tried one last time the elderly man suddenly stood and dashed off presumably to get help tankado seemed to be weakening but he was still holding the ring in the fat mans face the fat man reached out and held the dying mans wrist supporting it tankado seemed to gaze upward at his own fingers at his own ring and then to the mans eyes as a final plea before death ensei tankado gave the man an almost imperceptible nod as if to say yes then tankado fell limp jesus jabba moaned suddenly the camera swept to where hulohot had been hiding the assassin was gone a police motorcycle appeared tearing up avenida firelli the camera wheeled back to where tankado was lying the woman kneeling beside him apparently heard the police sirens she glanced around nervously and then began pulling at her obese companion begging him to leave the two hurried off the camera tightened on tankado his hands folded on his lifeless chest the ring on his finger was gone chapter its proof fontaine said decidedly tankado dumped the ring he wanted it as far from himself as possibleso wed never find it but director susan argued it doesnt make sense if tankado was unaware hed been murdered why would he give away the kill code i agree jabba said the kids a rebel but hes a rebel with a conscience getting us to admit to transltr is one thing revealing our classified databank is another fontaine stared disbelieving you think tankado wanted to stop this worm you think his dying thoughts were for the poor nsa tunnelblock corroding a technician yelled full vulnerability in fifteen minutes maximum ill tell you what the director declared taking control in fifteen minutes every third world country on the planet will learn how to build an intercontinental ballistic missile if someone in this room thinks hes got a better candidate for a kill code than this ring im all ears the director waited no one spoke he returned his gaze to jabba and locked eyes tankado dumped that ring for a reason jabba whether he was trying to bury it or whether he thought the fat guy would run to a pay phone and call us with the information i really dont care but ive made the decision were entering that quote now jabba took a long breath he knew fontaine was rightthere was no better option they were running out of time jabba sat okay lets do it he pulled himself to the keyboard mr becker the inscription please nice and easy david becker read the inscription and jabba typed when they were done they doublechecked the spelling and omitted all the spaces on the center panel of the view wall near the top were the letters quiscustodietipsoscustodes i dont like it susan muttered softly its not clean jabba hesitated hovering over the enter key do it fontaine commanded jabba hit the key seconds later the whole room knew it was a mistake chapter its accelerating soshi yelled from the back of the room its the wrong code everyone stood in silent horror on the screen before them was the error message illegal entry numeric field only damn it jabba screamed numeric only were looking for a goddamn number were fucked this ring is shit worms at double speed soshi shouted penalty round on the center screen right beneath the error message the vr painted a terrifying image as the third firewall gave way the halfdozen or so black lines representing marauding hackers surged forward advancing relentlessly toward the core with each passing moment a new line appeared then another theyre swarming soshi yelled confirming overseas tieins cried another technician words out susan averted her gaze from the image of the collapsing firewalls and turned to the side screen the footage of ensei tankados kill was on endless loop it was the same every timetankado clutching his chest falling and with a look of desperate panic forcing his ring on a group of unsuspecting tourists it makes no sense she thought if he didnt know wed killed him susan drew a total blank it was too late weve missed something on the vr the number of hackers pounding at the gates had doubled in the last few minutes from now on the number would increase exponentially hackers like hyenas were one big family always eager to spread the word of a new kill leland fontaine had apparently seen enough shut it down he declared shut the damn thing down jabba stared straight ahead like the captain of a sinking ship too late sir were going down chapter the fourhundredpound syssec stood motionless hands resting atop his head in a freezeframe of disbelief hed ordered a power shutdown but it would be a good twenty minutes too late sharks with highspeed modems would be able to download staggering quantities of classified information in that window jabba was awakened from his nightmare by soshi rushing to the podium with a new printout ive found something sir she said excitedly orphans in the source alpha groupings all over the place jabba was unmoved were looking for a numeric dammit not an alpha the killcode is a number but weve got orphans tankados too good to leave orphansespecially this many the term orphans referred to extra lines of programming that didnt serve the programs objective in any way they fed nothing referred to nothing led nowhere and were usually removed as part of the final debugging and compiling process jabba took the printout and studied it fontaine stood silent susan peered over jabbas shoulder at the printout were being attacked by a rough draft of tankados worm polished or not jabba retorted its kicking our ass i dont buy it susan argued tankado was a perfectionist you know that theres no way he left bugs in his program there are lots of them soshi cried she grabbed the printout from jabba and pushed it in front of susan look susan nodded sure enough after every twenty or so lines of programming there were four freefloating characters susan scanned them pfee sesn retm fourbit alpha groupings she puzzled theyre definitely not part of the programming forget it jabba growled youre grabbing at straws maybe not susan said a lot of encryption uses fourbit groupings this could be a code yeah jabba groaned it saysha ha youre fucked he looked up at the vr in about nine minutes susan ignored jabba and locked in on soshi how many orphans are there soshi shrugged she commandeered jabbas terminal and typed all the groupings when she was done she pushed back from the terminal the room looked up at the screen pfee sesn retm mfha irwe ooig meen nrma enet shas dcns iiaa ieer brnk fble lodi susan was the only one smiling sure looks familiar she said blocks of fourjust like enigma the director nodded enigma was historys most famous codewriting machinethe nazis twelveton encryption beast it had encrypted in blocks of four great he moaned you wouldnt happen to have one lying around would you thats not the point susan said suddenly coming to life this was her specialty the point is that this is a code tankado left us a clue hes taunting us daring us to figure out the passkey in time hes laying hints just out of our reach absurd jabba snapped tankado gave us only one outrevealing transltr that was it that was our escape we blew it i have to agree with him fontaine said i doubt theres any way tankado would risk letting us off the hook by hinting at his killcode susan nodded vaguely but she recalled how tankado had given them ndakota she stared up at the letters wondering if he were playing another one of his games tunnel block half gone a technician called on the vr the mass of black tiein lines surged deeper into the two remaining shields david had been sitting quietly watching the drama unfold on the monitor before them susan he offered i have an idea is that text in sixteen groupings of four oh for christs sake jabba said under his breath now everyone wants to play susan ignored jabba and counted the groupings yes sixteen take out the spaces becker said firmly david susan replied slightly embarrassed i dont think you understand the groupings of four are take out the spaces he repeated susan hesitated a moment and then nodded to soshi soshi quickly removed the spaces the result was no more enlightening pfeesesnretmpfhairweooigmeennrmaenetshasdcnsiiaaieerbrnkfblelodi jabba exploded enough playtimes over this things on doublespeed weve got about eight minutes here were looking for a number not a bunch of halfbaked letters four by sixteen david said calmly do the math susan susan eyed davids image on the screen do the math hes terrible at math she knew david could memorize verb conjugations and vocabulary like a xerox machine but math multiplication tables becker said multiplication tables susan wondered what is he talking about four by sixteen the professor repeated i had to memorize multiplication tables in fourth grade susan pictured the standard grade school multiplication table four by sixteen sixtyfour she said blankly so what david leaned toward the camera his face filled the frame sixtyfour letters susan nodded yes but theyre susan froze sixtyfour letters david repeated susan gasped oh my god david youre a genius chapter seven minutes a technician called out eight rows of eight susan shouted excited soshi typed fontaine looked on silently the second to last shield was growing thin sixtyfour letters susan was in control its a perfect square perfect square jabba demanded so what ten seconds later soshi had rearranged the seemingly random letters on the screen they were now in eight rows of eight jabba studied the letters and threw up his hands in despair the new layout was no more revealing than the original clear as shit jabba groaned ms fletcher fontaine demanded explain yourself all eyes turned to susan susan was staring up at the block of text gradually she began nodding then broke into a wide smile david ill be damned everyone on the podium exchanged baffled looks david winked at the tiny image of susan fletcher on the screen before him sixtyfour letters julius caesar strikes again midge looked lost what are you talking about caesar box susan beamed read top to bottom tankados sending us a message chapter six minutes a technician called out susan shouted orders retype top to bottom read down not across soshi furiously moved down the columns retyping the text julius caesar sent codes this way susan blurted his letter count was always a perfect square done soshi yelled everyone looked up at the newly arranged single line of text on the wallscreen still garbage jabba scoffed in disgust look at it its totally random bits of the words lodged in his throat his eyes widened to saucers oh oh my fontaine had seen it too he arched his eyebrows obviously impressed midge and brinkerhoff both cooed in unison holy shit the sixtyfour letters now read primedifferencebetweenelementsresponsibleforhiroshimaandnagasaki put in the spaces susan ordered weve got a puzzle to solve chapter an ashen technician ran to the podium tunnel blocks about to go jabba turned to the vr onscreen the attackers surged forward only a whisker away from their assault on the fifth and final wall the databank was running out of time susan blocked out the chaos around her she read tankados bizarre message over and over prime difference between elements responsible for hiroshima and nagasaki its not even a question brinkerhoff cried how can it have an answer we need a number jabba reminded the killcode is numeric silence fontaine said evenly he turned and addressed susan ms fletcher youve gotten us this far i need your best guess susan took a deep breath the killcode entry field accepts numerics only my guess is that this is some sort of clue as to the correct number the text mentions hiroshima and nagasakithe two cities that were hit by atomic bombs maybe the killcode is related to the number of casualties the estimated dollars of damage she paused a moment rereading the clue the word difference seems important the prime difference between nagasaki and hiroshima apparently tankado felt the two incidents differed somehow fontaines expression did not change nonetheless hope was fading fast it seemed the political backdrops surrounding the two most devastating blasts in history needed to be analyzed compared and translated into some magic number and all within the next five minutes chapter final shield under attack on the vr the pem authorization programming was now being consumed black penetrating lines engulfed the final protective shield and began forcing their way toward its core prowling hackers were now appearing from all over the world the number was doubling almost every minute before long anyone with a computerforeign spies radicals terroristswould have access to all of the us governments classified information as technicians tried vainly to sever power the assembly on the podium studied the message even david and the two nsa agents were trying to crack the code from their van in spain prime difference between elements responsible forhiroshima and nagasaki soshi thought aloud the elements responsible for hiroshima and nagasaki pearl harbor hirohitos refusal to we need a number jabba repeated not political theories were talking mathematicsnot history soshi fell silent how about payloads brinkerhoff offered casualties dollars damage were looking for an exact figure susan reminded damage estimates vary she stared up at the message the elements responsible three thousand miles away david beckers eyes flew open elements he declared were talking math not history all heads turned toward the satellite screen tankados playing word games becker spouted the word elements has multiple meanings spit it out mr becker fontaine snapped hes talking about chemical elementsnot sociopolitical ones beckers announcement met blank looks elements he prompted the periodic table chemical elements didnt any of you see the movie fat man and little boyabout the manhattan project the two atomic bombs were different they used different fueldifferent elements soshi clapped her hands yes hes right i read that the two bombs used different fuels one used uranium and one used plutonium two different elements a hush swept across the room uranium and plutonium jabba exclaimed suddenly hopeful the clue asks for the difference between the two elements he spun to his army of workers the difference between uranium and plutonium who knows what it is blank stares all around come on jabba said didnt you kids go to college somebody anybody i need the difference between plutonium and uranium no response susan turned to soshi i need access to the web is there a browser here soshi nodded netscapes sweetest susan grabbed her hand come on were going surfing chapter how much time jabba demanded from the podium there was no response from the technicians in the back they stood riveted staring up at the vr the final shield was getting dangerously thin nearby susan and soshi pored over the results of their web search outlaw labs susan asked who are they soshi shrugged you want me to open it damn right she said six hundred fortyseven text references to uranium plutonium and atomic bombs sounds like our best bet soshi opened the link a disclaimer appeared the information contained in this file is strictly for academic use only any layperson attempting to construct any of the devices described runs the risk of radiation poisoning andor selfexplosion selfexplosion soshi said jesus search it fontaine snapped over his shoulder lets see what weve got soshi plowed into the document she scrolled past a recipe for urea nitrate an explosive ten times more powerful than dynamite the information rolled by like a recipe for butterscotch brownies plutonium and uranium jabba repeated lets focus go back susan ordered the documents too big find the table of contents soshi scrolled backward until she found it i mechanism of an atomic bomb a altimeter b air pressure detonator c detonating heads d explosive charges e neutron deflector f uranium plutonium g lead shield h fuses ii nuclear fissionnuclear fusion a fission abomb fusion hbomb b u u and plutonium iii history of the atomic weapons a development the manhattan project b detonation hiroshima nagasaki byproducts of atomic detonations blast zones section two susan cried uranium and plutonium go everyone waited while soshi found the right section this is it she said hold on she quickly scanned the data theres a lot of information here a whole chart how do we know which difference were looking for one occurs naturally one is manmade plutonium was first discovered by a number jabba reminded we need a number susan reread tankados message the prime difference between the elements the difference between we need a number wait she said the word difference has multiple meanings we need a numberso were talking math its another of tankados word gamesdifference means subtraction yes becker agreed from the screen overhead maybe the elements have different numbers of protons or something if you subtract hes right jabba said turning to soshi are there any numbers on that chart proton counts halflives anything we can subtract three minutes a technician called how about supercritical mass soshi ventured it says the supercritical mass for plutonium is pounds yes jabba said check uranium whats the supercritical mass of uranium soshi searched um pounds one hundred ten jabba looked suddenly hopeful whats from seventyfour point eight susan snapped but i dont think out of my way jabba commanded plowing toward the keyboard thats got to be the killcode the difference between their critical masses seventyfour point eight hold on susan said peering over soshis shoulder theres more here atomic weights neutron counts extraction techniques she skimmed the chart uranium splits into barium and krypton plutonium does something else uranium has protons and neutrons but we need the most obvious difference midge chimed in the clue reads the primary difference between the elements jesus christ jabba swore how do we know what tankado considered the primary difference david interrupted actually the clue reads prime not primary the word hit susan right between the eyes prime she exclaimed prime she spun to jabba the killcode is a prime number think about it it makes perfect sense jabba instantly knew susan was right ensei tankado had built his career on prime numbers primes were the fundamental building blocks of all encryption algorithmsunique values that had no factors other than one and themselves primes worked well in code writing because they were impossible for computers to guess using typical numbertree factoring soshi jumped in yes its perfect primes are essential to japanese culture haiku uses primes three lines and syllable counts of five seven five all primes the temples of kyoto all have enough jabba said even if the killcode is a prime so what there are endless possibilities susan knew jabba was right because the number line was infinite one could always look a little farther and find another prime number between zero and a million there were over choices it all depended on how large a prime tankado decided to use the bigger it was the harder it was to guess itll be huge jabba groaned whatever prime tankado chose is sure to be a monster a call went up from the rear of the room twominute warning jabba gazed up at the vr in defeat the final shield was starting to crumble technicians were rushing everywhere something in susan told her they were close we can do this she declared taking control of all the differences between uranium and plutonium i bet only one can be represented as a prime number thats our final clue the number were looking for is prime jabba eyed the uraniumplutonium chart on the monitor and threw up his arms there must be a hundred entries here theres no way we can subtract them all and check for primes a lot of the entries are nonnumeric susan encouraged we can ignore them uraniums natural plutoniums manmade uranium uses a gun barrel detonator plutonium uses implosion theyre not numbers so theyre irrelevant do it fontaine ordered on the vr the final wall was eggshell thin jabba mopped his brow all right here goes nothing start subtracting ill take the top quarter susan youve got the middle everybody else split up the rest were looking for a prime difference within seconds it was clear theyd never make it the numbers were enormous and in many cases the units didnt match up its apples and goddamn oranges jabba said weve got gamma rays against electromagnetic pulse fissionable against unfissionable some is pure some is percentage its a mess its got to be here susan said firmly weve got to think theres some difference between plutonium and uranium that were missing something simple ah guys soshi said shed created a second document window and was perusing the rest of the outlaw labs document what is it fontaine demanded find something um sort of she sounded uneasy you know how i told you the nagasaki bomb was a plutonium bomb yeah they all replied in unison well soshi took a deep breath looks like i made a mistake what jabba choked weve been looking for the wrong thing soshi pointed to the screen they huddled around and read the text the common misconception that the nagasaki bomb was a plutonium bomb in fact the device employed uranium like its sister bomb in hiroshima but susan gasped if both elements were uranium how are we supposed to find the difference between the two maybe tankado made a mistake fontaine ventured maybe he didnt know the bombs were the same no susan sighed he was a cripple because of those bombs hed know the facts cold chapter one minute jabba eyed the vr pem authorizations going fast last line of defense and theres a crowd at the door focus fontaine commanded soshi sat in front of the web browser and read aloud nagasaki bomb did not use plutonium but rather an artificially manufactured neutronsaturated isotope of uranium damn brinkerhoff swore both bombs used uranium the elements responsible for hiroshima and nagasaki were both uranium there is no difference were dead midge moaned wait susan said read that last part again soshi repeated the text artificially manufactured neutronsaturated isotope of uranium susan exclaimed didnt we just see something that said hiroshimas bomb used some other isotope of uranium they all exchanged puzzled glances soshi frantically scrolled backward and found the spot yes it says here that the hiroshima bomb used a different isotope of uranium midge gasped in amazement theyre both uraniumbut theyre different kinds both uranium jabba muscled in and stared at the terminal apples and apples perfect how are the two isotopes different fontaine demanded its got to be something basic soshi scrolled through the document hold on looking okay fortyfive seconds a voice called out susan looked up the final shield was almost invisible now here it is soshi exclaimed read it jabba was sweating whats the difference there must be some difference between the two yes soshi pointed to her monitor look they all read the text two bombs employed two different fuels precisely identical chemical characteristics no ordinary chemical extraction can separate the two isotopes they are with the exception of minute differences in weight perfectly identical atomic weight jabba said excitedly thats it the only difference is their weights thats the key give me their weights well subtract them hold on soshi said scrolling ahead almost there yes everyone scanned the text difference in weight very slight gaseous diffusion to separate them x as compared to x there they are jabba screamed thats it those are the weights thirty seconds go fontaine whispered subtract them quickly jabba palmed his calculator and started entering numbers whats the asterisk susan demanded theres an asterisk after the figures jabba ignored her he was already working his calculator keys furiously careful soshi urged we need an exact figure the asterisk susan repeated theres a footnote soshi clicked to the bottom of the paragraph susan read the asterisked footnote she went white oh dear god jabba looked up what they all leaned in and there was a communal sigh of defeat the tiny footnote read margin of error published figures vary from lab to lab chapter there was a sudden and reverent silence among the group on the podium it was as if they were watching an eclipse or volcanic eruptionan incredible chain of events over which they had no control time seemed to slow to a crawl were losing it a technician cried tieins all lines on the farleft screen david and agents smith and coliander stared blankly into their camera on the vr the final fire wall was only a sliver a mass of blackness surrounded it hundreds of lines waiting to tie in to the right of that was tankado the stilted clips of his final moments ran by in an endless loop the look of desperationfingers stretched outward the ring glistening in the sun susan watched the clip as it went in and out of focus she stared at tankados eyesthey seemed filled with regret he never wanted it to go this far she told herself he wanted to save us and yet over and over tankado held his fingers outward forcing the ring in front of peoples eyes he was trying to speak but could not he just kept thrusting his fingers forward in seville beckers mind still turned it over and over he mumbled to himself what did they say those two isotopes were u and u he sighed heavilyit didnt matter he was a language teacher not a physicist incoming lines preparing to authenticate jesus jabba bellowed in frustration how do the damn isotopes differ nobody knows how the hell theyre different there was no response the room full of technicians stood helplessly watching the vr jabba spun back to the monitor and threw up his arms wheres a nuclear fucking physicist when you need one susan stared up at the quicktime clip on the wall screen and knew it was over in slow motion she watched tankado dying over and over he was trying to speak choking on his words holding out his deformed hand trying to communicate something he was trying to save the databank susan told herself but well never know how company at the door jabba stared at the screen here we go sweat poured down his face on the center screen the final wisp of the last firewall had all but disappeared the black mass of lines surrounding the core was opaque and pulsating midge turned away fontaine stood rigid eyes front brinkerhoff looked like he was about to get sick ten seconds susans eyes never left tankados image the desperation the regret his hand reached out over and over ring glistening deformed fingers arched crookedly in strangers faces hes telling them something what is it on the screen overhead david looked deep in thought difference he kept muttering to himself difference between u and u its got to be something simple a technician began the countdown five four three the word made it to spain in just under a tenth of a second three three it was as if david becker had been hit by the stun gun all over again his world slowed to stop three three three minus the difference is three in slow motion he reached for the microphone at that very instant susan was staring at tankados outstretched hand suddenly she saw past the ring past the engraved gold to the flesh beneath to his fingers three fingers it was not the ring at all it was the flesh tankado was not telling them he was showing them he was telling his secret revealing the killcodebegging someone to understand praying his secret would find its way to the nsa in time three susan whispered stunned three becker yelled from spain but in the chaos no one seemed to hear were down a technician yelled the vr began flashing wildly as the core succumbed to a deluge sirens erupted overhead outbound data highspeed tieins in all sectors susan moved as if through a dream she spun toward jabbas keyboard as she turned her gaze fixed on her fiance david becker again his voice exploded overhead three the difference between and is three everyone in the room looked up three susan shouted over the deafening cacophony of sirens and technicians she pointed to the screen all eyes followed to tankados hand outstretched three fingers waving desperately in the sevillian sun jabba went rigid oh my god he suddenly realized the crippled genius had been giving them the answer all the time threes prime soshi blurted threes a prime number fontaine looked dazed can it be that simple outbound data a technician cried its going fast everyone on the podium dove for the terminal at the same instanta mass of outstretched hands but through the crowd susan like a shortstop stabbing a line drive connected with her target she typed the number everyone wheeled to the wall screen above the chaos it simply read enter passkey yes fontaine commanded do it now susan held her breath and lowered her finger on the enter key the computer beeped once nobody moved three agonizing seconds later nothing had happened the sirens kept going five seconds six seconds outbound data no change suddenly midge began pointing wildly to the screen above look on it a message had materialized kill code confirmed upload the firewalls jabba ordered but soshi was a step ahead of him she had already sent the command outbound interrupt a technician yelled tieins severed on the vr overhead the first of the five firewalls began reappearing the black lines attacking the core were instantly severed reinstating jabba cried the damn things reinstating there was a moment of tentative disbelief as if at any instant everything would fall apart but then the second firewall began reappearing and then the third moments later the entire series of filters reappeared the databank was secure the room erupted pandemonium technicians hugged tossing computer printouts in the air in celebration sirens wound down brinkerhoff grabbed midge and held on soshi burst into tears jabba fontaine demanded how much did they get very little jabba said studying his monitor very little and nothing complete fontaine nodded slowly a wry smile forming in the corner of his mouth he looked around for susan fletcher but she was already walking toward the front of the room on the wall before her david beckers face filled the screen david hey gorgeous he smiled come home she said come home right now meet you at stone manor he asked she nodded the tears welling deal agent smith fontaine called smith appeared onscreen behind becker yes sir it appears mr becker has a date could you see that he gets home immediately smith nodded our jets in malaga he patted becker on the back youre in for a treat professor ever flown in a learjet becker chuckled not since yesterday chapter when susan awoke the sun was shining the soft rays sifted through the curtains and filtered across her goosedown feather bed she reached for david am i dreaming her body remained motionless spent still dizzy from the night before david she moaned there was no reply she opened her eyes her skin still tingling the mattress on the other side of the bed was cold david was gone im dreaming susan thought she sat up the room was victorian all lace and antiquesstone manors finest suite her overnight bag was in the middle of the hardwood floor her lingerie on a queen anne chair beside the bed had david really arrived she had memorieshis body against hers his waking her with soft kisses had she dreamed it all she turned to the bedside table there was an empty bottle of champagne two glasses and a note rubbing the sleep from her eyes susan drew the comforter around her naked body and read the message dearest susan i love you without wax david she beamed and pulled the note to her chest it was david all right without wax it was the one code she had yet to break something stirred in the corner and susan looked up on a plush divan basking in the morning sun wrapped in thick bathrobe david becker sat quietly watching her she reached out beckoning him to come to her without wax she cooed taking him in her arms without wax he smiled she kissed him deeply tell me what it means no chance he laughed a couple needs secretsit keeps things interesting susan smiled coyly any more interesting than last night and ill never walk again david took her in his arms he felt weightless he had almost died yesterday and yet here he was as alive as he had ever felt in his life susan lay with her head on his chest listening to the beat of his heart she couldnt believe that she had thought he was gone forever david she sighed eyeing the note beside the table tell me about without wax you know i hate codes i cant break david was silent tell me susan pouted or youll never have me again liar susan hit him with a pillow tell me now but david knew he would never tell the secret behind without wax was too sweet its origins were ancient during the renaissance spanish sculptors who made mistakes while carving expensive marble often patched their flaws with cerawax a statue that had no flaws and required no patching was hailed as a sculpture sincera or a sculpture without wax the phrase eventually came to mean anything honest or true the english word sincere evolved from the spanish sincerawithout wax davids secret code was no great mysteryhe was simply signing his letters sincerely somehow he suspected susan would not be amused youll be pleased to know david said attempting to change the subject that during the flight home i called the president of the university susan looked up hopeful tell me you resigned as department chair david nodded ill be back in the classroom next semester she sighed in relief right where you belonged in the first place david smiled softly yeah i guess spain reminded me whats important back to breaking coeds hearts susan kissed his cheek well at least youll have time to help me edit my manuscript manuscript yes ive decided to publish publish david looked doubtful publish what some ideas i have on variant filter protocols and quadratic residues he groaned sounds like a real bestseller she laughed youd be surprised david fished inside the pocket of his bathrobe and pulled out a small object close your eyes i have something for you susan closed her eyes let me guessa gaudy gold ring with latin all over it no david chuckled i had fontaine return that to ensei tankados estate he took susans hand and slipped something onto her finger liar susan laughed opening her eyes i knew but susan stopped short the ring on her finger was not tankados at all it was a platinum setting that held a glittering diamond solitaire susan gasped david looked her in the eye will you marry me susans breath caught in her throat she looked at him and then back to the ring her eyes suddenly welled up oh david i dont know what to say say yes susan turned away and didnt say a word david waited susan fletcher i love you marry me susan lifted her head her eyes were filled with tears im sorry david she whispered i i cant david stared in shock he searched her eyes for the playful glimmer hed come to expect from her it wasnt there ssusan he stammered ii dont understand i cant she repeated i cant marry you she turned away her shoulders started trembling she covered her face with her hands david was bewildered but susan i thought he held her trembling shoulders and turned her body toward him it was then that he understood susan fletcher was not crying at all she was in hysterics i wont marry you she laughed attacking again with the pillow not until you explain without wax youre driving me crazy epilogue they say in death all things become clear tokugen numataka now knew it was true standing over the casket in the osaka customs office he felt a bitter clarity he had never known his religion spoke of circles of the interconnectedness of life but numataka had never had time for religion the customs officials had given him an envelope of adoption papers and birth records you are this boys only living relative they had said we had a hard time finding you numatakas mind reeled back thirtytwo years to that rainsoaked night to the hospital ward where he had deserted his deformed child and dying wife he had done it in the name of menbokuhonoran empty shadow now there was a golden ring enclosed with the papers it was engraved with words numataka did not understand it made no difference words had no meaning for numataka anymore he had forsaken his only son and now the cruelest of fates had reunited them
