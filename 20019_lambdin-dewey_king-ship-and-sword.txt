chapter one hms thermopylae a gun fifth rate frigate prowled slowly off the texel to keep a wary eye on the dutch coast for several years a conquered allied power under french control now named the batavian republic it was a sullen endeavour for thermopylaes people for the dutch had not much of a fleet left since the battle of camperdown four years before in when adm duncan had caught them headed for the english channel to combine with their french masters fleet for an invasion of great britain had forced them to run for home close inshore of their own coast where duncan had given them the choice of wrecking on their own shoals or fighting and had taken sunk or burned almost all of them by now the few surviving batavian warships were slowly rotting away at their moorings their new construction rotting on the stocks and all their vaunting plans for a larger fleet scrapped sullen too was the general attitude aboard thermopylae after months of dull blockade duty for it could not hold a candle to the heady and daring adventures of the first of the year of as the league of armed neutrality had readied their navies to confront the royal navy it had been thermopylae that had been ordered into the balticaloneto smoak out the types and numbers of ships being prepared in danish swedish and russian harbours to determine the thickness of the ice that kept all baltic navies penned in port and to ascertain how long it would be before the ice would melt and free them oh thered also been the delivery of a pair of russian nobles to somewhere as close as possible to st petersburg one of whom had tried to kill their new captain as they were being set ashore an attempted murder right by the entryport all over a london whore of all things and for certain the younger roosky was lovesick mad but what could be expected of foreigners and wasnt their new captain a scrapper though out of the baltic at last and thered been their own british expeditionary squadrons under viceadmiral sir hyde parker and viceadmiral horatio nelson and theyd been just in time to take part in the glorious battle of copenhagen and squash the danes like so many roaches round the galley butter tubs all downhill from there though first cruising in the baltic til midsummer watching first viceadmiral parker go home in a bit of disgrace the hands had heardtell then nelson departing for his always fragile health and at last a spell of revictualling and repairs at great yarmouth where the adventures had begun and a spell of shore liberty after that thermopylae had been seconded to the small north sea fleet to serve as a scout doing much of a boresome much as they did this morning making her presence known under reduced sail about two leagues seaward of the shoals and counting windmills for all the good that thermopylaes people knew in a thin and fine mist on this particular morning a cold earlyoctober rain was falling and dripping in great dollops from sails and rigging over a grey and dingywhitefoamed sea that chopped and hissed and imparted to the frigate a slow and queasy wallowing roll and the wind if freed thermopylae could cup that wind and rush like a cambridge coach nigh on eleven knots or better yet that wind was wasted on her twicereefed or gathered sails and it was a nippy wind to boot a rawun out of the norwest fresh from arctic ice sheets that made nettled tars wish for their franklinpattern stoves to be set up on the gundeck once again blow warm breaths into cupped fists and shiver under their tarred tarpaulins hms thermopylaes second officer lt james fox let out a pleased sigh as a ships boy turned the halfhour glass then slowly struck eight bells up by the forecastle his watch was done and hot tea or coffee awaited him in the gunroom below along with his breakfast lt fox clapped gloved hands together in joy as his replacement his old chum lt dick farley stepped from the lee side of the quarterdeck to amidships before the doublehelm drum and the binnacle cabinet to assume command of the forenoon watch a thouroughly miserable day and i wish ye joy of it dick lt fox said with a grin and a roll of his eyes worse things happen at sea jemmy lt farley replied as he formally doffed his hat a secondbest and muchbattered old thing with its gilt lace gone verdigris green foxs wasnt a whit better just thinking that in point of fact lt fox quipped so the usual winds still norwesterly were beamreaching as anyone can clearly see course noreast half east and making six agonisingly slow knots whats for breakfast scrambled eggs cheese and biscuit speaking of usual lt farley replied has the captain determined whether well exercise at the greatguns this morning hasnt said yet lt fox replied letting a yawn escape him damme i was hoping for hot porridge do we drill on the artillery id prefer a steadier point of sail aye this rolld be a bugger lt farley agreed well i leave you to it dick fox said cheering up i relieve you sir lt farley said with another doff of his hat and the second officer along with his midshipmen of the watch and the starboard watch of the quarterdeck and afterguard were scrambling below some to their breakfasts some to the uncertain warmth of the gundeck right aft and just below the quarterdeck in the greatcabins captain alan lewrie was shaving or trying to it was not a chore comfortably or safely done in such a wallowing rolling seaway in the small mirror of his washhand stand with a straight razor lewrie had to brace himself like a runner frozen in midstride his left leg behind him and his right in front balancing from one to the other as thermopylae heaved from beam to beam like a metronome about fifteen degrees or better to each roll he could have sat himself down in a chair but would be without the mirror or the small enamelled basin that held his single pint of water ration for washing daily get out of it ye bloody little lewrie snapped as chalky the younger and spryer of his cats leaped atop the washhand stand for the third time fascinated in equal measure by the lapping water in the basin and his reflection in the mirror shoo scat pettus sir his cabin steward replied carefully hiding his smile isnt there some amusement ye could offer him lewrie griped ill take him sir pettus offered coming to scoop up the white and greysplotched cat and bear him away spraddled atop his forearm an instant later and it was toulon the bigger and older and clumsier blackandwhite torn that wished to see what had taken chalkys attention but his leap was just a tad off blame it on the roll and he went tumbling back to the deck with the hand towel in his paws mrrf he carped tail bottled up in disgrace then marr as he looked up plaintively at lewrie as if to ask if hed seen that flub i still love ye tdeath toulon lewrie commiserated bending down to retrieve the hand towel and give the embarrassed cat a wubbie or two he had to grin for there had been scrapedoff shaving soap on the towel and toulon had gotten some of it on his whiskers which made him go slightly crosseyed trying to see it and swipe it off sitting up rabbitfashion and whacking away with both paws thermopylae rose up to a rare scending wave and heaved another slow roll to starboard timbers masts and windward stays groaning in concert and lewrie halfstaggered almost to amidships before catching himself mine arse on a bandbox he hissed under his breath using one of his favourite expressions that stagger involved some complicated foot stamping which only drove the cat under the starboardside settee into relative darkness where toulon could blink in shame and in umbrage consulting his cat gods the larboard roll took lewrie back to the washhand stand where he took a firm grip with one hand and braced himself for another stab at shaving um might you need me to do it for you sir pettus asked no no pettus lewrie countered with a false grin on his phyz done for meself for years in worse weather than this dined out on my dexterity if you say so sir pettus replied with a dubious expression once hed scraped his whiskers as close as he dared without cutting his own throat lewrie swabbed his face tied his neckstock and donned his uniform coat he made a careful way forrud to the diningcoach and his table and his breakfast it was a banyan day without any saltmeat issue and after a miserable two months on blockade a paltry and dull breakfast it was there was oatmeal porridge boiled up in water not milk and livened with a daub of rancid butter and a largish dollop of strawberry preserves there was a slab of cheese from his own stores not that crumbling dryassawdust navy issue so beloved of the victualling board but even that was beginning to go over though showed no signs of red worms yet and there was ships biscuit lewrie had purchased extrafine for himself but it was tough going even after being soaked in water for the better part of an hour before being served and did he wish to keep his remaining teeth hed chew it hellishcareful there was coffee at least with sugar grated off a cone from his locking caddy and sweet goats milk from the nanny up forrud in the manger lewrie turned his eyes towards the cats dish at the far end of his table where a reassured toulon and a cocky chalky were having their own porridge laced with cutup sausages and jerkied beef and felt a trifle envious with his second pipinghot cup of coffee lewrie considered one more biscuit and peered into the bread barge just in time to see the weevils crawling out of the last piece no thankee he thought ill be on deck pettus lewrie said shoving back from his plate and rising shove me into my boatcloak and im off captains on deck midshipman tillyard announced to one and all as lewrie trotted up the larboard gangway ladder from the waist morning sir tillyard added with a hand to his hat and a dullun mister tillyard lewrie replied his own right hand touching the front of his cocked hat good morning to you mister farley anything of interest to report good morning captain no nothing of interest so far sorry to say the first officer told him lewrie began to pace the windward side of the quarterdeck with farley inboard of him the masthead lookouts have reported seeing some of those canal barges under sail behind the dikes every now and then but i cant imagine a way to get at them not through those shoals yonder seemed an organised sort o thing lewrie asked or merely a civilian barge or two weve gathered theyre singletons sir swanning along slowly in both directions lt farley said in answer as they reached the flag lockers and taffrail lanthorns right aft forcing them both to turn inwards and reverse their course one or two with washing strung up and women aboard and not more than two of those could be described as being close together dull as dutchmen lewrie decided aloud with a sigh unfortunately sir lt farley agreed deadboresome lewrie said further indeed sir farley said with a nod im so bored lewrie admitted a cutter could perform this duty better a frigates wasted on close blockade i fear we all are sir bored that is farley told him ah about drill on the greatguns sir not with this bloody rolling mister farley not today wed be safer at pike and cutlass work and musketry aye lewrie said in suddenly brighter takings one hour o cut an thrust then an hour o musketry at a towed keg very good sir lt farley said with a relieved grin deck there a lookout on the mainmast crosstrees shouted down cutter off th larboard quarter hull up an makin signal no moren eight or nine miles off lewrie decided to himself as he turned to peer to windward even from the deck he could faintly make out a dingy white triangle of saila set of triangular jibs and a gaffrigged foreandaft mainsl barely peeking from behind the jibswith a tiny splotch of colour at her masthead that presumably was a national ensign perhaps the lookout had better eyes to espy the even tinier signal hoist from so far away aloft with you mister pannabaker lt farley ordered one of the younger midshipmen of the forenoon watch and mind you dont drop the glass aye sir young pannabaker thermopylaes cockiest younker piped up in reply scrambling for a long telescope then hopping atop the weather bulwarks for the mizermast shrouds quick as a cat and as agile as an ape he was at the mizen top then to its crosstrees in a dozen eyeblinks come to spell us oned hope lewrie said with a yawn rocking impatiently on the balls of his booted feet shes the osprey sir pannabaker shouted down in his thin and high voice this months private signal and have despatches sir mister tillyard do you hoist acknowledged to osprey and i spose well just loaf along as were already doing til shes close aboard aye aye sir hmm sir lt farley commented drawing lewries attention to his first lieutenant whose face bore a pensive wolfish grin it was not the done thing to speculate but id not get my hopes up mister farley lewrie had to say to him the baltic powersve had quite enough of us the dutch cant put a rowing boat regatta to sea and are the french out i doubt theyve business in the north sea oned wish but he concluded with a shrug they also serve who only stand and wait i suppose sir lt farley replied seeming to slump into his tarpaulin coat indeed lewrie said with a very bored grimace chapter two hms osprey was a saucylooking little thing a singlemasted cutter that could spread a lone topsl yard above her gaff mainsail if the wind was right by the number of her closed gunports she mounted no more than eight pounders and was a lieutenants command she might have been brightpainted tarred and oiled at one time but one year in the sometimes boisterous north sea had taken the shine off her now shewas a dowdy scow and even her sails had gone oldparchment brown she drew alongside of thermopylae about a cable to windward and sent her jollyboat over with her despatches under the command of one of her midshipmen and a boat crew of five i will come to your larboard entryport sir the midshipman shouted to the quarterdeck sporting a cheeky windreddened grin on his face no need for ceremony for the likes of me usually officerseven the lowest sort of petty officers as midshipmen were greeted at the starboard entryport the port of honour welcomed with a sideparty and bosuns calls in this case though as soon as the oarsmen in the jollyboat had hoisted up their dripping oars and the bow man had hooked onto the mainchains with a gaff pole the midshipman was scrambling up the boardingbattens to the temporarily opened port in the larboard bulkwarks and stayed just long enough to doff his hat to the flag to the quarterdeck and to lewrie whom he espied waiting impatiently then handed over a single foldedover letter to lt farley a second later and he was clomping down the battens judging his moment and dropping back into the row boat to return to osprey waving his hat chearly as he put its tiller over and got his oarsmen back to work how odd sir lt farley commented as he came to the quarterdeck from the larboard sailtending gangway and handing over the lone despatch i expected a weighted bag fresh mail from home what the devil lewrie wondered for the letter though sealed with wax where the folds met was not addressed to him nor to thermopylae but bore a cryptic number eleven of twentyone in smaller longhand script was the caution captains eyes only ah hum lewrie said ill be below mister farley carry on with cutlass drill once seated at his desk in his daycabin lewrie broke the seal and unfolded the letter sir admiralty has informed us that a cessation of hostilities between great britain and france as well as all her allies has been agreed to by all parties the preliminary articles were signed in london on the st of october with ratifications exchanged on the th and our sovereign his majesty king george iii issuing a proclamation of peace by sea and land on the th of this month from the receipt of this letter you are directed and required to commit no aggression towards any national ships or merchant vessels of france or the batavian republic nor any formerly hostile vessels you may encounter do you currently hold any prize such vessel or vessels must be despatched to an admiralty court for a swift adjudication should you hold any naval or civilian officers or sailors from said prize or prizes they are to be sent in with said prize or prizes on parole or from a vessel not made prize but burned or sunk they are to be landed ashore with all due honours and all their properties for adm viscount duncan oh jesus lewrie dared mutter after reading that for a quick second time it cant be it simply cant dont those fools in london know were winnin a year or two more and christ ye cant trust the french tkeep it not for long sir pettus said from the wee pantry built rightaft of the chartspace you need something sir guy fawkes ttorch parliament pettus lewrie growled back the henheadsve gone and signed articles of peace with the frogs wars over sir pettus said with a gawp if it aint a sly trick aye lewrie grumbled the wars over before christmas we all might be paid off and beached does it hold mine arse on a bandbox thermopylae paid off an laid up inordinary lewrie silently gloomed still squirming with sullen anger me all of us paid off too on halfpay with nothin tdo but go home oh fuck me lewrie had a mental picture of the village of anglesgreen and north surrey in midwinter at christmastide of him sipping ale at the olde ploughman for he still would be as unwelcome at the fashionable red swan as a whore in church just as he would be goggled at did he attend the divine services at mossy nosehigh old st georges parish church he fantasised just how long this peace might hold and if he thought that dull blockade duty was boresome it didnt have a patch on farming animal husbandry or even pretending to know what he was about at civilian pursuits at home in anglesgreen with his wife caroline foreverbloodymore by god it wasnt just the chill of a midoctober rainy day that made him shiver he scooped up his boatcloak and hat and headed out for the quarterdeck once more mister farley pipe all hands do ye please he ordered and as he waited for the ships people offwatch to thunder up to join the onwatch hands lewrie gazed off the larboard bows to wee hms osprey already more than a league away and making a pretty way on up the dutch coast for the next warship in the close blockade to relay her supposedly glad tidings it was cold it was nippy the sea was crosspatch and dollops of cold water showered down to plop on his hat and shoulders with each roll or shudder of topsls and tgallants but of a sudden it was a joy one he feared hed lose and never recover ships compny off hats and face aft to hark to the captain lt farley directed at least theyll be glad enough lewrie told himself as he began to speak theyve something tgo home to chapter three of course the happy homecoming didnt happen right away admiralty justifiably leery of french intentions was loath to reduce the fleet quickly even though the wish to save funds and reduce annual expenditures on the navys maintenance pressed some returns and decommissionings ships of the line were the first to depart the oldest and weariest s s and s of british third rate or those warships bought in after capture from their foes no it was the gun twodeckers of the line which were the standard and should war break out again the older smaller ships might never be put back in commission yet even after the weakest and oldest were gone from the north sea fleet it was not a fortnight later that the s were called home too leaving the frigates brigs of war and older sloops of war to carry the burden of showing the flag with twomasted lighter despatch sloops and singlemasted cutters to bear orders and mail back and forth it could be worse lewrie could conjure with growing impatience we could be in the indian ocean or the china seas even a fast packet or frigate might require six months to bear word to royal navy units on faroff stations those ordered out to distant oceans before the peace articles were ratified those still cruising halfway round the world just naturally would assume that the war was still on and would attack any enemy national ship they encountered make prize of any enemy merchantman and what the courtsmartial might make of those engagements and what the prize courts could demand as damages from unwitting captains was best not thought about at least lewrie and hms thermopylae had learned of the peace in a matter of days even ships on the north american station at halifax the west indies station on jamaica or the leeward islands station at english harbour antigua or the squadrons at gibraltar might not know for another four or six weeks after october so thermopylae still cruised through the rest of october and well into november her stores slowly diminishing and the north sea ever a beast growing colder and windier and the winter winds howling over the many wide and shallow banks to stir up truly immense seas in bilious greygreen rollers whitedecked and shattering alongside in icy sheets of spray theyve forgotten were here lewrie glumly thought one afternoon as his crewmen struggled to strike topmasts and reef in gasket and lower upper yards almost to bare poles or that bastard nepean does know and means tpunish me past epiphany drogue is ready sir lt farley reported looking half like a drowned rat in his sodden tarpaulins see to its deploying mister farley lewrie ordered even more of a drowned rat in a camphorandrottinghide reek of his own for it was so chilly hed had to dig out some of his furs from the solo dash into the baltic weeks before the battle of copenhagen the frigate had thrashed out fifteen miles to seaward from the shoals of the dutch coast before the gale had turned into a shrieking norwesterly storm against which thermopylae could make no progress their only choice was to lieto under trysails and a thricereefed main topsl letting out a canvas seaanchor to check her inexorable drift sternward towards those sand and mud shoals til the storm blew itself out and pray that it did before they were run aground and wrecked pray most earnestly the bare yards will act like sails lt farley hopefully said peering upward gainst a wind like this well quite so mister farley lewrie replied though still wondering if sir evan nepean the longtime first secretary to admiralty no fan of his who had served the former first lord the earl spencer and now served admiral lord st vincent old jarvy might not wish that he come a cropper nepean had despised him more than cold boiled mutton for years and lewries acquittal at kings bench for the crime of stealing a dozen black jamaican field slaves to man his old ship must have set nepeans teeth grinding in frustration could nepean be that petty lewrie asked himself for damned sure i certainly could be full trick for the quartermasters on the helm sir lewrie snapped as the buoyed seaanchor was paid out over the bows trouble always seems tcome with inattention when fresh hands take over very good sir the seaanchor was a modern one a large canvas cone held open with an iron barrel hoop worthy of the largest water butt weighted to keep it under the surface with a light iron boat anchor at the end of an hundredfathom cable of fourinch manila as the cable was let out it felt ineffective for the longest time til the painted buoy bobbed up about one hundred yards ahead of the bows and the cable went taut hauling thermopylaes bows closer to windward brace yards closehauled to weather on the larboard tack mister farley lewrie ordered his left hand shoved into the pocket of his fur parka with his fingers secretly crossed he had never in his naval career been reduced to using bare yards as substitutes for proper sails so it was an experiment to hima lifeordeath experiment pray god my sham doesnt catch up with me with us lewrie silently wished for he had never been one of those gladsome sailors who revelled in heavy weather had never become so thoroughly salted as a tarryhanded tarpaulin man a fearful crew should look to as their sure and certain hope of salvation in when the war with france had begun after four idle years ashore playing an equal sham of being a farmer his first daunting sight of hms cockerels intricate rigging had made lewrie quail and had left him gawping and grasping for even the proper terms to call them and many hours offwatch in his little dogsbox cabin poring in secret over his tattered copy of falconers marine dictionary and other beginners guides to keep from being revealed as an utter fraud and a cackhanded cunnythumbed dangerous lubber that seems to ease her sir lt farley said at last sounding as if hed been holding his breath to see if the seaanchor and braced bare yards would really work hows her helm lewrie asked beasley the quartermaster of the watch and his mate elgie who stood braced widestanced either side of the doublewheel drum and spokes stiff with th relievin tackle rigged sir beasley replied shifting his quid of tobacco to leeward but shes steadyin aye very well thankee lewrie said mister furlow he called for the midshipman pass word to my steward pettus and desmond my coxn and ill have my deckchair brought up aye aye sir midshipman furlow answered then stepped to the break of the empty hammock nettingsthe ships people needed their dry bedding for their scant hours belowdecks between calls for all handsand bawled the summons to men in the waist lewrie knew he could trust his first officer lt dick farley his second lieutenant james fox as well to do their best for their ship but should things go completely to shambles he felt he had to be present even if he had to engage in one more of his eccentricities a proper royal navy captain should be so stoic a paragon as to stand and pace the windward side of the quarterdeck to set a stout example and inspire confidence even did he not have the first clue lewrie though had always been an idle sort so after the canvas and wood collapsible deckchair had been fetched up spread out and lashed securely in place lewrie sat himself down in it spread a scrap of oiled canvas like a blanket to keep the sleeting showering spray off him and sprawled his booted legs out as seemingly at ease as a passenger aboard an east indiaman on a fine morning and a calmer ocean or as much at ease as a man could appear as the frigate heaved her bows skyward with showers of salt spray cascading over her then plunging like a seal with her jibboom and bowsprit and beakhead rails under and even larger bursts of whiteout clouds of spray bursting to life and the very fabric of the ship thundering juddering and groaning like a tormented ghost at each plunge or rise lewrie tucked his chin down slanted his hat firmly down atop his eyebrows and even tried closing his eyes no sir he decided after a minute of that eyes on the horizon wherever that is or ill go sick as a dog which thought made him smile in spite of the circumstances the wellcontained fear and the danger of wrecking it would not inspire confidence in the crew if he had to cast his accounts to neptune some hot broth sir pettus asked looking as if the very idea of victuals would empty his stomach too but he had to offer im fine for now pettus but thankee for asking lewrie let on with a forced smile and damn his eyes for the very mention lewrie thought feeling a brief spate of biliousness that made him belch ah hmm bloody brisk aint it mister farley amen to that sir farley shouted back sounding pleased as if he was truly one of those odduns who relished foul weather offwatch hands below now sir aye make it so mister farley let em dry out and thaw out for a spell lewrie decided hot broth for them if sauder thinks he can trust a fire in the galley i will see to it directly sir farley agreed lewrie doubted the roughness of the storm would allow fires to be lit below but perhaps the offer might mollify thermopylaes people with no recall in the offing they were sullen enough already for better or worse this storm and the risk of drowning in the surf of a dutch beach would take their minds off thoughts of decommissioning and freedom damn nepean lewrie fumed inside again as the ship shuddered and tossed and the storm showed no signs of easing itd please him did we all drown chapter four the dog watches came and went with no relenting of the storm full dark as black as a boot and the evening watch was a roaring and soaking horror so much spume spray and solid waves broke over the weather decks that the tar and oakum in the seams between the planking could not keep out a constant drizzle on sleeping offwatch men and their violently swaying hammocks from the sickberth and livestock manger under the forecastle right aft to the greatcabins the decks bore puddles that were swept to either beam and fore and aft so that the blackandwhite enamelpainted chequered canvas deck covering in lewries cabins became as slick as the marble tile design that it emulated and the good turkey or axminster carpets had long been rolled up and stowed atop the transom settee it was only at two bells of the middle watch that the winds and seas seemed to ease and the vast explosions of spray over the bows with each thundering timbercracking plunge diminished allowing lewrie to go below at last for a cold glass of tea some cheese and a couple of soaked pieces of ships biscuit eaten in the gloom of a single candle and the weevils in the biscuit considered out of sight and out of mind his bedding in the wideenoughfortwo hanging bedcot was cold and damp despite an oiled canvas covering so lewrie in all his clothes tried to nap on the starboardside collapsible settee for an hour or two it was hopeless of course for the settee was only long enough for two only deep enough for sitting and that in the proper mode of the age which was to say erect and mostly on the forward edge he ended in a sprawl with one leg up the other braced on the deck cover and thought hed wished his man pettus a rest of his own and to wake him should anyone need him before dropping off in a slouched snoring bundle by four bells though sir captain sir tis mister privette sir pettus said mmph bugger im mister foxs duty sir privette piped up as lewrie pried an eye open blinking away grit he wishes to make a tad more sail sir sail lewrie said with an uncomprehending grunt sitting up and rubbing his eyes with both hands aye sir privette added mister fox believes we could bare staysls spanker and inner jibs and begin to make a way full and by lewrie was woozy with exhaustion and lack of sleep despite his brief nap so it took him a long moment to listen to his senses the ship was no longer rising and plunging like a manic child on a hobbyhorse and the sickening roll was less the hiss and roar of the sea down the hull and the thunder of her bows meeting hard steep waves no longer made it hard to hear or speak aye lewrie allowed at last staggering to his feet tell mister fox ill come up may take a moment but he added wincing as muscles and joints toolong tensioned against the motions of the frigate complained loudly making him wonder if he had caught the longtime sailors plaints of arthritis and rheumatism both very well sir privette replied it was still cold and icy spray still sheeted cross the deck as lewrie attained the quarterdeck the sea and sky were inkblack and the only lights came from the two taffrail lanthorns another by the focsle belfry and the binnacle cabinet to illuminate the compass only now and then did the taffrail lanthorns glint off fleeting whitecaps and seahorses mostly abeam the mizen mast or astern eased has it mister fox he asked aye sir or so i do believe the second officer told him as he raised a bent finger to the brim of his hat in casual salute her motion has most certainly eased as has the velocity of the winds i wish to replace storm trysls with staysls hoist the spanker at two reefs and hoist the inner jib lewrie looked into the binnacle to discover their present course noreast wind still out of the norwest mister fox aye sir though it does show sign of backing aye hoist away lewrie decided rubbing his chin and feeling two days worth of stubble rasping with any luck full and by well be able to steer noreast by north and take in the seaanchor too he added turning to look astern for the dutch coast as if the drift might have put them close to the shoals already rate of drift nigh a mile each hour sir lt fox told him with a grimace then carry on sir carry on smartly lewrie urged they had set out the seaanchor about three in the previous afternoon and if theyd drifted stemward a mile per hour sinceit took lewrie another long moment to do the simple math in his woozy headthat meant eleven hours of drifting and theyd only been fifteen miles off holland when theyd begun mercifully for the weary and groggy hands hoisting jibs and staysls and baring the spanker at two reefs could be done by the sailors of the current watch not an all hands manoeuvre requiring men to go aloft at their peril the offwatch people could sleep in as best they could under the circumstances and be a tad fresher when the watch changed at am hoisting was fairly easy it was sheeting home to cup that stillboisterous wind that would cause the hernias lewrie stood out of the way by the aftermost shrouds of the mainmast crossing his fingers as the afterguard hoisted and reefed the spanker with but a bit more sail exposed thermopylae was forced to heel a few more degrees to leeward but after putting her shoulder to the sea she felt stiffer and no longer rolled to larboard like a metronome no the ship came fully upright with each windward roll and seemed steadier he looked overside to the ambertinted glimmers of lanthornlight on the heaving wave crests the wind drove them by as they chopped and broke upon themselves making it seem as if the frigate was making way but was she lewrie staggered aft towards the crossdeck hammock nettings at the forrud edge of the quarterdeck peering outboard hoping two and a quarter knots sir midshipman plumb called out in a thin piping voice from the taffrails bow lookouts lewrie bellowed through a brass speakingtrumpet is the seaanchor cable taut slack sir one shouted aft runnin up on th buoy sir cried another just thankee jesus lewrie said under his breath then turned to lt fox take in the seaanchor sir fore we run her under the forefoot he uncrossed his fingers with a whoosh of pented breath grinning for the first time since midday even at a bare two knots good to windward they could be eight miles clear of the dutch shoals by the change of watch watch your luff mister hook mister slater lt fox warned cant hold her head noreast sir the quartermaster shouted winds veerin on us he and his mate slater heaved on the spokes of the wheel easing a full quarter turn of helm leeward steady on noreast by east sir best shell manage sailin parallel tholland not makin searoom then lewrie thought with a groan well have ttack stiff as the winds are and hope for the best the winds were too stiff and the spray too thick to spread a chart on the traverse board in the dark the best lewrie could do was picture the chart in his mind and groan again as he realised that should they continue on this course theyd encounter those islands east of the texel vlieland and terschelling noreast of den helder and harlingen that jutted northwards smack on their bows well have to tack mister fox lewrie said about the same time that lt fox opened his mouth to suggest the same thing grimacing again loose another reef in the spanker pipe all hands and shake a reef from the main topsl as well so we can build up enough speed tget her round without gettin caught in irons aye aye sir bosun pipe all hands fox yelled five bells chimed before all was ready before thermopylae had accelerated to five knots and stations for stays had been piped despite the heavy weather and the continual shipping of seas over the bow the larboard hawse buckler for the best bower had been removed and the heavyweather lashings on that anchor freed with a cable of thighthick rope affixed to the anchor stock and bound about the capstan men in hawse breeches swung lead lines from either channel of the foremast just in case the thermopylae could not cross the eye of the wind and the seabottom might be close enough for them to anchorto save the ship from drifting helplessly shoreward if unable to tack or to try to boxhaul her over to starboard tack so they could sail away even if it meant cutting the bower cable and losing it altogether ready sir lt fox reported it was still his watch though all watchstanding officers and midshipmen were on deck along with the sailing master mr robert lyle and his mates pick your moment mister fox lewrie allowed i have every confidence in you thankee sir and i dont trust myself tchoose it lewrie wryly told himself pay her off half a point loord mister hook lt fox said half a point loord aye sir chiplog mister plumb fox shouted aft smartly now five and uh five and a half knots sir the young midshipman shouted back after a long minute or two to toss out the log turn the sandglass check the line measure the knotmarks and report good as itll get right mister fox lewrie asked aye sir ready about lt fox bellowed through a speakingtrumpet ready ready ease down the helm god only knows her trim lewrie queasily thought watching the helm spin round noting the faint trembling of the spokes as regular as the works of a good pocketwatch that bespoke a decent balance to the ship despite the shifting and consumption of stores and all the water shed shipped aboard over the long day and night helms alee lt fox shouted forward over in the name of the lord the sailing master said in the old usage of the fisheries rise tacks and sheets lt fox yelled the afterguard hauled taut the lee spanker topping lift the main topsls clew garnets were hauled up and the jibs and staysls windward sheets were hauled taut the lee sheets binds round the belays undone yet held firmly waiting for the proper moment when the bows were right up to the eyes of the wind and they luffed and shivered come up ye darlin lass come up i say quartermaster hook crooned as he and slater let go the spokes and watched them almost blur as the wheel spun even with relieving tackles rigged belowdecks a sure sign that thermopylae would go up to the wind ardently shes goin t make it lewrie exulted haul taut mainsl haul fox all but screeched haul of all it was so dark it was impossible to see the bows sweep round see the proper trim of the sails or the yardcloths to mark the angle of the yards but one could feel her lift on the fiercescending sea stark upright for a long moment then begin to heel to larboard feel the wind as it shifted from rightahead to ones right cheek hear the rustling crackle of icystiff canvas as it whooshed over the deck the groan of starboard sheets as they took the new strain then a second whump and whoosh as they and the reefed main tops filled with wind and bellied out as stiff as sheet metal ease her ease her there helm down half a point loord thermopylae shook herself like a wet dog heeled hard onto her larboard side for a moment then came back more upright steadying with the deck canted about twenty degrees from plumb according to the inclinometer on the binnacle cabineton starboard tack steerin west by north half north sir quartermaster hook cried with relief as he and slater steadied her up another cast of the log mister plumb lewrie ordered about two minutes later midshipman plumb could report the good news that thermopylae was now making three knots i think shell bear the main topmast staysl and the middle staysl mister fox lewrie opined aloud and id admire did ye add the fore topsl and mizen topsl at three reefs aye sir a perfect tack mister fox lewrie congratulated him timed to a tee uhm thankee for saying so sir lt fox said tucking in his chin and ducking his head in modesty false or otherwise permission to mount the quarterdeck sirs lt eades their marine officer enquired now all the excitements done you did not wish to get in the way during the manoeuvre sir lewrie asked him now in much better relieved takings i leave all that to proper seamen captain sir lt eades said with a grin as he came to amidships forward of the helm besides we had some scraps of yesterdays breaded and toasted cheese and i admit all the tossing about made me feel peckish hungry in this weather sir lewrie said with a gawp well aye sir eades admitted with the galley shut down didnt everyone the ships rats and mister eades own constitutions are of much the same nature sir lt farley japed they can eat anything at any time with no ill effects no sense in drowning hungry lt eades said with a shrug i do though gather that drowning is no longer an immediate threat aye and if the weather continues to moderate well all have hot breakfasts by midmorning lt farley told him good ho was eadess joy at that news nigh as dense as a milepost lewrie thought shaking his head in wonder but hell do hms thermopylae continued on her course of west by north half north til dawn and beyond as the winds eased and the seas moderated slowly adding sail til she was making a good six knots by two bells of the forenoon watch am it was judged safe to light the galley fires and serve up a late breakfast for one and all the low clouds lifted a bit and lightened in colour and the rain ceased not that it made much difference belowdecks for the seams still dribbled water here and there after all the flexing and strain put on the hull and the planking by the storm and if lewrie sat halfway down his dining table he could find a dry spot to drink several very welcome cups of hot coffee and spoon up hot porridge the ships motion was even steady enough to allow him a shave then back on deck in clean dry linen sloptrousers and uniform and feeling human for the first time in days he could dispense with both furs and tarpaulins for the temperature was just about warm enough to be stood with his coat doubled over and buttoned sail ho a lookout shouted down to the deck two points off th larboard bows midshipman furlow was sent aloft with a glass to report and moments later he shouted down that she was a cutter one of theirs to boot the muchbelaboured osprey she signals have despatches sir furlow cried very well mister furlow lewrie shouted back then turned to the taffrails mister pannabaker send her come under my lee id imagine shed welcome our shelter if shes been through the same weather weve suffered osprey quickly replied acknowledged by flag hoist and steered for thermopylae one hour later she had come almost abeam to larboard came about to starboard tack and eased into thermopylaes lee off her larboard quarter to lower a boat and send her across it was sickmaking to watch poor hms osprey pitch and toss even so or to watch her rowing boat rise swoop and fall amid showers of spray from wave crests and whitecaps til the boat was closeaboard and the very same midshipman from midoctober came scrambling up the battens and manropes to the larboard entryport and handed over his canvas bag of mail and orders with a brief doff of his hat he was back in his boat in a twinkling making way back to his wee cutter mister furlow pass word for my clerk mister georges lewrie instructed as he took the bag well sort everything out then pipe the crew to receive theirs aye sir he didnt feel all that hopeful though the canvas bag was not weighted first of all as it would be to prevent secret instructions or orders for future operations from being taken by an enemy second there wasnt much mail to sort out lewrie and his clerk piled what contents there were into three quick heaps officers and warrants in one pile seamen in the second and his own in the third with the official letters the first to be opened and read before anyone else got a peek at theirs the one that took lewries attention first off was from admiralty this time properly addressed to him and hms thermopylae with a penknife he sliced off the wax wafer seal and unfolded it hallelujah at last he muttered a broad smile breaking out on his phyz see to the rest georges ill go on deck once there he ordered actinglieutenant sealey to have all hands piped then paced along the forrud edge of the quarterdeck by the iron stanchions of the hammock nettings which were now filled til everyone both on and offwatch was gathered in the waist on the sailtending gangways and the forecastle i trust you ladsve dried out thawed out and eat a flllin breakfast at last hey he began in a loud quarterdeck voice we have orders from admiralty lads we are required and directed to make the best of our way we all know that meanspull yer bloody finger out and get a move on he japed which raised a laugh to sheerness and the nore a few days west of here there to lay his majestys ship thermopylae inordinary to land ashore all of her artillery and small arms to consign to his majestys dockyards all stores not yet consumed with a strict accounting to be he was drowned out by the tremendous cheer that erupted but he didnt have to say more or cite more from the officialese of those orders it was not like he was reading himself in as postcaptain or standing beside another who would relieve him mister sealey mister lyle sirs lewrie bellowed at last as the din died down a bit shape the most direct course for the nore sirs and lay us upon it we are going home lads were going home book i quid sofutis est beatius curis cum mens onus reponit ac peregrino labore fessi venimus larem ad nostrum desideratque acquiescimus lecto o what is more blessed than to put cares

pounder gun reams of it from the victualling board as they took possession of all consumable stores butts kegs and tuns of saltbeef or saltpork of hard ships biscuit weevilly or otherwise spoiled or fresh saltmeat marked condemned as too rancid to be eaten would lewrie was mortalcertain be dumped into new kegs to be foisted on some unwitting captain in the future their motto at the victualling board was waste not want not spare upper masts and yards were sent ashore to the warehouses first then sails and cordage and all bosuns stores and lumber the frigate was stripped down to her fighting tops and main lower trunks of her masts to a gantline the magazine was carefully emptied of kegs of gunpowder premade flannel cartridge bags already filled and bales of empty bags all meticulously indented for and counted next went the artillery the pounder main guns the lighter pounder bow chasers the pounder carronades and the quarterdeck pounders along with their truckcarriages guntools flintlock strikers and all breeching ropes and handling tackle blocks heavy barges from gun wharf spent two days rowing back and forth to bear all the guns away leaving thermopylae high in the water and her weather decks the focsle the quarterdeck and lewries greatcabins yawningly bare and empty by the end of the first week of december there was no more need of crew for there was nothing left to remove with muscle power and no reason to keep her manned clerks and paymasters from the port admiral came out to muster the hands to issue them their pay chits that required another chestful of paperwork for every sailor owed the navy something right from the moment hed been pressed or had taken the joining bounty deductions had been carefully kept by the purser mr herbert pridemore and his jackinthebreadroom clerk of every quid of tobacco issued each wool jacket blanket each pair of shoes and stockings each broken plate or mug each wornout shirt or pair of trousers the surgeon mr harward offered his own list of treatments beyond the usual a dubious mercury cure for venereal disease was fifteen shillings to be deducted when the rare chance for pay to be issued occurred surgeon mr harward and the purser had their own accounts to square for though they might hold admiralty warrant they could be considered as independent contractors to be reimbursed for goods medicines or services expended were they not allowed a profit it would be almost impossible to lure anyone to the posts as thermopylaes captain lewrie was held to the most acute accounting with reams of forms to be filled out and admiralty satisfied that each item marked as lost or broken each cable of rope rigging used up each sail blown out or torn in heavy weather each backstay shifted since the moment hed read himself inall tallied with what hed received and what remained to be landed ashore at the instant of his frigates decommissioning at the instant of his surrender of command with penalties deducted from his own pay owing if he had been remiss the weather was cold there was a faint swirl of snow falling so the musteringout was held below on the gundeck each man came forward as his name was called there was much hemming and ahumming twixt the purser the surgeon and the shore clerks before a chit was filled out and a final sum announced carefully noting whether a sailor had dependents to whom hed authorised a deduction already for their support whilst he was away at sea theyll be cheated of course poor devils a senior clerk from the port admirals offices muttered to lewrie as they watched the proceedings from the door to the officers gunroom the chatham chest deductions for widows men the jobbers lewrie sombrely agreed most of them will never see the councillor of the cheque but will sell off their chits for half their value to the first jobber they meet the senior clerk said with a sniff of disdain for the practice selling them off was cheaper and more convenient than travelling to london for the whole sum owing a wad of paper fiat money and a hefty handful of real nowrare solid coin was simply too tempting to a tar who hadnt seen moneyreal moneysince his ship had set sail years before even if was but a pittance of what a man earned aye and theyll drink up half o that the first evnin lewrie added find a whore and a tavern and end up crimped on a merchantman only trade most ofem know really the sea aye poor fellows the senior clerk said with a grave sad nod and another sniff though he added with a wry grin if the war begins again theyll be much easier to find and press back into the fleet hmm uhm captain lewrie sir a fubsy official from the dockside warehouses interrupted your pardon gentlemen do i intrude upon a conversation but i do not see these iron stoves listed as naval property and i must have a proper accounting of everything aboard they arent navy issue sir lewrie informed him captain speaks whom i relieved when he fell ill had purchased them for the crews comfort for service in the north sea winters most charitable and considerate of him i vow sir but i cannot accept them into admiralty possession these two there are four actually lewrie further informed him one in the gunroom here and one in my cabins as well mostly to keep his pet parrot from freezin t death i imagine four sir four my word he was profligate the fubsy old fellow vowed scratching his scalp under his wig with a pencil stub and the coal well why there must be at least two hundredweight bagged up to boot what am i to do with it all sir leave em for the standing officers lewrie hopefully suggested tsee em through the winter once thermopylae was officially decommissioned mr pridemore the purser mr dimmock the bosun lumsden the ships carpenter the master gunner mr tunstall and the ships cook sauder would watch over her in the sheerness ordinary along with a small crew of other shipkeepers to manage her maintenance paid by the dockyard at their full payrate for as long as their frigate sat at anchor for as long as admiralty deemed her valuable enough to keep in reserve wives and children would accompany them of course unless those worthies asked for transfer to a new construction wangled an exchange with another shipkeeper in a navy port more desirable to them or outright retired from service they had full employment til thermopylae rotted away or was stricken and sent to the breakers indeed theyd been assigned to thermopylae even as she had been constructed on the stocks and were hers for the ships entire life quite impossible captain lewrie the dockyard official poohpoohed for without a regular issue of coal with which to stoke them absent the kindling and firewood issued for the galley theyre useless and his majestys dockyards are not responsible for the cost stow em on the orlop then and let the next captain sort it out lewrie replied sensing that there was bad news coming franklinpattern iron stoves are not carried on our books as naval property sir and must be removed ashore the official pressed if as you say the former captain purchased them at his own expense then they remain his property and should quite properly be sent on to him wherever he may be oh good god lewrie thought wondering how much thatd cost for he had no idea whether captain speaks had survived his pneumonia or where he resided if he had lands end john o groats lewrie speculated worrying what the carting fee would be for four heavy metal stoves all that way his own carting charges would be steep enough to bear away all his furniture wine and spirits remaining his tableware chests and boxes and there were all the luxury goods the dainties that those russian counts rybakov and levotchkin had left aboard when hed landed them close to st petersburg theyd bought as if preparing for a sixmonth voyage to china on an indiaman not a twoweek dash up the baltic and devil take the cost to boot there were twogallon stone crocks fivegallon wooden barricoes and costly cased bottles of vintage wines and champagnes crocks of caviar bags of coffee beans cocoa beans and assorted caddied tea leaves by the tenpound lot along with lashings of vodka and gin of course so much that he might clear a nice profit in selling most of it off once he got to london why the brandies the rarely seen expensive liqueurs could fetch a shall we say for now sir that the stoves are of a piece with your personal stores and will be removed when yours are landed sir the rotund older fellow decided for them with an oily little smile just damn my eyes lewrie muttered but had to nod an assent were the stoves still aboard a week from now after his own departure thered be hell to pay and a full two years worth of angry letters flying back and forth til someone claimed them most satisfactory sir the dockyard official beamed ill be in my cabins lewrie announced i leave it to you sirs to continue the musteringout pray inform me when youre done and ill say a few last words the boats will be alongside by by two bells of the day watch sir the port admirals senior clerk assured him a final clear decks and upspirits lewrie decided later than usual but later gentlemen lewrie decided meaning a last issue of rum full measure for all with no sippers or gulpers given to his crew to splice the mainbrace just one last time chapter six as if things werent gloomy enough no sooner had lewrie gotten to his cabins now almost stripped of all his goods and filled with piles of chests crates and boxes than he had to deal with pettus his steward and whitsell his twelveyearold cabin boy hot coffee and a dollop of brandy with sir pettus offered his own canvas bag his tightrolled bedding and hammock and his seachest before the door of the wee pantry thankee pettus lewrie replied taking a welcome sip uhm sir might you be needing my services ashore once the payingoff is done pettus asked rather tentatively i do need a man aye pettus are you of a mind lewrie told him couldnt ask for a better really well sir id rather not if you could find another pettus replied looking cuttyeyed for i was of a mind to go to portsmouth to look up nan if shes still employed there ive a fair amount of pay due me enough to keep me for a time before taking service with some household and and take up with the girl where you left off aye i see if you need a letter of recommendation lewrie said thatd be most welcome sir thank you pettus said perking up with relief sorry to let you down sir but twas only drink and the press gang that made a sailor of me an accident that not in my usual nature if its peace i dont intend to go to sea again ill write it for you right now lewrie said going to what little was left of his desk in his daycabin there to find whitsell idly playing with toulon and chalky and looking hangdog miserable c could ye pen one fer me too sir whitsell plaintively enquired ill need a place meself without the navy wee whitsell was an orphan a street waif whod been begging on the streets of yarmouth when captain speakss recruiting rondy in a pierside tavern had scooped him up almost two years before whitsell had eat his best meals his only regular meat aboard ship and had no prospects in civilian life except for poverty starvation and exploitation aye one for you as well whitsell lewrie promised back to yarmouth will pettus asked the lad well i dunno whitsell waffled looking down at his scuffling shoes might come to portsmouth with me pettus suggested grinning a gentlemans servant and a page or linkboy together or mister nettles nettles lewrie asked intent on his writing hes a standing offer as head cook for a posting house in his old town sir pettus told him in ipswich nettles might have need of an assistant an apprentice will learn to be what the french call a chef it aint a bad life head of a grand kitchen with grub on either hand whenever you like hey aye id like that whitsell exclaimed beaming with joy and avarice for hot vittles ya kin stay warm in kitchens hell be missed by god lewrie told them ive never eat so well aboard any ship at sea in my life there came a rap on the deck outside his cabin door lt eades and his marine detachment had departed days before so one of the ships corporals either duncan or luck now stood guard over his privacy th coxn an landsman furfy tsee th capm sir enter lewrie bade in a loud voice in came liam desmond a darkhaired blueeyed black irishman and his longtime mate the overgrown great pudding patrick furfy both were turned out as fresh as sunday divisions in taped short sailors jackets flat tarred hats in their hands clean chequered shirts snowy white sloptrousers and their shoregoing best blacked buckled shoes and clean stockings beggin th captains

see im minded that yeve a farm where a brace o stout hard workersd be welcome if yeve beasties furfy heres yer man sor he could charm a chargin bull to a kitten for so ive seen him done sure sor you wouldnt enter a merchantman desmond lewrie asked as he sat back in his chair and took a sip of his laced coffee he felt an urge to smile for desmond was laying on the auld brogue thick as he usually did when working a fiddle or talking himself or furfy out of trouble or take the opportunity to go back to ireland for a spell see your home folk he asked with a solemn face instead faith sor dear as wed desire tsee erin agin well sor desmond said with a brief appalled expression and a disarming shrug they may be ah some back home whod take exception tth sight o us do ye git me meanin sor so that

matter of fact desmond pettus here just told he that he plans to swallow the anchor and take civilian domestic service back in portsmouth so i do have need of a man lewrie told him as for furfy though desmond swelled with happy anticipation though he got a frown on his face when lewrie mentioned his mate youre good with horses furfy with all manner of beasts wi me mams pigs an chickens sor furfy piped up almost pleading to convince him sharing a worried look with desmond that he might be separated from him an me first job o work when i was but a lad was stableman capm sor nursed many a horse

club then down to surrey i trust that anglesgreen wont be too rustic for you its a small and quiet place only the two taverns the last i know of it and im not welcome in one of em theyve a good local ale sor furfy asked a hellishgood ale furfy lewrie assured him fine with us sor desmond exclaimed sealing the bargain barely had desmond and furfy turned to go when there came another rap outside his door mister harper from the port admirals office tsee the capm sir enter the senior official ducked under the overhead deck beams as he clumped aft to lewries desk the musteringout is done sir very well mister harper lewrie said taking a peek at the face of his pocketwatch just as one bell of the day watch was struck up forrud at the belfry coffee with a splash of brandy thatd be most welcome sir welcome indeed harper said with joy rubbing chilled hands together in anticipation no matter those modern franklinpattern stoves a few feet away from them and the cold belowdecks could be a damp misery pettus a laced coffee for mister harper then pass word to the first lieutenant lewrie instructed he is to have all hands piped then clear decks and upspirits the pursers parsimony bedamned he added with a grin aye sir this damnable peace with the frogs wont last harper griped after a deep sip and an appreciative sigh not above a year lewrie sourly agreed the only reason bonaparte asked for peace was to regather his forces build up his navy again after the way weve savaged it since ninetythree perhaps two years captain lewrie harper countered after all hes a lot of building and rebuilding to do and a proper navy is like rome not built in a single day aye two years then lewrie gloomed refit what he already has and get them to sea in early spring drill and train their officers and sailors at sea for a change stead of harbour drill send squadrons round the world to reclaim all the colonies weve conquered so far i havent seen a newspaper yet regarding what we are to surrender to them have you nothing official yet no mr harper admitted though i am sure we must restore all french west indies islands cape town and all that to the dutch the guyanas in south america too lord when the war erupts well have to do it all over again senseless plain senseless makes one dearly miss pitt as prime minister lewrie scoffed even henry dundas as secretary of state for war the arrogant coxcomb they both took deep sips of their drinks in silence for a bit each wondering why the new administration had felt it necessary to end the war when england held the upper hand ive only decommissioned one ship long ago mister harper so i may be a tad rusty when it comes to the details lewrie confessed now the musteringout of the crew is done what the boats come to fetch the hands off will ferry aboard an officer in charge harper told him shifting clubman fashion in his seat and crossing a leg mostlike a deserving old tarpaulin man with no future prospects he will bear orders and will read himself in as the ships new captain relieving you a fullpay retirement for some old fellow midshipman furlow sir his sentry shouted rapping the deck with a musket butt mister farleys duty sir furlow reported crisply hat under his arm and he reports that a string of oared barges are making their way to us mister farley also reports that the purser is prepared to serve out the rum ration and that the bosun is standing by to pipe the all hands and the clear decks and upspirits sir very well mister furlow lewrie said finishing his coffee and rising my compliments to mister farley and i shall be on deck directly aye aye sir the redpainted rum keg had just emerged on deck its colour and the giltpaint royal seal of the crown with the gilt letters spelling out king george iii and god bless him the only vivid sight on a bleak and grey winters day honoured much like the ark of the covenant was by the israelites it made its stately way forrud to the break of the forecastle before the belfry past able and ordinary seamen and landsmen ships servants and powder monkeys petty officers and rated men all of whom were now in a festive mood eager to depart the ship and gruelling naval service but just as eager to drink their last issue of rum to warm their short voyage to the docks any debts left lewrie cried out if there are they are to be forgiven before we go our separate ways thermopylaes will splice the mainbrace one last time that raised a great cheer i dont know if we can trust the corsican tyrant bonaparte to keep the peace for long lads he went on but if england does face a future conflict i cant imagine a surer way tkeep that snaileatin bastard awake nights than for him to know that the men of thermopylae are at sea and that eager trip the guts out of the best his navy can send against us wherever you light you can be proud of what you accomplished here aboard thermopylae lewrie told them after another great cheer had subsided im proud of you and proud that even for a short time i was permitted to be your captain dont let the job three cheers fer capm lewrie hip hip interrupted him a cup for you sir lt farley asked for this once the rum issue had made its way to the quarterdeck aye lewrie eagerly agreed and once the ships crew had settled lewrie concluded thank you kindly men i was about tsay dont let the jobbers cheat you dont spend it all the first night make sure the doxy doesnt have three hands and pick your pockets blind and go see your kin before you let yourselves get crimped to thermopylae to you and to us he shouted lifting the wee brass rum cup to his lips and tossing its contents back whole dont cough he chid himself for the neat rum with but a haporth of water to grog it this time almost made his eyes water dismiss the hands mister farley lewrie ordered once he had control of his vocal chords again aye aye sir ships company dismiss good luck and godspeed to one and all taking leave of his officers warrants and midshipmen was much more genteel handshakes and doffings of hats a brief jape or two to the younkers and wishes for good fortune promotion another active sea commission soon and hopes to serve together again someday my jackinthe breadrooms made arrangements for your cartage sir mr pridemore told lewrie and there will be a goodsized barge alongside within the hour for all your dunnage might have to make it two barges mister pridemore he had to confess the dockyard wont accept the stoves and thinks i must send them on to captain speaks at mine own expense oh really sir pridemore said brightening if that is so sir might i suggest that you leave all that to me for i have captain speakss address already and made arrangements for most of his goods to be sent on to his home in yorkshire months ago just knew itd be a long long way off lewrie told himself in point of fact sir pridemore went on two of them would be more than welcome whilst were laid up inordinary this winter if i lease them from captain speaks for my comfort and the comfort of my fellow shipkeepers it goes without saying the purser quickly added and so long as we purchase our own coal the dockyard people can have no objection dye see sir that leaves me two thaul off lewrie glumly replied well not really sir mr pridemore schemed on not if captain speaks authorises me to sell them for him so many warships laid up inordinary so many shivering shipkeepers right here in sheerness or a quick sail up to the chatham ordinary im certain their usefulness and their rarity shall allow me to turn a good profit to the benefit of captain speaks and myself of course all that is needful is for you to sign a chit consigning captain speakss property to me and alls aboveboard so to speak really thatd do it lewrie marvelled though there was the dread that pridemore was a purser a skillful man of business and trade after all and undertook nothing without a scheme to get cheap then sell dear pursers were not called nip cheeses for nothing do it admirably sir pridemore assured him and whilst we are at it i believe the russian gentlemen gifted you with nigh half a bargeload of dainties and luxury goods should you wish to dispose of some of them and save yourself the carting fee to the london market where you are certain to be scalped i assure you captain for i am a veteran and a victim of sharp practices in the city not a big market for roosky vodka mister pridemore lewrie said now sure that he might be being scalped on his own quarterdeck nor for caviar and pate in sheerness id think though and there is some of it id like to haul along home but of course sir pridemore said with a little laugh for so would i the bulk of it though i could purchase from you with the bill of sale though lewrie said reminded by the word bulk as in breaking bulk cargo unlawful for a warship to do aboard a ship made prize and the penalty for landing captured goods there are the kings custom duties to be paid do you undertake to pay them once the goods are transferred to your possession and note such in your bill of sale did i just pinch his testicles lewrie had to wonder to see a brief wince twitch pridemores face but of course sir it shall be as you say pridemore agreed lets go below and sort it all out then lewrie suggested and have my clerk georges draw up the paperwork with copies to all before i depart whew lewrie thought once bitten twice shy maybe with age wisdom does come the last thing i need is another brush with the law over smuggled goods chapter seven admiralty in london was very crowded with so many ships being decommissioned at once so much so that it had been necessary to make an appointment for a set date and time to begin the process of turning in all his ledgers forms logs punishment books and pay vouchers thankfully a fortnight shy of christmas lewrie met with the second secretary to admiralty william marsden not his nemesis sir evan nepean and the whole thing was a fairly businesslike and pleasant affair not the ordeal lewrie had expected well there was a halfhour stint in the infamous waiting room on the ground level but the tea cart was set up in the courtyard and doing a grand business with its tea lads whipping round with hot pots mugs and sticky buns rightactive lewrie had even found a pew bench seat right off after but a single glare at a midshipman whod gotten the hint and sprung from his place to accommodate a senior officer is he the same snotdrizzler i saw the last time i was here lewrie asked himself for the midshipman bore a strong resemblance to the mouthbreather with whom hed shared a bench in february damned if he aint lewrie marvelled with a faint grimace of distaste to see him snort back a twoinch worm of mucus then gulp has he been here every day since lewrie wondered shaking his head at the nohopes persistence at seeking a seaberth even as twothirds of the navy was being laid up dont he know theres a war off lewrie japed to make more room for lewrie a lieutenant shifted over a bit a very tall and painfully thin young fellow with dark hair and eyes and dressed in a shabby and worn uniform coat with a very cheap brasshilt smallsword on his hip must bash his brains out on evry overhead beam lewrie thought maybe one too many already he further decided as the gawky spindleshanks stared off into space lips ajar and damned near mumbled to himself with a gloomy vacant expression on his phyz good morning lewrie said to be politeand to see if the fellow was truly addled will thisun drool he thought er ah hem good morning to you sir the lieutenant said with a grave formality then returned to his dark study captain lewrie is captain lewrie present a minor clerk enquired from the foot of the grand staircase here lewrie answered springing from the pew bench giving the officer not another thought as he followed the young clerk abovestairs with his boundtogether stack of books and papers a pleasant tenminute chat with mr marsden then lewrie was passed on to a succession of underlings from one cramped office to another even right down to the damp basements where clerks would work on stools and makeshift plank passageways when the thames flooded in spring to file his navigational observations to hand over ledgers and charts the final muster book to make official those crewmembers discharged dead or so injured that they were merely discharged and for what reason finally long past his usual dinner hour lewrie saw the councillor of the cheque where his final accounting was toted up the last fullrate pay of a postcaptain of a fifth rate was signed and handed over in full an assortment of ten five and onepound notes on the bank of england with only a few shillings and pence in real coin and his whereabouts should admiralty have need of him noted thence placing him on halfpay for the near futureminus all the deductions for the aforesaid chatham chest and crippled pensioners robbing him of the eight shillings per day of an active commission reducing him to six shillings per day of halfpay but really amounting only to a low three shillings by then with the money in his pockets and his stack of books and such much reduced and sure that he had seen almost all thirty of the employees who ran the entire fleet lewrie made his adieus and trotted down the stairs to get his hat and cloak from the hall porter looking over the waiting room in hopes he might espy at least one old shipmate before departing someone whod shared privations dangers and high cockalorums if only to stave off the dread that there would be exceedingly dull times ahead on his own without such companionable sheet anchors linked to the bulk of his adult life oned think so lewrie thought as he took his time buckling on his sword belt settling the heavy and enveloping boatcloak upon his shoulders an hundred ships othe line an hundred frigates sloops owar and brigsloops lessn a thousand active postcaptains commanders not ten thousand lieutenants yed think id know one of em in here well there were some hed rather not encounter this side of the gates of hell francis forrester whod made post years before he had the idle wellconnected bastard that idle grand tourist commander william fillebrowne that captain blaylock of the rosaceaed phyz back in the west indies come to think ont there were rather more than a few fellow commission sea officers listed in steels original and correct list of the royal navy whod be more than happy to playact the merry andrew gladhand him then spit in his tea on the sly or worse there was the drooling drizzling midshipman there was that gloomy tall and skeletal darkhaired lieutenant now taken to wringing his hands and there were an hundred strangers fie on it lewrie clapped his cocked hat on his head and left going out to the courtyard feeling as he imagined an aging foxhound would when left in the run and pen whilst the younger spryer dogs set out for a hunt to be idly lubberly civilianuseless an theres a proper seadog for ye young ginnlmen merry christmas tye capum the old tiler bade him doffing his own hat and making a clutch of midshipmen round the tea cart turn to gawk and grin in polite confusion merry christmas an a happy new year christ will he never retire lewrie wondered or just drop the hell dead hes been doorman here since i paid off the shrike brig in and a merry christmas tyou lewrie answered back with a doff of his own hat to the old fart then in responding salute to the mids as he trudged past for the curtain wall and the street beyond looking for a hired carriage to bear him to the strand his lastminute holiday shopping and an excellent but late dinner at a chophouse in savoy street one introduced to him by his barrister during his legal troubles bad memories or not their victuals were marvellous well after his dinner before shopping he would have to drop by coutts bank to deposit his accumulated earnings then call on his solicitor mr matthew mountjoy to settle his shore debts with notesofhand then the day after there would be no more reason to put off going home home to anglesgreen and the dubious welcome of his wife and dour disapproving inlaws all of whom held him in as much regard as a sack of dead barn rats lewrie would have thought a sack of sheepshit but sheepshit was worth something as fertiliser chapter eight it was a long slow and muddy road from london through guildford and on sutherly towards portsmouth before taking the turning to the petersfield road it was cold enough for the ruts to freeze in the nights then turn to brittle slush by midday to lean out of a coach window was a good way to have ones face slimed by the shower of wet slop thrown up by the coachs front wheels the sky was completely overcast the clouds low and the winds held a hint of snow in the offing indeed it had snowed sometime in the past two days for the treesthe poor bare treesalong the way cupped it in the fork of their branches and the piles of leaves on the ground were halfsmothered in white as were the fallow pastures and fields last plowed into furrows in spring all the crops were harvested now the last good from them raked and reaped and gleaned with only a hayrick here and there topped with scrap tarpaulin to keep off the wet most of the feed livestock lewrie knew would have been slaughtered by now toothe beef mutton and pork salted smoked sugarcured or submerged in the large stone crocks filled with preserving lard it was only the young and breeding beasts that remained in the pastures by the road in the styes or pens within sight from the rumbling jouncing coach and the dray waggon that followed fair lotta sheep hereabout aint they sor liam desmond enquired with a quirky uplift of one corner of his mouth thousands pon thousands of em lewrie told him the comin thing in the north downs since before the american revolution weve about two hundred last time i got an accounting nothin like good roast lamb sor sure there aint desmond said with a chuckle liam desmond no longer was garbed in a sailors short clothing but wore dark brown ditto his coat and trousers of the same coloured broadcloth he sported a buffcoloured waistcoat a white linen shirt even a white neckstock and with triplecaped overcoat and a grey farmers hat could almost be mistaken for a man of the squirearchy one who rented his acres not owned them at least youll founder on lamb and mutton by easter lewrie said with a wry laugh for by previous experience in the country hed seen that particular dish on his table rather more than thrice a week in spite of the risk to his complexion lewrie let down the window glass and took a quick peek astern to see how patrick furfy was doing with the dray waggon furfy and the waggoner swathed to their eyebrows with upturned overcoat collars wool scarves and tuggeddown hats seemed to be having a grand natter and he caught the tailend of a joke that furfy was telling and his deep hearty roar of laughter at its successful completion patrick furfy loved a good joke or yarn but had a hard time relating them onwards leaving out details that he had to jab in in the middle and overall had but a limited stash of jokes he could reliably tell loight th candle help me foind me bliddy equipage an well coach outta this bitchs quim har har thatd be number twentyone sor desmond said with a grin and i thought hed nivver git it right he tugged uncomfortably at his neckstock and the enveloping folds of his overcoat not used to such perhaps in his whole life in ireland then the navy where the hell did that come from lewrie gravelled as their coach came even with a field that lewrie recalled as a thinnedout wood lot bounded by a low handlaid stone wall now the wood lot was taken over by several new buildings a brickworks and a wide gate open in the wall about an eighth of a mile later past a stretch of woods and there was a tannery thankfully downstream from anglesgreen my eyes the towns gone industrious all thats the local squires land or it was sir romney embertons hed not abide that did he pass over and his son harry set them up they good people sor the embletons desmond asked peering out the windows himself sir romney is lewrie commented not sure whether he liked the changes round anglesgreen it was a bucolic boresome place full of predictable and sometimes tiresome folk but hed hoped to find it as reassuring as an old shoe just long enough to get tired of it before napoleon bonaparte and admiralty snatched him back to active sea service harry delights in killin horses at foxhuntin and at steeplechasin theyre no matter thim last i was home he was the leftenantcolonel of the local yeoman cavalry ye cant miss him hes the chin of an otter talks loudern an angry bosun and laughs like a daft donkey faith sor but oned think ye had a down on him his coxn wryly commented of long standing hah lewrie told him with a barking laugh he took the risk to his hat and hair and stuck his head out the coach window once more looking back at the brickworks and tannery grimacing with displeasure to see the steam and stinks rising from them like a pall of spent gunpowder from a twodeckers broadside hazing off to a flattopped cloud that slowly drifted eastward god help us does the wind change he thought just as a glob of muddy slush plopped against his cheek from the front wheel eliciting a snarl that had more to do with the newcome industries he swabbed the muck off with his wool scarf and sat back as he noted several new brick cottages on the left of the road that hadnt been there before where once there had been a commonshared pasture before the enclosure acts that had taken away poor cottagers grazing and vegetable plot rights and turned so many from handtomouth selfsufficient to common day labourers on others farms or driven them to the cities where the new manufacturies might employ them at least the dozen or so cottages were on decent plots of land picketfenced with wee truck gardens and decorative flower beds they were substantiallooking wellpainted with flower boxes at each window sill and in the spring might appear quite pleasant he decided to the right at last and there was mossy old st georges parish church as stout and impressive as a feudal manor or norman conquerors keep with its low stone walls marking the bounds now topped by new iron fencing the expansive graveyard was further bound with iron fencing too though the oldest headstones were still limegreen with moss and tilted anywhichway as if braced acockbill in eternal mourning st georges had marked the eastern boundary of the village the last time lewrie had been homechrist my last time here was back in lewrie realised with a startbut it seemed that that had changed too for hard by the churchs fenced boundary there was a lane running north then a row of two and threestorey brick and slateroofed bowwindowed shops that hadnt been there before either milliners a tailors a tea shop lewrie muttered half under his breath and whats this there had been four rowhouses just east of the olde ploughman public house but someone had redone the fronts closing off half the entrances and turned two of them to double doors all to allow entry to a dry goods a dry goods before anyone wishing to do serious shopping would have had to coach ride or hike to petersfield the closest substantial town or go allin and stay over at southampton portsmouth or guildford but now why in the dry goods stores windows lewrie could espy readymade clothing china sets and this th public house ye told us of sor desmond asked as the coach drew level with the olde ploughman it had been touched up with whitewash recently sported a new swaying signboard over the entrance and new shutters aye desmond lewrie told him the side yards a grand place in warm weather tables outside and coachee draw up here i say lewrie cried thumping his walkingstick on the coach roof as long as were here well try their ale the coachee and waggoner too at that welcome news liam desmond sprang from the front bench seat and opened the door jumping down to lower the folding metal steps for lewrie who was out not two seconds behind him and walking round the head of the coachs team of four to take it all in bareheaded ale pat desmond cried the coachee and yer friend too ale arrah furfy chortled the olde ploughman fronted on the large village green that ran along the stream that bisected anglesgreen spanned just a bit west of the public house by a stout stonearch bridge across the stream sat a second street fairly new from the s once mostly earthen mud and now and then gravelled now the street was cobbled several rowhouses had been turned into even more shops and there were even more streets south of them lined with even more of those handsome cottages situated on spacious acre lots with room enough for coachhouses and stables chicken coops and runs truck gardens and walledoff lawns lewrie gawped in awe slowly turning to look upstream towards the red swan inn where the squirearchy and landed gentry did their swilling and lewrie was most unwelcome and found that the village had grown in that direction too though the smaller green of the red swan was yet untouched and the groves of giant oaks still stood neat lil place ant it pat desmond asked his mate faircleanun too liam furfy replied spreading his arms and expanding his chest to inhale deeply nothin like th reeks o london smells farmy a bit like our auld maynooth hey desmond said with a grin smells aley furfy decided ale aye lewrie announced ale for all fore we go on to the house spiteful as carolines mostlike tbe i might as well go home foxed lewrie decided it maynt matter one wayr tother the ole ploughman was ancient a public house since the days of the norman conquest some speculated its interior walls were whitewashed over rough plaster the few windows tudorish diamond paned and the ceiling was low the overhead beams black with kitchen fireplace candle oillanthorn or pipe smoke or so it had been during his long absence old mr beakman and his spinster daughter had added fair approximations of jacobean fold wood wainscot panelling the walls were now painted a cheery red and the beams and the barmans counter looked to be sanded down to fresh raw wood then linseeded and polished to a warm honeybrown beakman had gone with the times and had set aside a dining area round the fireplace on the righthand half of the vast room with new tables covered by pale tan cloths whilst the lefthand half had been rearranged to accommodate drinkers and smokers round the other fireplace with double doors leading out to the trellised and pergolaed side garden which was no longer a scraggly attempt at lawn but brickpaved and railed in by low picket fences there were brass spitoons for those who chewed their quids and even more brass candleholders along the walls and brass lanthorns hung from the overhead beams making the public house much brighter warmer and more welcoming a place than ever it had been before my stars lewrie breathed as he shrugged out of his cloak and hat noting the framed pictures hung on the walls too old pastorals and race horses prize bulls and boars and hunting scenes featuring packs of dogs gathered round mounted riders who did all this will ye look at im capm lewrie tth life a woman cried from behind the long bar counter past the customers bellied up to it will come see whos come home maggie cony lewrie exclaimed recognising the roundfaced local lass whod married his old bosun will cony shed thickened and gone apple dumpling cheeked but she was still the goodhearted and hardworking woman he remembered when both she and cony had been in his employ tween the wars you work here now tosh capm lewrie we own the place now maggie said wiping her redraw hands on a bar towel and coming round to greet him old beakman sold up lewrie asked puzzled as he made her a showy leg and bow maggie dropped him a curtsy la e wuz gettin on in years an not but is daughter tinherit an er still a spinster so

glee as he emerged from the back kitchens the towheaded thatchhaired lad hed been had thickened considerably too and his forehead had grown higher his tophair thinned considerably though still drawn

proteuss commission then savage and lastly thermopylae beakmans daughter ehm lewrie had to ask for before will had wed maggie hed spooned round the mort not all that badlooking a wench really and though no promises were made no gifts exchanged to plight a throthi give my love a paper of pins and in this way our love beginswasnt this new arrangement prickly happily spinster beakman had found herself a husband at last a widower with two children a fellow of middle years hired on by the squire sir romney embleton as both a surgeon for the inevitable accidental injuries on his estate and as a dispensing apothecary in his offhours both the brickworks and the tannery used this newcome mr archers services sending their sick and hurt to him with coloured paper chits which required him to treat or dose them for free though both establishments paid him an annual retainer as did sir romney theyve one o them new cottages east near the brickworks will cony told them an ol beakmans set up proper by their fire in his old age thank th lord though he does tramp in ere when th weathers good fer th newspapers th ale an th ploughmans dinner that would have been an apple a slab of cheese a pint of beer and perhaps a hunk of bread a fixture on every rural taverns chalked menu board the whole nation over fall off yer orse capm lewrie an mister archerll fix ye right up no matter ow many bones that ye break after the better part of an hour spent in pleasant nattering it was time to get on the day was drawing to a close the sun was lowering the temperature was dropping and damned if it didnt smell like there might be more snow in the offing the hired coachandfour could put themselves up at the livery stables for the night at lewries expense but it would take longer to unload the dray waggon of all of his goods and mostlike the waggoner and his beasts would have to put up in lewries barns for the night and hed have to feed the man to boot the little convoy clattered on westwards past the much finer red swan inn then took the turning for the chiddingfold road a half mile onwards in the vale tween two rolling ridges and there was the drive that led to both chiswick and lewrie properties over a wooden bridge that spanned a narrow shallow creek rippling over rocks half covered with skims of ice and now filled with fallen limbs and twigs just past the bridge there was a fork the muddy unkempt track to the left was uncle phineas chiswicksa man so miserly that gravel and proper upkeep was too dear lewries drive lay to the right there was a muddy patch at its beginning but beyond that as the drive ascended the low ridge it was properly gravelled almost two coaches in width quite unlike phineas chiswicks which was barely wide enough for one and lined by trees trees that had grown in height and thickness since lewrie had last seen them at present they were bare but in spring theyd be delightful and provide both shade and a sense that the drive would lead to a welcoming establishment with nesting birds twittering and flitting about their hatchlings and there was lewries house at last it was of grey brick and stone with a palladian entrance faзade set back from a circular gravel drive and large round formal flower bed now bedraggled and not much to look at unless one appreciated bare brown stalks and weeds lanthorns either side of the entrance and stoop and a single lanthorn by the edge of the flower bed gleamed off the shiny royal blue paint of the door and the large brass venetian lion doorknocker that lewrie had fetched back from the adriatic in despite the cold drapes were pulled back in the firststorey windows to display candles and christmas wreaths of redberried holly ivy and pine all three of the fireplaces and the kitchen chimney at the rear of the house were fuming as chearly as convivial pipe smokers in a very friendly tavern or coffeehouse everything said come in be welcome yet agamemnon thought clytemnestrad be glad tsee him too lewrie sourly told himself as he alit on his own land for the first time in years wonder if i should tell cassandra twait in the carriage like he did and it came to him a most apt snatch of classical greek play that hed stumbled over in his schooldays from agamemnon in point of fact it is evil and a thing of terror when a wife sits in the house forlorn with no man by and hears rumours that like a fever die to break again chapter nine he thought it good policy to knock not just barge in it took a long two minutes though before anyone responded to the rapping of his doorknocker a sourlooking older woman in a sack gown and mob cap opened the door looked him up and down as she might inspect a drunken reeling housebreaker and in a pinchednostriled and pursedlipped impatient way haughtily enquired yes and what is it that you want of this house sir i live here its mine lewrie snarled back step lively and tell mistress lewrie that captain lewries home he said walking past the mort swirling off his boatcloak and sailing his giltlaced cocked hat at the hall tree now lewrie prompted the woman who was balking in prim outrage devil take it hulloa the house lewrie bellowed in his best quarterdeck voice anyone to home he barely had time to take in the blackandwhite chequered marble of his foyer the family portraits on the walls the twin venetian bombй chests at either side of the staircase before chaos befell him first bugling in alarm came a setter belonging to his elder son sewallis closely escorted by a fluffy yapping ball of fur he thought was a pomeranian with his younger son hugh galloping down the stairs and squealing in elevenyearold glee whooping like a red indian youre home oh youre home hugh cried all but tackling his papa home for christmas huzzah with sewallis ever a much more staid lad now fourteen came a second setter sniffing arseholes with the first and circling about the reunion in a quandary whether to defend the house or go into paroxysms of delight the fluffball the pomeranian had no doubts about the matter he would continue to yap growl and go for the boots of the intruder once hed worked up the nerve sewallis give us a kiss lad lewrie bade arms outstretched to give his eldest a warm hug best christmas ever aint it all of us home for once damme but yeve grown you too hugh two fine young gentlemen yeve turned out tbe what did you bring us for christmas father hugh asked with an impish look me peace and a waggonload o presents lewrie assured him wheres charlotte wheres my little charlotte hey and can someone shut this wee hairball up he added as the pomeranian at last worked up enough nerve to nip at his left boot and get shoved by a swift leg thrust just in time for his daughter to appear on the landing and let out an outraged squeal of alarm to see her beloved lapyapper be assailed she came dashing downstairs to scoop the little dog up in her arms quickly step back a few paces and glare accusingly charlotte there ye are darlin lewrie said wont ya come and give your papa a welcomin kiss you hurt my dog she cried cradling it like a baby a madly barking squirming bloodthirsty little baby yearning for his throat i never dearest he was lewrie objected then quieted as his wife descended the stairs seemingly in no great hurry to welcome her husband back from the wars and the sea caroline he said in a much soberer taking im home for christmas for so we see my dear caroline coolly responded both arms folded across her chest your only letter did not inform us of just when youd appear when your affairs in london would be done that citronsour housekeeper came down the stairs to stand near her mistress still scowling as fierce as a masteratarms might at a defaulter due at captains mast for his fifth drunk on watch ouch lewrie thought striving manful not to wince at the chill your timing is impeccable though caroline continued with a tad of relenting welcome supper will be ready in an hour desmond and furfy came bustling in at that awkward moment hands full of seabags and carpet satchels the waggoner followed with a seachest and the dogs went silly once more uhm this is my man liam desmond caroline children lewrie told them my coxn since we fought the luranie frigate in the south atlantic his mate patrick furfy wholl be tending to the horses and such hes a way with animals sure enough furfy did for right after hed dropped his burden he whistled and clapped his hands and the two setters trotted to him tails awag tongues lolling and their hindquarters squirming in joy as he cosseted them with soft words pets and crooning irish phrases weve a stableman already husband so caroline began then weve another dear lewrie baldly told her oh very well caroline resignedly replied stiffening a bit mistress calder pray show captain lewries men to his chambers yes missuz the older mort said her mouth rattrapping weve the dray to unload as well lewrie said then pray do so through the kitchen doors and do not let any more heat out through the front caroline instructed ill pay the coachee and have the waggon shifted lewrie said hiding a sigh quite a lot of dainties liqueurs caviar tstow in the pantry he tempted her hoping for some enthusiasm mistress calder will show them where to put things caroline said turning to head aft for the kitchens herself the waggonerll stay over for the night lewrie told her ill tell cook to lay three more places in the scullery she announced then turned and departed with nary a hug a kiss or even a a promise of one petronius had it right lewrie sadly thought recalling another snatch of latin poetry reproach and love all in a moment for hercules himself would be a torment an hour later and it was time for supper lewrie had hung his uniforms and civilian suitings in the armoire stowed his shirts and such in a chestofdrawers and had made a fair start on emptying his heavy seachest in a guest bedchamber at the end of the upstairs hall right above his library and office hed borne his swords down to that officelibrary just in time to witness mrs calder remove the last of the linen covers from wing chairs and settee and stoke up the fireplace as if in his absence the only thing used there was the desk and the leatherpadded chair behind it for farm accounting desmond followed him in with his weapons his breechloading ferguson riflemusket the longbarrelled fusil musket the rare girandoni airpowered rifle twin to the one that had almost killed him at barataria bay in spanish louisiana and his boxed pistols from the stairs onwards his children had followed him as close at his heels as sewalliss setters the boys goggling at the firearms and swords lewrie hung his french grenadierpattern hanger above the mantel and stood his hundredguinea presentation smallsword in a wooden rack along with five more smallswords of varying worth and quality that hed captured from the french ehm are not surrendered swords handed back to the owners sewallis hesitantly asked tentatively fingering each one they usually are sewallis lewrie told him with a grin but thats hard tdo if theyre no longer among the living that fancyun there that was luranies captains sword but he was dead by the time we boarded and took her a couple of them belonged to frog lieutenants who perished too none of the french prisoners would be in a position ttake em home to their next of kin on parole here in england or refused and ended in the hulks so i kept them got the dead mens names jotted down and stuck the notes in the scabbards so i spose i could forward em tparis someday soon no time for that not as long as the war was still on dont play with em hugh they arent toy swords neither are any of these firelocks sir hugo lets us when hes down from london hugh objected he lets us shoot for real and hes taught us some fencing too said we should take classes from a fencing master then well give that girandoni airrifle a try once the holidays are over lewrie promised taking a welcome seat in a wing chair before the blazing fire and motioning the boys to sit on the settee mind its not a toy either but if my father allows you use of muskets and pistols already i think we could have some fun with it its very good for silent huntin charlotte had trailed him round the house too though silent as a dormouse lugging her lap dog by name of dolly as if restraining the little beast from attacking him now she was seated in the wing chair opposite lewries legs sticking out and the dog in her lap so it could glare and bare its teeth in comfort three settersdear god how many are there lewrie asked himselfwere sprawled before the hearth and his cats were in the room as well toulon and chalky were quite used to ruling the roost furry masters of both greatcabins and quarterdeck but the big slobbery setters antics and curiosity had driven them to the mantel topeven toulon who was not all that agilewhere they now lay sliteyed tailtips now and then quivering and folded into great hairy plum puddings uhm how longve ye had the pup charlotte lewrie asked last christmas his nineyearold daughter answered uncle governour and aunt millicent brought her from london takes a lot o brushin id imagine lewrie observed askance oh yes she likes it so charlotte replied every day know why she calls her dolly papa hugh said with a snigger cause shes ripped all tother dolls tshreds ha ha jealousy is it lewrie japed her just the one hugh dont be beastly charlotte cried hugging the dog closer she doesnt much care for cats papa nor do i she announced ehm were you really at copenhagen papa sewallis asked and did you see admiral nelson saw him spoke with him the night before the battle and then after it was over too lewrie answered did i not write you about it and how they sent us into the baltic tscout the enemy fleets and the ice all by our lonesome hah wait til ye see the furs that i had t wear swaddled up like a greenland eskimo ahem mrs calder said from the door to the library looking as if she disapproved of parents speaking with children mistress caroline says to tell you that supper is served come children yours is laid out in the little dining room aw we want teat with papa hugh griped yes why cant we all eat together sewallis complained he just got home its not mrs calder began to instruct aye its high time for a family supper lewrie announced as he sprang from his chair shift their place settings and theres an end to it weve catching up tdo right huzzah hugh exclaimed and even sewallis whod always put lewrie in mind of a solemn old soul due to take holy orders beamed with glee and chimed in his own wishes beats dinin alone with caroline all hollow lewrie thought as they trooped out oh it has thappen soon but for now use em as so many rope fenders she cant scream an throw things at me if the kiddies are present right chapter ten and thank god its christmas was lewries recurring thought as the yuletide festivities spun on his brotherinlaw burgess chiswick now major of a foot regiment was down from london with his future inlaws and fiancee the raptourously lovely theodora trencher and mister and mistress trencher her parents both of whom were solidly welloff and immensely respectable in the new sense hardworking prosperous as a result of it mannerly highminded welleducated stoutly christian involved in improving causes rigidly moral and more than willing to impose their prim morals on the rest of great britain lewrie could have been treated like a pariah by his country inlaws but for the fact that uncle phineas chiswick seeing how rich the trenchers were and being delighted with such a fruitful match had to grind his false teeth and simper at the black sheep of the family welcoming lewrie like a longlost son and governour his other brotherinlaw now as rotund and redfaced as the lampoonish cartoons of the typical countrybumpkin squire john bull had to plaster a false face and play the merry andrew though without guests for the holidays he would have happily shot lewrie it was immensely secretly amusing to lewrie to see his uncle by marriage and governour bite their tongues whenever the trenchers said anything favourable about lewrie for the whole family were enthusiastic supporters of william wilberforce and belonged to his society for the abolition of slavery in the british empire lewrie was their champion for his liberation of a dozen black slaves on jamaica years before making them freemen and british tars true blue hearts of oak and for his acquittal at trial for the deed to rankle those two even further burgess was for abolition as well and had always thought lewrie one hell of a fellow an heroic figure and a wry wag to boot and what was even saucier to relish from uncle phineass and governors mute fuming was the fact that uncle phineas was still invested in the infamous triangle trade and governour had been raised in the cape fear country of north carolina before the revolution and felt that chattel slavery was right and proper oh it was a merry band of revellers they made for chiswicks trenchers and lewries went everywhere together did they not dine at uncle phineass they were at governours or lewries along with some of the other worthy families of anglesgreen did they not sup at home there were parish and community suppers even an invitation to embleton hall with sir romney still among the living despite what lewried feared and harry and what harry made of having his rival for carolines hand come for supper music and cards lewrie could only imagine and savour indeed having caroline herself over might have galled the fool equally well for shed once lashed him with her horses reins and made his nose spout claret there were carolling parties beginning at sundown coaching from farmhouse to farmhouse through anglesgreens snowy streets from the red swan to st georges and bought suppers in both the red swan and the olde ploughman with a round dozen or more to treat attable and the hunt club ball again at embleton hall and the crosscountry ride that preceded it mr trencher was not quite the skilled rider that his wife and daughter were but he was dogged at it and wildly enthusiastic for a steeplechases jumps all in all the trenchers fit right in as well as a country rector or vicar for despite the initial impression of being very respectable all delighted at dancing and theodora aside could put away the wines brandies and punch like the most affable churchman and then two days before christmas day lewries father sir hugo st george willoughby coached down from london to open his home dun roman his own horrid pun a large rambling onestorey bungalow in the hindoo style to pour the rum over the plum pudding as it were and to light it on top of all that lewrie and his children went riding almost every morning before the days planned activities went shooting with the lighter fusilmusket or the girandoni airrifle they could not hunt not even over their own lands for lewrie was uncle phineass tenant not a freeholder but they could try their eyes at empty bottles and marks whitewashed on a tree that was great fun for everyone except charlotte she insisted on going with her brothers with her father too one might imagine but was interested only in the riding part on her horsepony and whenever lewrie tried to include her or jest or merely converse charlotte seemed as uninterested as his wife it was only when sir hugo joined their morning rides with promises of a cauldron of hot cocoa at his place after that charlotte opened up and actually essayed a laugh or two sir hugo had done much the same with sophie de maubeuge lewries orphaned french ward years before it was uncanny you shouldve had daughters too besides me lewrie told him in a private moment as they rested their mounts after a spirited gait had one belinda recall yer bloody stepsister sir hugo said with a snicker well stepdaughter at any rate and look how that turned out belinda was still listed in the guide to covent garden women a highly recommended and costly courtesan you bring charlotte out of her turtleshell lewrie said i cant make heads or tails of her moods the boys aye but shes carolines body and soul lad sir hugo said onliest child still at home and lappin up her anger bout ye like it was my chocolate hows yer happy rencontre with her goin anyway much like a winters day lewrie had to scoff short dark and dirty im in a guest chamber we talk of nothing mostly thank god for houseguests and the children else yed be measurin me for a coffin she acts jolly but thats only cause of the trenchers and burgesss comin marriage zachariah twigg did coach down to explain things whilst i was in the baltic but theres no sign she took any of it to heart too much to forgive really and too americanraised an english wife of our classd be more realistic dont lay wagers on that sir hugo said with a sour cackle women are women no matter where or how theyre raised shes sense though theres her place in society and the children tconsider oh speakin of whatd ye get the children for christmas what lewrie gawped at the shift of topic more slide sets for their magic lantern a new doll for charlotte assumin her bloody dog dont shred it like the others some french chocolates now were tradin again bow and arrow sets toy muskets and pistols some more lead soldiers and a model frigate and a halfdozen oranges each why whatd you do he asked fearing the worst well an openbacked doll house for charlotte sir hugo said looking a touch cuttyeyed a castle really and for the boys swords swords smallswords sir hugo said on its time for them to learn the gentlemanly art of the salle darmes and theres a skilled man i know from my first regiment the kings own near their school who can instruct them do ye not mind payin half his fee they should be taught hugh especially since we both know hell mostlike end choosin either the navy or the army for his living well i spose lewrie muttered seeing the sense of it started you early i did and swordsmanship came in damned useful to you sir hugo stated hugh shows promise with the sword and hes both a decent shot and has a hellishgood seat hes spunk and intelligence didnt get it from me lewrie said with a snort as they both turned to watch all three children in a rare moment of glee tossing snowballs at each other and running in circles grant ye that sir hugo wryly jested as i said long ago i still have connexions at horse guards and could have him an ensign or leftenant in an host of good regiments or with your renown you could get him aboard a warship captained by one of your friends what interest and patronage is all about after all fellow captains who like me lewrie asked himself i can count them on the fingers of one hand another year and hes twelve sir hugo further speculated more schoold just ruin him ruined me lewrie barked sarcastically and one cant make general or admiral if ye start late sir hugo pointed out something tthink about hope ye dont mind no not really i just worry what carolinell make of it when they open their presents lewrie said perhaps the armys best for hugh shes rather a down on the navy cause o me and wont much care tsee him followin in my footsteps and it dont look like our armys ever going to do all that much overseas after the shambles we made of it in holland a while back retake french and dutch colonies all over again in the indies aye but the british army in concert with the russians during a brief alliance had landed in holland but had been muddled about like farts in a trance had been confronted with regular french troops for the first time and had been humiliatingly beaten like a rug and run out of the country with their tails twixt their legs as for retaking west indies colonies it was never the risk of battle that could worry lewrie as a father it was the sicknesses that had slain fifty thousand british soldiers and officers since the indieseast or westwere not called the fever isles for nought gad yell be chilled tth bone th three of ye sir hugo shouted to the boys who had given up on snowballs and had gone for tackling each other and heaping armloads of snow over heads and shoulders breaking off just long enough to chase charlotte and make her screech hot cocoa at dun roman leave off and saddle up and off they went to sir hugos estate and his eccentric home with its wide and deep porches all round it had been a celtic dun a hill fort once in the earlyearlys then a roman legionary watchtower then a tumbledown ruin which sir hugo had incorporated into one corner of his homesite and partially refurbished his folly some called it like the architectured grottoes some very rich landowners had erected in their gardens lacking only a hired hermit to make them authentic moated once outer fosse wall restored though most stone work blocks had gone to make the foundation of sir hugos house the boys found it the very finest playfort that any lad could wish when it was phineas chiswicks land i courted caroline there lewrie painfully recalled as they topped a rolling rise and the brokentoothed tower came into view spread a blanket outside the fosse chilled our wine bottles in the stream kissed her the first time whered all that go oh right im a bastard in more ways than one last one tth doors a turk in a turban sir hugo shouted spurring his mount and they were off snow slush and turf spraying from their horses hooves and all charlotte included hallooing and whooping with happinesstil she came in last of course was dubbed that turk in a turban and got all sulky again chapter eleven respectability had altered the celebration of christmas even in alan lewries times gangs of drunken revellers invading a house led by the lord of misrule and bought off with food and drink were not much seen any longer even in tumultuous unruly london the old custom of church ales in which every communicant in the parish wealthy or poor honest or otherwise drank and supped together were things of the past in all but the most rural places mostly reduced to a supper hosted by landowners for their own cottagers and labourers more of a postharvest celebration than a religious one so the lewries the trenchers the chiswicks and several other families direct kin or longtime neighbours spent christmas eve at uncle phineass with gay dancing right out and carols and hymns round the harpsichord replacing merriment mostly due to the fact that phineas chiswick would not pay for musicians and held that too much gaiety anent the birth of the saviour was irreligious and unseemly there was not enough wine to enliven things anyway or wash down their mediocre supper they coached home round ten in the evening gathered about their own harpsichord and sang and played livelier airs on their own with lewrie on his pennywhistle charlotte scraping away on her small violin sewallis strumming a guitar and hugh making odd notes on his recorder there was hot chocolate with scones and jam to make up for the supper and from the kitchens the competing sounds of liam desmond and his uilleann lappipes the thudding of patrick furfy on a shallow bodhran drum and someone on the fife sounds like theyre havin a good time lewrie said as their last passable effort at a carol came to a merciful end lets have my lads in for tune or two and a glass of something mrs calder who had been rocking and knitting in silent disapproval in the corner gave a faint snort and looked to her mistress to scotch such nonsense theyre servants my dear caroline pointed out making her my dear sound strained and forced said only for the childrens sake wholl attend church with us tomorrow morning lewrie countered whom well gift the day after on boxing day and desmond and furfy are sailors dearest my sailors mistress calder i would admire did ye fetch a bottle of brandy and sufficient glasses as you summon them to the parlour very well sir mrs calder replied with a stiff nod putting away her knitting as if shed been commanded to set out drink for the devil himself his wife and her chief housekeeper might not have approved but lewrie and the children enjoyed the improvement sewallis and hugh learned a pulleyhauley chanty or two and got instruction on how to do a hornpipe dance then a bit of clogging irish stepdance at which the burly furfy was surprisingly lightfooted the cook and her husband the scullery girl charlotte and carolines maids and the maidsofallwork whod been nipping at a bottle of their own on the sly got into the spirit of things too and wanted to dance which required lewrie and caroline to play some lively airs to accommodate them it was nigh eleven before lewrie uncorked the brandy bottle and began to pour all round tomorrow well be prim proper and serious lewrie told them and surely inspired by the vicars homily but tonight on the eve of our saviours birth let us count our blessings all charged may i and my wife wish you all a very merry christmas now heeltaps and then to our rest they all lifted their glasses and drank them down to the very last drops glasses inverted at the last to show that heeltaps had been attained good night all and thankee for the merriment the children were hugged hands were shaken charlotte kissed and wished sweet dreams then all were herded upstairs by the sour mrs caldersure to hiss and take all joy from the previous hours before they were all tucked in for the night not sure i like that woman lewrie grumbled as he poured himself another glass of brandy stiff as thatun we had years ago missuz mcgowan wasnt it you disapprove of my choice of housekeeper or governness do you caroline snapped it is my house after all my housewifery year in and year out but for the few brief spells you allow us from the navy i am quite satisfied with mistress calders management of both house and children else the boys would be as wild as so many red indians as wild as you sir merry bloody christmas tyou too lewrie thought with a groan his nose in his glass this aint workin never will mostlike i might as well lodge in london at the madeira club til hellfreezes up the boys are only home tween school terms these days lewrie pointed out and charlotte aint the wild sort caroline shes more in need of tutorin at dancin and music than grim discipline the glare he got could have shattered boulders but i will defer tyour wishes your ways he quickly added for as long as you stay caroline grimly said which is til the french start the war again i am home lewrie told her its my home too and til the boys leave for hilary term i hope we can share it in a sham of harmony at any rate after that well youre the postcaptain o this barge and ill try to accommodate my ways to yours stay out from under foot all that he allowed in a soft voice that would not carry abovestairs chin tucked in defensively i dont spose zachariah twiggs visit made any impression at all what a horrid man caroline exclaimed her own arms folded over her chest like an oily spider and a hellishdangerous one tboot lewrie agreed and god help any foe or spy that crosses his hawse every time he hauls me in on one of his schemes its neckornothing and cutthroats and murderers on evry hand fair gives me the collywobbles he does zachariah twigg until his partial retirement from his majestys government had served the crown in the secret branch of the foreign office for years and had been lewries bugabear since off and on oh hed sworn hed coach down to anglesgreen to explain who had written the poisonously anonymous letters to carolinetheoni kavares connorand the why which had been spite that she could not have lewrie for her own and how so many of the sexual dalliances she had accused lewrie ofin such lurid detailhad been complete fictions or so richly embellished twiggs promised expiation could not erase all of lewries overseas doings of course his mistress in the mediterranean when commanding the jester sloop of war or the fact that lewrie had indeed seeded theoni kavares connor with a bastard son but the rest of it was a fantasy meant to harm have ttalk about us sooner or later lewrie told her shrugging as he took another sip of brandy after epiphany or yes we do alan caroline softly agreed looking down at the pattern of the parlour carpet she looked up then almost beseechingly with the vertical furrow tween her brows prominent do you love me alan even after all your do you still love me caroline was not the sprightly young miss hed first met during the evacuation of wilmington north carolina back in his days as a midshipman in the american revolution nor was she the lissome bride hed taken vows with at st georges yet aye i do caroline he told her and felt his chest turn hot his eyes mist a bit with the truth of it no matter everything else he had done i still do not for the children not then we shall see alan she promised arms still crossed in protection once yuletide is done we shall see good night she paused at the double doors to the foyer and looked back for a mere trice merry christmas she said then headed for the stairs a very brief smile that might have been wistful or rueful turning up the corners of her mouth wrinkling the riant folds below her eyes for the slightest moment well ill be doubledamned he breathed muttering softly in wonder might be a beginnin after all he tossed off his brandy to the last drop set the glass aside and went abovestairs to his own beddown the hall in the guest chamber stillwhere toulon and chalky at least gave him some affection after hed rolled into a cold bed merry christmas to you lads merry christmas to us all though they did not snuggle the way he longed for book ii it was the best of times it was the worst of times charles dickens a tale of two cities chapter twelve christmas day and the opening of presents had passed as had boxing day on the twentysixth most gifts had gone over well but for the toy muskets and swords sir hugos real blades had made the biggest impression and cause for chaotic tumult as hugh and sewallis practised their initial lessons on each other swashbuckling through the entire house til lewrie and his father took them in hand in the barren back garden and gave them both some sword exercises learned from hard and bloody experience at least charlotte was ecstatic over her new dolls books and miniature fairy castle after epiphany though the boys coached away to begin their new school term with grandfather sir hugo as their avuncular escort and it was back to the routine drudgery of village and farm life in a cold midwinter and only lewrie his wife and daughter in the house and much like the descriptions hed read of north american porcupines mating lewrie found the process of reconciliation and the enforced togetherness a prickly endeavour with few occasions for visiting about or receiving callers in return and with charlotte busy at her studies with her hired tutor there were simply too many hours in a day not that it was boresome exactly wake rise and dress in the guest bedchamber promptly at six a quick shave and scrubup and breakfast was taken in the smaller dining room en famille round seven farm accounts worked on together in his office occupied another hour or so with lewrie the student and she the master striving manful to remember what little hed known of managing a farm from years before striving manful to stay awake and pay heed to carolines surely you recall how or surely you remember what i once told you of lectures on crop rotation animal husbandry and sheep a full pot of strong hot coffee was very necessary round ten or so caroline was busy with mrs calder the cook or the tutor and lewrie had time in which to read a book or take a stroll through the barn and stables halfpast twelve though and it was time for dinner it was only by midafternoon that he was free to saddle up his old gelding anson and canter into anglesgreen to the ploughman to have a pint or two and read the daily papers coached from london and damn his hide did he linger too long or come home in his cups either no once the papers were read and a natter or two with will and maggie cony and the idle regulars life with his wife went so much better did he ride back out to his farm and skirt the bounds over the fallow fields streams and wood lots til his phyz was chilled to rosy red and the last lingering fumes of ale were dissipated after that he could return about an hour before supper for a stiff session in the parlour with wife and daughter now free of household chores or lessons a doting fuss must be made over charlottes lap dog dolly though the wee beast still bared her teeth and flattened her ears whenever he got too close toulon and chalky would huddle with him on the settee for safety for lap and for affection flattening their ears bottling tails and hissing fit to bust whenever dolly approached too near at her play his cats got along much better with sewalliss wee pack of setters all three of whom would never make true hunting dogs and were goofily lumbering playmates a little music some teasing banter with charlotte and a stiff glass of brandy and it was time to sup together again after that it was usually back to the parlour for more music together or teaching charlotte the simpler card games before mrs calder herded her up the stairs leaving lewrie and caroline alone together chess lewrie said apropos of nothing to fill a void or backgammon dye think charlotted enjoy learning those she hates to lose though alan caroline answered looking up from her current embroidery project cant learn to win less ye lose a few first and she ought to learn that life dont always let ye win even if she is a girl she musnt be so cossetted or spoiled she ends up a sore loser the boys know it have tknow it before they enter adult lives and careers you say i cosset her caroline asked with one brow up not at all caroline lewrie quickly countered wondering how deep in trouble he was stepping its just that damn caroline gave a rare mischievous smile its refreshing that you show concern for her improvements dear damned if you do damned if you dont something like that lewrie admitted squirming shes always been headstrong caroline explained returning to her embroidery of a new handkerchief though usually a sweet and biddable girl well with two older brothers to vie with before we sent them away to school and now the only child in the house shes developed a competitive streak one which ive tried to scotch as unseemly for a young lady you may not have noticed being at sea so long and for once that did not sound like a sour accusation but you think introducin her to new gamesd not go amiss even does she pout when she loses i think shed adore them caroline told him with another grin shes playing with her father whom she hasnt seen in years and with both of us cautioning her to be a better sport well tomorrow lets all go for a ride together lewrie suddenly suggested hang the kitchen and stillroom for a day theres your capable mistress calder to oversee things that new tea shop in the village tea and sticky buns or muffins the dry goods store to prowl ride the bounds together maybe put up a fox and have a go at view halloo away from her tutor and lessons for a bit thatd be a treat surely that is a marvellous idea alan caroline eagerly said we will tell her at breakfast and i must own that some time away from household drudgery will suit me right down to my toes as well good then well do it lewrie exclaimed well caroline determined gathering up her embroidery it is time for me to retire do not sit up too late goodnight dear and wonder of wonders she actually crossed the short space twixt settee and her chair to lean over and give him a brief peck on his forehead before stepping away goodnight caroline he replied halfstunned unsure whether he should respond in kind she was walking to the doors and out of his reach before he could decide you see alan domesticity can be very pleasant she said as she paused in the doorway once more with yet another of those enigmatic smiles after so many years of grim war and separation your family can be a source of joy and contentment aye it can lewrie thought once she was gone though nine parts outta ten just bovine boresome chapter thirteen huzzah weve letters lewrie cried as he entered the house after an hour or so at the olde ploughman letters and newspapers who are they from caroline asked bustling into the foyer from the kitchens pantry and stillroom where spring cleaning had kept her occupied uhm one from sophie and anthony langlie lewrie told her shuffling through the pack one from his parents too burgess has written us one from my father oh give me burgesss caroline enthused drying her hands on her apron as they went to the manywindowed office at one end of the house for charlotte was practicing with her music tutor in the formal parlour the windows were open the drapes taken down to be beaten on lines outside and air fresh as were the carpets after months with the house shut against winters chill the accumulated mustiness from candles lamps and fireplaces was being dispelled replaced with the soft breezes of spring that wafted in the scents of the first blossoms in the gardens freshspringing grass and leaves the twitter of birds and the soft cries from the nearest pens where sheep were lambing along with the first wasps of spring which lewrie spent time to swat or shoo before opening the letter from sophie their former ward and his old first lieutenant aboard hms proteus and hms savage yes caroline shouted in triumph alan my brother is to be wed the first banns were published last sunday oh how grand and good for him at last lewrie heartily agreed when do we expect the wedding and where what a splendid match caroline further enthused before giving him the details uhm at the trencher familys home parish in high wycombe not so very far lewrie replied more intent on the langlies letter didnt know the trenchers were landed still rich as he is im sure her fathers found some skint lord with a large parcel that aint entailed and willing tsell up tsettle his debts england was crawling with newmade men of trade and industry men risen from the middling classes who aspired to emulate the titled and longstanding landowners with country estates and acres of their own without renting the law of entail though awarded the inheritance of the income that land generated not the land itself to eldest sons who could not dispose of it nor could their sons it was only the grandsons of the heirs who could sell off land but a new deed of settlement could stave off that shocking event to that heirs grandson for another three generations and it was a rare thing to see land be sold outright uhm perhaps some former commons land taken tween deeds of settlement under an enclosure act caroline ever practicalminded idly commented as she squirmed excitedly in her chair oh the first saturday after easter the boys can be home and attend with us a suitable wedding present though over christmas theodora told me her paraphernalia is quite extensive already hmm beds linens plate and a thousand pounds per annum to boot lewrie idly thought imagining that the lovely and charming theodora trencher might fetch along her own coachandfour thoroughbred saddle horses a likely entry in the ascot and the derby and a townhouse of her own in london lucky bugger that burgess he told himself good god lewrie exclaimed after scanning the first page of sophies letter sophie she and langlie have just come back from france from paris and her old lands in normandy them and langlies parents both from paris caroline gawped and they didnt lop off their heads what risks they took lewrie had rescued sophie her mother and her brother from toulon before the besieged forces of the first coalition had evacuated the poor girl had been for a brief time the vicomtesse sophie pitiful meat for the guillotine and the murderous wrath of the jacobin revolutionaries who were redeyedmad for eliminating every aristo family root and branch and anything that smacked of nobility such revolutionary sentiment and old grudges lewrie imagined still held sway surely not tget her lands back lewrie said reading on i doubt aha damme if she dont say they had a grand time a proper honeymoon month evidently they took her for an english girl who would that not be risk enough caroline quipped who could speak fluent french as missuz langlie with an english husband they hardly had a spot o bother saw all the sights in paris ate well attended balls and levees all sorts of things hmm lewrie said reading off salient points and it now seems theres tbe a langlie heir in the near future caroline sophie says to inform you she is enceinte or grosse dye prefer the colloquial french expectin ha here ill let you read it for yourself later caroline demurred she and sophie once one of those lying letters had arrived declaring that lewrie had been topping her too caroline had turned from fond to outright spiteful towards sophie spurring the girl to flee to london into the dubious aegis of sir hugo st george willoughby her adored adopted grandpиre even now after sophie and anthony langlie had wed and those slanders had been found to be utterly false caroline still seemed glad to be shot of her lewrie doubted if she would read that letter what is the rest of the post his wife asked after putting the glad tidings from burgess chiswick aside oh theres two from the boys lewrie told her still engrossed oh you she cried only a tad vexed springing from her seat to the desk to paw through the stack one would think youd set them aside as if you were still captain of a ship official things first and personal last youd deprive me of word from my dear lads she said but it was a teasing almost fond admonishment for his lapse apologies mdear lewrie told her hmm dear old wilmington caroline puzzled looking over a travelstained letter oh your old friend is he not engaged in business there the one who sent a deposition for your trial christopher cashman aye lewrie agreed he bought into an importexport and chandlery livesey seabright and cashman has offices and warehouses on water street he wrote me the sawmill on eagles island cross the river why we knew the liveseys before the revolution rebels though decent people in the main caroline fondly reminisced of her girlhood home in the cape fear low country the only seabright that i recall was a newcome from england an officer of the royal artillery whod emigrated for land married a livesey i think he did he was a rebel too helped manage the guns at widow moores creek bridge when our friends and neighbours from the scot settlements at cross creek and campbelltown were slaughtered ah well and who is desmond mcgillivery from charleston say who again lewrie started hed missed thatun when hed hurriedly sorted through them and good as things seemed to be going with his wife they could turn to sheepshit the instant she learned that desmond mcgillivery was yet another of his bastards a result of his brief very unofficial wedding to a captured cherokee slave of the muskogee indians when hed been up the apalachicola to entice them into war against the yankee doodle frontier oh i remember he was a midshipman in the american navy i met back in ninetyeight his uncle was captain of one of their cobbledtogether warships going after the frogs when america and france got huffy with each other i felt sad for the lad his mother was indian dont ye know weve corresponded on and off wonder what hes up to now caroline paid that letter no more attention enrapt by those from sewallis and hugh and thought no more about it whew lewrie secretly gloated cheated death again he would reply to desmonds letter very much on the sly and pay stricter attention to the senders names the next time he collected the mails chapter fourteen wonder of wonders domestic relations took an even sweeter turn as spring progressed as sewallis and hugh returned from their school for the summer and filled the house with japes pranks and laughter there were more family rides together more companionable breakfasts walking tours of the farm through sheep cattle and foals nattering with day labourers and their few permanent employees and yarns from liam desmond and patrick furfy about battles and grand adventures the lewries even went visiting as a travelling troupe first to high wycombe to attend burgess and theodoras nuptials then up to london for some major shopping and lastly down to the langlies at horsham in kent to visit with sophie and her husband and inlaws even lewries father sir hugo had coached down for thatun for hed always been dotingfond of sophie as she had been of him her replacement grandpиre lodgings well they could reach london in a day but once there their favourite old haunt in williss rooms convenient to all the best shops and sights could only accommodate so many guests in so many beds charlotte and the boys could be bedded down on cots or in one nearby room lewrie and his wife were forced to share a bedstead of their own together the same arrangements were forced upon them halfway to the wedding at high wycombe and in a posting house in the town as well and the jaunt to horsham not only forced alan and caroline to sleep in the same bed on the way but once there mr and mrs langlie insisted upon putting them up at their house assuming that capt and mrs lewrie were just another typical married couple who naturally shared a bedchamber perhaps it was the joy of burgesss wedding perhaps the relit notion of romance and a slew of wines and brandies taken aboard during the day but alan and caroline found themselves in such close proximity in such companionable darkness and in such thin summer sleeping clothes that nature at last had its way and in the mornings after such enforced intimacies caroline expressed such fondness and affection that lewrie could imagine that their years long bitterness had been no more than a quickly forgotten little spat over her paying too much for a new bonnet and even more miraculous was the fact that once back home in anglesgreen there was no more of that damnable guest chamber for him lewrie was back in his wifes good graces though he hadnt a clue how it had come about indeed so content with things did she seem that caroline could even abide a midsummer visit from sir hugo down from london for a spell of country life hed never been one of her favourite relations yet more cool tea caroline asked sir hugo as they all sat in the shade of an oak near the backgarden of the house or might you be more partial to the lemonade the tea mdear thankee kindly sir hugo replied sprawled in a slat chair near the table and idly fanning himself for it was a warmish afternoon that rob o lemon drink makes me gaseous just a dollop o lemon in the teas sufficient a wasp now and then hummed about the sweetness of the lemonade or the napkincovered plates of scones or sandwiches horses snorted neighed and clopped as patrick furfy walked them in circles in the paddock cattle lowed as calves butted for their milk and it was almost so quiet as to be able to hear sheep munching grass except for the children of course charlotte sat attable primly enough to all appearances in her style of hair and gown a miniature adult though she did tend to prate cooing nonsense to her newest doll and that damned lap dog of hers sewallis and hugh were on their knees sailing their model frigates at each other over a closemowed green sea and ordering their sailors about just ready to open fire lewrie sat sprawled in an equal untidyness in a chair on the other side of the table a widebrimmed straw farmers hat set low on his eyebrows one eye open for the shrill argument to come over first broadsides and what damage the boys guns had done to the other ones hull or rigging have you ever been to paris or to france sir hugo caroline casually enquired halloa whats that lewrie thought france sir hugo scoffed cant say that i have dye not count calais was in holland for a time dye see and found it more convenient treturn tengland through calais he breezed off haw lewrie silently sneered long ago when a captain in the th regiment of foot the kings own he scampered off from his wife elizabeth lewrie once he discovered that some of his fellow officers had bamboozled him with a false justice a sham wedding and an elopement to holland there to wait for the riches that should have come with his mothers dowry and goods once sir hugod discovered that there would be no quick fortune that a very pregnant girl was boresome nagging and a burden on his shrinking purse and that he was technically as free as larks he had fled her taking her jewelry along and danced his way back to london didnt know that lewrie commented i thought youd sailed direct from amsterdam he tilted up the brim of his hat to peer at sir hugos answer to that tacitly jeering got distracted sir hugo rejoined with a toothy fuckyeforasking smile why dye ask mdear well now were at peace with france caroline tentatively said as she poured a glass of tea for herself and it seems that they mean for it to last i was thinking on what sophie and her husband told us of their jaunt over there it may not be like a grand tour of the continent as wealthier folk than we undertake yet i must own to a certain curiosity very rich members of the aristocracy considered a grand tour of france holland some of the germanies spain and portugual and of course the ruins of ancient rome and the artistic cities of italy with a stopover in vienna and venice a necessity for the finishing of their welleducated and polished children and to seek bargains in paintings sculptures and gold and silver work to enhance the furnishings of their mansions and estates seen toulon at least lewrie harrumphed spots ashore in the gironde to boot thats enough o france thold me for a lifetime a squalid damned place toulon dirtier than cheapside or wapping no i dont mean you cat you know tbathe if the frogs dont he had to tell his blackandwhite torn who at the mention of his name leaped into lewries lap not to be left out of it chalky came trotting to join toulon abandoning his butterfly hunt it would be educational for the boys caroline went on in an offhanded way improve their french which every civilised man must speak je suis un crayon mort de ma vie lewrie quipped oh tosh caroline objected so youre a pencil are you death of your life papas a pencil charlotte gawped then burst into titters in point of fact lewries french was abysmal execrably bad i spose a tour o france might teach em something mdear sir hugo told her how vile are the french so they hate em as bad as the devil hates holy water th rest o their lives haw haw perhaps as a proper honeymoon caroline said lowering her eyes and going a tad enigmatic as sophie and anthony did not have when they wed with his ship ready to put back to sea as soon as the wind shifted as short as ours was recall alan there had been one short night at a posting house in petersfield and two weeks at the george inn in portsmouth with him gone half the time fitting out little hms alacrity for her voyage to the bahamas hemm uttered both lewrie and his father for both knew what she was driving at and the reason for it youre sunk hugh yelled i shot you clean through did not sewallis loudly objected i dismasted you so you cant move can too from hugh facedown on the grass to shove his ship ships dont sink sewallis insisted shuffling on his knees to move his model frigate hughs followed at a rate of knots do too they burn they blow up youre on fire lads lewrie barked springing from his chair and scattering cats leave off another instant and theyd be rolling and pummelling each other here let me show you how things go lewrie knelt on the grass green stains on the knees of his old and comfortable white sloptrousers bedamned now which of ye is the enemy both pointed at the other accusingly faces screwed up lets say the winds from there from the stables and the paddock he instructed so you both should be sailin this way on the same course sewallis has the wind gage aye but his larboard guns cant elevate high enough to dismast ye hugh you on the other hand in his lee can shoot high enough and as he explained to his sons a couple of curious setters and both cats that it was very rare for a ship to be sunk in action that extreme pains were taken to prevent fires and that it might take an hour or better to batter a foe into submission caroline looked on with a fond smile on her face the very picture of contentment as she absently jammed a fresh scone for charlotte ye look pleased with life mdear sir hugo pointed out in the main i am sir thank you she told him with a grin france though paris sir hugo queried with a scowl perhaps a second honeymoon as i said a proper one this time she answered though she was smiling the determined vertical furrow twixt her brows was prominent after all ive had to put up with i believe we owe it to each other a fresh beginning that he owes you more tth point sir hugo leered indeed caroline rejoined with a slow firm nod chapter fifteen thisll mostlike put me in debtors prison fore were done lewrie ruefully told himself as he delved into his washleather coin purse to tip the porters once their luggage had been stowed aboard the hired coach some in the boot and the most valuable inside the box it was prime sport for vagrants and street thugs to slit the straps and leather covers of the boot and make off with the luggage with the travellers all unsuspecting til they reached their last stop the porters were a surly lot unhappy to accept british coinage and to deal with an anglais a bloody a biftec in pidgin french all square lewrie asked the porters uh cest toutbon uhn growled one grr the other porter sourly replied au revoir then lewrie concluded boarding the coach and may ye all catch the pox if ye aint poxed already he muttered under his breath after closing the coach door such a warm and welcomin people the frogs he told his wife caroline seated by herself on the forwardfacing padded bench seat feelin a touch better my dear lewrie solicitously enquired the ginger pastilles seem to have availed yes she replied the crossing on the small packet from dover to calais had been a rough one theyd had bright skies and brisk winds but the narrows of the channel when a strong tide was running could produce a prodigious chop and the packet had staggered and swooped over steep tenfoot seas with only thirty or fourty feet between the swells the last time that caroline had been at sea returning from the bahamas aboard the little hms alacrity a ketchrigged bomb converted to a shallowdraught gunboat that would bucket about in any sort of weather past placid shed suffered roiled innards for days before regaining the sea legs she had found on the stormy passage out in the packet voyage had been so short that caroline had had no time to acclimate and she had spent most of the trip past the harbour mole by a bucket or the lee rails even last night spent in a squalid calais travellers inn she could tolerate nothing more strenuous than cups of herbal tea and thin chicken broth the ginger pastilles were made in london by smith amp co recommended by another couple crossing to france with them sir pulteney something fruitish and his wife lady starts with an i both of em of the most extreme languid and lofty airs the sort that set english teeth on edge worried about caroline lewrie hadnt paid all that much attention to the social niceties and once on solid ground at calais had been more than happy to decline an invitation to dine with the whosits on account of carolines tetchy boudins a further vague suggestion to meet again in paris hed shrugged off as well well were off lewrie said to fill a void as their coachee whipped up and set their equipage in motion once out in open country and fresh clean air i expect that we shall enjoy this much better caroline opined holding a scented handkerchief to her nose as she looked out the windows it will be a fine adventure im bound sweeter smellin than calais at any rate lewrie agreed with her seaports always reek though he suspected that every french city or town would prove as noxious as dung wharf or the old fleet ditch in london long ago paved over and how the devil did i end up chivvied into this he asked himself for the hundredth time guilt mostlike no one back in anglesgreen had thought much of their jaunt to france well millicent chiswick carolines brothers wife had deemed it a very romantic idyll but she was about the only one weeks of well not exactly harping and nagging had preceded the actuality thered been french maps and atlases turning up mysteriously then a weedy university lad to tutor the children in french though he and caroline had somehow become pupils as well not that those lessons had done lewries linguistic skills all that much good he had a smattering of hindi from service in the far east between the wars in a dab or two of french from duty in the mediterranean in the s and several good public schools from which he had been booted and a few words and phrases of russian from dealings with the delectable eudoxia durschenko and her equally appalling papa and his mostrecent service in the baltic curse words mostly foul oaths and the sketchiest rudimentary necessities such as i will order the fetch me too hot too cold hello goodbye dye have any ale and the everuseful fetch out yer whores schoolboy greek was still a mystery too though he had done rather well in latin mostly due to all the battles described and the lurid and scandalous poems caroline heaved a petulant sigh and knit her brows creating that vertical furrow that was usually a sign of her anger lewried gotten very familiar with thatun over the years and involuntarily crossed his legs to protect his wedding tackle somethin troublin caroline oh the children she replied fretful i know i thought our getting away would help but theyre havin a grand time dear lewrie told her dont fret about them his father sir hugo st george willoughby had agreed to spend most of the summer in the country and would look out for the boys at his dun roman with the help of his exotic man trilochan singh a swarthy oneeyed sikh as randy and as dangerouslooking as the worst sort of calcutta bazaaribadmash whod cut your throat just to keep in practise to corrupt sewallis and hugh even further liam desmond and pat furfy would be near to hand with their seafaring tales yarns and irish myths and though his uncle phineas chiswick and his brotherinlaw governour chiswick deplored it charlotte would be included during the days though governour had insisted that she reside with him and his wife accurately thinking that exposing a girl to too much of sir hugos past repute would quite ruin her to irk governour even further sir hugo would take all three of them into town to play with will conys children a rambunctious and rowdy set as wild as red indians now was caroline having second thoughts oh is that not the grandest chateau alan caroline suddenly enthused shifting over to the other side of the coach to goggle at a substantial manse surrounded by pasture land vineyards and manicured green lawns and do i detect that our coach is travelling upon a very welllaid road perhaps one of bonapartes decrees pray god hes more interest in roads and canals than armies lewrie replied though his professional sense was that armies marched faster and farther on good roads than bad and the peasants caroline further enthused as their coach passed a waggon heavily loaded with hay drawn by a brace of plodding oxen and goaded and accompanied by several french farmers their wives and children are they not picturesque native costume do you think to lewries eyes what they wore looked more like a mixture of embroidered vests straw hats voluminous skirts wooden clogs and rags rootless irish mendicants could be deemed better dressed catchascatchcan id spose was his verdict why one would imagine you had no curiosity in your soul his wife teasingly accused or is it that you have fought the french for so long you cant fake interest so long as they aint tryin tkill me ill allow that they are colourful folk he said with a smirk given a choice though hindoos win colourful hands down and so it went all the way to amiens where they laid over for the night in a much cleaner travellers hotel where carolines appetite was much restored and though the chalked menu and the waiters unhelpful explanations might as well have been sanskrit they managed to order both excellent hearty meals and a couple of bottles of very good wine as for dessert french apple pie was as succulent as english apple pie and the lewries went to bed in fine fettle just a bit past eight ready for an early rising and the next leg of their trip to fabled paris chapter sixteen the lewries found good lodgings a spacious appartement on the rue honorй just a short stroll north of the jardin des tuileries and the palais national and palais de la rйvolution they found themselves a brace of englishspeaking servants a pleasant young fellow named jules for him and a dumpling of a girl named marianne for caroline at juless suggestion they engaged an englishspeaking guide too jeanjoseph a very smooth customer and a veteran of the early italian campaigns under the fabled napoleon bonaparte led them to the best bank where lewrie exchanged a noteofhand drawn on coutts in london and his pound notes for french currency with a temporary account set up to cover their expected expenses then with a programme of sights lined up by jeanjoseph they set off to experience paris and its environs the place de la bastille now an open space since the infamous old prison had been razed the faubourg du temple the hфtel de ville and notre dame of course along with the оles de la citй and the site of the revolutionary court and palais de justice the vieux louvre of course too filled with artworks looted during many of napoleons famed campaigns they did the right bank all the grand churches and former palaces the champsйlysйes and champs de mars they did the left bank cross the pont neuf along the broad and impressive quai dorsai and quai de voltaire visited the pantheon and the cordeliers convent the abbaye de stgermaindesprйs the luxembourg palace and the massive maison nationale des invalides and every dayjaunt was interrupted with a fine meal at a restaurant bistro or cafй that jeanjoseph just happened to know all about and recommended highly there were carriage trips to versailles argenteuil and the bucolic splendour of st denis and asniиressurseine which caroline thought the equal of the willowed reeded banks of the upper thames replete with swans and cruising geese it was all so impressive so romantic did wonders for caroline and the complete restoration of her wifely affection for which lewrie was more than thankful that he could almost be glad theyd gone but for the stench of course firstly there were the open sewers flowing with ordure and the unidentifiable slop down the centre of some streets evidently parisians thought nothing of emptying their chamberpots out the nearest window with but the sketchiest warning of garde а leau even the seine a very pretty river even in the bucolic stretches was filled with foul somethings yet to lewries amazement people actually fished it and seemed happy with their catches secondly there were the frogs themselves oh perhaps some of the better sort might bathe weekly and might even be so dainty as to launder their underclothes and wear fresh on sunday at least then not change til the next saturday admittedly there were quite a few english who were high the common folk and his sailors held that a fellow needed only three complete baths with soap included in their lives at their birthing the morning of their wedding and bathed by others before their bodies were put in winding sheets and the grave yet the french whew soap might be rare but colognes hungary waters and perfumes covered the lack among the better sorts common frenchmen and frenchwomen could reek so badly that lewrie was put in mind of a corpses armpit it is said msieur jeanjoseph gaily imparted with a snicker that when bonaparte sailed from egypt he sent his wife josephine letters by several ships saying i arrive do not bathe hawn hawn you know a good perfumery lewrie asked him la parfumerie msieur mais oui jeanjoseph exclaimed you wish the finest scents and sachets in all the world madame lewrie i know the very place but peraps msieur would find such shopping a tedium non and a milliners a dressmakers a shoemakers caroline happily ticked off on her lacegloved fingers and perhaps a dry goods a uhm les йtoffes jean for fabrics before the dressmakers but of course madame jeanjoseph heartily agreed the very best of fashion artistes the most impressive fabrics from people whom i know are most skilled and he intimated with a wink the final works can be had bon marchй that is to say inexpensively now why do i get the feelin weve fallen into the clutches of a french version of clotworthy chute lewrie had to ask himself weve not seen inexpensive since we left amiens and it would not go amiss did you have a suit of clothes run up for yourself alan caroline suggested france sets the style for the entire world after all and what you brought along їs a bit long in tooth by now she said giving him a chary lookingover uhm perhaps lewrie allowed in his teens before his father had pressganged him into the navy thered been an inheritance from his mothers side and sir hugod needed the money perishin bad lewries clothing tastes had run to the extreme macaroni styles but after better than half his life spent in uniform what fashion sense hed had had dulled to more sobre convention perhaps your maid marianne and i can escort you to the shops madame jeanjoseph spritely babbled on and for msieur perhaps he can be guided by jules to whom i will impart the location of the most stylish tailor in all paris nestce pas uhm thatd suit lewrie said with a shrug suit ha msieur is so droll jeanjoseph all but simpered isnt he caroline agreed with a roll of her eyes and on your separate jaunt alan you might see about your swords aye call on our embassy too lewrie said with rising enthusiasm to be frank about it lewrie by then had had his fill of museums grand cathedrals and art galleries monuments to the revolution and its brutalities and in point of fact their unctuous guide jeanjoseph as well and hed always despised being dragged along on feminine shopping trips a full day on his own would be very welcome msieur wishes a swordsmith jeanjoseph enquired a golden glint in his eyes at the thought of more spending with his recommended artisans the british embassy lewrie told him we do have one here do we not now were at peace there is msieur jeanjoseph replied looking a bit mystified i can instruct jules to direct you there as well very good then lewrie decided today or tomorrow dear tomorrow caroline said so i may spend the whole day at it peraps then madame and msieur desire dinner quite by coincidence there is an excellent restaurant nearby and their food magnifique jeanjoseph enthused kissing his fingers in the air lead on then lewrie told him lead on chapter seventeen ne hopes that readers will be patient with a slight digression from lewries foreign adventure but a few people also in paris must be introduced before the tale may continue as lewrie discovered in london the winter before when between seagoing commissions even the greatest most populated city in the civilised world can seem too small when out of the blue or overcast grey in londons case all the embarrassing people who should never be in the same place at the same time or ever actually meet do show up and share greetings in london it was an innocent trip into the strand to purchase ink stationery and sealing wax and a chance meeting on the sidewalks with his old school chums theyd all three been expelled from harrow for arson and riotous behaviour at the same time lord peter rushton viscount draywick and that clever scoundrel clotworthy chute which rencontre had been interrupted in distressing happenstance by the arrival of the lovely delectable and hot after lewrie eudoxia durschenko better known as the scythian princess but really a cossack who performed bareback and damn near nude with daniel wigmores peripatetic extravaganza as a crack shot with the recurved horn bow seconding as the ingenue in wigmores theatrical troupe along with her papa arslan artimovich durschenko the oneeyed knifethrower and lion tamer a man who was determined to see his daughter buried a virgin and who hated capt alan lewrie much like satan hated holy water despite that theyd ended together in the same tea shop at the same table with sticky buns and jam lord peter drooling over eudoxia eudoxia batting lashes at lewrie clotworthy finagling how much money he might screw from the russians and eudoxias father whispering low curses near lewries ear whilst lewrie strove for innocent as if it couldve gotten any worse oh yes it could in had swept the former actress emma batson now the mother abbess of the finest brothel in the city with two of her girls one named tess whom lewrie deprived of his wifes affections for several years was regularly rogering oh it had been so jolly but we do digress as for paris now lewrie would think it very slim odds that he would know anyone among its hundreds of thousands of residents except for the new first consul napoleon bonaparte and it was even slimmer odds that he and bonaparte would ever come facetoface bonapartes guns had sunk lewries commandeered mortar ship off the eastern side of toulon during the brief capture of the port during the first coalition blown it and him skyhigh in point of fact and temporarily made lewrie a soggy prisoner on the beach before spanish cavalry had galloped to the rescue dame fortune however has always found a way to put the boot in where alan lewrie is concerned when he is at his smuggest and most content in the heart of the city down both sides of the seine lay the government buildings and former royal palaces napoleon bonaparte was living in the tuileries palace now the palais national in the eightroom appartement formerly occupied by louis xvi the lewries quite by chance or was it were lodging in a maison on the rue honorй the main thoroughfare that leads past the tuileries and the constituent assembly and dining and shopping and gawking in the same environs where the better sort of french reside and conduct their business where the most exclusive shops are found where people seeking favour and government employment gather is it any wonder then that at the very moment that caroline alan and their guide depart a restaurant pleasingly stuifed with one of the first consuls favourite dishes a blend of eggs crayfish tomatoes and chicken called poulet marengo in honour of one of bonapartes grandest battlefield victories also pleasantly foxed with wine and out nearly one thousand francsthat someone from lewries past should just happen to be limping away from the ministry of marine to his miserly and squalid lodgings in the mazelike ancient quarter round the hфtel de ville salaud the limping man hissed in shock his remaining hand jerking to the sudden twinge of pain in his ravaged and partly masked face a stabbing memory brought on by the sight of his nemesis cest lui putain cest lui espиce de petite vermine lewrie it is lewrie other people who shared the sidewalk with himstrollers or the ones in more haste about their businessgave the hideous old cripple a wider berth than they usually would one or two tapping their heads and telling their companions that the ogre was dйbile insane and best avoided perhaps guillaume choundas formerly a capitaine de vaisseau of the french navy was partly insane by then and that anglais bastard lewrie was the cause of it and his crippled state tween the wars in the far east in the s a handsome and whole guillaume choundas had armed and organised native philippine and borneo pirates won them over as french allies should another war come against the british as it had in and ravaged british trade in the malay and china seas both country ships and those of the east india company to counter their losses the british had sent out a disguised warship to counter choundass own and suppress piracy despite all of his jesuittrained cleverness his bretonpirate native guile and his lust to succeed and advance in the old aristocratic french navy despite his commoner birth as a fishermans son hed been bested his allies slaughtered and their proas sunk or burned lastly he and his lanun rover pirates had been surprised on balabac island in the philippines and on a beach choundas had made his last stand against the anglais and that ignorant bastard lewrie had fought him facetoface outclassed on his back in the surf and one cut or thrust from death lewrie had somehow risen his hanger slashing upwards silvery and trailing glittering seawaterfor choundass blind eye could still see it and laying choundass face open to the bone cutting clean across one eyeball laying him in the acidburning salt surf to scream writhe and shriek an angry petulant kick to lewries shins had drawn another cut in response and guillaume was not only mutilated but hamstrung and left a limping cripple for life theyd met again in the mediterranean in choundas amply rewarded by the ministry of marine and the directory in paris for his zeal at rooting out royalists reactionaries spies and traitors to the revolution during the terror was placed in charge of all coasting convoys and their protection from marseilles and toulon into the ligurian sea and the gulf of genoa to support and supply napoleons first italian campaign and dammit but lewrie and his sloop of war jester had been a leader in ravaging his coasters his lesser gunboats had sailed right into protected harbours to take sink or burn making choundas appear incompetent his greatest feattaking a british packet full of silver meant to prop up their allies the austrians and pay their own sailorsshould have won him laurels choundas had snuck it into genoa to pay volunteers to join the french army but to escape and return home in glory hed had to sail a civilian lateenrigged tub back west and there jester had been choundas had been rowed ashore to a friendly port village but lewrie had taken the lateener sailed it right onto the rocky shore and pursued him with a small party on horseback miles inland til choundas had reached the safety of napoleons army a cavalry squadron sure to gallop down and sweep his foe away yet even as hed sneered lewrie had dismounted an impossible two hundred yards or better away had taken aim with his rifled musket surely the ancient celtic gods had been with him and against choundas that day for the ominous raven had flown on choundass righta dire portentand lewrie had shot him spilled him from the saddle in fresh agony and rage and the army surgeons had had to take his arm off better he had died then lastly in the west indies in and at the height of the slave rebellion on french st domingue capitaine guillaume choundas commanded a fine frigate and coordinated the privateers and smuggling ships from guadeloupe raiding british commerce arming the factions on st domingue then dealing with the ungrateful americans whod all but declared war on their saviour during the american revolution owing to the french policy of stopping and inspecting yankee cargo ships that traded with frances enemies and making prize of the offenders the quasiwar it had been termed perhaps it had been the tropic heat the touchy dyspeptic state of his digestion and his infirmities but choundas once hed learned lewrie was there in hms proteus could think of nothing else but his revenge especially after lewrie had sailed proteus right into basseterre harbour and had caught choundas and his frigate at anchor had bowraked her mercilessly and crippled her timbers as surely as hed crippled choundas without european replacement oak knees futtocks beams stempost and timbers she might as well have been burned to salvage her metal fittings then lewrie had been there in concert with the americans at the moment choundass last escorted convoy to st domingue had been brought to battle it had been a monstrous american frigate which had taken him but lewrie had come aboard to taunt and demand custody of him and thank god for those chivalrous fools the yankees who would not give him up but took him on his parole to baltimore when choundas came home to france after that final humiliation griped in his guts lamer and older his old compatriots from the early days of the revolution were no longer there driven from office and the public view replaced by ambitious younger men whod serve a king if it meant employment promotion and wealth the bourgeois timeservers the directory of five were dead or displaced the later consulate taken over by this upstart corsican salaud bonaparte and guillaume choundas was now a pensioner living handtomouth unloved and unhonoured for his grand contributions to the revolution he was poor one step away from begging reduced to the cheapest stale loaves rancid cheese and sour vin ordinare which victuals he found hard to chew with inflamed gums and loose teeth when he was whole and unmarked any whore would accept his coins any very young and virginal native girl could be forced into his bed when he was powerful albeit mutilated prisoners wives girlfriends and daughters oh the daughters were his on guadeloupe he had had the power and the money to savage any whore and hush it up but now he might as well have become a monk and it was all lewries fault without allies without friends and accomplices though what could he do about it to take his revenge at last to kill lewrie no seize him first butcher him near death then ravage that woman on his arm whom choundas suspected was his wife right before lewries eyes before cutting her throat blinding lewrie hamstringing him as he had choundas and leaving him a worse cripple for the rest of his life oh yes but how former capitaine guillaume choundas cast a glance over his shoulder towards the ministry of marine on the left bank of the seine wondering if anyone official might be concerned that such a successful and dangerous foe as lewrie was here in paris this moment spying perhaps would that make someone sit up and take notice he looked back just in time to see lewrie the woman and a third young fellow entering a grand maison converted to appartements if nothing else choundas knew where lewrie resided where he could he found when the time came for vengeance chapter eighteen the next morning it was carolines turn for an encounter with more people from her husbands past one of whom was very well known to her by name at least as a result of a series of poisonpen letters over several years and one of whom she would not recognise from eve with her husband off with his manservant jules to shop on his own and call upon their recently reestablished embassy caroline along with her maidservant marianne and the garrulous and charming jean began a shopping trip of her own the sort of shopping which unfaithful husbands owe their wives and longsuffering women deserve there was a parfumerie that jeanjoseph had mentioned the very best most exclusive shop in all of paris which was to say the best in all of france which also left unsaid the very best in the world it was called la contessas just off the place victor and its scents could be discerned even before the front of the store was reached a bright red doorset between matching bowwindows filled with arrays of vials jars and droppers of scents with sachets for armoires and dresser drawers with scented soaps face powders and cosmeticsopened to the accompaniment of the gay tinkling of a shop bell hung over the transom oh it smells grand jean caroline enthused pausing to inhale and gaze about madame a young clerk enquired drawn by the bell it fell to jeanjoseph to explain that mrs lewries french was not all that good and that he would be translating the young girl lifted her nose and almost sniffed in derision even while she maintained her smile dealing with anglais travellers was odious enough and those who could not even attempt to speak french garbling as bad as hairyarmed gascons were even worse as jeanjoseph glibly continued requesting that la contessa herself attend his charge knowing that la contessa was somewhat fluent in english a couple entered the shop behind them the young fellow was a major in the dark green scarletcollared and trimmed uniform coat of the chasseurs very gay and charming the young lady with him was stunningly beautiful with bluegrey eyes and chestnutcoloured hair done up in ringlets framing her face chinois bangs on her forehead and a chignon behind madame lewrie wishes to sample your scents your colognes and bath powders mademoiselle jeanjoseph went on tipping the girl a wink to let her know that madame had money and would not know if she was being gulled your very best nestce pas at the mention of carolines name the girl with the chestnut hair blanched and seized her companions arm for support lewrie cest lui impossible she thought her mind areel it cannot be charitй you are unwell ma chйrie the young major enquired the uhm the richness of the aromas overcome me she told him recovering her aplomb and plastering gay coquetry on her face moving deeper into the store so she could look back from beneath lowered lashes at the woman who went by the name of lewrie she is very attractive charitй angelette de guilleri thought for a woman in her fourties she sneeringly overestimated is she his widow or another sanglante a bloody for here we meet someone else whod crossed hawses with capt alan lewrie charitй angelette de guilleri had once been the younger daughter of a rich creole planter family in louisiana the belle of any gathering in her beloved new orleans even if that original french colony had been traded off long before to the grubby spanish an odious fact that she and many other french creoles had resented everyone wished to restore louisiana and new orleans to france they debated it talked about it emoted over it yet so few tried to do anything about it so long as the rice and sugar crops were good the prices high the ships came from round the world for their produce and the moribund lazy spanish officials left them alone as light and as weak as the spanish yoke was it was still an onerous occupation so much so that at last charitй and her brothersoh her clever and active handsome brothers long dead now hippolyte and helio with their impoverished cousin jeanmarie rancour whose family had fled the slave rebellion and bloody massacres of whites and landowners on st domingue with less than a tithe of their former wealthhad sworn to take action to set a patriotic example for everyone else of like but timid mind the spirit of revolution stalked the earth after all first among those barbarous yankees in the american colonies then in the beloved belle france to rise up to strike was their patriotic duty the civilised world would be remade two old privateers from the french and indian war boudreaux balfa and jйrфme lanxade had access to schooners and their old crewmen downriver in the bayous and bays and to raise the funds to start a revolution to purchase the arms required for the time when the people would rise up they had engaged in piracy thrilling piracy against all ships but french which admittedly were rare in the gulf of mexico in and spanish ships the most preferred but any nations would suit so long as they had rich cargoes to sell off and money aboard thrilling too was the life of a pirate a secret searover an unsuspected rebel like the barebreasted heroine of the french revolution the emblematic marianne with the flagstaff of the tricolour in one hand and a bayonetted musket in the other in the forefront of the battle line and urging the others on against tyrants and oppressors exciting too had been living two lives she was charitй the demure coquette in the city but aboard their schooner le revenant she donned buccaneer clothes riding boots and skintight breeches loose flowing shirts and snug vests with pistols in her sash and a sword on her hip and shed been a good shot too as much a terror to the crews of the ships they took as the fabled women pirates of an earlier age anne bonny and mary read even if they had been anglais but that sanglant that anglais salaud alan lewrie had come upriver to new orleans playacting a penniless but skilled english adventurer and merchantman mate in civilian clothes to spy out a source of their piracy unsuspecting til it was much too late charitй had found him amusing attractive and eminently satisfying at lovemaking she blushed as she recalled how shed almost recruited the bastard into their covert band considered him as something more permanent than a wicked fling and for a brief naпve time felt love for him to be betrayed at barataria bay when alan lewrie and his frigate and a schooner had turned up landing sailors and marines on the ocean side of grand isle sailing in himself and killing poor old jйrфme lanxade with a sword taking his schooner and ordering his men to kill both her brothers and her cousin in the foulest way she and that laffite boy and boudreaux balfa and his son had fled in a pirogue lewrie had pursued them in a rowing boat and with tears of rage in her eyes shed levelled a girandoni airrifle taken aim square in the middle of lewries chest and despite her tears was sure shed killed him the range had been nearly fourty yards he had been standing amidships of his boat and had fallen backwards as if he had been poleaxed not to arise as long as his boat was in sight the scandal had been hushed up kept from the spanish authorities and charitй had been sent packing declared dйbile by the murder of her brothers and cousin allegedly by runaway slaves round barataria she was doomed to live a mundane life with distant relatives the lemerciers in the quaint town of rambouillet outside paris shed quickly fled that had found a way to inveigle her way into the company of the elite of the late directory period and the tripartate consulate into the best salons where with her beauty her outspokenness her coquetry and feminine charms she had gotten close to the director of national police the clever if ugly and bald fouchй the elegant but lame foreign minister talleyrand and after his seizure of power the first consul napoleon bonaparte himself her slaying of the anglais navy captain her attempt at revolution in new orleans and louisiana had made her a minor celebrity in her own right and the loss of her brothers and cousin a tragic figure who pleaded for a restoration of the louisiana territory to france now would it all come undone did alan lewrie live she had to know she idly strolled closer to the english woman sniffing at articles on display listening closely though to another person in the shop just another gay coquette chuckling and teasing her handsome companion the dashing young major of chasseurs la contessa emerged from the rear of the shop a petite brunette with large brown eyes a fine trim figure and the face of a teenaged angelminx oddly la contessa bore a slim and wiry young whiteandtan cat in her arms a cat with a diamondstudded collar round its neck ah jeanjoseph mon cher so appy to see you again said la contessa with a grand and languid air usually seen among the aristos of the prerevolutionary era she presented her hand to be kissed you bring a distinguish english lady to my umble shop cest merveilleux allow me to present madame caroline lewrie a visitor from england to you madame jeanjoseph smarmily announced madame lewrie i present to you mademoiselle phoebe aretino famed throughout paris as la contessa de la bastia on corsica the queen of parfumeurs phoebe aretino caroline exclaimed in a stiff tone each word huffed with her eyes suddenly asquint and her brow furrowed madame lew sophie aretino stammered her mouth agawp in utter shock ahem you are

do not jeanjoseph spluttered i will give my husband your regards caroline archly concluded with a snide smile do not expect them to be returned au revoir give him your zut merde alors he lives charitй thought in sudden alarm like to faint at that news really ma chйrie you look as if you will swoon her major of chasseurs worriedly said more than glad to put an arm about her to support her for like most men who met charitй de guilleri the dashing young cavalryman major denis clary was enamoured perhaps a restorative brandy or ah charitй denied taking in a deep breath no mon cher i am fine truly excuse me for one moment ah mademoiselle aretino who was that horrid creature anglaise was she they are such a rude people pardon me for asking but why would a stranger insult you so she solicitously enquired it is no the contessa of bastia began to snap setting her slim cat down on a glasstopped counter and delicately putting her fingertips to her temples oui she was rude such a shock to hear her name and to charitйs amazement mlle phoebe aretinos distress turned to a wistful smile of reverie as she absently began to stroke her cat from so long ago nestce pas phoebe aretino said further perhaps not all the anglais are horrid some of their men well that with even more wistfulness almost a sheepish smile he had you too charitй wryly realised and for but a brief second almost felt a pang of dare she call it jealousy i may help you select a scent mademoiselle phoebe aretino asked back to business something new to delight your charming young man more of a scent you purchased before on the streets outside caroline lewrie set a hectic furious pace along the rue neuve des petits champs to turn south cross traffic down the east side of the palais egalitй to return to the rue honorй her applecheeked maid marianne puffed along in her wake as did her guide jeanjoseph who took the kerb side to protect her gown from the muck thrown up from carriage wheels madame lewrie i do not understand he said la contessas is the most exclusive nowhere else in paris is there such a variety did she somehow give offence if so my pardons to you for taking you there but jeanjoseph had not walked all that fast since his last forced marches into savoia in i know of her caroline snapped until you named her i did not make the connexion under her breath she added the baggage oh ho jeanjoseph intuited carefully hiding a smirk as he fell behind her a step to mask his amusement capitaine lewrie is un chaud lapin the hot rabbit mon dieu he dipped his biscuit in la contessa oh i see the lucky shit before or after he marries hmm then with a gallic shrug and an urge to whistle gaily he wryly thought during hawn hawn fabrics jean the best caroline huffed then dressmakers milliners everything oh this will cost msieur lewrie dear jeanjoseph gleefully thought all but rubbing his hands with joy over how much she would be spending with his friends and how large his kickback would be chapter nineteen before it was reestablished the british embassy had been in french hands for several years from til and had not been treated well it had an odour of dirty feet and old socks of barrack farts and sweat as if troops of the garde nationale had been garrisoned there effort had been expended to clean it up and make it grand once more but it was a continuing process after announcing himself and the reason for his call lewrie had cooled his heels in the baroque lower lobby for an hour or better before some catchfart flunky saw him abovestairs to the offices of sir anthony paisleytempleton who held the odd title of chargй daffaires which could have meant anything lewrie had met a few people who parted their last names and had come away with a less than favourable impression one reenforced by his first sight of the fellow sir anthony was a wispy young fellow at least ten or twelve years lewries junior with pale skin and a stylish thick head of pale blond hair poetically curled on top sides and nape but brushed forward over his forehead his long sideburns brushed forward towards his cheeks as well he sported stylish suitings too it went without saying in the latest french cut with upstanding shirt collars captain alan lewrie so honoured tmeet you sir sir anthony enthused as he offered a hand to be shaken one so limp once taken in hand that lewrie might as well have been shaking a dead fish followed your trial last year dont ye know capital doings capital hah with about as much true enthusiasm as a clenchjawed oxonian of the quality ever allowed out in publick lewrie took note now what is it you wish to do captain lewrie meet bonaparte sorry but that would be impossible it just isnt done old chap sir anthony poohpoohed a rencontre with bonaparte isnt necessary lewrie told him didnt exactly enjoy the first anyway the point is ive several swords surrendered by french naval captains and id like treturn em to their owners or their heirs in exchange bonaparte does have one of my old swords my very first nothin grand about it but it is dear tme gifted me just before i gained my lieutenancy dye see you erm kept surrendered swords sir sir anthony paisleytempleton asked seeming tremulously appalled i thought the customary usage was to refuse and allow the surrendee to maintain possession of his honour sir it uslly is are they alive ttake em back lewrie said crossing his legs at sublime ease in a chair cross the desk from the slim diplomat most werent he added with a shrug and a grin i see sir anthony said with a barely imperceptible gulp something could be arranged twixt me and their admiralty their ministry of marine or whatever they call it lewrie asked i didnt think just bargin in on my own would be a good idea in the spirit of our newfound peace though ah yayss hmm paisleytempleton drawled head cocked to one side in sudden thought then brightened considerably peace thats the thing is it not captain lewrie hmm you will take coffee or tea sir and will pray excuse me for a few moments whilst i consult with my superiors that few moments turned into two cups of very good coffee one trip down the hall to the necessary to pump his bilges and a third cup before paisleytempleton returned consider this captain lewrie sir anthony said with genuine enthusiasm hands rising to frame a stage like a proscenium arch a levee in the tuileries palace music champagne french chittering and flirting the first consul general napoleon bonaparte is there with his cabinet his coterie you are presented to him and perhaps to his wife josephine by my superior or one of his representatives hmm like yerself dye mean lewrie sarcastically thought even as he kept his phyz sobre and nodded sagaciously gain up in the world like a montgolfier balloon do ye hope bonaparte forewarned through his foreign minister msieur talleyrand sir anthony speculated on will be prepared to accept the delivery of your captured swords with enough forewarning perhaps he will be able to find your sword then sir then with hundreds of people looking on you and he will make a formal exchange sir anthony fantasised your how many five good ho five your five swords presented to him then after some kind and sincere words shared some smiles twixt warriors he will return to you your old sword or one suitable enough to the occasion in value and style to satisfy you sir anthony tossed off as if it was no matter gad what a place of honour thatll have in your house captain lewrie yours or a proper replacement from the hand of bonaparte why one could dine out on that for years ha ha hold on a bit sir lewrie said with a gawp im tmeet the corsican tyrant gladhand the bastard sir anthony paisleytempleton visibly shuddered and pouted now captain lewrie in the interests of continental peace and goodwill surely you could find more charitable expressions he chid lewrie now hes first consul perhaps for life it is lately rumoured and so involved with a sweeping reform of frances legal system its roads canals harbours and civic improvements standardising its currency and all could you not perhaps give bonaparte the benefit of the doubt think of him as a great newcome man dont know seems a bit theatrical tme lewrie dubiously replied shifting uncomfortably in his chair but long as i get my old sword back i spose i could play along thats the spirit captain lewrie sir anthony cheered now you must give me all the particulars about your old sword shouldve brought my dress uniform dye think sir lewrie asked good heavens no sir paisleytempleton gasped about ready to shudder again general bonaparte usually dons red velvet suitings for formal levees most unmilitary the sight of an officer from a branch of his recent opponents in uniform might be insulting my superior believes something new stylish uhm might i give you the name of my tailor here in paris sir sir anthony enquired with an equally dubious expression as he looked lewries suit up and down make my wife happy lewrie mused aloud a reason to purchase court clothing hey you and your wife together sir that would be even more pacific paisleytempleton gushed dare she take wine with josephine well perhaps that might be a bit of a stretch but as to what the old sword looks like then captain lewrie it was a hanger patterned on a french infantry sabrebriquet royal blue scabbard and sharkskin grip the grip bound in silver wire with silver throat drag and an hour later and lewrie was at a tailors not the one recommended by paisleytempleton but the one that jeanjoseph had named it didnt begin well for the elderly tailor had very little english lewrie was nighincomprehensible in french and his manservant jules was not as bilingual as hed been touted to be before negotiations broke completely down another customer and one of the tailors journeyman assistants emerged from a changeroom at the back of the shop and rescue was at hand of a sort stap me i declare if it is not captain lewrie to the life haw haw the fellow brayed in an oxonian accent and an inane titter sir poult pulteney lewrie responded groping for the fellows last name and only coming up with thinggummy yer servant sir and i thankee for your kindly assistance board the packet pulteney plumb and your servant captain lewrie the foppish man said back making a flourished showy leg i trust your lovely wife recovered from the mal de mere sir ha completely sir pulteney thankee for asking lewrie replied those sweet ginger pastilles did the trick should i ever command a crew of pressed hands again a case or two of em in the surgeons apothecaries might prove useful hey might admiralty reimburse you for them though haw haw sir pulteney gaily countered a parsimonious lot officialdom indeed lewrie agreed with a wry roll of his eyes you seek new suitings captain lewrie sir pulteney asked as he came closer to look lewries current suit up and down then you have come to one of the finest establishments in paris one which it was my utter delight to patronise in the years before the revolution you see sir pulteney spun himself slowly round most theatrically modelling the new suit he was having fitted and indeed it was a marvel to behold of subtle grey and black striped watered silk over a burgundy satin waistcoat light on his feet aint he lewrie thought as sir pulteney preened sir pulteney plumb was perhaps an inch taller than lewries five feet nine still of a trim active build for a man in his late fourties or so lewrie judged him broad in the chest and shoulders without appearing too common or beef to the heel cut to the tee haw haw sir pulteney crowed old jacques mon vieux you have done it again fйlicitations he congratulated the master tailor kissing his fingers in his direction then in fluent french urging the fellow to emigrate to london where he could make an even greater new fortune at least that was the gist lewrie got from it old jacques ate it up like plum duff something for our newfound friend here jacques i dare say youd look particularly dashing in something maroon or burgundy less youd prefer something more everyday what perhaps you and your lady wife envision some formal occasion whilst in paris in which case dashing would be required msieur sir pulteney ees ze trиs йlйgante hein the master tailor simpered to lewrie christ aint he just lewrie silently agreed an occasion aye sir pulteney lewrie informed him telling him of those swords he wished to exchange in short one thing led to another and were down for some theatrical flummery at a levee at the tuileries palace with bonaparte he said with a wry shrug presented to the first consul of france begad sir what an honour odds blood haw haw sir pulteney brayed tossing his head back and to one side to emit another of his donkeybray laughs now we simply must array you in the very finest there was a palaver twixt sir pulteney and the master tailor to explain how fine a suit would be necessary jacques cautions that you must not outshine the first consul in splendour captain lewrie sir pulteney plumb said with a cautionary wag of a long aristocratic finger and that bonaparte is fond of his generals uniform or red velvet with white silk stockings and a pair of red moroccan slippers fellow caught the turkish and mameluke fashion pox somethin horrid during his egyptian campaign even fetched back a muslim manservant haw haw or sometimes he will don the plainest uniform of a colonel of chasseurs yayss sir pulteney softily speculated as he paced a quick orbit round lewrie you would be splendid but not too splendid in something dark red vite vite jacques maroons and burgundies is he a clotworthy chute a jeanjoseph a captain sharp he had to ask himself as assistants came with tapes to take his measure and his dimensions were carefully noted in a ledger should lewrie be a return customer hang the cost begad from sir pulteney lud a once in a lifetime occasion haw haw fabrics were fetched stroked draped over his shoulders to display how a fine broadcloth wool would mould to him how watered silks or embroidered and figured satins might complement the basic colour motif not knowing just how hed been cossetted into it lewrie ended with all the makings for three suits hang the cost indeed there would be a darkred doubledbreasted tailcoat with a wide collar and lapels snug matching trousers and an electric blue waistcoat in moirй silk beneath there would be a grey singlebreast coat with a standandfall collar trimmed in electric blue satin that could be paired to the first waistcoat or a second one in maroon satin there would be a third a black singlebreasted coat matched with a creamcoloured embroidered waistcoat which could be mated with those grey trousers or any old pair of black or buff breeches not to mention the hats new silk hosiery elaborately laced silk shirts sir pulteney thought essential the gloves or lace jabots the newfangled croatian cravats and various coloured neckstocks without which a proper gentleman would be deemed halfdressed or only half finished ill need a new leather portmanteau tpack away all this bumf lewrie told himself wondering how much thatd cost him on top of all this appointments were made for further fittings before the delivery of the finished togs sir pulteney plumb slightly made up for the pained look on alan lewries face as he goggled over the reckoning offering to treat him to a late midday meal and extending an invitation for lewrie and his wife to sup with them that evening his treat then take in a performance at the comйdie franзaise where sir pulteney grandly informed him his ladywife imogeneknew it was somethin starts with i lewrie told himself had once trod the boards as a noted actress of some renown french o course begad sir pulteney brayed tittering over the fact dash it imagine an english gel on a parisian stage haw haw haw a comedy lewrie thought thatll give the fop genuine call for that godawful laugh o his chapter twenty caroline lewrie was waiting rather impatiently in their rented suite of rooms for her husband to arrive pacing frowning rehearsing the wrath she would launch as soon as the faithless hound stepped into the parlour her purchases those that could be carried away the same day she had left scattered on settees chairs and table topspelts of her kills the expensive items that did not even come near to mollifying the rebirth of her anger after meeting phoebe aretino his old mistress and seeing her in the flesh and to be so pretty and petite and younglooking to boot well im home dear lewrie gaily called out whipping his old hat at a row of pegs by the armoire infuriatingly scoring a direct hit and hanging it up on the first try have fun shopping caroline well there may be need for a lot more of it dye see i met an old friend of yours today husband she fumed did ye now i say that looks expensive all that stuff lewrie blathered on weve some formal todos in our future how would ye like tmeet napoleon bonaparte himself the famous josephine too mostlike and were invited to supper and the comйdie franзaise tonight recall sir pulteney plumb and his lady imogene from the packet with the ginger pastilles ran into him at a tailors lewrie said grinning as he went to her prepared to dance her round the room with his news i said i what said caroline flummoxed napoleon bonaparte when dont know yet but our embassyll be sendin round an invitation to a levee at the tuileries palace in a few days lewrie cheerfully explained those swords o mine stead of an informal handover at their ministry of marine its got turned into a rareeshow ye should see the bill from the tailors tget me suited proper for it whats the current rate of exchange francs to pounds i wonder you just just barge in here full of yourself and spring this upon me like a jackinthebox caroline blurted her fury now redirected on a fresh cause you expect me to be presentable at the theatre at the drop of your hat should i have sent you a note first lewrie asked confused the theatre tonight caroline continued to rant pacing the salon in one of my old rags why sir pulteney plumb and lady imogene i vaguely recall oh that lofty couple they were as i recall extremely welldressed in the height of fashion lord i might be mistaken for their maidservant in comparison are they anyone well over dinner sir pulteney alluded tbein on intimate grounds with the prince of wales lewrie told her and he seemed tbe swimmin in gold guineas tween his purchases at the tailors and him sportin all for dinner supper and the theatres his treat tonight too if theyre a pair o sharps then theyre both out a pretty penny and if they think ttrick us out of chink then theyre barkin up the wrong tree he seems genuine annoyinly odd but genuine should i write him a note and ask for a couple nights delay lewrie offered sure that something else had set her off and he ran betterthangood odds that he was in the quag right to his eyeballs over something you will not caroline snapped after a long moment to mull it over if the plumbs are as well connected and as wealthy and aristocratic as you say they appear to turn them down would be unseemly people on close terms with the prince of wales perhaps even with the king himself so are pretty whores and eudoxia durschenko by now lewrie had to imagine though he dared not say that aloud the winter before in london the prince of walesprinny to his friends and florizel to himself god alone knew whyhad taken a keen interest in eudoxia and despite her evillooking fathers arguseyed watchfulness over her virginity the mort did sport a few more baubles than before im in the same boat caroline lewrie told her boat see that was met with another roll of her eyes id be wearin me own best and my newuns wont be finished for days so he went on well theres new stocks and such hats and gloves but i suppose i could throw a suitable ensemble together at short notice caroline allowed at last with an exasperated wifely sigh the comйdie franзaise gawd it will all be in french she wailed turning to sort through her new purchases to see if there was anything that would avail instanter to liven the best of her supper gowns met an old friend o mine in paris lewrie tried to puzzle out as he began to change clothes he couldnt imagine who that would be but he had the uncomfortable feeling that hed just dodged a broadside and that his wife despite this new distraction was still swabbing out reloading and just waiting til the range was shorter to fire off another meanwhile in the former offices of the committee for general security just outside the eastern wall of the tuileries along the quai galerie du louvre mlle charitй de guilleri was paying a call upon the head of the national police joseph fouchй it was not one that could be called a social visit nor was it one done casually for fouchй was a very clever coldblooded man he had to be to have survived from the earliest days of the revolution one of the last of the old stagers so steeped in the blood of discovered or denounced aristos royalists and reactionaries hed created bloodbaths at nevers and lyon had threaded a wary way through the denunciations and deaths of marat danton robespierre saintjust and the other jacobins and had prospered mademoiselle de guilleri ma chйrie fouchй gravelled as she was at last let into his offices he stayed seated though intent on the papers on his desk scanning fresh denunciations of suspected plotters who still hoped to supplant the first consul undo the revolution and return royal rule to france joseph fouchй was an illfeatured man rather short and stocky some might say rotund due to his barrel chest he cared little for fashion or the proper fit of his clothes and still wore his shirt collars open with a loose stock tied more like a sailors kerchief he was also completely bald and shaved what little stubble or fluff remained what can i do for you citoyenne fouchй asked reverting to the form of address created more than a decade before at the start of the revolution unlike some newly risen arrivistes fouchй was a dedicated common man of the republic the british captain i thought i shot do you recall citoyen charitй baldly began knowing that coquetry and idle niceties before business were wasted on fouchй and would irritate him further than she dared she took a deep breath waiting ouais fouchй said with a leery grunt intent again upon his paperwork hed always been unimpressed and dubious of the little selfmade heroines tale thinking charitй a foolish dabbler too full of herself and too ready to push herself and her cause forward i was mistaken charitй meekly declared the airrifle my shot was perhaps too weak to kill him as i dearly wished i met i met his wife today citoyen here in paris and she spoke as if he is still alive this very moment he spied on us once in new orleans who is to say he is not here to spy on us again you see you suspect he is here in paris to spy on us citoyenne the policeman responded setting aside a document and folding meaty hands atop his desk he seemed amused and a touch irritated by charitйs assertion would it not make more sense for this fellow what is his name alain lewrie citoyen fouchй charitй said unnerved by the mans chary tone and expression an anglais naval captain fouchй made a pencilled note on a fresh sheet of paper then looked up again with a scowl on his face would it not make sense he this alain lew however you say it spies in our seaports our navy yards than paris citoyenne perhaps you misheard what the anglaise said youve seen him yourself non citoyen i have not seen him myself charitй rejoined bristling a little to be patronised or dismissed but i speak very good anglais from dealings with the barbarous amйricains in new orleans and i know perfectly what madame lewrie said in anger you see surprised by confrontation with another woman whom she suspects was once her husbands mistress nestce pas charitй de guilleri explained the circumstances in la contessa phoebe aretinos parfumerie how icy and angry madame lewrie had become upon her introduction and how flustered mlle aretino had become in turn at the mention of alan lewries name i quote citoyen i will extend your regards to my husband but do not expect them to be returned charitй told him lewrie is alive citoyen fouchй and most likely travelling with his wife here in paris i thought the presence of an anglais officer who put aside his uniform to spy on us in louisiana should be brought to your attention lest he do so again against us these other people rescued by this leew whatever fouchй asked scowling more deeply do you remember their names madame lewrie alluded to many royalistes escaping toulon on her husbands ship she said citoyen though the only one she gave name to was a vicomtesse maubeuge her former ward i believe madame lewrie said charitй easily recalled citoyenne phoebe aretino hmm fouchй said with a grunt of displeasure corsican oui of noble birth non a common putain in toulon as i recall there is a dossier fouchй said with an idle wave of one hand an avid supporter of the revolution in toulon had no reason to flee service the invaders officers for they were the only ones with money at the time but did citoyenne aretino deny any of the accusations no citoyen charitй told him shifting uncomfortably on her hard chair shed come to warn the authorities and to get vengeance on the bastard whod slaughtered her kin and ruined her plans for revolt but charitй hadnt planned on sending anyone else to prisonor the guillotine she seemed very upset by the confrontation but after she i asked her not in so many words nestce pas mada citoyenne aretino seemed wistful la tristesse a woman can see the look of a former lover who is still fond womanly intuition fouchй sarcastically said with a sneer in this instance oui citoyen i am sure she was once lewries mistress or lover charitй could firmly state but so many years ago surely you have given me some things to look into citoyenne fouchй told her making more pencilled notes i failed the revolution citoyen fouchй charitй declared with a clever bit of frankness and a becoming sniff into a handkerchief drawn from her left dress sleeve i truly did believe that i killed him with my shot i am ashamed to confess my failure one that puts you to extra work fouchй tilted his shiny head to one side and peered at her for a long moment unsure whether to laugh out loud at her pretensions as a patriot and her theatricality i will look into this lewrie persons presence in paris citoyenne he said at last i thank you for your honesty and your alacrity in bringing this matter before me perhaps it is nothing yet for the safety of the republic and the first consul enquiries must be made is that all citoyenne de guilleri it is citoyen fouchй merci et au revoir charitй said with a sense of relief as she rose from her chair and escaped from the foul spiders immediate grasp though not his web for it spanned all of france in the heady early days the french newspapers that reached new orleans had limned fouchй in her pantheon of heroes with men such as marat danton robespierre saintjust and the other brilliant lions of the jacobins people she wished to emulate it was only once she got to paris and met some of those rare surviving revolutionaries that charitй had had the scales torn from her eyes joseph fouchй was an icehearted executioner plain and simple and no coquetry no beauty or grace no flattery could make an impression upon him she would love it if fouchй found cause to arrest lewrie as a spy to hunt him down fetch him into court in chains and put his head on the block ready to be shorn and tumbled into the basket at last yet charitй already rued her coming to fouchй if mlle phoebe aretino was swept up as a reactionary a secret royaliste traitor to the revolution perhaps even now in league with her former lover the anglais spy charitй intellectually knew of the excesses of the reign of terror of the slaughter in the surf with shot bayonet and sword as those refugees who had not found a ship tried to flee toulon three thousand men women and children in the space of two hours the rumour related and twice that number perished under gen dugommiers guillotines over the next month after the city was retaken but she had not been in paris during those times hadnt seen heard or smelled the holocaust which was now mostly a bad memory to the french uneasily shrugged off as a temporary necessity but for men like fouchй it would never be over so long as displaced aristos overseas beyond his grasp schemed and plotted to overthrow the revolution and its new leaders and there were those to aid them in france mon dieu i have denounced an innocent charitй whispered to herself as she reached the clean air along the banks of the seine recalling how lovely and petite how vivacious and charming mlle aretino was had been whenever shed visited her shop would her glorious hair be shorn at the nape would she die under the guillotine for nothing fouchй rang a small bell on his desk to summon a clerk there must be enquiries made about this lewrie even so laisserpassers were now required of all foreign visitors and this lewrie must have one issued by the foreign ministry registered at the city gates and noted by the municipal authorities at the hфtel de ville and every concierge at every hotel or lodging house no matter how grand or how mean might as well be in fouchйs employ and this would make locating the man and his wife very easy fouchй would send for information from the ministry of marine as well which kept dossiers on enemy captains and admirals to see if they considered this lewrie dangerous beyond the scope of naval combat he paused in his written demands wondering if citoyen pouzin at the foreign ministry a spymaster and aristo hunter well known to him might have some information he had been in the mediterranean in the s when the de guilleri chit said that this lewrie had been all these enquiries i wish answered by this time tomorrow fouchй demanded with an even fiercer scowl see to it vite vite oddly enough at about that same time of late afternoon citoyen philippe pouzin though no one was ever sure if that was the name he had been given at birth was sharing a bottle of brandy with an old compatriot from his time in the mediterranean though with a certain wellhidden sense of distaste pouzins mission to subvert the genoese savoyards and piedmontese in order to aid gen bonapartes first italian campaign had been a smashing success destroying their will to fight for the british and buying their zeal to ally themselves with france he and his underling spies male and female had even penetrated the elusive and ultrasecret last romans movement which aspired to unite all italy once more and turn it into a world power which would retake everything that had once been under the old empire in the balkans and greece in the holy land egypt and north africa not only penetrated the movement but turned it to frances advantage for that pouzin had been rewarded promoted and allowed to be among the living as the various feuding factions of the directory slit each others throats and sent each other to the guillotine hed been overseas like napoleon safe from the treacherous games now he held an elevated position in the spy organisation under the aegis of the foreign ministry and had thickened on a rich safe salary his unfortunate compatriot however had not been so successful and had if appearances were reliable judges fallen even further than anyone but the unfortunate job could dread the west indies saint domingue and guadeloupe were not my areas of concern capitaine choundas said pouzin in apology for not being cognisant of choundass troubles the undermining of the kingdom of naples and the two sicilies the retention of malta and the adriatic took all my attention at the time of the quasiwar with the amйricains you have my condolences for your ah lack of success at least in the med guillaume choundas had still seemed vital an active and hearty fellow despite his crippled leg with its rigid iron brace the stiff black mask which covered his maimed face and dead eye hed had two arms the last time pouzin had seen him as well now choundas was a greyhaired creased and stooping ruin easily mistaken in his shabby remnants of naval uniform for a street beggar as pruned and wrinkled and aged as a poor fishermans grandpиre you say this lewrie the author of all your misfortunes is here in paris eh choundas pouzin asked between sips of an excellent brandy i saw him pouzin choundas insisted in a harsh rasp sure as i know you did i see you on the street he lodges in the rue honorй he and his wife recall citoyen it was a closerun thing that i got the pay chests intended for the austrians to your agents in genoa a hairs breadth ahead of lewries pursuit and would have made my escape to report to you but for him and what he did to our cause in the west indies all our vessels lost our cargoes captured by the cursed ungrateful amйricains led to them by that salaud and my defeat and capture we both know this peace is only a brief pause the first consul grows impatient and angry that the faithless anglais delay the return of our former colonies stall their evacuation of the island of malta which is in your area of expertise nestce pas trust me citoyen pouzin choundas gravelled his remaining hand clawed about his glass and his one good eye glaring when war comes that salaud lewrie will be at our throats once more i gathered though capitaine choundas pouzin replied that when we worked together in the mediterranean you were dismissive of his cleverness that you put his interferences in your enterprises down to blind dumb luck frankly pouzin had always been leery of choundass excuses for his setbacks and losses for they were based more on ancient celtic breton superstition than anything else the man saw signs portents and omens in the flights of birds like an ignorant peasant despite his vaunted level of education imparted by cynical and worldly jesuit tutors of all people pouzin also knew that once choundas was aware that this lewrie was in the vicinity hed allowed his wits to be focussed more on the mans destruction than upon the job at hand pouzin could plainly see why choundas might wish revenge having been so ravaged and made to match his old nickname of le hideuxthe hideousby anyone much less his bкte noire his imagined nemesis lewrie you have spoken to people at the ministry of marine mon cher capitaine pouzin asked him feeling sympathetic enough to top up the poor ogres glass bah those indolent and smug bourgeois newcomes they arrive at nine do no work til ten then depart for dйjeuner at twelve not to return til three and go see their wives and mistresses at five the bearskin slippered choundas almost howled with rage choking on his beverage and his bile they have no time for the likes of me these days pouzin mon vieux i upset their digestion choundass hideousness was certainly upsetting pouzins senses and the time he allowed the old fellow wasnt he younger than me he thought was cutting into his supper and time with his mistress so long as he is here on innocent sightseeing mon chere he is of no concern to my ministry pouzin had to tell him if only to hasten his departure even though he and that foul anglais spymaster zachariah twigg who fooled you when he playacted the part of silberberg a juif banker from london have been joined at the hip for decades the old cripple accused though i lacked proper support from wellplaced spies in the west indies we did know that two of twiggs underlings were active and that both of them at one time or other took passage with lewrie one to saint domingue to deal with that rebel general toussaint louverture lewrie and the anglais secret service pouzin their lackey not clever not all that intelligent but he does their bidding extremely well i will look into it then mon cher capitaine pouzin allowed as an ormolu clock on the mantel over his large marble fireplace began to chime the hour his mistress would be distressed by his lateness after all what are old comrades for if not to help each other safeguard the republic heu i will look into it if there is something to his presence in france well perhaps we can find some way to repay you for your bringing this to our attention nestce pas an increase in your naval pension and a financial reward hmm guillaume choundas tossed back the last of his brandy his ugly face split with a rough approximation of a pleased grin which hideous attempt made pouzin shudder chapter twentyone what an odd but charming couple caroline determined as they readied for bed she yawned a couple of times for such late hours in the almostmidnights was foreign to her rural life of early rising and early retiring they had supped divinely well with lashings of wine beyond her usual partaking at one of the most elegant restaurants in paris packed to the rafters with the most fashionable and lively of pariss elite and had been regaled by sir pulteneys and lady imogenes quick wit and repartee silly though half of it had been afterwards there had been the theatre and a grand comedymoliиre of course an immortal of french theatrewhich the lady imogene who indeed had once been a star on that very stage a decade before still knew by heart she had translated the cleverest funniest parts for them in gay whispers in their box closely overlooking the stage lewrie was yawning too though hed managed a few short naps at the comedie franзaise despite lady imogenes excited whispers and sir pulteneys cackles guffaws and donkey brays sir pulteney also had the annoying habit of making idle comments on just about everything and everyone disparaging a badly tied neckstock on one gentleman in the box opposite theirs or the colour of some fetching young womans gown the tackiness of too much jewelrycheap paste mostlike begad that what was she thinking charming aye annoying as well still the plumbs had paid for everything so what was one to do so fortunate that sir pulteney married her away from france before the revolution and the terror caroline said as she brushed out her hair and she is lovely in a way or was once meow lewrie thought grinning lady imogene plumb was petite and wiry with large elfin green eyes and a wealth of shining ravenblack hair though her face was that of a slightly overthehill pixie she uses paints the actress in her id spose he said to show caroline that he agreed with her and had not found her pretty yes she does caroline agreed even so though lord that gown of hers sir pulteney must be hellishrich indeed id not wish to ascribe lady imogenes motives for marrying such a daft fellow like sir pulteney caroline cattily said pausing her brushing looking pensively into the mirror as if drawing a comparison but a chance to flee france and all the bloodshed and to a man with so much money seeming money rather silly as a goose lewrie agreed again he does laugh rather a lot doesnt he caroline said chuckling beginning to underbrush i must admit though they seem to be besotted with each other still did you not notice alan usin my first name hey lewrie exulted that sounds promisin cant say that i did my dear he said tossing his shirt at one of his old seachests and donning a dressing robe but it takes all kinds dont it i suspect a great mutual passion caroline said done with her hair and swivelling about on her stool to face him it sounded wistful im up for passion lewrie told himself feeling frisky should i break out the dental powder or settle for a swillout with brandy did you think her fetching alan caroline teased it seemed like romantic teasing at any rate lewrie hoped well i was too busy tendin to you on the packet caroline he replied with a noncommittal shrug only really met her tonight aye i spose shes handsome in her own way lady imogene and i will go shopping tomorrow she said as she put her toiletry items aside in a rollup housewife then stood to go to the far side of the inviting bed nearest the last candle you will have another day to yourself if we are to be presented to that ogre napoleon bonaparte i will need something truly grand to wear and she has promised to advise me we cannot let the french form a low opinion of how british people dress oh she has such an exquisite sense of style and taste as does sir pulteney well i spose i could find something tdo with myself he allowed sweeping back the covers on his side of the bed so long as you dont go in search of scents caroline said much more coolly scents hey most especially at a shop called la contessas in the place victor caroline said on her expression and tone hardening the furrow twixt her brows appearing a shop run by a corsican baggage by name of phoebe aretino uhm er who honest tgod caroline how was i to know she was in paris lewrie flummoxed mean tsay rather shit there it is lewrie quailed fourtytwopound coast guns and it did not give you pause that lady imogene and your whore resemble each other remarkably closely my dear here she snapped handing him the candle from the nightstand it trust you find the settee in the parlour a pleasant bed for the night chapter twentytwo by midmorning two days later whilst the unsuspecting lewries were coaching along another bucolic stretch of the seine an increasingly concerned joseph fouchй was receiving a summary report on what his agents had been able to glean about this troubling anglais visitor the ministry of marine notes that this gars was instrumental in destroying a secret alliance with native pirates in the far east back in the bad old days of the ancien rйgime matthieu fourchette one of fouchйs cleverest and most persistent agents related to his chief a dumb idea anyway that wouldnt have lasted a year once war broke out again and the biftecs put enough warships out there to escort a china convoy fourchette told him with a sneer only a lieutenant but the anglais force was directed by secret agents from their foreign office just a lackey at the time id suspect matthieu fourchette was one of the few people in france who did not cringe at the mention of fouchйs name or shudder in fear when in his presence or carefully guard every utterance fourchette was too insouciant too casual and carefree to fear the man he served so well and it was against his wry and sarcastic cynical nature fourchette did not sit upright but slouched with his legs sprawled in the chair in front of fouchйs desk making free with a spanish cigarro and knocking ash to the marble floor now theres this retired capitaine guillaume choundass notes but hes dйbile on the subject of this lewrie mec fourchette breezed on and thinks the anglais is a demon from hell sent specifically by the devil to torment him i can see why he thinks so since this alain luray lewrie was the one who sliced him up like a veal sausage and crippled him odd though how often choundas was put in charge of something that smacked of spywork combined with combat and lewrie just happened to turn up like a bad penny as the anglais say hmm anything recent fouchй pressed were getting there citoyen fourchette said with a grin in the mediterranean he put a hitch in pouzins plans again with connexions to the same anglais spymaster that ran things in the far east poor old choundas lost his arm to lewrie that time poor old salaud this fellow just keeps whittling choundas down to a nub its good our navy retired him hawn hawn anyway this lewrie did rather well in the west indies taking prizes keeping the nйgres slaves on saint domingue so their uprising did not spread to jamaica fourchette went on i spoke to that citoyenne charitй de guilleri as you ordered mon dieu citoyen what a fine young thing and thank you for the assignment id love to dip my biscuit in that the fellow did dress in civilian clothes and go up the mississippi to new orleans as a spy though there was no provable direction by anglais spy agencies but it is hard to believe that he did it on his own nestce pas then when we and the amйricains had our little disagreement choundas was out there on guadeloupe and again lewrie was instrumental in his last downfall crippled the fellows frigate in his own harbour and rolled up many of his privateers and smuggler vessels before the amйricains captured him and his last convoy perhaps this choundas is not so demented after all fouchй rumbled after that then strictly straightforward fourchette said with a shrug brushing his loose shock of dark hair back from his broad forehead and his oddly pale green eyes that sometimes in the right light looked yellow he was lean and foxfaced not much above middle height but despite his insouciance there was an air about him that made others tread as wary about fourchette as most did about fouchй a time in the south atlantic escorting china convoys a fight with one of our frigates which he won uhm theres a note from the gironde that he was responsible for the reduction of two forts in the bay of the river a bombardment of troops dug in on the cфte sauvage that resulted in heavy casualties and one of our naval officers who was spying on the anglais blockade ships pretending to be a poor fisherman whod trade with them sent a letter to the ministry of marine to say that the man is a clever liar which does not agree with pouzins or choundass opinions citoyen fourchette pointed out they think this lewrie just lucky or welltutored un type de poorly educated anglais officer one who will do anything to avoid being called too clever by half nestce pas which public face can disguise a wealth of cleverness fouchй snapped ill at ease with what hed heard so far this lewrie did run into legal troubles last year fourchette told him he stole a dozen nиgres slaves from an anglais planter hed duelled with from the family that is to crew his ship then was tried in absentia and sentenced to be hung but the abolitionists in england got him off perhaps he is lucky as well fouchй commented two medals participated in the battles off ushant at cape saint vincent and camperdown and lately at copenhagen fourchette tossed away got sent into the baltic alone to scout the danish swedish and russian fleets before the battle the new anglais head of their ministry of marine is said to have appointed him to the duty directly it is also rumoured that he carried two russian nobles home men who are further rumoured so the foreign ministry dossiers say to here participated in the assassination of the late tsar what assassination you say fouchй perked up going into an instant rage how sure are those dossiers fourchette oh citoyen fourchette disparaged flicking more ash on the floor speculative at best the foreign ministry people whom i talked to about it dont believe the anglais could ever undertake anything that simple and direct the russky aristos most likely wangled a rapid way home promising a diplomatic solution so they could be in at the kill and prosper on their own thats how talleyrand and the rest of the ministry interpret it talleyrand and his grands lйgumes are a pack of simple fools fourchette fouchй barked rising to pace with his hands in the small of his back head down and unconsciously imitating his idol the new first consul napoleon bonaparte limpwristed overeducated closeted aristos and arrivistes they would not recognise a rampaging bear in their dining room theyd call it a hungry foreign visitor with no fine manners such as theirs you have placed this salaud under observation fourchette since the first moment i spoke with you citoyen fourchette assured him a rotating crew of watchers so he will not take alarm even should he be here to spy on us and has been instructed in tradecraft the concierge at his lodgings reports he and his wife mostly spend their time here in touring cathedrals palaces and such with shopping and dining the comйdie franзaise a few nights ago accompanied by another anglais couple uhm fourchette had to refer to his notes for a momentneither of them are fluent in french and he is the biggest offender both need the aid of bilingual servants and guides for even the simplest exchanges hardly what one would expect of a man sent to spy on us fourchette said with a shrug and a sniff of derision no it is not is it fouchй said raising his head and ceasing his frenzied pacing calming as quickly as hed raged what are they doing today coaching along the seine citoyen fourchette told him taking the air under observation by at least six watchers well then perhaps fouchй allowed sitting back down behind his desk and running his heavy hands over his bald pate our terrified capitaine choundas our deluded citoyenne de guilleri both have good cause to seek revenge on this anglais and imagine him an agent of the devil in so doing they magnify this lewries cleverness and guile to get me to do their dirty work hein pardon citoyen one of fouchйs clerks a fellow much warier of his employer than fourchette would ever be tremulously rapped on the halfopen door you are busy citoyen a letter has come from minister talleyrand at the foreign ministry oui bring it fouchй snapped waving the man in impatiently and snatching the folded and sealed letter winking at fourchette as he did so more foolishness from that oily lame bishop the lecher mon dieu fouchй exploded a moment later zut alors putain mort de ma vie the fucking fools get out get out get out he barked at the little clerk and threw the letter at fourchette startling the wiry younger man to his feet at the next levee two days hence the first consul will greet the very man we discuss fourchette theyve come up with a piece of diplomatic theatre in the name of peace bah the anglais this espиce de merde this fumier lewrie will present to bonaparte some swords hed taken from defeated french captains asking for one of his taken by napoleon from him years ago so everyone can applaud and fawn and simper about what good friends we and the sanglants now are within the reach of a dagger to bonaparte within a pointblank shot of a hidden pistol are they mad fourchette exclaimed non fourchette deluded by their own foolishness fouchй accused eyes darting about the room for something he could smash and not regret later suddenly it all makes sense that this man is a spy an assassin sent to destroy our head of government and start the overthrow of the republic if the salaud did have a hand in the assassination of the tsar last year the faithless perfidious british have sent him to do this uhm citoyen how might he plan to escape once the deed is done fourchette pointed out after a brief quiet moment and would a man even a mad anglais endanger his wife as well if she is here in paris will she not be presented with him i do not see how anyone could be ordered to face certain death for both himself and his woman and for england to envision such an act hein surely they know it would mean immediate war which they might be planning on fouchй hotly rasped their army and navy might even now be mobilised just waiting for news of the success of their murder have we seen any sign of that citoyen the more practical spy suggested fourchette suspected that fouchй saw plots where hed put plots were he in their enemies shoes and had spent so many years at sniffing out opposition where there really was no opposition that he had become as fixated as that dйbile old sailor choundas despite what fourchette publicly espoused about the revolution and the republic he was too pragmatic a fellow to give heart and soul completely such sentimentsfor a fellow who held very few sentiments were the social oil necessary to keep his delightful career and gain him plum assignments which guaranteed his steady rise in the police nationale the committee of public safety the directory the triumvirate and now the first consul hell they could bring back a king an emperor and he could really care less fouchй though fourchette considered he owed his life to the continued good health and firm grip on power of his master napoleon bonaparte fouchй was his man for as long as it looked like bonaparte held sway after that perhaps he would jump ship and espouse another leader but for now fouchй would go to any lengths to protect the fellow too devotedly too slavishly fourchette thought him a cool head was needed here this gars lewrie wishes to present captured swords let us ask for them to be held by the ministry of marine til the levee he breezily advised his chief before the presentation call the fellow aside and check him for weapons what can he do after that leap and try to strangle the first consul hein in the meantime i will keep him under the strictest surveillance and look into anyone that lewrie speaks to for any connexion to reactionary elements nestce pas one to keep watch on will be his former lover the owner of a parfumerie in the place victor a woman well i should hope so fourchette japed though so many englishmen prefer boys this is no laughing matter fourchette fouchй cautioned him a citoyenne phoebe aretino she fled toulon aboard his ship as our army retook the city fled good republicans with aristos in fact assign one of your men to look into her no matter whether this fumier contacts her or not i will do so citoyen fouchй fourchette vowed and departed after stubbing his cigarro out on the fireplace surround and wondering if the woman had been lewries lover would she be entertaining enough and pretty enough to interview himself book iii their hearts battered by this din were torn in two and much afraid flightby land said one the sea is better said another gaius petronius the road to crotуn chapter twentythree napoleon bonaparte allconquering general and the first consul of france always rose at dawn when the brain was keenest after one cup of tea in his bedroom he spent an hour in the marble bath tub in water kept so hot that constant his valet who read the morning papers to him sometimes had to open a door and duck out into the hallway to escape the thick foggy steam at the levee this afternoon the first consul will receive an embassy from great britain represented by chargй daffaires sir anthony paisleytempleton escorting capitaine de vaisseau alan lewrie of his britannic majestys navy and his lady constant intoned a prissy primping pйdй bonaparte grumbled a shit in silk stockings they send me titled boyfuckers not a real ambassador and how long has it been since the peace was ratified even though my man andrйossy has been named to them for months this salauds old sword had been found it has first consul constant told him rustam has it well let me see the damned thing bonaparte snapped usually his steaming bath relaxed him immensely and eased his constant problem of needing to pee yet being unable for long impatient minutes but today it was one vexation after another rustam his mameluke servant brought back from his egyptian campaign stepped closer dressed in magnificent native garb holding out a scabbarded sword cleaned and polished general rustam assured a hangersword no grander than the sabrebriquet a grenadier of the guard might carry on his hip royal blue scabbard with sterling silver fittings its only decorative touches being a handguard shaped like a seashell silver wire wound round its blue sharkskin grip and a matching seashell catch on the throat to fit it into a baldric or a sword belt the pommel was the usual lions head also in silver and where the devil did i get it remind me constant napoleon demanded young general bonaparte had always awed his troops with a steeltrap memory for names ranks faces and past heroic deeds unknown to them was his preparation and prompting by officers on his staff to provide those names ranks and deeds toulon towards the end of our siege first consul constant read from notes made in napoleons own hand in the inventory of his personal armory the british officer was in command of a commandeered french twodecker lowered by one deck and converted to a mortar ship she was shelling fort le garde quite successfully until you gathered general la poypes heavy artillery and shelled her in return scoring a direct hit and blowing her up ah oui now i remember napoleon brightened up enjoying the memory the survivors swam ashore and we rode down to take them prisoner the officer lewrie general constant provided your note says that despite your offer of parole he preferred to surrender his sword and go with his men he looked like a drowned rat but he had hair on his ass bonaparte hooted with glee oui just after i took his sword those yellowjackets spanish cavalry approached from fort saintemarguerite and we had to scramble for our lives hawn hawn it was quite a day constant quite a day doesnt look all that valuable though to me not enough sterling silver to make a teapot really the blade is more valuable unsheathe it rustam aha made by gillss even better than sheffield or wilkinson or a germans kligenthal now i see why that anglais fumier wants it back when napoleon bonaparte shaved himself not using a servant to do it he secretly preferred pearlhandled razor sets smuggled in from birmingham england since french steel could not take so fine an edge put it where we remember it rustam bonaparte ordered any more interesting items constant indeed first consul shall i continue red velvet suit today general rustam asked non bonaparte decided if that preening fop talleyrand is desirous of a theatric with the anglais then i must dress for my part and i do not wish to portray the smiling peaceful dunce no one pulls my strings like a puppet the british lie stall and delay with such wonderful smiles they play the same game they did with the amйricains after they lost the revolution over there they keep hold of french spanish and dutch colonies the same way they kept new york and new england the settlements on the upper missouri and mississippi on the amйricain side of the great lakes do the british even say when they will evacuate malta for instance pah they do not today rustam napoleon bonaparte instructed wiping his face free of sweat with a fresh dry hand towel i will appear more martial as a sign of my displeasure lay out my colonel of chasseurs uniform though it was but a short distance from their lodgings in rue honorй to the main entrance to the tuileries palace a coachandfour was de rigueur laid on by the embassy and sir anthony paisleytempleton oh lovely suitings captain lewrie sir anthony gushed once theyd gotten aboard you used my tailor but of course you did and mistress lewrie enchanted your humble servant marm and allow me to tender my regrets that we have not til this instance met i beg your pardons but i must also express how lovely you look today as well congratulations my wont it be fine though as i said to captain lewrie for you to be presented to the first consul a day to remember the rest of your lives aha stop yer gob fore i do it for ye lewrie thought in no better takings than the first time hed been exposed to the simpering young twit christ but he will prattle on i am led to understand that a factotum from the first consuls staff came round to retrieve the swords you are to present to him all is in order captain lewrie paisleytempleton enquired aye all done lewrie told him shiftylookin cove you will be thrilled to learn that the first consuls office sent me a letter informing me that your old sword has been discovered in bonapartes trophy room sir anthony further enthused languidly and will be onhand to return to you once the pacific speeches about our new relations are done erm you would not mind looking over a few thoughts that might go down well were you to express them to the first consul during the time he gives you captain lewrie some actors lines tbe learned sir lewrie balked why is this the first ive heard of em just a phrase or two some hopes for a long continued peace paisleytempleton assured him producing a sheet of paper from his velvet and embroidered silk coat well hell lewrie said with a putupon sigh quickly looking them over damn my eyes sir do people real people ever talk in such stilted fashion well erm sir anthony daintily objected blushing a bit captain lewrie will phrase things his own way sir anthony caroline told the prim diplomat with luck he will be able to get the gist of what you wish said across wont you my dear she was too impressed by the grandness of the occasion to be angry with him today and sounded almost supportive as if shed tease the young fop too almost like a fond wife of longstanding content and here we are paisleytempleton said with overt relief as the coach rocked to a stop and a liveried palace lackey opened the kerbside door this seadog was being a bit too gruff this afternoon for paisleytemple tons liking you do look lovely caroline lewrie whispered to her as they debarked from the coach into a sea of onlookers and other attendees garbed in their own grandeur especially so that put a broader grin on her face and a twinkle in her eyes as she lifted her head to gaze over the incoming crowd lady imogene had done her proud with a choice of gown in the latest paris fashion with the puffy half sleeves lowcut bodice and highwaisted style of the moment carolines gown was a delicate light peach colour trimmed with a waist sash and hemmings of braided gilt and amber twine with an additional trim of white lace all carefully attuned to her complexion her sandy lightbrown hair and hazel eyes a gilt lamй stole hung on her shoulders draped over long white gloved arms and nigh to the bottom hem of the gown some of the late granny lewries gold and diamond jewelry adorned her ears and wrists while a gold and amber necklace encircled her neck her hair was done up in the convoluted grecian style with a braided gilt and amber circlet sporting egret plumes bound about her forehead and in the style of the times her gown was racily shimmery semiopaque which in the right light revealed almost all of a womans secrets in carolines case her gown hinted at a woman who despite three children and a hearty cook had kept her figure slim and nearly girlish she did frown for a second though to look down at her feet to see if her white silk knee stockings or gilt lamй slippers had gotten scuffed or stained satisfied that all was still well she looked back up and rewarded both sir anthony and lewrie with another pleased grin beard the lion in his den lewrie japed in a whisper to her the ogre in his cave caroline quipped right back the troll under the bridge lewrie added the dragon in his golden lair she said with a chuckle and leaned her head close to lewries for a moment those feathersll make me sneeze lewrie said pardon msieur permettezmoi sil vous plaоt a uniformed officer in the police nationale said to lewrie once they were in the large formal receiving hall un moment the young officer beckoned to draw him into an alcove away from the others what for lewrie asked sir anthony he looked for aid i do not know captain lewrie un problиme msieur damme he says no one presented to the first consul can do so without being searched for weapons captain lewrie this is outrageous but understandable lewrie said after thinking about it for a moment proceed sir produit msieur he told the officer as he held out his arms to cooperate muttering to himself in english and i hope yere not one tprefer the windward passage lewrie got a rather thorough patdown though it was obvious that the snug tailoring of his suit precluded hidden weapons even the inside of his lower sleeves the tops of his halfboots held nought lui aussi maintenant msieur lewrie asked in his halting french pointing to paisleytempleton him too now they will not dare sir anthony snapped this is an insult to his britannic majesty king george and all great britain a stiff note of displeasure will be on minister talleyrands desk before nightfall dare they manhandle me sir cest de rigueur comprenez messieurs the officer said with an apologetic shrug waving them both back towards the hall doors and the two men rejoined caroline at their place in line before those tall double doors as tall as a longboat stood on end they were surrounded by a rainbow of brightly coloured uniforms of the various branches of napoleons army some clanking with spurs on their boots and swords at their hips which raised lewries eyebrows over his recent search by those officers and ornately dressed civilian gentlemen stood an host of elegantly gowned women some of them young lovely and flirtatious as they waited for entrйe lovers and mistresses lewrie determined wives seemed more dowdy even though gaudied up something sinful in the same semitranslucent fabrics as the young and firmbodied and there were so many egret plumes in hats and hairdos that lewrie could conjure that every bird in europe was now barearsed a majordomo or master of ceremonies loudly announced each pair as they were allowed in crying above the soft strains of a string orchestra over in one corner of the vast baroque hall their turn came at last first sir anthony then capitaine de vaisseau а la marine de guerre britannique alain lui lewrie et madame caroline lewrie that turned quite a number of heads made officers grip their sword hilts or pause with their champagne glasses halfway to their lips forced women to goggle or comment behind their fans and flutter them in faint alarm as if a fox had been allowed into their chicken coop are we so infamous caroline had to ask in a soft mutter near his ear once more her cool and regal smile still plastered on her face were english we must be lewrie chuckled back how do all he said to the crowd in a soft voice nodding and smiling almost waving in their general direction as they paced down the centre of the reception hall now sir anthony where the devil do they keep the bloody champagne first consul napoleon bonaparte had completed his toilet after leaving his bath his usual routine followed to the letter he washed his hands with almond paste his face neck and ears with scented soap from la contessas in point of fact in the place victor picked his teeth with a boxwood stem brushed twice with paste then powdered coral stripped to the waist dressing robe tossed aside and standing in a flannel vest and underdrawers he had constant trickle eau de cologne over his head also from phoebe aretinos whilst he brushed his skin with stiff bristles and had constant do his back napoleon donned stockings white cashmere breeches and a silk shirt with a fine muslin cravat with a white cashmere waistcoat over that he spent his morning at work til eleven when he dined lightly then still in a foul mood he at last made his decision about what he would wear to the levee the scarlettrimmed dark green chasseur uniform was militant but not nearly enough bonaparte ordered his dress generals uniform the long blue tailcoat with the lavish gilt lace trim and scrolls of acanthus leaves topboots and a redwhiteblue tricolour sash about his waist over the doublebreasted uniform coat bon he decided looking in the cheval mirror lastly he stuck a scented handkerchief in a pocket and a small snuff box into another nodded to constant and headed down to attend the levee and put those damned anglais those lying sanglants in their place oh it was an elegant crowd attending the levee lewrie expected a scruffy jacobin mob of sans culottes in illfitting coats and red liberty caps perhaps leaving their scythes and pitchforks at the door a bunch of old peasant women knitting and rocking where they could get a good view of the next beheading but there were frosty foreign ministers from half of europe minus the prussians and austrians of course with their wives or temporary local courtesans there were all those aforementioned officers from the guard the chasseurs the line infantry lancers and light dragoons the heavy cavalry cuirassiers and allied officers from the dutch batavian republic and all of napoleons italian allies the conquered but cooperative instead of ragged commoners with unshaven chins and loose long hair the civilian male attendees were dressed so well they could give sir pulteney plumb a run for his money and a fair number of them had the graceful and languid airs that lewrie thought more commonly seen at a royal reception a gathering of aristocrats which all the world knew were so despised by staunch french republicans oned think they were all titled waitin for king louis the sixteenth tcome dancin in lewrie pointed out to sir anthony as the three of them made a slow counterclockwise circuit of the hall what happened tall that noble commoner nonsense most of the great voices of the revolution are now conveniently dead sir sir anthony simpered back napoleon has even gone so far as to allow the churches to reopen and the catholic church to restore its presence with power only over its priests and nuns not over the state and of course without its former wealth thats gone for muskets and cannon the joie de vivre of your common frenchman cannot be suppressed the draconian edicts of the jacobins against riches their dour insistence on equality and fraternity were too much a pieeyed idyllic dream dye see captain lewrie its against all human nature to believe that one could invent a classless society with all individual effort directed in support of the state besides drinking eating and living well having fine things and making money is every mans fondest wish sir anthony said with a wry chuckle as he touched his nose with a scented handkerchief next thing you know this bonaparte will make himself first consul for life and surround himself with a royal court titles will come back just you wait and see itll be msieur vicomte and madame baroness stead of citoyen and citoyenne you mark my words pity our own politicians like fox or priestley who admired the french revolution caroline said how disappointed they must be to see the french slip back to having aristocracy we should begin to introduce you and your good lady about their young diplomat announced the civilian sorts id expect the military types might be a tad too gruff with us sounds good lewrie began to say then froze in his tracks holy christ its all over again he thought goggling at two people he hadnt seen since a night ashore in genoa in one case and a night in bed at shore lodgings in leghorn in the other it was signore marcello di silvano that hefty and handsome italian millionaire once the most powerful senator in the genoese republic the man the old spymaster zachariah twigg had identitied as the prime leader of the last romans lewrie could not be mistaken the fellow was wearing the same glaring white figuredsatin suit with the royal purple trim the same heavy gold medallion and chain of office atop an aquamarine moirйsilk sash it appeared that silvano had picked up a few more baubles of honour to pin to his coat breast too most likely from napoleon on his arm though was the woman whod spied on lewrie and influenced him pretending to be a north italian lombard but really french from near the swiss border claudia mastandrea looking almost as young and fetching as evershe of the large round and firm breasts that shed pressed either side of lewries face of the wealth of sandy blond hair of large brown eyes nipples and areolae the size of maria theresa silver dollars the spy twigg had ordered him to bed to pass on disinformation and a good round lie or two blabbed in the drowsy afterglow of throbbing thrashing hairtossing view halloo sex signore silvano now duke of genoa under one of napoleons kin bestowed upon lewrie a curledlipped smile and a grave inclination of his head get to you later that smile seemed to promise from claudia mastandrea lewrie got one of those momentary gasps and a mostfetching upward heave of her impressive mammaries as she recognised him as well then came a sly seductive smile a tilt of her head a lowering of her chin and lashes maam lewrie managed to mutter as he nodded thank god but silvano was of no mind to wait for an introduction but strolled past tucking his longtime paramour a little closer to his elbow lewrie took a cautious look over his left shoulder after they had passed and claudia mastandrea winked at him someone else you know in paris my dear caroline asked ah hem met that fellow in genoa when i had jester he replied thinking himself quick on his feet for so saying a senator at the time til the french bought him off already owned half or more of the damned place a nasty article signore silvano oh now this is a good show paisleytempleton excitedly told them jutting his chin towards the space before the orchestra where a few younger couples had begun to dance not for them your everyday quadrille or contredanse such as we have at home theyre doing the gavotte a most intricate dance takes years of study and practise to perform properly i fancy myself as a dabhand at dancing yet it is so complicated the gavotte i despair of ever learning it you look the sort lewrie told himself uncharitably napoleon did you know refuses to dance unless they play the monaco sir anthony tossed off intent upon the dancers with glee in his expression his champagne glass hand gently marking the time and even essaying a sway and faint shuffle of his feet the monaco is simple as is the new dance that comes from vienna the waltz means walking i suppose or something near it one actually embraces ones partner with a discreet space between of course he said lifting his left hand in the air extending his right a couple holds hands here the lady places her hand on her partners shoulder and the gentleman places his hand on his partners waist one dances a box one step forward for the man one backwards for the lady one step to the right for both then back for the man forward for the lady and then left back to where one started before performing a halfturn to the right and beginning the box again swooping elegant romantic yet perhaps too racy for english society mores the pity it has been christmas since we danced caroline said quite taken with the dancers movements perhaps if they do play something familiar to us once were done with napoleon after ive had more champagne lewrie said hed once been a dabhand himself in the parlours at the subscription balls but it had been years and stumbling about canted decks on his sea legs was not conducive to elegance or fine style he was sure he would clump as if hed said open sesame a liveried waiter appeared with a tray bearing fresh glasses of champagne lewrie gallantly clinked glasses with his wife and turned away to sip deep and spluttered and coughed msieur charitй angelette de guilleri said as she dipped in a graceful curtsy on the arm of an officer of chasseurs who knocked off a faint bow wondering who the devil his girl was greeting mademoiselle lewrie managed to say bestowing a leg in reply suddenly feeling the heat of the room in late summer and its crowded body heat of hundreds of attendees breaking out in a funksweat would be more to the point madame charitй continued with a maddeningly serene smile on her face curtsying to caroline this time enchantй mademoiselle caroline said responding in kind confused feeling a flush of heat herself and wondering if she was being twitted by an impudent mort who wished to insult a briton it didnt help that charitй was in an egyptianpleated gown of such thin shimmery pale blue stuff that lewrie didnt have to use his imagination to recall every succulent inch of her her hair was up in the ringleted style а la josйphine a plumed widebrimmed hat on her head a furled parasol in one lacegloved hand and a tiny reticule hung from an elbow pardon madame but i was also in the parfumerie la contessa the other day charitй said with wideeyed lashbatting innocence and wish to express my regrets you did not find anything satisfactory for it is the grandest establishment a thousand pardons for my boldness but you are english how marvellous that we are at peace and you may enjoy the splendours of paris the most magnificent city in all europe nestce pas i may make your acquaintance she got a pistol in that reticule was lewries prime thought quickly followed by christ just open a hole in the floor and let me through it whothebloodyelse is goin tturn up he surreptitiously gave charitй a careful lookingover in new orleans shed had a habit when carousing in mens suitings of keeping a dagger up a sleeve did she today have it strapped to one of her shapelyslim thighs and captain alan lewrie of his britannic majestys navy mademoiselle de guilleri sir anthony was happily babbling away glad to have some frogs to present captain lewrie may i name to you mademoiselle charitй de guilleri and major denis clary your servant mademoiselle de guilleri major clary your servant as well lewrie was forced to respond with another leg to both of them gritting his teeth to appear polite captain lewrie will be presented to the first consul today paisleytempleton grandly announced an exchange of captured swords general bonaparte once made captain lewrie a prisoner temporarily at toulon and still has captain lewries sword you refused parole msieur major clary asked amazed that a man would not accept the relative comfort of a very loose sort of imprisonment in civilian lodgings with his pay continuing til exchanged for an officer of his own rank i would not abandon my sailors to the hulks major lewrie responded it wouldve cut a bit rough tjust walk away from them and be comfortable while major denis clary was trying to sort out the phrase cut a bit rough charitй stuck her own in she seemed to find his choice honourablewideeyed astonishment and allbut the capitaine lewrie is surely courageous as ferocious as denis here a hero of hohenlinden and marengo nestce pas she batted her lashes nighfit to stir a small breeze playing the innocent minx eliciting congratulatory coos from sir anthony and a moue and shrug of false modesty from her companion to be so praised quel dommage such choice was not given to my brothers helio and hippolyte charitй continued suddenly turning solemn and all but dabbing at one eye with a handkerchief or my cousin jeanmarie who perished for the glory of france charitй glared directly at the author of their deaths making lewrie purse his lips and frown sure that shed claw his eyes out given half a chance you will exchange swords with napoleon nestce pas i only hope that some of those swords are not theirs capitaine lewrie that would be so tragique shes gotten teeth lewrie thought fighting a wince recalling those names good god amighty can this get even worse i do not recall those names being associated with the swords i brought mademoiselle he told her glancing at her soldier companion these were surrendered by naval officers at sea well picked up more than surrendered since their owners had fallen major clary curled a lip in faint disgust over the fate of fellow french officers even if he held a low opinion of his nations navy and how little it had accomplished since the wars start in yayss well paisleytempleton placated honour to make your acquaintance msieur major clary said eager to end their chat madame capitaine your servant sir mademoiselle lewrie replied with one more bow to each hoping that that was over and done with that little whore caroline muttered as they departed oh shit shes plumbed to it lewrie gawped to himself now she knows about charitй too oh yes it can get worse lewrie tried to bluster his way out of it why call her a her caroline snapped flicking her fan open in the direction of the orchestra and the dancers for there now the orchestra had ended the long gavotte and gone on to a simpler minuet or quadrille air was phoebe aretino swanning gracefully through the figures partnered with a tall mustachioed colonel of the guard infantry and sneaking brief but longing glances at lewrie before his wife caught her at it christ itll be emma hamilton next lewrie miserably told himself irish tess lady cantner even soft rabbits ghost lord but i need another drink now and here he comes now paisleytempleton said with enthusiasm as the orchestra quickly ended their air and the tall doubledoors at the far end of the long hall opened people scampered from the centre of the floor to form up on either side as the first consul made his entrance hands behind his back and looking as if his boots were pinching his toes now what does his choice of uniform mean oh perhaps he expected you in uniform and means to honour you sir sir anthony whispered with a hopeful smile it took better than threequarters of an hour for them to find out what napoleons martial appearance meant for there were other luminaries for the first consul to greet and sir anthony was more than happy to point them out and name them for the lewries there were generals of course the odd french admiral men high in bonapartes government along with composers scientists philosophers and academics civil engineers enrolled to expand the french road and canal systems as well as actors and actresses famed singers and playwrights from the comйdie franзaise even a scruffy artistic poet or three there was the crafty some might say duplicitous foreign minister charles maurice talleyrandpйrigord a tall and spare former aristo and former powerful bishop with a taste for silly and impressionable young women there were members of distinguished and titled old families of france mostly those who had somehow escaped the rabid purges during the reign of terror whose sons had atoned for their sins of privilege on the battlefield and were now held blameless finally an elegant young fellow from the french foreign ministry approached sir anthony paisleytempleton whispered in his ear and indicated that that worthy should herd his presentees to a prominent place in the centre of the hall before a set of chairs and settees quickly cleared of people one chair in particular that would serve as a throne til the real thing was dusted off and dragged down from the garret not very big is he caroline whispered to lewrie as they were led to the makeshift seat of honour napoleon bonaparte stood about two and a half inches shy of her husbands five feet nine to lewries memory napoleon had put on a few pounds since but still appeared slim his hair was now more carefully dressed no longer a sans culottes pageboy frankly bonapartes hair was thinning and was combed forward over his brow shorn closer to the ears with longer sideburns forgot he and i have much the same bluegrey eyes lewrie told himself as they approached from one side of the seating arrangement a liveried servant came with a long bundle wrapped in dark blue giltedged velvet from the other there came another man bearing a much slimmer package paisleytempleton presented first by a simpering frog diplomat underling responded in his excellent french with over a minute or two of gilt and beshit diplomatistspeak with so many subordinate clauses that lewries head began to reel trying to follow it at last he recognised that he and caroline were being named to bonaparte and made a leg with his hand over his heart as caroline performed a very fine curtsy she had not imbibed as much champagne as he with a fetching incline of her head your servant sir lewrie spoke up in english in english fashion and he heard paisleytempleton making excuses for their lack of fluency in french the first consul says you are welcome captain lewrie he expresses enchantment with madame and finds her beauty and her gown delightful paisleytempleton translated he remembers you he says toulon fort le garde exploding firing upon your ship blowing her up as well uhm you would not accept parole and he told you then that ehm you have hair on your arse had rather their representative said deeply blushing at the crudity while the gathered audience tittered and chuckled tell him that i recall vividly lewrie said not even trying to tangle his tongue with his french not after four glasses of wine say that i am honoured that he would remember such a minor incident such a minor encounter say also that had i known who he was then or to what heights he would rise i would have tried to be more pleasant even given the soggy circumstances of course sir sir anthony said before launching into one more long simpering palaver lewrie noted though that bonaparte had his lips curled in a faint expression of dislike for this pantomime unconsciously one finger of napoleons left hand tapped on his thigh he says that you appeared a halfdrowned rat sir paisleytempleton translated with your stockings round your ankles and your breeches draining water aye i expect i did lewrie agreed with a grin though as i recall general bonaparte looked natty does he still have that white horse he rode a splendid beast the pleasantries went on for another minute or so before sir anthony got to the meat of the matter expressing a wellrehearsed preamble about lewries wish now there was a lasting peace between their respective countries to return the swords he had taken restoring them to france and to the families of the fallen at a nod from napoleon the liveried servant with the large bundle came to lay it across lewries arms just long enough for him to retake possession before the draped bundle was formally laid at napoleons feet and spread open to reveal all five scabbarded blades with paper tags bound to the hilts to indicate who were the former owners at another nod the other servant came forward and gave it to napoleon he whipped the cloth covering off and tossed it aside then held up lewries old hanger for all to see before stepping forwardsir anthony gave lewrie a slight nudge to make him take a step towards napoleon to meet him halfwayand napoleon held it out to him but before he actually let it go he began another long speech this time with his lips slit to nothing whenever a pause came and he didnt look all that happy oh lord sir he asks what sort of peace is it when england stalls and delays fulfilling its part of the terms i wont bore you with all of it paisleytempleton said with a very good imitation of a placid expression on his stricken phyz nodding now and again as the first consul had himself a little rant at lewries expense he hopes you never have cause to use your sword against france again but does great britain continue in its perfidious course the need to draw it will become more likely and he he expresses a desire that england sends him a proper ambassador and accepts his own in london else before mistakes and confusion engendered by junior diplomatists do irreparable harm to the amity between our nations napoleon clapped his mouth shut for a moment his lips pressed closer together and his expression stormy whilst the gathered crowd sounded quite pleased with his rant the generals that lewrie could see sharing wolfish eager glances between them he presents you with your old blade sir paisleytempleton said at last looking as if he wished to daub his face with a handkerchief from one warrior to another a quick imperative shake of the sword and lewrie reached out to take it he had enough wit to bow again and express his utmost thanks along with some of those phrases sir anthony had written for him great honour to be presented so pleased the exchange could be made thanks for his excellencys indulgence let us pray that peace prevails and all that tomfoolery lewrie stepped back at last with a final bow in congй as caroline did a parting curtsy and sir anthony led them away from the presence it dont look like well have tea with josephine after all lewrie whispered to his wife sorry bout that mdear to see her was quite enough caroline told him shes not as fetching as weve heard an incline of her head led lewries eyes to a woman in a pale pink and white ensemble with her hair up in grecian style and roses in her hair who was now joining napoleon should we scamper now its done lewrie asked their chaperone or must we circulate and try tbe polite any longer i dont think he cared much for it a quarterhour or so a last glass of champagne and we could depart sir anthony told them looking troubled and wheyfaced and not appear to be fleeing with our tails tucked once back in his appartements in the tuileries palace napoleon bonaparte had his bodyservant rustam peel him out of his sash and uniform coat he tore away his own cravat and tossed it on the floor crossing to the fireplace napoleon loved a fire even in temperate weather and furiously jabbing at the coals and embers with the poker he even kicked one of the mostly consumed logs in anger an act that cost him many ruined shoes and boots monsieur bourrienne monsieur monsieur he called for his private secretary allez vite bring me talleyrand and fouchй i wish to know who thought that charade a good idea and it did not do his simmering temper any good that it took a good quarterhour for fouchй to appear without talleyrand where is the salaud still fumbling under that silly madame grands skirt again fouchй napoleon snapped i would suspect so general fouchй sarcastically replied is this about the englishman i am relieved that the affair is over and that he had no ulterior designs upon your life all my careful precautions proved unnecessary he added almost preening awaiting his masters thanks a day or two more of sightseeing and they will be gone now the exchange is done bourrienne had warned him that the first consul was angry and why i will not be settled in my mind til the fumier is back across the sea napoleon spat poking at the fire again much better would it be that my troops had slaughtered that lewrie and all his men right there in the surf as they came ashore i read the reports you sent me from the ministry of marine about his connexions with the anglais secret service fouchй that fellow is more dangerous to france than he appears not the sort id leave alive or turn my back on without finding a way to neutralise him did i run across him on the field of battle what an insult to the honour of france to lay dead and conquered mens swords before me to smile and speak of peace when what was really meant was to flaunt their navys superiority to my face and present me with the blades of abject failures as a warning to france what will happen at sea should we contemplate a vigorous response to their continued perfidy napoleon paced at a rapid gait from one end of his offices to the next pausing to jab or kick at the fire at the middle of every circuit the fellow is not a nelson general fouchй pointed out he is only a minor frigate capitaine a very fortunate one we learn fortunate napoleon scoffed giving the fire another poke a soldier or sailor makes his own fortune fouchй non non what the ministry of marine reports of his doings shows me a man born for war in time he might become another nelson another pestilent obnoxious poorly educated and pissproud englishman as poorly as our navy has done so far non it might be better for us that this salaud does not that he drops dead of something would ah ohй bonaparte barked here at last are we monsieur talleyrand i wish for you to explain to me what gain there was in that ignoble theatric you recommended so highly that you forced me to endure i will see to it at once general fouchй said certain that he understood his masters command to a tee he was anxious to depart no matter how much pleasure could be derived from seeing the arrogant languid talleyrand being scolded and a strip of flesh torn from his arse fine fine fouchй good work your precautions napoleon offhandedly said with an abrupt wave of his free hand too intent on scolding foreign minister talleyrand to consider how fouchй might interpret his idle spiteful wish now monsieur tell me what fouchй left the offices and quickly made his way out of earshot his keen mind already laying plans contemplating the methods and means and organising a list of likely personnel to fulfill the first consuls order chapter twentyfour it had been a grand jaunt up along the seine to melun and fontainebleau to tour the pristine forests and the grand hunting lodges of the displaced nobility over thirty english miles each way but more than worth it for the sidetrip had soothed caroline into calmer takings that and several smaller vineyards best wines and heartier provincial dishes than the effete kickshaws found in paris still it felt grand to kick off shoes coat and waistcoat and sprawl on one of the settees in their rented parlourlewrie upon one and caroline on another in stockinged feet too she was tucked up with a new book in her lap when there came a rapping on the hallway door jules went to answer it stap me if the lewries didnt get eaten by the corsican ogre sir pulteney plumb brayed as he swept in bestowing an elaborate bow to each with a flourish of his hat imogene and i are dyin of curiosity as to how your levee at the tuileries palace went so much so that we simply had to barge in and enquire haw haw haw mainwell if ye like icy and threatenin lewrie said as he got to his feet you find us not quite ready to and to extend an invitation to supper this evenin where you may reveal all the juicy details to us sir pulteney blathered on i have discovered a pearl of a wee restaurant in the rue saintnicaise odds fish but their volauvent their bouchйe а la reine and their sautй а la provenзale are simply divine and you must try the place before you leave paris oh do say you will join us our treat sir pulteney tempted then added imogene and i have news to impart to you as well which news you will find astounding sir and madam well caroline said cocking her head to one side and looking at her husband if you do not find our travelling clothes too plain sir pulteney begad mistress lewrie no fear o that for you are always elegant plumb poohpoohed it is we plumbs who may shame you haw indeed sir pulteney was garbed in darker soberer fashion than was his usual wont tis a splendid evenin for a stroll before we dine grand for both appetite and the digestion to which the french pay particular care sir pulteney further suggested a turn along the seine in the twilight yes lets caroline agreed deciding for them a quarter hour later after theyd dressed the three of them slowly ambled along the galerie du louvre enjoying the coolness of a breeze off the seine and the soft lingering amber sunset sir pulteney had babbled brayed and japed most amusingly plying his walkingstick with the panache of a regimental drummajor but then fell into an unaccountably gloomy silence at last he turned his head to look at the lewries and muttered through a fools smile pray do not react at all to what i have to impart to you or make any sign of distress pretend i tell you another amusing talecan you do that there may be people watching us this very instant watchin what the devil for lewrie asked frowning fighting the urge to peer about caroline put her hand in his but kept a silent shudder well hidden years ago as the revolution turned violent and right through the reign of terror in ninetythree sir pulteney plumb explained in a softer voice there was a grand english lord who was so appalled by the injustice and bloodshed that he organised a league of gentlemen dedicated to the rescue of innocents from the guillotine and the mob which league was quite successful right up to the death of robespierre and the outbreak of the war with france in february of ninetythree of course this league sometimes depended upon the aid and the intelligence passed on from welldisguised royalist sympathisers here in paris throughout france i confess to you only that i was once a member of that leaguethen and now able to make cautious rencontres with former french supporters even under the noses of the police nationale what the bloody lewrie began to flummox hist listen carefully i pray you sir pulteney cautioned then continued the rebel georges cadoudals failed attempt to kill bonaparte with a hidden bomb a while backquite near here in point of fact at the intersection of the rue saintnicaise and the rue de la loihas tightened the surveillance of the police upon any who might still harbour royalist antibonaparte feelings yet sir pulteney went on with a louder bark as if getting to the punchline of a jape one of our old confidants sought me out whilst you were away and told me that whatever it is you did or said to napoleon has made him exceedingly wroth with you and he has given orders that you are to be eliminated for your insult to him my insult lewrie gawped but what the devil did dear god caroline softly exclaimed blanching now laugh laugh as if i just told you the grandest amusing tale sir pulteney hissed breaking out his characteristic donkeys bray the lewries amusement sounded much lamer as if they were merely being polite or the tale had not been all that amusing therefore you both must flee paris instanter sir pulteney said leaning closer and urging them to begin strolling again pack as if you havent a care in the world wind up your accounts without showing any signs of haste above all do not let on to your hired servants or the concierge of your lodgings back yonder that you are departing in a panic most importantly do not discuss the matter if a servant is anywhere within earshot for you may trust no one whom you do not know even a fellow englishman whom you suddenly encounter here in paris he may be a skilled bilingual police agent i will arrange for your bulkier possessions shipment back to england and i have already begun the scheme to spirit you back to england if you will trust to my experience and abilities in this matter what well erm hey lewrie stammered thinking that only a feeble idiot would trust this braying ass with an empty pewter snuff box for sir pulteney plumb gave all evidence of losing it within the hour too scatterbrained to keep up with a pocket handkerchief part of a secret league him lewrie thought incredulous over the very idea he arranged hundreds of escapes best we abandon all our traps and run like blazes this instant i made napoleon angry he wants me dead or is it charitй de guillens doin yet shes no real power here does she alan if what he says is true caroline almost whimpered squeezing his hand like a vise what must we do this is impossible softly mistress lewrie softly sir pulteney cautioned her and do not lose heart you must believe that what i say is true and that what our old league accomplished in years past we shall be able to accomplish now plans are already afoot soon as i was informed of bonapartes wrath by someone well placed in his entourage ive sent word to some of our old compatriots in england to cross over to help and once we reach the coast we shall be met by a schooner mastered by yet another of our old compatriots royalist sympathisers and old supporters though minister fouchй and rйal imagine they have eliminated our and cadoudals networks i assure you that whichever route we take there will be many along the way to aid us will you believe me sir madam for your lives will you trust me to see you safely out of france and home to england plumb pressed them christ i spose we must lewrie gravelled still unable to take it all in trust someone at any rate though it beggars all belief that bonaparted go tsuch lengths knowin such an act would restart the war less thats what he wishes lewrie trailed off his mind reeling you didnt insult him alan i dont think caroline said in a distraught whisper looking deep into her husbands eyes it was more our governments delays that irked him but surely he cant hold that against you against us oh why did i ever insist that we come to france this is all my fault still sir and madam do you trust me to make good your escape sir pulteney pressed with uncharacteristic sternness dont see how you can yet they say drownin manll clutch even the feeblest straws lewrie decided puffing out his cheeeks in frustration aye i spose we must we do though how we have our ways stap me if we dont sir pulteney assured them then cackled out loud begad but we do have our ways charitй de guilleri in the meantime had been having a grand few days firstly she had finally allowed the dashing major clary of the chasseurs to have his way discovering that denis was a most pleasing lover secondly her beloved new orleans her louisiana was now rumoured to almost be back in frances grasp while she could not fantasise that her continued hints suggestions or pleas for france to reclaim louisiana from the dullard corrupt and incompetent spanish had been the sole cause charitй had in the best salons found allies who felt the same as she a couple of napoleons brothers talleyrand though that had taken an affair with the crippled arrogant and dismissive older fumieran affair which had become almost unendurable before talleyrand had discovered madame grand and a few othersall had coaxed cajoled and spoken favourably for an expansion of empire on the american continent two years before soon after napoleon had become first consul talks had been opened with spain for an exchange charles iv of spain desired a kingdom for his new soninlaw and bonaparte had offered tuscany now firmly occupied by french troops in exchange for louisiana an agreement had tentatively been signed then at san ildefonso yet it still lacked the formal signature and approval from the dilatory and suspicious charles iv now though wonder of wonders talleyrand had dropped her a hint at the levee where she had confronted that imp of hell from her past alan lewrie that charless final approval would soon come she could go home in triumph not as an escaped felon from spanish justice for piracy not as a failed revolutionary but as a confidante of napoleon bonaparte himself a member of the official delegation which would accept the turnover in the place darmes before the cathedral of st louis to the cheers of her fellow creoles her fellow frenchmen and frenchwomen she would be a heroine at last so it was that mlle de guilleri felt as if she could float on air as she breezed into the quayside entrance to the offices of the police nationale at fouchйs invitation after all his sneers at her pretensions let him eat crow that she had succeeded in reclaiming her dear home citoyenne fouchй began with his usual grouchiness and testy impatience you have met citoyen fourchette indeed citoyen fouchй charitй sweetly replied dipping one brief curtsy to the slouching greasylooking agent who had questioned her about that salaud lewrie a pleasure to greet you again citoyen fourchette my pleasure to see you again citoyenne de guilleri the man replied with an appreciative upanddown stare openly leering at her he did not fully rise from his chair though he did sit up straighter and continued to draw on his cigarro fourchette has had this lewrie gars under constant watch for the last few days citoyenne fouchй gruffly told her waving her to a chair a touch too uncomfortably close to the lusting fourchette for charitйs comfort indeed citoyen fouchй charitй asked with one brow up his presence in paris his history of involvement with the british spy establishment what the ministry of marine knows about him from their dossiers fouchй grumbled my thanks to you citoyenne for alerting us to him for a time we suspected he was here to kill the first consul how close he got to him during the exchange of old swords i was there citoyen fouchй charitй pointed out letting him know once more that she travelled in the best circles thankfully we escaped that but perhaps you also witnessed how angry the first consul was as well nestce pas fouchй went on with a mocking grin over her comment later he gave me orders that this mec should drop dead of something hein since you already know he will be done away with at last charitй exclaimed in sudden joy could her prospects be even more blissful bien trиs bien you have just made me the happiest woman in all of france despite citoyenne de guillens enchanting beauty and seeming innocence fourchette she is a fireeater a veteran of armed revolution back in louisiana hein fouchй told his agent almost winking on the sly even as he praised her she and her brothers went to sea to pirate spanish ships raised funds and took arms so the patriots of louisiana could rise and throw off the spanish yoke comprenez i assure you citoyenne de guilleri is a very dangerous young woman then all france must owe you a great debt citoyenne charitй fourchette said with slow and sly surprise and an incline of his head to her in lieu of a bow a slim sword hidden in a silk scabbard how when does he die charitй demanded impatiently feeling irked by fouchйs sarcasm and fourchettes suggestive ogling may i be there when its done my brothers my cousin must be avenged at last she insisted shifting eagerly on her chair not here in paris non fouchй told her thats too public fourchettes watchers say that he and his wife will soon take coach to calais now the exchange is done and their touring is over the last trip fourchette two days in the forest of fontainebleau very romantic i suppose fourchette answered with a chuckle and roll of his eyes they pay the concierge the final reckoning and may depart by the end of the week a highway robbery may be arranged tragique hein the both of them charitй had to ask that bastard lewrie was one thing but his wife was quite another might be best fourchette suggested with a tentative shrug of his shoulders and the coachmen too better they simply disappear and are never heard from again hmm pity they do not coach towards normandy or brittany fouchй grumped it could be blamed on royalist bandits like cadoudal and his compatriots reduced to robbery to fund their schemes against the republic ah well i suppose the calais highway must do you are sure that is their destination fourchette it is what they speak of with the concierge the port to which they have already sent off their heaviest luggage fourchette assured his chief they will travel lighter departing else it would take a second coach shes bought so much in paris understandably i have summoned both of you who know the man and his wife by their faces fouchй continued just in case something goes wrong en route you see citoyenne you will be in at the kill hawn hawn a thousand thanks citoyen fouchй charitй said in heartfelt and genuine gratitude though she had her doubts about travelling with the leering fourchette for that matter major denis clary of the chasseurs was with me when i spoke with lewrie at the levee and he knows his appearance as well she thought she would have to put up with a lot less cloying attention should denis be at her side uhm perhaps fouchй allowed leery of involving anyone too official in uniform though of any slipup that might lead back to the first consul or the french government i sent for another gars who also has intimate knowledge of lewries appearance though pardon citoyen the meek clerk intruded rapping hesitantly on the door before sticking his head in but that naval fellow you sent for is here should i show him in ah bon fouchй perked up clapping his meaty hands together and getting to his feet come in capitaine come in a man from the earliest days of the revolution you see a zealous hunter of aristos and traitors is but here you are capitaine allow me to introduce you to citoyenne charitй de guilleri and one of my best agents citoyen matthieu fourchette fouchй continued but of course you and fourchette have met before hein citoyenne i give you capitaine de vaisseau guillaume choundas charitй shot to her feet in sudden shivering horror as she got sight of the monstrous caricature of a human being her face blanching surely this this hideux could not be real guillaume choundas limped into the office his stout cane tapping on the marble floor his crippled leg in its stiff iron brace making a dragging swishclomp swishclomp with a leer on that half of his dissipated twisted and aged face that he still showed to the world citoyenne de guilleri enchantй the horror said to her with an evil smile clumping close to her flipping his cane to the elbow of his sole arm and reaching out to take her hand as if it had been offered to him he bestowed a kiss upon it a kiss that to charitй felt like the crawling maggoty lips of a rotting corpse it was all she could do to not jerk her hand away to recoil in disgust from his monstrosity to flee the office and go light candles at notre dame and make her confession to a curй in hope of deliverance from one of satans demons capitaine choundas like you citoyenne is also a victim who has suffered at the hands of that salaud alan lewrie fouchй informed her in indeed citoyen charitй managed to say stricken with terror and revulsion this is about lewrie choundas snapped dropping her hand and regaining the use of his cane so he could turn towards fouchй a feral gleam in his remaining eye something is to be done he insulted the first consul capitaine fouchй told him he is to be done away with somewhere lonely and quiet out of sight on the road to calais the three of you know what he looks like so sacre bleu choundas exclaimed and i will participate in his end mort de ma vie all i have asked of life for so many years and it comes to pass perhaps there is a god he spun about more nimbly that charitй imagined that he could to face her again all the ravages you see citoyenne charitй have been at his hand my face my laming my lost arm the ruin of my lifes work oui i will gladly help you murder him another quick turning to face them all swishclomp but it must not be an easy death for him choundas demanded with forethought he must be taken alive only for a time hein he specified with an anticipatory cackle give him to me for half a day a full day and i will take from him what he took from me so long ago and make him beg for deaths release oh mais oui that uhm might be a bit beyond what is necessary fouchй hesitantly countered as he fiddled uncomfortably with his loosely bound neckstock we had thought to make it appear as a highway robbery by aristolovers and criminal elements and so it may citoyen choundas quickly countered his mind ascheme as he haltingly paced in anxiety swishclomp swishclomp is the crime brutal enough it can be blamed on georges cadoudal and his conspirators against the republic financed by the comte dartois with anglais gold from his lair in england to to foment anger in britain against france because their government wants to begin the war again hein their prime minister addington pays the comte dartois for a murder of one of their naval officers and his wife fouchй scoffed at the notion too complicated they disappear everyone in the coach with no one ever the wiser the first consul does not wish a new war with britain at least not yet i have his personal spoken assurance on that matter his wife too oui i saw her with him choundas crooned with an evil hiss shrugging off the quick dismissal of his initial scheme if they must disappear the coachmen horses carriage and all then an outoftheway place could be found where all that could be disposed of an hour or two with her before his eyes before i begin on him and that swaggering lout that despicable fumier would beg ahum fouchй pointedly coughed into his fist you will be in at his demise capitaine choundas that must be enough if you insist citoyen then it must be so choundas seemed to surrendertoo quickly for matthieu fourchette or charitй to believe choundas set the exposed half of his face in a wry smile of contentment but she and the police agent shared a quick dubious look and an even briefer nod in mute agreement that if they had to be saddled with this hideous monster they would have to keep a sharp eye on him at all times and keep his halfinsane fury on a tight leash i must have denis with me charitй de guilleri vowed to herself to keep this hot rabbit fourchette from laying his hands on me and to keep this disgusting beast from killing anyone who denies him his revenge a sour taste rose in her throat a chilly feeling in the pit of her stomach and a weak shuddery feeling that forced her to sit down in her chair once more with only half an ear for fouchйs plan being revealed as dearly as she desired lewrie to die before her eyes for her own revenge stillcompletely innocent coachmen madame lewrie and any unfortunate peasant who happened by at the wrong moment must die as well callous as she had been over the fates of those taken in the merchant ships by her and her brothers her cousin and the old pirates jйrфme lanxade and boudreaux balfa this just didnt enflame her former passion or hatred of all things english it felt to her of a clarifying second as foul as the touch of choundass lips on the back of her hand chapter twentyfive the hired servants jules and marianne were paid off the last funds in their temporary bank account had been withdrawn and a coach had been arranged for their journey to calais with their travelling valises at their feet alan and caroline waited in the foyer of their lodging house for their coachs arrival whilst the concierge and her servants were busy abovestairs so far as lewrie knew fumigating the appartement after being occupied by bloodies yet the coachandfour that drew up by the kerb outside was not theirs for a french couple emerged from it with some handcarried luggage and began to palaver with the concierge announcing so far as lewrie could follow the conversation that they wished to take lodging for a fortnight and would she show them a vacant appartement barely had they gone abovestairs before a second coach rolled up and out of it popped sir pulteney plumb and lady imogene as well as two other couples whom lewrie didnt know from adam and eve they also bustled in with handcarried luggage as if they would seek lodgings too the concierge is busy is she good sir pulteney said with a snicker see why we asked specifically what you would be wearing for your departure haw haw all ready names are not necessary for now but these fine people are old companions summoned back to work in our endeavour all change now quickly the women one with sandy blond hair and the other a brunette had entered in light travelling cloaks over their gowns their faces and hair obscured by longbrimmed faceframing sun bonnets valises were opened and the cloaks stowed away in them revealing that both women wore plain lightgrey gowns very similar in colour and cut to the one that caroline wore the brunette further produced a wig from her valise changing herself to a sandy blonde too the men had entered in broadbrimmed hats more suited to a day on horseback and light riding dusters to protect their suitings at the same moment they revealed themselves in black coats buff waistcoats buff trousers and black topboots a quick change of cravats to match the dark blue one that lewrie sported a change of hats to a taller model with short curlybrimmed hats much like lewries too youve both sets of laisserpassers good sir pulteney said to the first couple off you go then thomas you and your lady and we shall see you in dover at that thomas or whoever he was picked up his valises and offered his wife an arm they stepped outside into the rue honorй and entered the waiting coach which lewrie could note from a vantage point back in the foyers shadows quite blocked the view of any watchers the coach clattered off heading west not half a minute later a second coach almost the twin of the first with a fourhorse team of the same colour drew up facing the other direction andrew you and susannah next youre on sir pulteney urged almost shoving them towards the doors last one to the queens arms inn pays the reckoning for all haw haw he tapped his long walkingstick on the parquetry foyer floor impatiently as the second couple of andrew and susannah exited and got into the coach which headed east whip cracking now for you and your lady captain lewrie sir pulteney said hurriedly cocking his head and ears as the rattle of a third carriage could be heard calm as does it show serenity and unwitting blandness to the guards at the porte theyll have orders to report your passing all of them will after they allow you to leave the environs of paris which i expect they will for any attempt in the city would be too incriminating let your coachees proceed at their normal pace youll be using the argenteuil gate so you must say that you will be taking ship at le havre we will catch you up on the pontoise road before your coach crosses the river oise where we shall put into play other measures to throw the authorities off your scent now be on your way quickly go with god and we shall see you shortly lewrie heaved a deep breath and picked up his valises whilst sir pulteney shrugged out of his elegant suit coat tossed his hat to the sideboard table and whipped out a white porters apron to play a servants role to carry the rest of their luggage to the coach that was that very instant drawing rein right by the doors lady imogene gave caroline a fond assuring hug then shooed her out to join alan with a last instruction to smile and be gay you are going home to england nestce pas once inside the coach though and under way caroline pressed her hands together and shut her eyes as if in prayer looking wan and pale whilst lewrie fussed and shifted on the leather seat beside her to rearrange his coat and waistcoat trying to get comfortable alan caroline muttered in a fretful conspiratorial whisper will they really let us pass not snatch us out or murder us in one of the poorer stews weve seen them passing through crime is surely rampant in them unremarkable still too public lewrie decided patting her knee casus belli or bellum plumbs right about that at least itd mean war even if they put me on trial as a spy and slung me into prison from what bonaparte said to us tother day it sounds as if thingsre tetchy enough already as plumb says their best chance be out in the countryside seeing how fretful caroline still seemed he took her hand and gave her an encouraging squeeze an instant later and she turned to lay her head on his shoulder silently demanding to be held no matter if the sight of one of his former lovers had put her off intimacy the last few days nigh sixteen years of marriageno one could call it wedded bliss exactly counted for something he supposed we never should have come to france she fiercely muttered on his coat lapel and he could feel her body shudder at the brink of hot tears of remorse im sorry i ever oh tosh mgirl lewrie calmly objected though his own guts and heart were about to do a brisk canter he kissed her forehead and muttered into her hair it was half my idea dye recall and if ye dismiss this little problem hadnt we a grand time well fairly a good time in the main her answer was a tearful snort and a closer snuggling mean tsay its been me traipsin halfway round the world havin all the adventures he cajoled and gettin paid mainwell by king george for it too you havent had a whiff o danger since you whipped harry embleton with yer reins or came nigh tshootin calico jack finneys nutmegs off when he burst in on ye and sewallis when he was a baby we get back tengland with our scalps why we could dine out on this for years caroline uttered another snort this one tinged with amusement lewrie gently tilted her face up to his and kissed her for reassurance though to his surprise that kiss quickly turned to a warm and musky one of passion thats my darlin lass lewrie told her grinning here now ever do it in a carriage he added to jolly her further she punched him in the ribs almost hard enough to hurt but she smiled at last she laughed even in gallows humour and said and i suppose that you have dont answer your lewd suggestion is clue enough to your past you wretch well later perhaps lewrie allowed with an easy chuckle uhm alan caroline said snuggling up to him do you imagine that sir pulteney is that capable mean tsay he seems as if hes done this sort of thing before he seems to have the connexions but might he be in league with the french too are we to be his victims his wifes frenchlady imogene was a famous actress during the terror and shed have known a lot of the brutal revolutionaries and dont think weve anything tfear on that score caroline lewrie quickly dismissed at first i took him for a captain sharp who plays on unwary travellers lookin tskin us broke but look at all theyve spent on us suppers theatre and if he meant to lay hands on our goods we sent off to calais then thatd be a damned bad trade no all these matchin coaches and horse teams the clothes the plumbs came up with at the drop of a hat and people who somewhat resemble us at short notice puttin themselves to as much risk as us if theyre exposed no im beginnin tthink hes the genuine article even if he is daft as bats half the time we get home we could look him up in debretts see if hes authentic the coach began to slow and lewrie turned his attention to the environs as they drew up into a line of dray waggons coaches and farm carts at the porte dargenteuil during the reign of terror under the hideously misnamed committee for public safety then even later under the directory of five france had become a suspicious police state fearful of counterrevolutionaries and spies of saboteurs and each other paris and the great cities had closed and barricaded their medieval gates completely at night and only the market carts that fetched fresh produce from the countryside were let out travellers not known to locals were instantly suspect and soldiers of the garde nationale or police nationale inspected every basket or valise for contraband bombs smuggled weapons or coded messages even now in the autumn of the city gates were manned by policemen or soldiers though passage was usually much easier even for foreigners and thorough questionings and searches were a thing of the past at least lewrie hoped buck up now caroline he told her its time to play the snooty english tourists bland serene stupid a garde nationale soldier with a musket slung on his shoulder a sabrebriquet on his hip and a cockaded shako tipped far back atop his head rapped on the lefthand coach door demanding papers lewrie handed them over in a languid limply bored hand through the lowered window and the guard a sergeant by the tassel hung from one shoulder moved his stubby pipe from one corner of his mouth to the other tugged at a corner of his impressively long and thick mustachios and gave out a grunt he looked up locking eyes with lewrie for a second then peered into the coach to assure himself that it contained only the two people declared by their laisserpassers anglais msieur he gruffly asked oui lewrie replied et vous retournez en angleterre retourn yes were going home lewrie replied pretending even poorer command of french back to jolly old england what mean tsay oui au revoir msieur madame the guard said handing back their laisserpassers and sketching out a salute before waving to the coachmen and his compatriots to signal that they were allowed to exit paris no worse than any other daycoach jaunt we made lewrie told caroline were on our way one way or the other matthieu fourchette had placed three covert watchers in close vicinity to the lodging house in the rue honorй feeding pigeons taking a stroll sullenly sweeping horse dung as the first coach came to a stop by the doors the senior man tipped an underling the wink and he was off quick as his legs could carry him to alert the band waiting for his news in the place du carrousel the second coach then a third bollixed everything throwing the remaining two watchers into feetful confusion the departure of those three coaches with three pairs of lewries less than a minute apart threw those two agents into a panic try to pursue them try to catch up with fourchette and his men who had most likely started off for the porte st denis the logical exit for the calais road or raise a hue and cry the senior man decided that his best choice if he wished to continue his employment was to run to the headquarters of the police nationale on the south side of the tuileries palace to pass the burden on to director fouchй well not directly to his faceand let him despatch riders to sort it out if director joseph fouchй had had a single hair on his head he would have been sorely tempted to yank it out in frustration as contradictory news came in in mystifying dribs and drabs horsemen from three of the portes had come to report the departure of the anglais couple the guards had been ordered to be on alert for another horseman had to be sent off to catch up with fourchette and his party to warn them that a massive charade was being played on them of a sudden fouchй needed two more parties of pursuers with no time to brief them on the purpose of their urgent missions or to scrounge up the proper men who could manage the elimination of those perfidiously clever anglais all their plans had put that task into the hands of fourchette that salope de guilleri and that foul fiend choundas damn damn damn fouchй roared flinging an inkpot at the nearest wall even if they catch them they wont know them from adam their papers give nothing away merde alors merde merde citoyen his meek clerk timorously asked cringing a little you have orders he dared to pose another rider fouchй demanded grabbing for pen and paper and realising he no longer had any ink with which to write new orders putain he roared in even greater frustration ink fool bring me more ink ballot vite vite he took a deep breath to calm himself as the clerk scrambled to fetch a fresh inkpot fourchette could sort it out hed better or it would be his neck three coaches to pursue so he would split his party of course and make haste fouchй assumed the girl with a few agents to help her thank god shed talked him into including her chasseur clary who could chase after the second with a few more men though hed been included to identify them to trail them and had not been in on the conclusion of the plan would he balk fourchette and that beast choundas could chase after the first coach before all three of them got too far away from paris before the roads diverged too far apar the clerk returned with the ink and fouchй scribbled furiously to impart his new instructions then issued a second order there was a chance that the anglais couple would get so far along that there would be no catching them if the first lead was false he needed more men with orders to arrest them he would leave the elimination to his man fourchette for that he would send an urgent request to the general in charge of the garde nationale garrison in paris no no request but an order for at least three troops of cavalry send them off at once at once fouchй snapped thumping down into his chair with his head in his thick hands staring at the middle distance and wondering if things could go even more awry fouchйs first despatch rider caught up with fourchette and his party no more than two kilometres past the porte st denis putain quel emmerdement fourchette spat once hed read it balled it up and shoved it into a side pocket of his coat our quarry must have been warned but i do not see how three couples at three portes presented papers declaring themselves as the lewries with the help of anglais spies i knew it guillaume choundas growled thumping his rein hand on the low pommel of his saddle he had never been a decent horsemen even when in possession of both his arms and working legs and even a little more than one hour astride a horse was beginning to be an agony hes in league with the royalist conspirators how else in league with the devil make haste fourchette decided quickly the coach bound for calais from the porte saintdenis cant be that far ahead well see whether were after the real lewrie or another allez vite fourchette spurred his horse to a gallop quickly joined by the girl and her chasseur major both revelled in the sudden chase and the kilometreeating pace and the wind in their faces still unaware of their true purpose major denis clary delighted in showing off his superb cavalrymans mastery of a horse and charitй was just as eager to impress him with her seat for a few moments she could shake from her mind the image of what would occur at the end of their chase and take a little joy she looked over her shoulder and laughed out loud to see that foetid monster choundas jouncing almost out of control in only a boneshaking trot as she left his hideous form and mind behind there it is fourchette bugled espying a slowtrotting coachandfour on the road ahead hurry fourchette charitй major clary and half a dozen agents garbed in civilian clothes thundered up to the coach catching up easily and passing down either side of it as fourchette bellowed demands for the coachee to draw reins and stop he sprang from his saddle and was at the carriage door before one of his men could take his reins msieur et madame i order you to present your laisserpassers at once and oh merde alors who the devil are you sir i do not know who you are but you will not use such foul language in my wifes presence do you hear me the gentleman with the midbrown hair inside the coach shot back with an imperious back and in perfect french with but a touch of anglais accent your papers at once fourchette shot back fighting down his shock to find utter strangers once handed over he read them over quickly and got a sinking feeling the man and his wife were english but not the ones he sought you are sir andrew graves sir the briton said looking at fourchette with that maddening supercilious air of a proper english lord looking down at a chimney sweep my lady wife susannah and what is the meaning of this sir irking fourchette so much that he wished this arrogant anglais was his real prey and he could just put the salaud into a hastily dug grave yet the laisserpassers he had been presented were authentic with entry dates and a departure from paris showing that they had been in france two weeks and with all the proper signatures and stamps depressingly authentic to boot a thousand pardons msieur madame but we seek escaping criminals thought to be fleeing justice on this highway in a coach quite like this one adieu you may proceed fourchette said though that galled him to no end and you apologise msieur sir andrew pressed a brow up a thousand pardons for my choice of words as well and my apologies to madame fourchette was further forced to say well i should bloodywell think so dash it all sir andrew huffed whip up driver avance cocher vite vite one down two tgo his wife susannah who was really better known round drury lane as betsy peake chortled to her companion who was also better known on the shakespearean stages of london and its nearer counties as anthony ford as the party of horsemen clattered far enough away for them to revert to their natural accents and glee to have fooled the frogs so thoroughly must say mdear but these roles we play give life a zest ford said with a satisfied sigh of contentment and a bit of relief that they were free and clear here ill shred these lyin packets twee bits as we bowl along betsy offered and yes it is very piquant showin off again piquant my eye hoy bets ever do it in a carriage ford leered wif th likes o you hmmph chapter twentysix oh caroline said with a start after sitting silently tense for more than an hour as their coach rolled past the last outskirts of paris and into the pleasant countryside tween the seine and the oise trouble lewrie bolted erect thinking she had seen some sign of pursuit what he demanded wishing that hed thought to pack a single pistol in his bags before leaving england even the hanger he had gotten back from napoleon was in a roundtopped trunk on its way to calais no i dont believe caroline told him delving into her reticule forgive me for being remiss but i quite forgot the note that lady imogene slipped me just as we were leaving she produced a wee folded piece of paper when opened no more than four inches square oh caroline exclaimed again sir pulteney has additional instructions for us here see for yourself once you pass through pontoise there is a quite nice coaching inn on the far bank of the oise called le gantelet rouge stop there for refreshment linger i arrive anon hummph lewrie huffed whats that down at the bottom lewrie asked his wife once hed read it that blob there it looks like a flower of some kind caroline said peering more closely at the note which was written in black ink the flower petals though were coloured yellow with chalk or pastel pencil should we eat the note now weve read it lewrie japed caroline rolled her eyes at him for making jest in such circumstances but at least she did it with a grin she began to shred it feeding wee pieces of the note out the window on her side of the coach bit by bit that should be sufficient enough so for the likes of your mysterious old friend that hideous zachariah twigg never a friend lewrie countered i wonder if theyll ask for our papers when we enter pontoise cross the bridge or when we order dinner at the inn the authorities in pontoise evidently could have cared less of a damn anent the identities of travellers for there were no soldiers posted on the southern outskirts nor on the bridge which spanned the oise the carriage trundled through the heart of the towns business district to the northern outskirts then there it is caroline exclaimed as le gantelet rouge came in sight on the righthand side of the road out where the homes were humbler and further apart where stonefenced or hedged pastures and farm crops began to predominate uhm cocher lewrie called leaning out his window i say cocher arrкte sil vous plaоt а le gantelet rouge for dйjeuner mais oui msieur the lead coachman laconically replied as he slowed the horses and turned the coach into the large shady yard in front of a twostorey stone inn with a slate roof with a cool gallery to one side and many outbuildings and barns we will be awhile erm quelque temps lewrie said to the coachmen once they had alit ah youre free to faites comme vous voudrez messieurs caroline provided for him explaining that while they took a long dinner and a rest from the ride on the hard benches the coachmen could do as they will have a bite themselves some wine and such give them a few franc coins alan oh rightho lewrie agreed handing up coins from his purse the gallery looks inviting caroline commented as the entered the travellers inn perhaps an inside table caroline out of sight from the road yes of course she agreed then looked at him with amusement rightho alan the plumbs must be wearing off on you you will be saying begad zounds and stap me next well uhm they shared a bottle of wine lingering over it and making but guarded small talk half an hour later and they ordered a plate of horsdoeuves then a second bottle of wine when that was consumed they ordered soup and bread then opted for breaded veal and asparagus to while away another hour le gantelet rouge boasted an ormolu clock on the high mantel and its ticking the slow progression of its minute hand was maddening after a while til a coach could be heard entering the inn yard wheels hissing and crunching over the fine gravel and chains tinkling bound to the rear of the inn nearest the stables and well was it sir pulteney was it soldiers both alan and caroline began to tremble despite their efforts not to ready to bolt zounds but there you are sir pulteney plumb exclaimed very loudly as he bustled in the rear entrance now in more modest travelling clothes and a light serge de nоmes duster and widebrimmed farmers hat which he swept off elegantly as he made a leg to them told you the red gauntlet sets a fine table haw haw and here is my good lady begad mdear but look who has stopped at the very same inn as us allow us to join you for we are famished and as dry as dust the lewries had to sit and sip wine order coffee to thin the alcohol fumes from what they had already taken aboard as sir pulteney and lady imogene ordered hearty full meals and dined as if they had all the time in the world now for your coach and coachmen sir pulteney said at last as he rose and moved to the front door lewrie followed him to see sir pulteney paying off their hired coach and ordering their luggage brought to the inn i told them that you found the inn so delightful and the arrival of old friends so pleasant that we would all be staying on the night and coach to le havre together in the morning sir pulteney explained after he returned they will rack back south to paris a touch richer than they expected and god willing your whereabouts ends here haw haw what happens tomorrow then lewrie asked him not tomorrow captain lewrie what happens now is more to the point sir pulteney said with a sly expression as their luggage made its way through the inn to the rear stableyard and into the plumbs coach sated my dear excellent now we will all pay our reckonings and resume our journey what there was no coachman for sir pulteney to pay off for once he had handed lady imogene and caroline into the coach he sprang to the coachees bench and the reins most lithely and got the team moving with a few clucks a whistle and a shake of the reins lady imogene crossed herself as they got under way once more pulteney adores playing coachee though i fear hes not as talented as he imagines himself and he rushes on much too fast sometimes good christ lewrie said shaking his head in dread sir pulteney got the coach on the road and began to set a rapid pace whipping up like jehu the biblical charioteer putting the wind up lewrie whod had his share of harumscarum whiphands like zachariah twigg and his damned threehorse chariot twigg was in his sixties for gods sake usually aloof staid and cold but hand him the reins and hed turn into a raving lunatick screeching like a naked celtic warrior painted in blue woad revelling in how close he came to carriages farm waggons and pedestrians as if reenacting queen boadiceas final charge against the roman legions sir pulteney took the eastern road from pontoise following the north bank til reaching a crossroads that led north towards the smaller towns of mйru and beauvais slowly climbing into a region of low and rolling hills that were thickly forested and the roads were windier did it matter a whit to that fool like hell it did for their coach sometimes swayed onto two wheels and those inside were jounced tumbled and rattled like dice in a cup lewries testicles it must be admitted drew up in expectation of the grand smash to come at long last and at a much slower pace sir pulteney steered the coach off the road to a rougher and leafcovered forest track some few of those newfangled froggish kilomиtres short of mйru or so the last milepost related before they drew to a very welcome stop deep in a forest glade what now lewrie had to ask easing the kinks in his back from keeping himself as stiff as rigor mortis the last few hours as he and sir pulteney went into the woods in one direction the ladies another to tend to the necessities why we become other people before we reach mйru sir their rescuer told him beaming with pleasure as he took a pinch of snuff on the back of his hand then once there we change our mode of travel ten years ago during the height of the french revolutions bloodiness there were more than a few residents there royalist in their sympathies who aided our endeavours at spiriting the blameless to safety in such a rural place i rather doubt the committee for public safety or the later directory even bothered to root out socalled reactionaries or hold their witchhunts no no im certain there are still many of our old allies ready to speed us on our way ahahachoo sir pulteney paused for a prodigious sneeze into a handkerchief with all evident delight you will partake captain lewrie he said offering a snuff box zounds but thats prime he said sneezing again never developed a liking for it thankee lewrie said you say were tbecome other people your trail goes cold at the gantelet rouge in pontoise now it will go even colder at mйru sir pulteney confidently told him as they went back to the coach my trail and lady imogenes as well we will openly sup in mйru after obtaining a much humbler conveyance then travel through the night to put as much distance between us and paris and any pursuit before tomorrows dawn that will require new aliases and some ah costume changes to transform us into a most unremarkable party of travellers french travellers begad im tplay a frenchman lewrie gawped in disbelief me sir thats asking rather a lot i took that into consideration captain lewrie plumb replied just as i noted that your wifes french though not fluent is much better than yours which suggested to me the very personas which must be assumed haw haw imogene and i shall do most of the talking wouldnt we need new documents or something lewrie wondered for foreign visitors of a certainty but for innocent and upstanding frenchmen hardly aha sir pulteney exclaimed hurrying them to the boot of the coach my lady has already begun the alteration of your wifes appearance the leather covering of the boot had been rolled up revealing several large trunks one of which was open whilst a second served as a seat for caroline as lady imogene fussed over her now and then having a good dig down through the open trunks contents there were some gowns many scarves and shawls a heap of variouscoloured wigs and a smaller box of paints and makeup caroline had changed into a sobre and modest drab brownish wool gown with a creamcoloured shawl over her shoulders and a dingy white apron white silk stockings had been replaced by black cotton and her feet now sported clunky old buckled shoes instead of light slippers good god lewrie gawped again noticing that carolones fair hair was now covered by a mousy brown wig and atop that there now sat a nighshapeless old straw farmwomans hat lady imogene had done something with her paints and powders too for caroline looked at least ten years older of a sudden lud but thats subtle mdear sir pulteney congratulated merci dearest lady imogene sweetly replied beaming what is necessary for theatregoers twenty rows back would be much too much for those we will deal with facetoface artifice as you say must be subtle oh i apologise for making you seem so careworn mistress lewrie but your natural beauty must notbe remembered lady imogene said finishing up the additions or slight enhancements of furrows or crowsfeet darkening the merry folds below carolines eyes as if she possessed weary sleepless bags et voilа done she cried now should any pursuers ask if anyone has seen a fairhaired englishwoman they can honestly say non dye see captain lewrie sir pulteney said with an inane titter your turn now sir he removed his own clothing and began to dig into another trunk i will now become major ah pierre fleury a retired officer of foot now too lame to serve i will be a very disappointed man haw haw lady imogene is to be oh hang it imogene fleury a disappointed woman in her own right because because aha i have it he said as he paced in a small circle you mistress lewrie are the widow of my eldest son bertrand who found you in the piedmont during bonapartes italian campaign an italian of all things and not the sort of match we had arranged for him being foreign of course your lessthanfluent french is plausible mdear he asked lady imogene i simply adore it mon cher lady imogene cried clapping her hands in delight i see i think caroline said sounding a bit dubious you captain lewrie sir pulteney said whirling to face him and already feigning the stiff fierceness of a retired officer and a disappointed father with a strict martinets snap to his voice you are my youngest son our last hope of grandchildren and the continuation of our familys name but you armand yes thatll do you armand tried to be a soldier you can remember your name trиs bien you enlisted as a private soldier in the cavalry but proved so clumsy that you ended by getting kicked in the head by your horse before you had a chance to go on campaign and have recently been invalided out we shall have papers to that effect well we will shortly you will have to play a dummy it didnt help lewries nerves or his dignity that caroline let forth a cynical chucklesnort then a fullout hoot of laughter youre addled as a scrambled egg armand sir pulteney went on you must walk stiffly as if afraid your whole head will tumble off slowly and stiffly be clumsy with anything you handle forks and spoons and such be slow in speech grasping for the proper names for things je suis un crayon lewrie interrupted feeling sarcastic too with your poor command of french i expect youll grasp for a great number of nouns yayss sir pulteney snapped still in character do you rise from a chair you might swoon a bit and wince as if theres a sudden pain in your poor head as well lady imogene prompted we will cut your meat for you dribble a little wine so that i may wipe your chin should i drool lewrie rejoined growing tetchy that might be a bit too much sir pulteney said with a frown let me wrap this bandage round your head lady imogene said then turn your complexion pale and wan by the time lewrie had been touched up and his good suitings replaced with illfitting and older castoffs sir pulteney had altered himself into a stiff and sternlooking fellow in his late fifties or early sixties with a shock of reddish hair and a large gingery mustachio a man who wore a sobre black ditto suit and limped on a stout cane when i address you armand it may be well for you to cringe into your collar sir pulteney instructed who after all would wed you now what hopes of family martial glory for la patrie can come from one such as you will you give us grandchildren or a life of caring for a lackwit pah he stamped lewrie ducked his head as if avoiding a proctors rod gulping a bit as he recalled that what he must playact now was him to the life in his student dayswhen caught lacking at his studies skylarking or wakened from a nap in class huzzah for an english public school education he told himself thank god for napoleon bonaparte lady imogene said as she packed up her paints and closed the trunks the meddler he imagines he will reorder so much of france the civil law codes the roads and canals standardising the currency he has even given instructions to the comйdie franзaise about costumes makeup and how roles must be played all these castoffs were available for a song lets hoist these trunks back into the boot and be on our way capt armand sir pulteney snapped not all that many kilometres or miles away at that very moment matthieu fourchette was gazing across the fields to the river oise at a small crossroads place called lisle adam on the main road to amiens and cursing under his breath as they watered their tired horses and eased sore fundaments he had been forced to split his already small pursuit party after the incident with that english lord and his wife some went on up the road to see if a second coach containing their quarry had gotten that far along beyond the first theyd stopped there was a slim chance of that but fourchette had to make sure that that trailing coach had not been a decoy to put them off the chase and turn their attention elsewhere he wished he could sit down and rest wished he could reach back and massage his buttocks and inner thighs but he would not admit that he was not as good a horseman as that damned chasseur major clary or the girl on most of his missions for fouchй walking round paris or coaching round france was sufficient and when required to go by horse the distances were usually much shorter and at much slower paces police agent fourchette also wished he could get on with it but he could not do that either fouchй had promised him a cavalry troop and he had to wait for their arrival he had to wait for his agents to return with a report from the other road damn he spat the coaches that left through the argenteuil gate and the gate at saintgermaine en laye major clary thought to contribute as he stood nearby idly flicking his horses reins on his boots while his mount sipped water from the poor taverns trough the englishman is most likely in one of those msieur fourchette from the west gate pah fourchette snapped where would they run to going west brest nantes or saint malo lorient or saintnazaire that would take them days to make their escape that coach will prove to be a decoy fouchй writes that he has requested a troop of cavalry to pursue that one though it will prove fruitless no i think our quarry flees north for dieppe boulognesurmer or calais those ports are much closer and make their journey shorter then why do we tarry msieur charitй asked him fourchette began to round on her but major clary spoke up as he pulled the horse back from the trough and began to lead him to the shade under the trees beside the tavern beauvais is it departing the argenteuil gate the direst route north leads to pontoise then to beauvais all the roads join there we could go on leaving word with the tavernier for your men and the cavalry we could cross the oise and ride for beauvais and be there by nightfall nestce pas with your authority from msieur fouchй and my rank in the chasseurs we could order fresh mounts from the regiment garrisoned there and request more men than a single troop with these blown nags fourchette gravelled loath to take advice from a soldier we would be lucky to get to what the devil is the placehe snarled unfolding a poor mapto this little mйru oui well go to beauvais when my men have checked the road all the way to creil when the cavalry arrive and when our horses are rested else we get stuck in the woods until someone comes and rescues us we will have to wait a bit longer major major clary thought to tell fourchette that cavalry sent from paris in haste would arrive with blown horses too but was beginning to take a great dislike to the lankhaired weaselly fellow he would have said that in his military experience and with general bonaparte and his many victories as a shining example forces so widely separated had to act on their own initiative and quickly bonaparte had trusted his generals and colonels to think to play their disparate parts in the overall scheme before converging before the final objective to the utter confusion of the enemy in this case beauvais was the objective the junction of almost every road their quarry might take to flee but major clary didnt think that fourchette would be in a mood to listen to sound advice besides he didnt much care for how this insouciant leering salaud ogled charitй either major clary came back from the hitching rails letting his fond gaze assess his amour with a new lovers delight as she sat on a bench impatiently jiggling a booted leg crossed over the other idly pinning back up her windtossed coif she rode astride like a man a pair of mens breeches underneath her gown charitй rode as good as a man he further marvelled yet what was this chase all about and what was so important to her about being a part of itbeyond the fact that she could recognise the englishman and his wifethat that billiardballheaded fouchй had allowed her to come along so this anglais had insulted the first consul had he clary had heard their conversation and bonaparte had done most of the insulting to the smiling and bobbing bloodies they were to arrest this gars for that horsewhip him perhaps or throw him into prison asking charitй in the few fleeting quiet moments of this chase had resulted in vague answers waved off with an impatient hand and a change of topic all paris knew mlle de guilleris heroic history to raise a rebellion against the spanish and reclaim louisiana and new orleans for france the loss of her kin and her banishment before the dons garrotted her others said the englishman was a spy sent to kill bonaparte but that hadnt happened so why the urgency thinking back on what hed seen at the levee major denis clary suddenly recalled being introduced to this lewrie and how charitй had spoken to him with such wellconcealed anger had she known him before in spanish louisiana impossible clary decided yet oh beurk charitй exclaimed standing quickly she made a gagging sound a light twohorse open carriage was trotting up the road to the tavern with a saddled horse tied to its rear by the reins can we not be rid of that obscenity that disgusting capitaine guillaume choundas had caught up with them bleating in bile to run into them demanding why lewrie was not yet in their hands and what did they think they were doing standing about with their fingers up their idle arses chapter twentyseven police agent fourchette didnt think much of mйru when they got there at last just before sunset a wide spot in the road most likely awash in pigshit inhabited by numbskulls in wooden clogs he concluded sharing the views of most parisians with regard to their rural countrymen they did call a halt for wine bread and cheese water and feed bags for their horses and a few questions the local policeman the only policeman was a corpulent lazy jumpedup hayscyther stuffed into a uniform and a lax set of duties yes there were some travellers at the two foul inns but none of them were anglais and no one even close to lewries description had passed through of course hed carefully looked at the registries or he would once this intense parisian and his entourage had departed and no foreigners of any kind had paused in sleepy little mйru a coach a big shiny black coachandfour with a matched team of sorrels mais oui a coach like that had passed through but that had been three hours before that forced fourchette major clary charitй the police agents and the befuddled troop of light cavalry into their saddles some still chewing or pulling at spare canteens hurriedly filled with a raw local vin ordinaire a vague step away from vinegar on to beauvais allez vite fourchette demanded theyre in acoach three hours ahead but we can still catch them if they did not change teams somewhere along the way msieur fourchette major clary said as they began to clatter north we will be much faster even on tired mounts fresh team oui the livery fourchette snapped spurring his horse for the stables if they obtained fresh horses here the old stableman was as much a slowwitted bumpkin as the policeman interrupted from shovelling dung with a pitchfork from one of the barn stalls msieur wishes he asked slowly a coach came through here a few hours ago fourchette began impatiently did you provide them a change of horses they are criminals wanted in paris a coach came here oui msieur the older fellow said taking his own sweet time to puff on his pipe take it from his lips and look into the bowl to see if it was drawing properly then spit to one side but i did not change horses with them so they will be slow aha fourchette started to cheer up you wish to see the coach msieur the horses the old man asked they left it all with me and gave me three hundred francs to see it back to a livery in paris is it stolen perhaps will you be taking it i was looking forward to going to paris quel dommage still here where fourchette yelped in the barn certainement msieur the old fellow said with his pipe stem for a pointer to the barns interior the old fellow is a criminal then one would never have guessed what old man fourchette snapped as he dismounted and ordered some troopers to help him search the barn and the coach the man who left the coach here msieur the stableman said in his slow laconic way a msieur fleury how old with a fairhaired woman an old soldier i took him to be the stableman answered maddeningly slowly red hair and mustachios in his fifties i should think carried himself as an officer would a colonel or general of brigade i thought him he travelled with his wife but she had dark hair mixed with grey and quite stout he had a limp and leaned on a cane lewrie could not disguise himself that much charitй said in rising impatience too nor could his wife just the two of them no mademoiselle was the grunted reply tween smoke puffs msieur fleury had his widowed daughterinlaw and his son with him poor fellow puff puff look at the pipe once more and spit what about him fourchette demanded coming back from inspecting the coach and coming away without a clue why hed been kicked in the head by a horse and let go from the army the stableman related all his wits knocked from him fair midbrown hair slightly curled with a faint scar on his cheek charitй pressed sketching a finger down her own face no mamselle darkhaired didnt see a scar did they say where they were going fourchette asked did they rent horses from you said charitй at the same time did they just walk on up the road came a croaking snarl from the open carriage from guillaume choundas hй merde what a sight the old stableman gawped at choundas and made a gesture guaranteed in local lore to ward off evil one question at a time pray you he pleaded with his hands before him did they say where they were going you old fool fourchette and how no reason to be insulting msieur the old fellow said in a sudden sulk msieur fleury said they were going home to rouen he had taken his son to a physician in paris to see if they could do anything for him as for how they went on they rented an old twohorse farm waggon from me they went up that way the road to beauvais what is all this nonsense about these people fourchette choundas demanded from his carriage slamming his cane on the floor lewrie did not come this way hes on another road right now laughing his head off at how feeble we are who the devil are we after and why major capitaine joseph aulard leader of the troop of cavalry asked the only military man in the party two anglais or four french people my colonel told me nothing but to catch up with this police fellow and follow his orders two anglais a capitaine in their navy and his wife as to why you might have to ask msieur fourchette for i see no sense in it mon vieux major clary replied in a mutter with a shrug i am here simply because i met the anglais and can recognise him incroyable the cavalry officer spat there is a plot fourchette growled as he fumbled to put his foot into the stirrup three coaches three couples two to throw us off the scent theres more to this than we thought organised by a cabal of anglais secret operatives paid for with british gold this coach came from paris a match to the first one we came across they are still ahead of us lewrie and his wife and another pair that aid them going to beauvais we ride on all night capitaine aulard bemoaned merde well all be reeling in our saddles by the time we get to beauvais without a proper suppertoo the farm waggon had no suspension straps to support its jolting solid axles its four wheels were badly greased if greased at all so the intermittent keening shriek could carry for miles at night it had been used to haul hay bricks lumber dung everything now the bed was liberally covered with freshsmelling straw under which all those trunks and valises were hidden still it remained a nasty conveyance and a slow one to boot for the two large horses which pulled it were old and sir pulteney at the reins again did not press them too hard the sun was down the stars were out and the moon hinted that it might rise above the trees and low hills several hours hence the birds had gone to their nests and were silent innocent farm people were slurping their soups dipping their breads carving off slices of cheese and onions and sipping their vin ordinaire perhaps no more than an hour from retiring the locals own waggons and carts were in the barns so the fugitives had the road pretty much to themselves in the distance only here and there were there glims to be seen through opened shutters odds blood there it is just as i recall it sir pulteney announced as he turned the waggon into a much narrower farm track off the beauvais road the entrance almost lost in overgrowth and so bad a lane evidently so littleused that in the darkness anyone chasing them would have to know of its existence and peer hard to spot it sir pulteney shook the reins and clucked the team to a faster pace for a mile or so before slowing again it appears theres been a dry summer so we should find one of the old fords and cross over the thйrain river after that there are a thousand farm tracks just like this which will take us near amiens round it in point of fact and is our luck in well be in calais in a trice haw haw how long a trice did ye have in mind lewrie asked clawing at amaddening itch beneath his dark wig and bandage hoping that the lastfrog actor whod worn it hadnt had crabs lice or fleas the paints that lady imogene had daubed on him were greasy too and the cool night air made him conjure that his face was covered in bear fat like a muskogee indians would be to keep the mosquitoes at bay three days in this waggon sir pulteney estimated as they shared the unsprung bench seat of the unsprung waggon behind their plodding team slower than cold treacle tonight of course farmer folk hereabouts would remark upon anything on the roads at night especially one making good time and we cant have that begad haw if we cant make noise then stop that brayin lewrie griped horse pray god at some point lewrie hoped aloud so we can make better speed once weve altered our appearances and assumed new aliases somewhere up ahead sir pulteney poohpoohed you and your wife pardons armand and dorothea should try to get some rest hello he said of a sudden drawing the creaking waggon to a full stop do you hear something back there oh christ theyve found us lewrie thought in dread he stood facing to the rear they had come more than an english mile lewrie reckoned so he had no fear of being spotted right off there was a lot of forest behind them as he did at sea lewrie opened his mouth and breathed softly cocking his head to either side even above the groan of timbers masts and yards and the hiss of the hull through the sea sound carried quite far even something as faint as the dinging of a watch bell horses lewrie said in a harsh whisper a lot of em jinglin sword scabbards and musketoons bit chains and such or so i recall from my days in the yeoman cavalry sir pulteney opined cavalry at least a troop and a coach too at a fast canter or trot it sounds like lud they fell for it old simenon at the stables pointed them to beauvais possibly rouen as well where major fleury claimed he lived a party being pursued could take a boat at rouen down the seine to the sea and board a packet at le havre let us pray they take that as a betterthanfair proposition once we get to calais though lewrie had to ask losing his dread as the sound of their pursuersif pursuers they truly wereseemed to continue on north and coming no closer or louder along their miserably narrow and rough farm track how do we get aboard a packet ourselves we have no false papers if word gets out for the police and all to be on the lookout for us recall i mentioned that id arranged for a schooner to meet us sir pulteney breezily boasted the former head of our league the greatest of us all has a schooner yacht of his very own and had the eager cooperation of several other merchant masters she will be off one of our old rendezvous coves near cap gris nez to loiter near the shore til we turn up then take us off the beach and away uhm sir pulteney that was ten years ago in the midst of the terror when the frogs werent anywhere near as organised with so many police and guardsmen lewrie pointed out a new nagging dread in his head what also nagged him was that sir pulteney plumb looked on their escape from france as a chance to relive the antics of his youth like alumni during old boys week men of middling age who should know better but would overindulge in the old taverns and haunts and dive into vigourous sports as if they were still not come to their majority one last chance tbe heroic lewrie sarcastically deemed this one last grand adventure with us dead in a ditch if he fails they didnt have nigh a million men under arms back then sir lewrie continued in their army the garde nationale and the police there wasnt a gendarme on every street corner and if there were he was more like the constable at heme bay or a london parish charlie what do we do if even frogs have thave identity papers whip em up on the spot pull em out o yer smallclothes lewrie thought what really gnawed at lewrie thoughand even he would admit itwas that he was so completely out of his depth and not a whit of his competence as a commission sea officer an experienced postcaptain would avail them he was good with a sword a dabhand shot with pistol musket or rifled piece but if it came to using those skills the game was up surrounded and outnumbered at the last resort with his back to some wall and our lives are in the hands of this daft playactin dolt lewrie almost angrily thought good god were dead as mutton listen sir pulteney plumb interjected raising his hand to shush him begad i believe theyve gone on fooled em haw haw not a single word had penetrated the impossible geste was yet alive in his mind the game was still afoot fourchette and his party with capitaine aulards light horse troop reached the gates of beauvais round midnight even the skilled riders thighs chafed their legs shudderyweak and their fundaments saddlesore their horses were certainly played out by then capable of only a plodding headdown walk lathered with sweat and reeking of ammonia men swayed in their saddles barely able to keep their eyes open their balance astride and some once the pace slackened had nodded off completely trusting their horse to follow its fellows and keep its feet beauvais was a fairly large town a garrison town and with so many roads passing through it there were watchmen posted at its portes day and night at one time before the peace of amiens napoleon bonaparte had contemplated an invasion of southern england cross the channel so the town had been mindful of spies as the lead elements of the armies had started to assemble before it was called off beauvaiss authorities might have slackened their watchfulness after that but that did not mean that they had let their guard down completely yet with all that watchfulness at the city gates there was no sign of a twohorse farm waggon with four occupants no msieur fleury and family declaring himself at the southern gate and after checking with the towns constabulary no one of that name or description noted in the registries at any of the towns overnight lodgings no concierge could report any fleurys taking an appartement no landlord hastily wakened knew of anyone suddenly leasing a house at such a late hour we would have caught up with them if they were ahead of us on the road major clary sleepily muttered over a welcome cup of coffee as he slumped exhausted on his elbows at a rough plank table in the inn at which they had retired ergo they never were on the beauvais road another gooseegg messieurs un zйro that damned villageois that pйquenot stableman either he is in league with them or hes an idiot guillaume choundas accused as he sat on a padded chair nearby his hand clawed round a brandy glass a few hours on horseback even most of the day and night at ease in a comfortable carriage had caused him even more pain than it had the others his ironbraced leg throbbed his abused bottom was between numbness and muscle spasms and the cool damp night air even made his ravaged faces nerves now and then spike with knifelike pain forcing him to set down the glass and reach up to soothe it someone should ride back there and have the fool arrested tortured til he talks he told us only what he was told charitй de guilleri numbly mumbled over her own cup of coffee his sort is too dense to lie too much the ox to be curious or risk his life for another her first bleak year spent with her distant relations in the village of rambouillet had shown charitй the dimness of rustique french people this tavern had been about ready to shut its doors for the night when their party had clattered up demanding hot food spirits and lodgings the tavernier and his barman cook and waiters now kept far past their bedtimes clattered clomped and silently sulked and sneered as only frenchmen can while the hot meal was prepared its arrival was delayed by the excuse that the cookfire had ebbed and even though the interlopers accepted the quickly doubled prices and willingly paid in gold franc coins their party was still unwelcome the door to the street opened and matthieu fourchette and capitaine aulard clomped in the cavalryman looking exhausted and fourchette looking grim fourchette ordered brandy at the tincovered bar counter aulard opting for a mug of beer before they came to the table to join their compatriots and slouch in matching manner the colonel of the local regiment the idle timeserver fourchette spat after a deep draught of brandy he finally allowed us audience after more than half an hour fourchette swiped impatiently at the hair that had fallen over his face it was only after we declared our mission was ordered by the first consul that he got out of bed so we start out at once major clary asked no mon cher major we start at dawn fourchette said with a snarl hes sending riders to rouen amiens le havre and dieppe as we speak but will not send out his troops til the sun is up we do get remounts and he did offer my men use of the barracks for the night aulard sleepily told them that is something i suppose when he lifted his beer mug his hand shook with tiredness such bourgeois shopkeepers and clockwatchers would have lost their heads a few years ago guillaume choundas told them with relish in his heyday during the terror hed sent more than his share from his own navy to such a fate and looked as if hed be delighted to see a few more heads tumble into the bloody basket perhaps a report should be sent to bonaparte fourchette to encourage the others oh for gods sake fourchette said with a weary groan i may lose mine if we fail not you you where will the good colonel send his patrols msieur major clary said his mind still sharp even at that hour we did not catch up with them because as i was telling the others they were never on the beauvais road they did not come to beauvais perhaps did not ever have the intention of risking discovery at the gates yet there are dozens of farm lanes and unmapped tracks they turned off somewhere along the way east or west to skirt beauvais and proceed to rouen or le havre it seems to me that even if the entire regiment turns out and is split into files of only ten or fifteen men it will be impossible to scour all of the lanes and all the while those we seek will make their way to the coast in disguise assuming we are not following another false lead denis is right charitй sleepily mourned and if so many search parties are sent out how will any of them be able to recognise the lewries there are only four of us who know what lewrie and his wife look like are we to dash from one patrol to the next is half of france to be arrested til we can arrive and sort through them if that is what it takes yes guillaume choundas demanded even given your coach msieur you could not dash after a lame snail fourchette angrily scoffed or a batch of escargot in garlic sauce hed had more than enough of this bitter old cripple his continual bloodthirsty eagerness and more to the point choundass snide and cutting comments which galled sore fourchette shut his eyes for a long moment half nodding as he contemplated what fouchй would do when he reported back to paris the guillotine was no longer out in the public square but it still was in operation it very well may be your head as you say fourchette the old ogre shot back in a soft coo i will be delighted to see that if i cannot have lewrie perhaps i will have you for letting him escape yet choundas continued after a moment consider that he is a sailor hein we know he flees to the coast but perhaps not to a seaport there is no point in galloping down every narrow country road when we should be concentrating on the beaches the inlets and the lonely coves is france not on guard against threats coming from the sea we let them run major clary understood quickly imagining that they elude us perhaps they become careless or too confident but all the time we double the patrols at the coast and they will eventually have to take passage hire a fishing smack or steal a boat from somewhere the locals could arrest them til we do arrive and sort them out as you say mademoiselle charitй does that mean i can go to bed capitaine aulard whispered from le havre to calais the entire coast choundas insisted like frightened gnats they will fly buzzbuzzbuzz unsuspecting into our sticky web where the spider will bind them tightly and suck them dry choundas happily conjured looking like a beast having a blissful orgasm so much did he like his fantasy even the jaded fourchette felt a shiver up his spine oui i dare say we can all go to bed and get a decent rest at last major clary told aulard at dawn we tell the good colonel to send out more riders to alert the coastal garrisons and police it may still be necessary to scour the immediate area round beauvais but if they travel all night without pausing they may be too far away for an exhaustive search hereabouts to matter very much the only question is where do we place ourselves along the coast to organise the search rouen amiens they landed at calais charitй suggested perking up no matter how weary she was how much of france do they know how to travel the soup a surly waiter growled as he set his tray down atop the rough table bowls slopping onto the tray he dealt them out with a glower on his face bon appйtit he said offhandedly making that sound more like a curse hot potato soup aha fourchette cheered quickly spooning up a taste rouen amiens we can decide in the morning hй garзon can we get some good wine chapter twentyeight they got beyond montdidier by farm roads as the unhappy fleury family then the plumbs altered their disguises to those of a pair of old crones sir pulteney doing a remarkable imitation of a woman for a whole day whilst alan and caroline hid in the waggon bed under an even larger pile of pilfered straw in that guise they crossed the river somme then let the lewries emerge for another set of costumes and aliases the way sir pulteney and lady imogene preened giggled and congratulated each other really began to cut raw with lewrie sir pulteney became msieur andrй guyot a garrulous somewhat simple and greyhaired merry andrew with but a muted version of his inane donkeybray laugh no longer in need of a cane himself tthe bone and he dont have tact lewrie thought of that persona might we mention that lewrie by this time was becoming a touch surly lady imogene became madame hortense

mdear lady imogene gushed as they studied themselves in a hand mirror and so distinguishedlooking be pullin rabbits out o his hat next lewrie told himself now they were in artois and picardy so close to the border of the former austrian netherlands and the dead holy roman empire which after would become belgium sir pulteney thought it made sense for the lewries to portray the guyots manservant and maid flemings or walloons halfgerman really hired from cross the border years before lewrie became a flaxen blond in neat but worn brown woolen ditto caroline became a coppery redhead with her face subtley redone to pinkyraw cheeks and chin again their poor french could be explained by their supposed origins and in flanders ricardy and in artois no one gave a tinkers dam or the slightest bit of notice to crude flemish or walloon folkas bad as so many germans to them sir pulteney allowed his goosebrained self to be cheated most sinfully at albert a small town on the road to arras and lille on a solo trip then returned to join them in a wood lot short of the town at the reins of a shabby canvastopped cabriolet with a younger and fresher twohorse team wishing to make a grand entrance in lille he told them as they reloaded the remaining trunks and valises which by then had been reduced to but one valise each and one trunk that held the last disguises sir pulteney decided would be apt when they got to the coast albert to arras the famed woolen industry town but instead of going through it and proceeding on to lille as sir pulteney had told the cabriolets owner they turned off the main road once more and resorted to backroads and farm lanes til striking a major highway near bйthune there they bought oats for the horses bread and wine cheese a baked ham and pair of broiled whole chickens with all the necessities for a midday piquenique along with all the utensils and plates the napkins cork puller and large basket necessary by the looks on the faces of the various vendors by the time they were done sir pulteney and lady imogene had made a distinct impression of a pair of cackling twits so much so sir pulteney whispered once back into the cabriolet that no one would remember their silent servants then they rattled out of bethunй on the st omer road we will find a place to lay up somewhere off the road sir pulteney informed them it will mean sleeping rough tonight then i fear poor msieur guyot will be cheated most horribly when he sells the cabriolet in saint omer haw haw one last change of disguises then were off for the coast begad mdear aint it grand to be in harness again livin by our wits what marvellous sport they dawdled along the road for the better part of the day til the sun began to decline and traffic began to thin a midday meal was taken en route without stopping sliced ham and cheese sandwiches with a mild mustard and pickles and but one bottle of wine shared by all sir pulteney had forgotten to purchase glasses and made quite a dither for their lack japing over how they had to pass that bottle back and forth finally as it drew on toward sunset sir pulteney began peering ahead and to larboard for a place to leave the road muttering over and over sure to be here just about here i remember it well unless theyve gone and cut the woods down now where is it this part of france was looking less promising to lewrie when it came to a place to go to ground it was mostly flat and not very interesting with long gentle slopes that rose only slightly for what seemed miles then fell away for what looked like even more miles and the plowed fields they passed the road bed looked paler as they passed through a land of chalky soil there were drainage ditches to either hand and enough windmills to put lewrie in mind of the dutch coast aha there it is begad sir pulteney crowed at last knew wed stumble cross it sooner or later see it mdear imogene hortense cher andrй mon coeur lady imogene prompted there was a long slow rise to the left what passed for a hill hereabouts thickly covered with forest with the faintest trace of a path where waggons or carts had cut a sketch of a road in white chalky earth it looked so long unused that new grass was growing in the ruts not just the crest of the track and a few seedlings from the forest had even taken root some as high as the belly of the cabriolet sir pulteney drew the coach to a stop stood on the seat to peer up and down the main road then satisfied that there was no one visible for miles sat down and clucked the team up into the woods by the time they had unhitched the horse team and hobbled them it was sunset a rather spectacular one of yellow amber and crimson which made lewrie feel a tad better the days dawn had been a clear one no red in the morning sailor take warning given the febrile goosebrained airs that the plumbs displayed he was about ready to hunt up a rabbits foot or spit and dance about three times counterclockwise for luck there was a spring at the foot of the rise on the western side and they fetched canvas feed bags of water for the horses til they were sated then gave them their oats from the summit of their low rise

better part of the day til the sun began to decline and traffic began to thin a midday meal was taken en route without stopping sliced ham and cheese sandwiches with a mild mustard and pickles and but one bottle of wine shared by all sir pulteney had forgotten to purchase glasses and made quite a dither for their lack japing over how they had to pass that bottle back and forth finally as it drew on toward sunset sir pulteney began peering ahead and to larboard for a place to leave the road muttering over and over sure to be here just about here i remember it well unless theyve gone and cut the woods down now where is it this part of france was looking less promising to lewrie when it came to a place to go to ground it was mostly flat and not very interesting with long gentle slopes that rose only slightly for what seemed miles then fell away for what looked like even more miles and the plowed fields they passed the road bed looked paler as they passed through a land of chalky soil there were drainage ditches to either hand and enough windmills to put lewrie in mind of the dutch coast aha there it is begad sir pulteney crowed at last knew wed stumble cross it sooner or later see it mdear imogene hortense cher andrй mon coeur lady imogene prompted there was a long slow rise to the left what passed for a hill hereabouts thickly covered with forest with the faintest trace of a path where waggons or carts had cut a sketch of a road in white chalky earth it looked so long unused that new grass was growing in the ruts not just the crest of the track and a few seedlings from the forest had even taken root some as high as the belly of the cabriolet sir pulteney drew the coach to a stop stood on the seat to peer up and down the main road then satisfied that there was no one visible for miles sat down and clucked the team up into the woods by the time they had unhitched the horse team and hobbled them it was sunset a rather spectacular one of yellow amber and crimson which made lewrie feel a tad better the days dawn had been a clear one no red in the morning sailor take warning given the febrile goosebrained airs that the plumbs displayed he was about ready to hunt up a rabbits foot or spit and dance about three times counterclockwise for luck there was a spring at the foot of the rise on the western side and they fetched canvas feed bags of water for the horses til they were sated then gave them their oats from the summit of their low rise looking down to the northwest and west lewrie could see quite a long way into the sunset and the land round them seemed but thinly populated there was a village far off and a manor house a mile or two away but in the immediate vicinity there was nothing but empty fields with not even the yelp of a stray dog to disturb the bucolic quiet well put up the bonnet and let the ladies sleep in the cabriolet sir pulteney suggested blanket rolls beneath for us hard ground dews and wee crawling things odds blood what i would give for a straw pallet tonight havent slept rough in ages its a feather mattress for me i tell you they dug a pit and risked a small fire hopefully deep enough in those oldgrowth woods that it would not be seen in companionable fashion they spread blankets to sit on and delved into their basket once more for a cold supper the new bottle of wine that they passed back and forth even proved to be a fairly good cabernet an early rising at dawn sir pulteney mused after jointing a chicken for them all and choosing a thigh for himself eating with his fingers most commonly by the time the shops open pauvre msieur guyot the old addlepate will be selling the coach and team money matters not at this stage just enough to tide us over til we are at one of the coves quel dommage he said with a grin and a little sigh followed by one of his irritating titters of course an utter fool lady imogene said with a fond grin snickering still a fool has his uses and his good points un bouffon a clown will outwit all of rйals all of fouchйs minions no matter how clever they are or think they are that fellow what is his name mdear in charge of the pursuit fourchette sir pulteney said with a guffaw he is named matthieu fourchette my old sources informed me hes been watching the lewries long before the levee and hes reputed to be come again lewrie blurted through a bite of chicken breast were bein chased by a man named fork and theres been people watchin us all that long think ye mightve warned us earlier by now fourchette could be as hot on our trail as he is on yours captain lewrie sir pulteney rejoined though not as famous as the instigator of our league my sobriquet was not unknown to the french authorities in those horrid days who knows perhaps a paper record of the times ten years ago was kept the connexion made from old dossiers and suspicions of my presence in france before the war closed off access for english visitors and the disappearance of the intended victims of the revolution say perhaps i did have a careless moment leaving a note behind as a cheeky taunt or by omission dropping one in haste one intercepted or taken from a collaborator mean tsay you signed yer bloody name lewrie gawped this was getting even more lunatick and he still hadnt gotten an answer to his question about the watchers my insignia rather sir pulteney told them that wee flower at the bottom of the note lady imogene gave me before we left paris do you mean sir pulteney caroline asked a part of a family seal or not so incriminating as a signet ring in wax no mistress lewrie sir pulteney told her with a smile and a bray he sat up straighter as if in pride back then we all had our secret names and signs i was known as the yellow tansy if he was expecting awe rushes of indrawn breath or knowing nods he didnt get them the lewries looked at him like an escapee from bedlam then at each other shrugging at the same time well it was a long time ago mon cher lady imogene said as she patted his thigh to comfort his deflated feelings and it was a secret from everyone wasnt it no mention of the league in the newspapers no thrilling tales written after the fact we laboured in the dark and our successes were their own reward nestce pas mean to say you never heard sir pulteney said crushed not an inkling lewrie rather enjoyed telling him who the hell runs about callin himself the yellow tansy he thought the shadow or somethin spyish aye but mine arse on a bandbox whod even admit tsuch they dont even call race horses at ascot or the derby such silly names the search round beauvais had proved fruitless as fourchette expected and the quickly erected road blocks on all roads leading to rouen had not turned up the fugitives either for a time he had hoped that this mysterious fleury family might appear in le havre or some other seaport and the coastal police or guardsmen might identify them but a rider had come from rouens hфtel de ville according to a census there were several real fleurys living there but all were accounted for and none matched the descriptions they had gathered from mйru again as fourchette dourly expected how i wish that all france was linked by the first consuls semaphore towers the way it was when it was gaul and the romans held us fourchette gloomed at how long messengers took to go back and forth how napoleon protects our coast with those new semaphore towers of his guillaume choundas grumpily pointed out stifling a belch of liquid fire that threatened to sear his throat his digestion had been going bad during his last stint in the west indies and what the amйricains served during his captivity had completed its ruin on his own in his paris hovel and with his miserly excuse for a pension he ate only the blandest cheapest food this hunt after lewrie though and the lavish funds spent on it by fourchettes employer resulted in many hastily eaten meals in foul inns along the way usually ordered by the policeman for all with no individual choice and guaranteed to be piquant and spicy and insults to his stomach and bowels even with final revenge waiting at the end of their road there were times that choundas wished hed stayed home with his tasteless broth some nights when the hunters could take lodgings choundas would spend half the hours that he should have slept in the outback toilettes either squirting liquid and searing his hemorrhoids or groaning in painful bloated inability charitй wasnt enjoying the hunt much either for she had come away from paris imagining that lewrie would be taken no more than two hours outside the city and that she would be home in her chic appartement by dusk she had packed nothing more than a brace of pistols and their accoutrements no valise no tooth powder or brush no spare clothes her one small carry bag held a comb a brush a mirror and a scented face powder and puff and no more than two thousand francs to purchase a meal in celebration after three days she was sure she was as high as the rankest cavalry soldat her one serviceable gown and her single pair of mens breeches were stained with ammonia horse sweat and the stench of wet saddle leather and after the hard use to which their horses had been put both originals and remounts the reek of open and rotting saddle sores the cavalrymans cloak major clary had loaned her against the chill of night rides and one afternoon of sullen rain blown inland from the channel had seen an entire years hard field use on campaign and it too gave off a mйlange of odd odours not a one of them that could be called pleasant either all in all charitй reckoned she had managed to stay cleaner sweeterscented better groomed and a world more stylish aboard one of their pirate schooners in the gulf of mexico and denis could have this glorious soldiers life what you said mamselle charitй fourchette said suddenly leaning intimately towards her at the breakfast table they shared at their lodgings in beauvais a seductive note to his voice and flirtatious glints in his oddly pale eyes how lewrie only knows the roads from calais to paris oui msieur charitй answered put off once more by his continual lusty looks shifting a few centimиtres further away wishing she had a shawl with which to shield herself from his leering gaze calais boulogne dunkerque perhaps even abbeville and dieppe fourchette went on as if amused by the reaction he elicited much closer to england nestce pas on a good day one can see the cliffs of dover from cap gris nez nestce pas i thank you for the suggestion it is so astute of you mamselle you are a treasure indeed he was so obvious that even guillaume choundas snorted in derision you capitaine choundas remind me that lewrie is a sailor fourchette said turning to face that ogre he certainly cannot try to book passage aboard a packet for we watch all departures by now yet is he a good sailor one able to handle a small boat and tell me capitaine how small a boat might he need to sail it himself cross the narrow sea every second day the straits are so boisterous that anyone trying to cross in a small boat would be swamped and drowned and if he managed to get far enough offshore the swift tide race would take him either into the north sea or halfway to le havre before turning choundas was quick to say drawing on his nautical experience which was long and expert choundas paused though his evil swordravaged lips curled in sourness anent the first part of fourchettes question was lewrie a good smallboat man with a crew even choundas had to cede him tactical skill and daring damn him but hed only seen lewrie handle a jollyboat gig launch or cutter on his own once so he did not know his natural hatred of the man made him wish that he could say no yet the british royal navy was a demanding and hard school and lewrie had come up in it successfully choundas could not let him make his escape this time by underestimating him or deprecating him he has spent twenty years in their navy most of that at sea citoyen fourchette choundas slowly and carefully said at last he most certainly can hand reef and steer as they say as good as any matelot if he obtains a boat then he could sail it to england but choundas added holding up his one hand and arm he would need a decentsized boat of at least ten metres length with a single mast a typical fishing boat to survive the crossing in any sort of rough weather such a boat would be hard for one man to handle without help his wife could toss free the dock lines while he could hoist the single lugsail a woman might have the strength to hoist the much smaller jib for him while he mans the tiller your small rowing boat your small ships boat would not avail him such are more likely to be found in the smaller harbours then fourchette asked looking pleased with choundass answers in all harbours citoyen unfortunately choundas told him what if he travels with this mysterious second couple charitй fretted though relieved that fourchette had turned his mind to ideas other than bedding her behind denis clarys back how big a boat can two men handle if the seas are rough as i just said citoyenne de guilleri choundas told her with his mildest manners any boat much larger than ten metres would be too much for two men to handle for two men and two women if we now believe that lewrie and his wife travel with help anything with more than one mast would also be hard for them to sail we can send riders to alert the guard nationale and the local gendarmes to keep a closer watch on such boats and pass word among our fishermen to guard their livelihoods from theft fourchette said hah choundas scoffed with a mirthless laugh you might as well tell them to lock up all the smugglers til weve caught them too fourchette our smugglers who would drown their children for a purse full of coin or the anglais smugglers who come and go as free as the wind and brazenly walk the streets of dunkerque and calais in full view with the winking knowledge of police and customs men how do plotters against the republic enter france or escape back to england like willothewisps on smugglers boats i tell you what of smugglers further down the narrow sea the policeman pressed suddenly unsure of his clever idea our entire coast their entire coast is as infected with smugglers as this inn is full of bedbugs choundas sourly replied in my own brittany in saint malo the heroism and patriotism of my glorious celts is corrupted by the lure of quick money brittany where one may find the bravest most skillful seafarers in all europe since the days of julius caesar and yes yes capitaine as you have told us fourchette said with a wave of his hands ever since this foul creature had joined their expedition they all had been subjected to choundass tales of breton derringdo and pagan myths and sagas more than enough of it this lewrie though stands a better chance from calais and dunkerque he does choundas sulkily said nettled that no one would appreciate his peoples glories then we shift to the calais coast fourchette decided god charitй softly groaned not looking forward to another long hard ride on a reeking horse in her reeking clothes we will coach to calais mademoiselle fourchette informed her once there in more comfortable lodgings we will wait for the quarry to come to us instead of haring all over france as we have and i think that minister fouchй would not deny us clean clothing barbers or hair dressers nestce pas it will be my treat to reward your cleverness ma chйrie oh gag me charitй thought ill owe him gratitude a debt the ladies went off deeper into the woods atop their rise just before bedtime a last moment of modesty sir pulteney plumb produced a pint bottle from a side pocket of his coat pulled the cork and had a brief taste then waved it to draw lewrie downslope northwest once more will you partake captain lewrie as we give our good ladies a touch more privacy what not a bad tipple does one prefer apples to grapes so near normandy their calvados an apple brandy is easy to find he handed the bottle over to lewrie then tended to his trouser buttons for his own ease mmm tasty lewrie had to agree after a taste whilst were here sir in private so we do not alarm the womenfolk there is something that has been nagging at me this past day or so plumb hesitantly began him worried bout somethin at this late stage how far up shits creek are we then for him tlook worried lewrie cringed since crossing the thйrain river no one has given us even the slightest lookingover sir pulteney said sounding fretful and sombre what i took for success at eluding them may have been that they have guessed our final objective the coast and the seaports and have set watchers in place so we stumble into their spiderwebs oh just bloody grand lewrie sourly thought ye didnt think they wouldnt he took a goodly slug of the calvados before he gave in to the urge to curse loudly theyll guard the crosschannel packets the goodsized boats we could steal lewrie said but we aint plannin tsail ourselves over are we your schooner waitin off some beach ttake us off like you told me right we do have a plan hey of course captain lewrie sir pulteney was quick to assure him perhaps reassure himself on that head theres the very place i had in mind a very lonely wee beach where we may hide in a maze of rocks above a small inlet til the schooner arrives used it in the past though though lewrie felt like screeching ten years ago it was totally abandoned sir pulteney said in reverie there were some fishermens shacks atop the cliffs and the path down so steep and convoluted that hardly anyone even knew there was a shallow inlet and a beach at the foot of it the shacks were falling in on themselves unused for years as well and did a lone gendarme happen by and see activity what could one man do with help miles away at the next post then at any rate but as you say the french have thousands more police and army patrols now and now i can cannot say with any certainty whether it is unhabited still just bloody fuckin great lewrie gawped you clueless id thought to take a look at the place for old times sake but imogene wished to get on to paris so i didnt plumb lamented neither of us is quite as eager to forego our comforts as we did in our headier days dye see yet who could have expected a visit to be necessary he added to excuse himself well you couldnt have known lewrie said sighing heavily to the reality and taking another deep gulp of calvados youll get us killed for the lack of it though you henheaded he thought once weve donned our last disguises and gotten a new form of transport in saint orner i must leave the three of you somewhere safe and make a reconnaissance on my own before committing us to its use sir pulteney decided aloud waving a hand for the bottle as if in need of dutch courage himself in a very humble costume haw haw hope it aint clowns or mimes lewrie gloomed so close to the sea what better way to blend in than to play the part of common sailors plumb said with a clever little heehaw i trust our ladies will not be scandalised to become sailors doxies sailors and doxies is it lewrie thought no sailor is authentic without a good knife no doxy without a wee pistol up her skirts we get to saintomer safe the last o my moneys goin for weapons chapter twentynine plumb drove alone to st omer to dispose of the cabriolet and their last nowempty trunk and leather valises getting what he could for them he came back on foot this time with a canvas seabag partially filled with something and changed his clothes and appearance to match their own caroline and lady imogene had changed in the meantime to voluminous peasant skirts with hems high enough to show a bit of ankles clunky buckled shoes and a froth of lace they wore rough ecru blouses with beribboned and embroidered peasant vests over them topped with tawdry shawls and hats caroline kept her copperyred wig whilst lady imogene went for frizzy dishwater blond sir pulteney and lewrie wore tattered and dingy oldstyle sloptrousers the legs so loose and baggy and ending just below the knees plain cotton stockings to hide gentlemanly legs that had not been bronzed by the sun their feet crammed into buckle shoes as well sailors of any nation were proud to be wellshod when ashore itchy fishing smocks atop striped pullover singletons completed their disguises as did the tasseled red jacobin liberty caps proper to good french revolutionaries the fact that they hadnt shaved in few days helped with versimilitude though lewrie thought sir pulteneys eyepatch was a bit much they walked into st omer on shanks ponies to do the last shopping and to purchase a rickety twowheel cart and a lone older nag to pull it the plumbs took the front bench together whilst the lewries lolled in the rear using seabags for bolsters and to make their disguises even more believable all made an open show of wine or brandy bottles tobacco in the form of cigarros or blunt pipes and an air of merriment on their slow way north out of stomer the plumbs quickly taught them some semidrunken songs to sing should the need arise when confronted by a patrol it was disconcerting though to see how many cavalry patrols there were on the road that morning almost every hour a file of ten or more troopers would come cantering south from the sea or another file would go past towards calais but only now and then stopping the rare coachandfour or the larger public conveyances the cavalrymen might look them over as their cart slowly plodded up the road mostly to ogle lady imogene or caroline and make lewd suggestive japes to them but lewrie had to hand it to lady imogene for she could hurl insults and gutterfrench right back at them insulting their manhoods in a way that made the troopers guffaw not get angry then canter on each time lewries stomach did back flips and a handstand his mouth turned dry which only another tipsy swallow of wine could assuage and his nutmegs did their shrinking act even as he swayed and scowled at the cavalrymen striving for pieeyed innocence the slightly soberer and more fluent sir pulteney always told them that he and his mate were bound for calais to find a ship since theyd spent the last of their previous voyages pay and amazingly every patrol no matter how suspicious had taken that as gospel and ridden on and so it went hour by slow hour mile by plodding mile each fetching them that much closer to the coast the sea and to the fishermans hut the inlet and beach and freedom love what yeve done with yer face lewrie told caroline as the afternoon wore on and they finished off the last of the chicken ham and bread lady imogene had tarted them both up with the sort of heavy makeup no respectable lady of worth would employ red lips kohloutlined eyes palepowdered faces and too much rouge and yer stockings lewrie added caroline had her skirts up halfway to her knees displaying blueandblack horizontally banded hose she flicked her skirt down quickly arr does yer warnt a lil tumble roight ere in th cart missie he teased in imitation of a british tar give a shillin i will fer a bit o sport har har she tossed a chicken bone at him grinning as she plucked some meat from a breast and chewed looking impish for a rare moment she held out a strip for him to chew he took it though chicken breasts were not as moist and tasty as dark meat playing a drunken sailor and the many nips at a bottle to make that plausible had made him hungry more coming from behind sir pul henri caroline warned recalling plumbs new alias a lot of them the plumbs went into their drunken singing swaying and bottlewaving in time to their tune christ shit on a biscuit lewrie yelped as he looked astern at the party that was rapidly gaining on them mine arse on a bandbox grope me caroline lay down and paw me for our lives its that de guilleri bitch and that chasseur major we met at bonapartes levee theyll know us sure as fate if caroline fell on her back and pulled him half over her arms round his neck to hide his face one thigh lifted to stroke down his thigh it was a lazy kiss a sleepy one twixt two people too foxed to couple lewrie shut his eyes tight with the inane thought that if he couldnt see charitй de guilleri she couldnt see him rapid clops of hooves coming closer the chink of bit chains and metal scabbards the squeak of saddle leather a lot of horses then the hiss and creak of a carriages wheels and suspension to boot and they were slowing down reining back to look them over hй des matelots ivres et leur putains someone said dismissively so close that lewrie could imagine that he had leaned over close enough to smell the fellows garlicky breath drunk sailors and their whores damned right we are so sod the fuck off lewrie thought in panic hй capitaine choundas another mocked are these some of your heroic celtic or breton seafarers hein choundas gawd lewrie thought ready to squeak in stark terror him too whered they find him floatin facedown in the seine there was a slow palaver twixt sir pulteneyhenriand the leader of the mounted party intent questions from one and drunken mumbles from the other whatever was said what little lewrie could glean from their french he hadnt a clue he fully expected a rough hand on his shoulder tearing him away to face them then caroline turned her face to his tucking under his shoulder to hide her own identity while he pretended to lamely nuzzle her neck his own face hidden in her red wig wondering if his own black oned stay in place and trying manful not to sneeze merde said the leader adieu allons vite mes amis the clop of hooves picked up the pace from a slow walk to a canter the carriage rattled past and the plumbs took up their mumbling song once more as their pursuers diminished on the road north you erm know one of them captain lewrie sir pulteney asked once it was safe to speak in english again a de guilleri the girl with em lewrie muttered cautiously sitting up to look beneath the carts drivers bench at the departing party shot me once in louisiana and if there was a crippled monster with a mask on his face and but one good arm then aye i do hes named guillaume choundas and im the one who maimed him several times known him since the far east in eightyfour the med ten years later and the west indies in ninetyeight one of the most disgusting creatures ever i laid eyes upon lady imogene said with a delayed shudder how many of them were there lewrie asked daring to sit up all the way a whole troop of green chasseurs sir pulteney told him an open carriage for the ogre a major and a captain of cavalry and the young woman and their leader a foxfaced lankhaired fellow him i must imagine to be the very matthieu fourchette i mentioned to you last evening haw haw zounds odds blood but weve just fooled the very people sent to catch you captain lewrie how glorious there he goes again lewrie sourly thought and just who is that de guilleri bitch to you alan she shot you once caroline asked sounding very huffy and hard one may only imagine the why you knew her before we encountered her at the levee oh merciful shit lewrie quailed in alarm just when i think im back in her good books the plumbs shared a worldlywise look sure that it was none of their business but fourchette had been free with official funds at beauvais they improved their cleanliness and comfort and hired coaches and teams to take them to amiens where hed spent even more capitaine aulards cavalrymen had gone back to paris but theyd picked up a troop of chasseurs at amiens and denis clary had been delighted to don a borrowed uniform and once more be a complete soldier charitй had picked up a few new serviceable gowns a fresh pair of breeches to allow her to straddle a horse not perch daintily sidesaddle and fill a pair of saddlebags with not only fresh necessities but a few luxuries as well from amiens on though they had set a furious pace as rapid and demanding as the first dash from paris to the oise to reach the coast set a temporary headquarters in calais and coordinate with the gendarmerie and the local national guard garrisons so intent was the police agent fourchette to get there that they performed only a cursory inspection of travellers on the road to calais trusting to the alerted cavalry patrols to nab any suspicious people matching the descriptions they had sent ahead by despatch riders fourchette and his party had to depend on the vigilance of the local authorities they could not be everywhere on every road or at every town gate to spot their quarry it was only after they had taken brief lodgings at an inn at calais and fourchette had bustled himself importantly to the hфtel de ville the chasseur troop had taken over a livery to see to the horses and obtain lashings of wine by fair methods or foul and that beast choundas had painfully crookedly limped off to the outhouse to ease his flaming bowels that major clary finally had an idle hour to spend in private with charitй why you ma chйrie he posed over a welcome glass of wine on the inns opensided gallery as a soft warm breeze redolent of fish and kelp and salt blew in from the sea you knew this man before i suspect not from one brief introduction in paris what is he to you she turned away eyes closed in weariness and her face to the aromas of the breeze she did not answer him why did fouchй insist that you come on this chase denis went on or was it you who insisted that you be included denis mon cher she warned him her lovely face stern no i must know at last clary insisted we both know that the anglais gave no real insult to the first consul he was not the assassin fouchй suspected either yet we chase after him and will drag him back to paris in chains and you seem to have such personal interest in being here in the pursuit as if you have cause to hate him i must know charitй he killed my brothers my cousin denis charitй snapped in sudden venom turning to face him he chased us down to grand isle in barataria bay and his frigate destroyed everything and everyone he ruined it all he destroyed all hopes of taking louisiana back from spain and for that i despise him i had a chance to kill him once and i failed i thought i shot him full in the chest with a miserable airrifle but by all thats unholy he lived all right happy now and you took advantage of fouchй so you could kill him at last charitй major clary surprised her by speaking softly with understanding as if in sympathy is that what you wish ma chйrie to see him dead the way that hideux choundas wishes him dead yes i wish to see him dead charitй spilled out in rage he owes me blood he came to new orleans in disguise to deceive to spy and find all about our plans our force he denis clary leaned back a little his face harder as he realised just who had been deceived in new orleans and surmised how this girl had been beguiled so were to murder him denis clary whispered and what of his wife we must shoot her too the mysterious couple that they travel with leave no witnesses that is what fourchette was told denis charitй de guilleri confessed with a bitter laugh you heard him speak of it before so do not pretend that you are here unwittingly he is a dangerous enemy of france and you are a distinguished patriotic soldier of france it will be your duty i will gladly obey orders to fight charitй clary objected his chin up i will happily shed a foes blood in the heat of battle but this i already feel slimed mademoiselle dear as i hold you in my heart he trailed off distancing himself with the formal address and suddenly feeling very sad and badly betrayed perhaps charitй relented feeling a chill under her heart that she might lose him after such a wonderful whirlwind beginning perhaps you do not have to take an active hand denis mon cher but my revenge and the first consuls revenge must be fulfilled ah the cooing little lovebirds fourchette exclaimed in glee as he breezed back into their inn coming to the table to pour himself a glass of wine not waiting for permission and where is that ugly old cowhide choundas dying in les chiottes again hein its no matter ive lit a fire hot enough under our local soldiers and police for the night so we will split our party each of us to go with five or six troopers to cover the city gates and the roads to boulogne dunkerque and saint omer if we can reach the coast by now then so can our quarry i have a feeling about tonight eat a hearty meal and then well be about it fourchette sat himself down a bit away from their table taking another sip of wine and savouring the lateafternoon sea winds hiding a grin as he shrewdly took note of the stiff and uncomfortable postures and the silence between the girl and her soldier not as fond of each other as theyd been when i left bon more hope for me fourchette thought chapter thirty sir pulteney left them at a foetid inn a mile or so short of the sea so old and begrimed that they were afraid even to speculate what simmered in the large iron pot over the fire in the hearth settling instead for bread cheese and sour wine over which they could linger til his return from his reconnaissance the two bentbacked old prunefaced hags and the one whitewhiskered old man who supposedly ran the place must have a fiddle on the side lewrie thought for in the hour or longer that they sat there coughing in silence over their food in lowhanging haze of smoke from the fire they were the only three customers lady imogene whispered that they had used the inn as a waystation long ago and it appeared that the owners had not scrubbed the bare wood of the table top in all that time at last the door leaning at an angle on loose leather hasps creaked open the bottom screeching on the wood floor as sir pulteney in his oneeyed piratical sailors disguise slouched in to join them he upturned a somewhat clean glass to pour himself some wine used a sailors sheath knife to cut himself some bread and cheese and dropped a silver coin on the table for his fee that untrustworthy anglais smuggler is not coming plumb or as he preferred henri growled well in character talking through his food in raspythroated french we might as well go on into calais there are others who might be interested in our goods hein the old whiskered man came to collect the coin and bend an ear to the conversation for a moment we are full bon we go they had left the twowheeled cart and the weary horse in the side yard still grumbling about the perfidy of any anglais goddamn or sanglant in business or anything else sir pulteney climbed up to take the reins leaving lady imogene to clamber aboard on her own still in character the lewries took their place at the tailboard as he clucked the horse to a slow plod once more and the cart creaked off into the night for a late summer night it was cool with a soft wind wafting off the channel cool enough to make lewrie shiver as his shoes dangled a foot or so above the road caroline was huddled into her shawl her arms crossedfor warmth lewrie hoped since he had blabbed the name of charitй de guilleri that afternoon and had then had to explain how she and her kin had gone pirating in the west indies and how hed ended themhow the girl had shot himleaving out the bawdy parts of course caroline had acted very coolly towards him rightly suspecting that there was a lot more to the tale he put an arm round her shoulders to warm her up and adjust her shawl but she shrugged him off with a muchputupon bitter sigh they came to a turning another of those faint tracks within sight of the lights of calais before the crossroads of the eastwest boulognedunkerque road and their former st omercalais road this jolting grass and gorsestrewn track led west parallel to the main road and lewrie wondered how sir pulteney could even see it in the dark a mile or so more and the track bent northwards after a time spent in low windsculpted trees and bushes well rejoin the road to boulogne soon sir pulteney told them in a harsh whisper missing any crossroads where patrols might be what a mile and a bit more and well be just above the cove and stap me if it still aint occupied they had to get off the cart and almost drag it and the horse through a shallow ditch that ran alongside the boulogne road calming the skitterish old horse til it was back on solid ground then boarded their cart for the last leg here sir pulteney cried at last drawing reins fetch out your things and were off begad they alit and plumb looped reins loose and slapped the old horse on the rump to send it plodding down the road on its own this way smartly now they stumbled over uneven clumps of grass small bushes and a field of halfburied rocks at first on the level then gradually on a downslope northwards cape gris nez old grey nose stood high to their right barely made out in starlight and the hint of a moonrise yes ahead of them loomed a black swaybacked mass that hut that sir pulteney had mentioned crumbling slowly into ruin its roof halfcollapsed and its low front and back doors seemingly no higher than lewries breastbone and the jambs leaning at crazed angles a bit beyond the coast was a darker mass erose and bumpylooking to either hand but for a notch a little to their right backlit by some lighter something that seemed to stir and glitter in the starlight the channel lewrie exclaimed as loud as he dared the sea and for the first time since their harumscarum odyssey had started he felt a surge of confidence he was within reach of his proper milieu matthieu fourchette and five chasseur troopers sat their horses at the crossroad where the eastwest highway met the st omer road about a mile before the porte of calais with fourchette showing a lot more impatience than the bemused softly chatting cavalrymen he could hear a horse approaching from the south taking a damnably slow pace one that almost made him spur out to meet it at last a rider emerged from the dark a gendarme see anyone on the saint omer road fourchette demanded no one msieur the fellow said making a sketchy salute to him it is very quiet nothing moving this time of night even the jolly hound tavern had only a few patrons tonight god help them if they ate there though hawn hawn he added with a laugh what sort of patrons did you enquire fourchette pressed only two sailors and their whores the innkeeper reported to me the local gendarme easily related smiling most likely they were smugglers looking for a ship msieur the jolly hound is one of the regular rendezvous points for smuggling dealings we keep a wary eye on it i assure you msieur the innkeeper said that the older one a gars with an eyepatch told the others that some anglais smuggler didnt come as agreed so they would go into calais and try someone else they had a twowheeled horse cart they should have passed here msieur so surely youhave four people two couples in a cart fourchette said with a frown shifting his sore bottom on his damp saddle two sailors and two women one with an eyepatch you say oui msieur the gendarme told him one woman with copperyred hair one fellow with black hair much younger with a scar down his cheek we passed them on the road south of here this afternoon the frustrated police agent muttered half to himself drunk as aristos and a scar mademoiselle de guilleri said that lewrie had a scar a faint one but youre sure the innkeeper heard them say they would go to calais certainement msieur the gendarme said mystified yet they didnt fourchette spat thinking hard two couples four anglais had dined together at pontoise then coached together disappearing from the face of the earth it seemed two couples had supped at mйru major fleury his wife and widowed daughterinlaw and a bandaged son the watchers on the somme bridge had noted four welldressed people though oddly travelling in a hay waggon going to arras and morbleu disguises fourchette yelped realising how gulled hed been a whole set of disguises the two sailors and their women they are the ones we seek if they didnt come through this crossroads then they must be either east or west of us this very instant the criminals we seek are disguised msieur the gendarme gawped if they change again how can we ever trooper fourchette snapped at the nearest cavalryman ride to major clary and his party and bring them here at once his burst of sudden energy made his horse fractious beginning to circle you ride the other direction where we left mademoiselle and bring her here and you he ordered in a rush fetch that ugly thing choundas and his party we have need of all our men theyre looking for a smuggler to take them cross the narrow sea but not in calais itself someplace along the coast gendarme you know this coast well what of side roads farm lanes that lead round calais there are some msieur the local gendarme replied his own horse beginning to rear and arch we my unit and i know almost all of them i should ride to fetch my officer and more men to be your guides he asked eager to please this fellow from the splendours of paris and surely a man of great importance go go go vite vite i will wait for you here make haste for the love of god though fourchette demanded in a lather poor as this lead was and as slim a hope there was still a chance that the enigmatic foursome would be in his hands before daylight they paused briefly at the tumbledown fishermans hut to take a breath kneeling by its back side it was a rough log structure reenforced with scrap lumber and driftwood from the beaches it looked and smelled as if it had been a decade since anyone had even attempted to make use of it or maintain it sir pulteney dug into his seabag and pulled out a battered old brass hooded lanthorn and a flintlock tinderbox remain here and rest ladies whilst captain lewrie and i head down to the cliffs for a little looksee sir pulteney said in a harsh whisper though cackling to himself in his old manner they scampered bent over at the waist as if dashing through a volley of fire til they reached the edge of the cliffs to the left of a deep axedout notch that led down to the channel a deep hidden inlet and a rockguarded sand beach lewrie looked back and realised that the abandoned fishermans hut was below the long slope from their highway above and was invisible to any but the most intent searchers following the boulogne road whoever fished from here he mostlike broke his damnfool neck lewrie thought espying a zigzag path down from the notch through a maze of boulders to the beach had the last tenant kept a cockleshell boat drawn up above high tide down there he wondered or was he a simple caster of nets youve keen eyes captain lewrie sir pulteney asked fear mine own are of an age but might there be a schooner out yonder i think theres a vessel of some kind but its hard for me to make out if youd be so kind lewrie lifted his eyes to the vague horizon the moon was rising at last that orb waxed half full spreading faint blue light on the channel waters illuminating the white chalk cliffs of dover far to the north twelve or so odd miles away only so close yet lewrie cupped his hands round his eyes and strained to scan the sea quartering near then closer wait he hissed aye there is something out yonder i think there was an eerie spectral blotch of pale grey about three or fourmiles offshore a ship of some kind two trapezoids like twin foreandaft gaffhung sails there was a smaller thinner shape that might be asingle jib to the right of the trapezoid shapes so she was making a long slow board eastrd upchannel aye theres something much like a schooner he said at last but it could be a smugglers boat puttin in to calais a frenchie or even one of their navys chassemarйes lookin for smugglers no he said on second thought chassemarйes had a short mizen right aft he recalled was it an innocent fishing boat making a long night trawl to be first to the market come daybreak we must have faith captain lewrie sir pulteney said with rising enthusiasm as he fluffed the lint in the tinderbox cocked the firelock and pulled the trigger on his third try sparks took light in the lint which he carefully coaxed with his breath into a fire that caught in the oily rag which began to glow with dark amber which yet another breath turned to a flame he opened the lanthorn and applied the rag to an oily wick which at last flared up zounds sir pulteney crowed standing erect holding up his lanthorn and waving it to and fro for a bit then he turned it round so the closed back side faced the sea rapidly rotating it back and forth he sent some signal known only to him and one of his old conspirators then lifted it high once more the glasspaned side facing outwards begad sir odds life will you look at that sir pulteney yelped almost leaping in joy as a tiny glim aboard that vessel leapt to life and began to flash a slow reply in a series of rotations much like sir pulteneys its our schooner captain lewrie he has seen us and if god is just we shall be away before the dawn let us go gather our ladies and make our way down to the beach haw haw major clary charitй de guilleri and guillaume choundas had responded to fourchettes urgent summons to join him at the crossroads choundas in such bilious haste that hed demanded a chasseur to carry him behind his saddle no matter how painful it was now he was incredulous and raging costumes disguises pah he bleated are we chasing phantoms chimeras the comйdie franзaise he snarled as fourchettes suspicions were laid out this lewrie salaud was bandaged at mйru most likely dismissed at the somme bridge and groping a redheaded whore in the back of the cart this afternoon and we never thought to ask to see his face but he showed his face at a smugglers inn and he had a faint scar they tried to find a smuggler to take them over to england but they didnt they didnt enter calais or pass this crossroad fourchette told them all you did not see two sailors and two whores in a cart on the dunkerque road major clary then we must admit that the older man of their party has an intimate knowledge of farm lanes and back roads from here to paris and that they are very near us this moment and desperate for passage we almost he was interrupted by a lone rider coming from the west up the road from boulogne qui va lа the rider called out nervously as he caught a glimpse of their large party police a capitaine vignon commander of the local gendarmes barked back who are you damn you oh there you are capitaine it is i gendarme bossuett the rider said spurring up to them and reslinging his short musketoon evidently the threat of dangerous fleeing felons aristo conspirators or cutthroat smugglers had made him edgy report immediately capitaine vignon snapped pardon capitaine but one cannot be too careful tonight with so many the gendarme began with a relieved chuckle have you seen anyone on the boulogne road two sailors and two women in a onehorse cart fourchette pressed him ive seen no one msieur citoyen the gendarme said in confusion as to the proper form of address to use but there is a twowheeled cart abandoned about a league back just grazing along with the reins i thought it rather zut alors putain we have them fourchette cursed crowing with glee they did find a smuggler to carry them away from some beach along the road allez allez vite at the gallop where they left the cart they cannot be far from it on foot despite the faint moon and starlight fourchette spurred into a reckless gallop leading the party of soldiers and police at a furious pace choundas whimpered and howled with pain clinging desperately to his troopers back music to fourchettes ears as it was to clary and charitй as well once they were over the edge of the cliff the path down to the beach was not quite as steep as lewrie feared though it wound like a snake round large coachsized boulders in some places so snug between that he had to turn sideways and puff out his breath to squeeze through at other points the flinty earth gravel and loose soil crunched and tumbled as soon as he set foot upon it in the steepest stretches someone had long ago used pick and shovel to carve out rough steps down to flatter ledges before another uncertain descent now below the line of the cliffs and unable to be seen by any watchers along the road sir pulteney kept the lanthorn lit and open to hasten their progress and to light the ladies way thank god our last disguises called for stout old shoes not slippers lady imogene whispered between deep breaths halfway down lewrie told himself helping caroline down a set of steps then looking out to sea again that schooner was the one sir pulteney had arranged by god after that mysterious signal it had hauled its wind and come about to approach the coast and their notchlike inlet and cove she was not more than two miles off now and cautiously slanting shoreward with a large rowing boat in tow astern and dare he imagine that it was already being led round to the schooners larboard entryport not much further not much longer all sir pulteney crowed as they reached the last of the boulders and a faint solid path down through a dangerous scree slope where the going was all gravel flat shards and fistsized rock where ankles could be turned bones broken and skulls smashed in an eyeblink if the way slid in an avalanche there theres the cart major denis clary cried pointing to the west caught up in the chase despite his misgivings as he caught sight of the weary horse trying to feed on the spotty dry weeds and shrubs by the landward side of the road the cart was crosswise upon the road and the poor horse was fortunate that the cart had not gone into one of the ditches they drew rein short of the cart is this about where it was first discovered fourchette demanded wheeling his mount to search for that sluggard dimwit gendarme whod found it speak up you he wasnt much of a horseman so it took the gendarme some time to thread his way through the others uhm near here msieur when i first came across it it was on the right side of the road back near a little cart track uhm show us fourchette ordered impatiently at the walk they had to retrace their way about two hundred metres east til the gendarme at last pointed to two faint ruts in the poor vegetation it was here i saw it msieur the gendarme told him by this path to the old hut the one down there msieur and you did not think to explore the hut capt vignon snapped by myself capitaine against four dangerous criminals non i rode for reenforcements to raise the alarm what about the hut fourchette asked vignon quickly informed him that it had been abandoned for a decade or better caving in upon itself and is there a beach down there below the bluffs msieur oui there is a beach a small one vignon said and there is a path down to it but this useless simpleton dismount everyone and arm yourselves fourchette cried we must inspect the hut find the path and look for them they are here i know it i feel it choundas insisted that his chasseur stay mounted and take him to the edge of the cliffs at once as armed troopers and policemen crept down the slope to surround the hut as torches or lanthorns were lit to aid the search charitй kneed her mount to follow choundas and major clary fearing for her safety on the cliff edge below the hut where their quarry might shoot at her before the troopers cleared it trotted his own horse after her urging her to wait in a harsh whisper to which she paid no heed shed drawn one of her longbarrelled pistols intent on her revenge as intent as that twisted monster choundas reached the edge of the bluff first his cavalryman drew rein with a gasp and fumbled for his scabbarded musketoon one instant later charitй came up alongside him here down here choundas cried in a feral rasp there is a schooner a boat they are here come quickly charitй used her reinhands wrist to draw her pistol to full cock even though the range was far too great and pulled the trigger chapter thirtyone oh christ on a crutch lewrie groaned as he heard the shot and the view halloo from the top of the cliffs they had been discovered and the rowing boat was still a halfmile offshore and they werent yet on the beach this be close as dammit sir such language sir pulteney objected stiffening bugger me thats that bastard choundas up there lewrie went on recognising his crowcaw voice then charitйs and paying the prim sir pulteney no mind and that charitй bitch tboot they halfslid the last of the way in a cloud of dirt bounding recklessly through the last of the scree to hard bare ground then to deep abovethetideline sand they would have rushed on to the surf but for a second shot from above that ricocheted off one of the large boulders at the back of the cove making them duck quickly into shelter of those boulders lewrie i have you at last choundas howled lewrie dug into his limp mostly empty seabag to pull out the pair of old used singleshot pistols hed bought with his last french coin in st omer they were big blunt ugly things akin to the pistols dealt out from the arms chests aboard ship when a boarding action was likely good for ramming into a foes stomach or chest and fired but unpredictable for anything much beyond ten or fifteen feet pray god itll take em about five minutes tpick their way down that path i dont spose youve a brace o barkers handy too sir pulteney he said as he quickly loaded both with powder and shot and primed their pans no there never was need of them back when i sir pulteney confessed huddled over lady imogene who was cowering close against the boulder lived by our wits dye see he lamely added wits played out lewrie snapped got a signal for hurry up to yer schooner best make it if ye do fortunately the crew of the rowing boat the mate conning her in had heard the shots had seen the torches and lanthorns atop the cliffs and were almost bending their ash oars to hasten their pace tirez tirez choundas was demanding as soon as he was set on solid ground shoot he commanded kill them before they get off the beach a few chasseurs obeyed him firing wildly hold your fire capitaine vignon ordered his gendarmes the range is too long and we are to arrest them hold fire major clary was ordering the chasseurs in a firmer command voice than choundass down the path mes amis and capture them no denis no charitй shrilled fumbling her reloading with her furious haste order your men to fire for gods sake down the path clary ordered again dismounting and drawing his musketoon from the saddle scabbard right fourchette capture them oh christ fourchette cursed under his breath it couldve been so simple one couple and two coachmen buried in an unmarked forest grave now four people must die along with the sailors from that schooner yet the ship would still escape and all europe would hear of the first consuls orders hear and be outraged but taken and privately executed later marksmen keep them in hiding and away from that boat oui capture them major clary what non dammit choundas screeched you two carry me down to the beach he ordered two chasseurs i must be there to see them dead the chasseurs looked to major clary who nodded his assent with a sneer and they hoisted him up with a musketoon under his legs and moved towards the head of the path down charitй at last reloaded dashed ahead of them with the first of the soldiers fourchette shook his head in disbelief as he followed shoving his way past cavalrymen to catch up with her and major clary might be able tpick one or two off and block the path lewrie muttered with one loaded pistol stuck in a pocket of his sloptrousers and the second in his hand he rose to a halfcrouch to look upslope torches and lanthorns showed him his pursuers progress it was damned slow so far above the sounds of the surf he could make out the noise the french were making stumbling tripping and sliding and setting off small showers of gravel there was a surprised shout as someone up there turned his ankle soldiers or gendarmes atop the cliff fired at him and he ducked down again as lead balls spanged off the boulders once the volley was spent he popped up again taking quick note that the people coming down the path were armed with short musketoons weapons about as inaccurate as his own pistols at any decent range yonder tthat boulder lewrie schemed up tthat bigun then i will have a good slant at that sharp bend cant hope thit anyone but they might waste a volley duck and have treload thatd slow em down do it damn yer eyes hang on a bit be right back lewrie told the others ducking down as another blindly aimed volley came their way alan no caroline wailed as he broke cover and ran for the first boulder her hand trying to snatch at his loose fishermans smock why must he be such a damned fool she cried only one or two shots followed him to his first hide and then lewrie was up and scrambling to the second a moment to get his wind back to calm his twanging nerves and he stood up levelling one of his pistols over his left arm to steady it cocking it and taking aim bang and he dropped out of sight spangwail went the ball as it caromed off the rocks by the sharp bend then the instinctive discharge of seven or eight return shots and the rattle of balls round his sheltering boulder a quick popup for a looksee soldiers were hunkered down in the boulders groping for cartridges and ramrods more shotsfrom the top of the cliff this time once they were spent lewrie rose and took aim with his second pistol at a chasseur with a torch at the head of the pursuit squeezing himself through the first tight space he fired and ducked bang then a meaty thunk and a frightened shout hed hit one of the bastards that summoned another ragged volley from the cliff top and one from the pursuers on the path and lewrie dashed back to that first boulder then back to rejoin the plumbs and caroline pinked one i think he chortled quickly reloading pistols theyre tryin tbe quick about it but theyre clumsy he told them frog chivalry theres two of em carryin choundas and more takin care that charitй dont fall and break her neck please jesus one i hit was only at the first tight squeeze and theyll have tmove him fore they get round it another quick peek that drew more fire and lewrie put his back to their boulder to look out to sea the schooners rowing boat with eight oarsmen stroking away like the devil was at the transom was only yards off and coming on strong another popup showed him that the leading french soldier was only halfway down the path and behind him there was a jamup where the chasseurs had to put choundas down so he could squeeze through the first tight space on his own tides out lewrie said itll be round fourty or fifty yards to the boat when it grounds be a real dash tget into her as soon as she grounds whichll be bout a minute or less theyll not have us when we run go straight to the boat no weavin about thats useless understand me caroline voices above were shouting oddly lewrie could understand every word for once french must be gettin better he thought sharing a joyful grin with his wife there was another volley of about a dozen rounds from the cliff top a ragged later shot from the soldiers on the path he stood and fired over the boulder not even bothering to aim this time just to make them cower to fear and slow down he looked at the plumbs they were not taking this well lady imogene was wheyfaced her teeth chattering sir pulteney holding her looked glazedeyed and ashen in the first hints of false dawn staring off at nothing he claimed tbe a soldier once lewrie scoffed mostlike the paradeground sort in a fashionable regiment and their sort doesnt get sent to battle that often schooled in arms sometime long before but playin chameleons more his style not fightin for his life lewrie waited out another volley then rose and fired his other pistol quickly tumbling down upon his back as a few cleverer french waited for his response and took potshots at him alan caroline yelped crawling to him im fine get back against the boulder he told her dusting himself off and taking his own advise to scramble back to cover too where he began to reload with what little powder shot and wadding he had left enough for four more shots total he reckoned the sea the surf it didnt look much higher than twofoot waves as the waters funnelled into the inlet and raled upon the sands a bit choppy but their salvation was now within fifty yards offshore lewrie risked one more peek and saw that a chasseur officerdamme but wasnt he the one hed met at bonapartes leveeanother one with a torch charitй and a weasellylooking man in a dark suit were at the bottom of the worst of the path just about to hit the screeslope there was choundas too in all his ugliness past the last squeezepoint and being carried again by two soldiers it would be a very close thing time t run lewrie decided for them all were breakin cover now he snapped kiss for luck mdear he put his arm round caroline she took his face in both hands and kissed him as fiercely as their first night wed it was hard for lewrie to break away to gather his nerve and let go of her on our feet ready he asked ready ready wait there was yet another volley from the cliff top lewrie stood and backed out into the open bracing himself for any clever bugger up yonder presented with a good target at last those last few clever frenchmen fired but thankfully they were gendarmes not soldiers and missed wide of him with their shortbarrelled musketoons now for the rest lewrie told himself dancing further out onto the beach capering and waving his arms va te faire foutre foutre napoleon and god bless king george he yelled at the chasseurs on the path then lifted one of his pistols and fired upwards striking a chasseur carrying a lanthorn in one hand and his musketoon in the other he yelped dropped both and clapped a hand to his thigh losing his footing the chasseur in front of him trying to aim and fire was swept off his feet too as the first landed on his back then began to slide down the scree slope taking the lead man with him in a whirl of arms and legs shot their bolt lewrie yelled as he rushed back to the rocks followed by sharp cracks of musket fire and plumes of sand from misses ready ready gol with carolines hand in his left and his last pistol in his right they dashed for the surf line and the boat which was now pitching in the shallows not ten yards from grounding there were a couple of stray shots chasing them but the party remained untouched the deep sand above the tide line dragged at their feet like cold treacle slowing them and all the while weapons were being reloaded and desperate soldiers were all but throwing themselves down the path and the slope lady imogene hitched up her skirts with both hands to run faster and lewrie let go carolines hand for her to do the same sir pulteney dodged astern of his wife to shelter her kill them kill them someone guillaume choundas was howling on men on major denis clary was urging with his sword out his musketoon in his left hand yet another chasseur slipped on loose rock and shale and went tumbling arses and elbows to join the first two whod fallen and who lay at the base of the slope barely moving still stunned clary came to a halt at the top of the scree fearing that half his borrowed troopers would break their necks or legs if they went on charitй halfslid to a stop beside him eyes wild and hair dishevelled panting openmouthed at the exertions fourchette thumped to a halt with them too then came another chasseur with a torch its too steep to clary said drymouthed shoot him fourchette ordered you soldiers shoot him not loaded msieur the torchbearer told him fumbling for cartridges shoot which one msieur a second asked also reloading the younger man shoot him fourchette snarled nigh crazed major clary you are loaded oui shoot him denis charitй shrilly demanded i am loaded msieur clary calmly told fourchette but i will take no part in murder here do it yourself he added as he shoved his weapon at the police agent theyre almost in the boat guillaume choundas screamed with frustration as he stumped down to join them at last leaning on one of the chasseurs who had been carrying him someone do something for gods sake he said punching the soldier in the arm to urge him to raise his musketoon and use it as if in answer the gendarmes atop the cliff let off a ragged volley but at that range their shots only struck sandplumes round the fleeing anglais raised a waterspout or two somewhat close to the boat which was now grounding but fell wide of their marks choundas was almost whimpering with rage grinding what few teeth remained as the bow men sprang from the rowing boat into waistdeep water to steady it and help the escapees aboard fourchette sneered at major clarys illplaced ideas of honour and tugged the lock of the musketoon to full cock then put it to his shoulder he reckoned himself a decent shot with a pistol or musket and this fumier lewrie would not be the first man he had had to shoot down but most of his kills had been at much closer range he put the rudimentary notch rear sight and front blade sight in line on lewries back just at the top of his spine trying to lead his target as he ran the last few yards to the waiting boat a downhill shot fifty mиtres or more off should he not hold even higher to allow for the bulletdrop he wondered then lifted the sights to aim at the top of lewries skull fourchette took a deep steadying breath and let it out slowly gently stroking the trigger which did not move even a millimиtre rearward his own weapons were made by a talented parisian gunsmith and this musketoon was a crude massproduced military firearm more pressure on the trigger then the lock released with an audible clunk then bang sir pulteney might not have been an impressive figure of a man but he was wiry when he and lady imogene reached the boat he lifted her from behind not breaking stride and practically hurled her into the arms of the secondtier oarsmen then scrambled over the larboard side tumbling into the boat headdown lewrie reached it a second later hoisting caroline with both hands on her waist his face in the small of her back for a second as a starboard oarsman took her by her upper arms to hoist her up and over the gunnel sailors shouts the mates orders by the tiller the thud and rushing hiss of surf and a buzzhum and then a meaty thunk of a bullet hot wetness sprayed his face blinding him christ im killed he thought amazed that hed neither heard the fatal shot nor felt the hammerblow impact of his death sweet jesus no lady imogene was screaming em murdrin frog bashtits a sailor cursed while two men seized him by his arms and armpits and threw him into the boat down onto the sole with his legs atop a thwart alan a faint weak and fearful cry almost lost in the rale of the next wave breaking on the beach a phantom voice go game lewrie told himself make a brave face for her lewrie lifted a hand from the sole dripping with seawater from the splashing of the chop and swabbed his face wondering when pain would come his hands came away almost black in the false dawn light what the devil if my heads blown open how am i still able tsee he goggled oarsmen were sitting back down to backwater some were poling off the sand and he was getting trampled so he grasped the nextaft thwart and rose to his knees we get her aboard quickly someone aft was saying we might save her even with no surgeon aboard alan came that phantom cry again weaker and more fearful what caroline good god he cried scrambling aft to her she lay on her back in an inch or two of seawater in the sole head and shoulders in lady imogenes lap no no no her lightcoloured blouse so cheery that morning was covered in large nighblack stains that slowly spread even as he crawled to her lady imogene was pressing her shawl and bright kerchief to try and staunch the flood at its source but there was so swift an outwelling that both cloths had turned almost completely dark too caroline lewrie cried as he got to her and took her hands in his a thin trickle of blood sprang from the corner of her mouth and she coughed spasming and gasping her eyes opened and she looked up at him eyes wide for a moment and her hands squeezed back then lost their strength she let out a long sigh then lay very still caroline lewrie croaked gathering her to his chest knowing she was gone god damn them god damn them the boat was now off the sands one bank of oarsmen stroking ahead the other still backing water to turn her bows out to sea and the mate at the tiller was judging the best moment to put the helm over between incoming waves so she would not be upset spinning her in her own length before both sides of oarsmen could row together you bastards lewrie howled unaccustomed tears in his eyes you murderin bitch charitй you foul childfucker choundas he raged searching for the pistol hed lost but hed dropped it when hed lifted caroline into the boat any guns aboard any sort of gun aye weve the mate said jutting his chin towards a pair of muskets near him intent on his steering lewrie snatched one up jerked from the muzzle the cork used to keep out the damp and tore off the greasy rag that sheltered the firelock and primed pan he scrambled right aft to the transom crowding the mate at the tiller to kneel and drag the lock to halfcock and check the powder in the pan and the tightness of the flint clasped in the dogs jaws the boat was rowing out now swooping wildly as the incoming waves lifted her bows and the oarsmen dragged her through the troughs making the stern soar upwards in turn he braced one foot on the aft end of the sole boards and the vertical stub of the keel where it emerged he had to try lewrie no what matters it will make no difference plumb was cautioning him he dashed a hand over his eyes once more squinting away those tears he had grim work to do then hed weep stop yer bloody gob he told sir pulteney there were several french chasseurs on the beach now some of them tending to their fellows who had slid or tumbled there none with a weapon at the ready as if they realised that firing would be pointless with them was a man in a dark suit and narrowbrimmed hat and he held a weapon at high portarms lewrie could conjure that spent powder smoke still fumed from its barrel but up above the beach at the top of the scree slope stood that major of chasseurs charitй de guilleri and that bastard choundas who was crowing and waving his cane in triumph seventy eighty yards lewrie gaged it shootin uphill so if i take one of em the man on the beachs closer which who do i kill who deserves it most please jesus help me shoot true help me kill just one of em we are damned major clary whispered fouchй will be furious oui charitй numbly agreed and the first consul she trailed off numb and drained and horrified by how badly her vengeance had gone amiss i speak of god and our souls mademoiselle clary said with a rasp of anger mon dieu does he intend to shoot at us bon clary said sheathing his sword and standing to attention chest offered as a target is she dead lewrie guillaume choundas was cackling and huzzaing do you suffer now hawn hawn weep lament suffer as i vous fumier charitй suddenly felt ill sick at her stomach and exhausted beyond imagining even her long desire to kill lewrie was gone flown away and all she felt was deep sadness and revulsion to be a part of the deed and those with whom she had shared it and at everythingthey had failed the boat was now over hundred mиtres offshore and there was nothing to stop it short of a miracle it was pitching and swooping wildly yet lewrie was still aiming at them charitй took one step away from denis clary and squared her own shoulders to make herself an open target and crossed herself for the first time in a long cynical time in expiation there was a sudden tiny bloom of gunsmoke from the boats sternsheets whipped quickly away by the wind stupid choundas yelled seaward you always were a hopelessly stupid salaud lewrie mistaking muscle for brains see your last hope dashed and fear for my revenge i will get you in the end suffer and eee thunk as lead slammed into flesh and bone choundas reeled on his good leg for a moment looking down at the blood spurting from his chest before toppling forward turning a clumsy pirouette as he slid down to the beach in a shower of loosed gravel and flinty stones going over and over head then feet before thudding to a stop at the foot of the slope in the deep sand his cloak spread out like a shroud and his corpse resembling a pile of castoff laundry major clary let out a whoosh of relief agog that anyone could kill with a smoothbore musket at that range and delighted that he had not been this lewries mark you see mademoiselle there is a judgmental god he said in wry delight beginning to whoop with laughter for a moment we must thank him for removing that thing from the earth and pray that weve been allowed to live for a good reason denis charitй said amazed herself smiling and shuddering to be spared as well she reached out a hand to her amour if denis was now in good spirits would he not wish to non major clary told her with a sad shake of his head that good humour vanishing as quickly as the gunsmoke i now bid you adieu mademoiselle au revoir with that he turned and began to trudge back to the top of the cliff summoning chasseurs to help their injured comrades below on the beach matthieu fourchette lifted his reloaded musketoon to his shoulder but gave it up as hopeless after a second of thought he uncocked it and handed it to one of the dazed soldiers there would be hell to pay when he reported this fiasco to minister fouchй theyd killed a woman yet let the others escape to england where news of the entire pursuit napoleons involvement and the murder would enflame british perhaps world outrage fourchette heaved a deep sigh contemplating the utter ruin of his promising career shrugging and shaking his head sorrowfully as he turned to face the cliffs wondering if he should cross over the frontier and lose himself in the germanies whats that he asked a woozy chasseur who was aiding one of his mates with a twisted ankle as he spotted the bundle of clothing thats that hideux fellow sir the chasseur told him rather cheerfully amazing that shot be a trial to get whats left of him back to the top of the cliffs dont bother fourchette told the soldier leave him here and let the crabs and gulls have him and wondered if he could couch his report to place some of the blame for his failure on choundas well a bit of it he went past the corpse struggling to make his way up through the loose scree slope the chasseurs more practical and realistic took a little time to loot choundass pockets though they found little of value seventy francs a poor watch some cigarros a flint tinderbox and a decent pistol with all accoutrements the ogres cane wasnt even scratched and it at least was of good quality then they walked away from him too book iv quid primum deserte querar forlorn what first shall i lament publius vergilius maro aenid u chapter thirtytwo though it was after easter in the year of our lord there was still need of a fire in the hearth in the officelibrary with its many large windows and french doors overlooking the side yards and the gardens it was a bright day if still a cool one so no candles or oil lamp was necessary for alan lewrie to read the latest letters that had come or take pen inkpot and stationery and reply to them the only sound in the comfortably wellfurnished room was the ticking of a mantel clock and the occasional skritch of his steelnib pen the house itself was quiet far too quiet and yawningly empty to suit him with the formal parlour and larger dining room furniture under protective sheeting sewalliss and hughs bed chambers abovestairs unused now they were back at their school and charlotte the only child still residing at home though of late she had spent the bulk of her time with his brotherinlaw governour chiswick and his wife millicent and their children at their estate lewrie felt no need to break his fast dine or sup in the big dining room no call to set foot in that wing of the house there were no visitors calling who could not be received in the smaller breakfast room or this office his world had shrunk to the foyer the landing and stairs his office the kitchens and pantry and his and their large bedchamber in point of fact lewrie preferred to pass most of his days outside or somewhere else the stables and barns on a long ride daily over his acres or to town and the olde ploughman lighting himself up to bed each night with a threecandle lamp with the last bustling sounds from the kitchen and scullery over he found that the house in which he once took so much pride felt more like a tomb an eldritch and eerie one all winter and into the spring since he had brought caroline home the house at night let out odd wooden groans or ticks latched shutters rattled even in light winds and there seemed an accusatory empty silence reading in bed far into the night and partaking of perhaps a glass or two of brandy beyond his usual custom he would look over to see her armoire and her vanity empty of carolines clothing and things and drawers in the vanity stripped to the last haircurler or hatpin yet they still stood in place in what seemed to him to be mute condemnation the plumbs hired schooner had not sailed for dover but for portsmouth at lewries request to shorten carolines final journey to the chiswick family plot in mossy old st georges graveyard in anglesgreen cutting a week off the time it would take to coach from dover to surrey in portsmouth one could also discover better carpenters who could fashion a finer coffin there were more fabric shops for lining that coffin and for a proper shroud and professionals knowledgeable at the dismal death trade and there would be perfume shops lewrie had had no experience with shore funerals and the needs of the dead when a sailor perished at sea his corpse was washed by his messmates and the loblolly boys sewn into a scrapcanvas shroud with rusty pitted old roundshot at his feet to speed him to the ocean floor a last stitch was taken through his nose to prove that he truly was gone the seaburial was done that very day with the hands mustered the way off the ship and her yards canted acockbill a service read from the book of common prayer before the dead man was tipped off the mess table from beneath the flag in brief honour in the heat of battle sometimes the slain didnt even get that and were passed out a lee gunport so the sight of dead shipmates did not unman or discourage the rest then only the names were read for their remembrance and honour there was no time for rot to set in dear god but that had been hard for lewrie to bear despite a brief bustle of aid from the plumbs too damned many condolences and too much handwringing can you ever forgive us once too often and watery gooseberryeyed speculations on what had gone wrong for the first time in hundreds of successful escapes it was up to lewrie to see her home on his own with the liberal use of a whole bottle of eau de cologne and nigh a bushelbasket of freshcut flowers in the coffin with her he had set off with a dray waggon riding beside the teamster whilst the plumbs had set off for londonthank godswearing that the news of carolines murder would set the nation afire that they would speak to their friend the prince of wales etc and etc til he was heartily sick of the sight of them travelling on the waggon seat necessity though it was made him cringe and burn with shame though for how could he wish to bolt from a loved one how could he do all the proper things if he wished that he had been the swift rider sent on ahead to alert the family and the vicar at st georges and his sexton who would dig the grave instead of making the trip with a scented handkerchief pressed to his nose and fighting the continual urge to gag once he was in anglesgreen others thankfully took charge and lewrie had been spared any more of the sorrowful details til the morning of the church service and caroline chiswisk lewries burial beside her parents sewallis sr and charlotte even her old hardhearted and skinflint uncle phineas chiswick had appeared to be moved to tears or a convincing sham for family and village for hed never cared very much to be saddled with his distant north carolina relatives who had fled at the end of the revolution and had showed up on his doorstep destitute and with nowhere else to turn there was yet another cause to make lewrie squirm to this day in church or at the graveside he could not mourn her death so much as he grieved for how he had failed her that he had not been man enough or clever enough to save her and that he had not been husband enough to make her life content and easy he could easily conjure that what their vicar had said was ruefully true in a sense that caroline was now at peace in heaven a welcome peace to be shot of him at last as common as death was how she caroline had perished had outraged everyone rekindling the instinctive mistrust and hatred of the french to a whitehot blaze in anglesgreen for caroline always had been quite popular with everyone with the possible exceptions of uncle phineas and sir romney embletons son harry who had courted her after a fashion before lewrie had come along and swept her away and had never forgiven either of them for refusing what he had desired lewrie suspected that it had been harry who had started a rumour that her death had been lewries fault for dragging her over to france and enflaming bonapartes wrath by being his usual headstrong and reckless selfa malicious slur that unfortunately had found a fertile field with uncle phineas his brotherinlaw governour chiswick whod never been in favour of the match and sadly through governour his own daughter charlotte lewrie had thought it done after a week and all that was left was to order her headstone but people learning of her funeral too late to attend coached to anglesgreen to console him anthony langlie his former first lieutenant in hms proteus and his wife lewries former orphaned french ward sophie de maubeuge had come up from kent to see him his other much more likable brotherinlaw burgess chiswick and his new wife theadora had come a week after his letter to them having arrived late at the barracks of burgesss regiment and there were so many letters some coming months later as word crept its way from london papers to provincial papers in the far corners of great britain or overseas each new missive clawing at the scabs to the point that he dreaded the arrival of a post rider or a mail coach old shipmates like commodore nicely from his days in the west indies commodore ayscough and captain thomas charlton people from his midshipman days like captain keith ashburn former officers aboard his various commands like ralph knolles darcy gamble fox and farley of hms thermopylae former sailing masters and mids even one or two pursers had written and despite lewries urge to crumple the letters and toss them into the fireplace hed kept them pressed flat together in a shallow wood box if only to save the home addresses after years with no correspondence for the lack of them his solicitor his former barrister from his trial his banker at coutts zachariah twigg and matthew mountjoy at the foreign office even jemmy peel still up to something shady for king and country in the germanies had written eudoxia durschenko had penned a sympathetic letter her command of english much improved just before the start of daniel wigmores peripatetic extravaganzas first grand tour through europe in years eudoxia was sure that the circus and theatrical troupe would score a smashing season she said that her papa arslan artimovitch sent his condolences but lewrie thought it a kindly lie the oneeyed old lion tamer hated him worse than satan hated holy water alan lewrie sanded the last of his correspondence then folded it and sealed it with wax one last dip of the pen in the inkwell and the address was done he looked up from his desk to a sideboard on which rested a silver tray and several cutglass decanters one for brandy one for claret and one filled with kentucky bourbon whisky he glanced at the mantel clock it lacked half an hour to noon he shook his head thinking that hed done too much of that of late to fill the hours of solitary quiet to stave off the feeling that he now resided in a mausoleum ring for a cup of coffee no he gathered up his letters and went out into the foyer on his way towards the back entrance past the kitchens but paused once there looking into the parlour and dining room at the clothshrouded furniture the heavy drapes had been taken down and beaten clean and the lighter summer drapes now graced the windows drawn back to let light in and the shutters open for the day for a brief moment he considered selling up and moving on to flee this house tween the wars when it was built it had been to her desires of what a proper home should be when hed paid off hms alacrity and settled in anglesgreen caroline had made allowances for his need for that office studylibrary hed just left but the builder had deferred to her on almost everything else shed chosen the paint for all the rooms shed selected the new furniture and the fabrics for the new chairs and settees the fabrics and colours to reupholster their old pieces they were carolines drapes tablecloths china pattern and table ware her collected knickknacks and objets dart the paintings on the walls of pastorals and grecoroman ruins the portraits of the children and her kin save for a couple of nautical prints and a portrait of lewrie done way back when he was a lieutenant on antigua there was little sign that he had ever lived there in point of fact he ruefully thought he had not lived there much a few brief years from to and he was back at sea with active commissions with barely six weeks at home between them last winter before theyd gone to paris was the longest hed spent under this roof in nigh twenty years cant sell up he realised the children need their homeplace some roots and a sense of place even if i dont your pardon sir but youll be havin your dinner before you post your letters today the cook mrs gower intruded on his musings as she bustled from the kitchen steak and kidney pie she tempted no long as im to town ill get something at the ploughman he told her does it keep that might make a good supper though la and ive a brace o rabbits your man furfy snared in the backgarden this mornin sir mrs gower objected cheerfully and them skinned and all and steepin in an herb broth for your supper already well dont let phineas chiswick know of em lewrie japed legally speaking lewrie rented his land as a tenant not freeholding and had no right to shoot trap or snare any game that strayed upon his property those rabbits were chiswick rabbits fish in the rills and creek in the dammedup stock pond were chiswick fish rabbit does sound tasty and we do have to eat the evidence of furfys poaching let him and desmond enjoy the pie one of the first things hed done once the first fortnight of mourning was over was to dismiss that dour mrs calder as housekeeper and semityrant with two months wages carolines maidservant had been let go too though with half a years salary and her choice of carolines clothing those that he had not donated to the church and the parish winter charity or let governours wife millicent have now his domestic staff was reduced to mrs gower and her husband who served as handyman gardener and doorman should any caller ride up or knock little charlotte still needed a maidandgoverness in one and mrs gower had need of a scullery maid and one maidofallwork to keep up with the cleaning but as for him he felt no need for a manservant he had liam desmond and patrick furfy his former coxn and a sailor off his last three ships to see to everything else about the stables barns the livestock and the crops with day labourers hired on as needed it was not due to the expense of keeping a staff that hed pared them down it was rather that the presence of so many people bustling about the house no matter how downcast or cheerful rankled him lewrie went on past the kitchens stillroom and pantry to the rear exit and more of carolines handiwork her herb plots and her meticulously arranged flower garden with the bricked terrace and the bricked walks through it under the vinecovered pergola where wicker chairs and a settee sat ready for midmorning contemplation or afternoon tea a bit further out to the right there was another gathering of woodslat furniture under the spreading oak boughs which provided a splendid view of the fields and woods the barn stables and stockpens and paddocks aye and there ye be capm liam desmond called out as he led anson lewries favourite horse from the stable doors saddled up and ready to go hes ready for ye faith missed his mornin ride and that eager for a trot ttown sure morning desmond furfy he added to the goodnatured side of beef who was desmonds shadow lashins of steak and kidney pie for dinner lads and furfy well have your rabbits for supper so the magistrate wont learn of it he added with a wink as he took the reins think we should bury the bones once were done with em master sewalliss dogsd predate em more sor furfy said looking furtive over his misdeed they must be a goodly warren about though for smany rabbits raidin th gardens arrah sor mebbe we i should keep snares set damnedest thing furfy lewrie said as he swung aboard at this moment i think ive gone deaf couldnt hear a thing ye said i meant tsay sor furfy began before desmond poked him in the ribs oh git yer meanin sure capm lewrie forget yer hat sor desmond pointed out oh no threat o rain today so lewrie said shrugging and peering at the sky i can live without later lads a flick of the reins a cluck and a press of his heels on ansons flanks and he was off round the house to the circular driveway and the gravelled lane down to the junction and the bridge at an easy trot posting in the stirrups though the day was cool the breeze felt good on his scalp and the sunshine scintillating through the fully leafed trees was delightful and it struck him then that the only time he felt like japing or smiling was when he was astride a horse away from there chapter thirtythree why captain lewrie maggie cony exclaimed as he entered the olde ploughman just in time for the mail coach and steak and kidney pie tboot and look whos just arrived not a tick ago my but we must cut you a goodly portion and put some meat on your bones again hallo son sir hugo st george willoughby seated by himself at a table near a side window cordially said hoisting a mug of ale in invitation father lewrie replied crossing the busy dining room to join him at his table and plunk himself down in a wood chair i wondered whose carriage that was out yonder what brings you down from town alone he added in a softer voice with a raised eyebrow though sir hugo was now of an age and played a publick sham of upright respectability the lascivious old rogues penchant for doing the needful with any courtesan or mistress who would go under his protection still thrived quite nicely and his fortune in hindoo loot from his time in the east india company army assured him willing even fetching young things some of whom fortunate enough to enjoy his offer of a fortnight of hospitality at his country estate dun roman alone aye this time sir hugo admitted with a shrug and a roll of his eyes though theres a delightful new one in london as to my business here why i came to see you lad see how youre coping speak of a few matters mistress conys right ye know his father added reaching out to pluck lewries coat and cocking his head in survey ye have lost some weight several good feedsre what ye need seen the latest papers ah some lewrie replied as one of the waitresses brought him a brimming pint mug of the ploughmans famed sale thankee for the waitress who was a fetching brunette and what about the papers to his father have i missed something or other evidently sir hugo drawled this business over alexandria and malta the french aint happy and neithers our government bugger the french lewrie snapped which statement aroused a chorus of amen and a few choicer curses from the public houses diners spoke with a few people at horse guards sir hugo leaned over closer to impart his rumour in a guarded voice the general sense is that pitt and his peoplewindham grenville and that crowdand the king himself want the war tstart up again the prime minister addington is leanin that way and his cabinet too first week of march the king said in his address that the militia should be called out and ten thousand more men called to the navy hey mustve missed thatun lewrie said after a deep quaff of ale and feeling a bit of hope but so many people were just sick of the war the shortages and taxes england aint one o those damned democracies as mobdriven as ancient greeks sir hugo hooted mirthlessly and thank god for that recall what that scribbler edmund burke wrote that intercourse with the french is more terrible than fightin em give em leave and theyll spread their revolutionary ideas everywhere uhm the spread of her doctrines are the most dreadful of her arms he quoted missed thatun too lewrie replied cocking his head at his sire damme when did you take up readin so much im a retired gentleman o means sir hugo snickered back a fellow with the time for it mongst other more pleasant things o course at any rate bonaparte and the frogs aint happy as i say he evacuated taranto but were still in alexandria and malta a year after we were sposed tturn em over to the turks and the french we gave france back her west indies colonies and we got trinidad and ceylon but lately and the french are more than welcome to saint domingue lewrie stuck in toussaint louverture and his generalsre killin frogs by the shipload even if the french did capture the old bugger and rout his men theyre still givin general leclerc fits in the jungles ambushin anything smaller than a brigade that and yellow jack of late addingtons added holland and switzerland to our objections sir hugo continued and piedmont in italy bonapartell get malta ten years from now if he pulls his armies out and lets the dutch and the swiss alone and bonaparte cant agree tthat hes dead set on riggin up all these damned republics with his eyes on all of europe eventually its comin alan me son its comin for sure and if its as much joy tyou as it was tme sir hugo added with a grin theres word that general leclerc bonapartes brotherinlaw died of a tropic fever on saint domingue people also told me that theres a general or marshal victor with a large army in holland batavian republic his father spat ready tsail for the indies perhaps bonaparte will end up killin as many french soldiers as henry dundas did of ours when he was secretary of state at war ha thatd be lovely lewrie wolfishly agreed before his hatred of the french was personal limited to only a few individuals hed met and opposed facetoface now though it was damn em all root and branch with napoleon bonaparte at the top of his list horse guards rarely talks with the admiralty sir hugo drolly said but there have been some discussions ive been made privy to some folderol over increasing the size of the royal marines for duties at sea with the transfer of a battalion of foot to the navy doled out in platoons per each ship heard anything from the navy yourself about another active commission no lewrie had to tell him dear as i wish it give me something to do again you very well may soon his father attempted to assure him the old rascal had risen to majorgeneral and the senior military officer to the lordlieutenant of surrey for a brief time during the nore and spithead naval mutinies when for a time it had looked as if french jacobin revolution would come to england too and hed done the crown yeoman service in retired he might be but he was still on the army list and he still had good connexions so perhaps he was not being kind not that lewrie could remember too many instances in their spotty past when sir hugo st george willoughby had been kind only if it didnt cost him tuppence lewrie notsofondly thought another matter sir hugo said after finishing his ale and waving for another hughs nigh thirteen now if the war begins again i might be able to wangle him his set of colours with a good regiment ensign first bit young for a lieutenant though there are a fair number o twelveyearold captains if their parents have enough blunt to purchase their commissions cant make brigadier or higher if ye start late ye know lewrie delayed his answer by paying attention to his ale they had spoken of this before years ago and after the funeral before hugh and sewallis had had to return to their public school i want to kill frenchmen father hugh had said in a shudder of barely controlled emotion tears at the corner of his eyes if we ever fight them again i wish to go to sea like you and kill as many of them as ever i may and even sewallis his usually subdued and quiet firstborn had evinced stonyhearted anger had whispered amen to that and stated his desire to avenge his mother blood for blood hed whispered a good shot a decent swordsman and possessed of a splendid seat sir hugo reminded lewrie intelligent and daring is our hugh active a keen sportsman make a grand officer hmm he wants tbe me lewrie told the old rogue hed prefer to be a midshipman when answering all those letters of condolence from my fellow captains and such i requested they keep hugh in mind should they get a ship in future thankee for the offer but his hearts set on the navy so he can kill a shitpot o frogs he said well then ill say no more about it sir hugo said with a bit of a sigh least hughs futures assured and sewallisll inherit so more schoolins more suitable for him university perhaps ere ye go sirs the fetching new brunette waitress declared as she delivered two heaping plates of steak and kidney pie and a new round of ale there was fresh white bread lashings of butter with it mashed potatoes with spring peas and the girl promised figgydowdy for sweets after any o ye gentlemen need anything just call out public schoolsre ruin enough for young lads lewrie objected with a growl universitys a good deal worse after leaving the olde ploughman sir hugo wished to go on out to his estate and invited lewrie to join him in his coach lewrie agreed to join him but wished to exercise anson so he would ride by the coach instead perhaps canter on ahead and meet him there his father had sent letters on to alert his house staff to have everything ready for his arrival from london as his coach rolled to a stop in front of the wide and deep front gallery of the low rambling onestorey bungalow built in imitation of an east india company cantonment there was his butler cook estate agent stableman and groom a brace of gamekeepers four maidsofallwork some ten or twelveyearold lads who would assist at anything from the barns to the kitchens and sir hugos longtime army orderly and manservant the oneeyed old sikh trilochan singh bows and curtsies doffed hats and wide smiles all round as the carriage box and boot were unloaded and the horses led off to the stables singh saluted and stamped boots sepoy fashion better than i thought what hey singh sir hugo exclaimed in joy over his latest improvements damme but the flowerin bushes and such do make the place attractive there were even hanging baskets of some sort of flowers strung from the gallerys overhead porch beams the summer wicker or bamboo furniture had been set out on the gallery along with a couple of rope hammocks too both of them large enough to accommodate two people at a time plan tstrum a girl in one of em lewrie had to think grinning as he had a mental picture of a fullmoon romp in the nude neighbours and house staff bedamned well he is set in the middle of all these acres he told himself maybe he could pull it off with no one wiser some o your cool tea here on the gallery sir hugo suggested must admit its refreshin that notion o yours so i took it up capital lewrie agreed taking a seat as the tea was ordered ah the country sir hugo said with a happy sigh sprawling on a wicker settee and its canvascovered padding one booted leg atop a woven cane ottoman with his neckstock removed his shirt collars open and his coat off id love tspend a whole fortnight but ive business back in london no moren a week this trip later on in the summer well might spend a whole two months clean air refreshin breezes good horses and long open fields what absolutely lewrie had to agree more by rote than anything else he got the feeling that there might be one more shoe to drop his father was not one for small talk or idle invitationsunless he had a good reason for it yours when im gone lad sir hugo reminded him as the cool tea arrived trilochan singh must have been responsible for its brewing for there were slices of lemon and a pot of light brown turbinado sugar from the first pressings already ground fine all of it lock stock and barrel ever erm ever given thought tremoving in here now mean tsay if hughs tgo for a sailor and sewallis is tbe away at school if you get a ship well its bags roomier than your place charlottes still lodgin with governour and millicent aye but that was only temporary while caroline and i lewrie replied then paused reminded again that there was no caroline and never would be if i do gain a new command he slowly said it might be best did she board with em id pay for her tutor and music teacher and all that but thats where she is now charlotte has gotten it into her head that he sat up with his elbows on his knees the cool glass of tea in both hands squirming in shame to announce that evil rumour theres some say it was my fault caroline was killed he told sir hugo growing angry damn em dont know what millicent thinks shes sweet and kind most of the time but governour hes always disapproved of my well ye know what he disapproved of at their place so much charlotte thinks it was my fault too she was always carolines daughter first and last and with me gone so much and those letters comin and makin caroline so bitter the girl was deadset against me and took caroline as gospel even after i came home last winter charlottes been missish and standoffish with me and i dont know what tdo about it the boys i can understand but her i leave her in governours clutches i might as well give her up lewrie said with a bitter sigh dont suppose youd take her on in london would you like you did with sophie not a chance in hell sir hugo baldly stated young ladies i can deal with not with headstrong little girls besides she might cramp your doins lewrie said with a mirthless chuckle there is that sir hugo cheerfully admitted without a wife in yer house without a stepmother trear her up i dont suppose yed consider marryin again not a chance in hell lewrie assured his father besides howd it look with the first year of mournin not half over and who could i trust tdo right by her and me just a thought sir hugo said waving one hand idly to shoo his suggestion away now do ye let governour and millicent have her through an active commission thats what three years or more out at sea halfway round the world before ye have tcome home to refit about that aye lewrie sombrely agreed a dockyard refit in england but still held active it might be five or six years and all that time yer house sittin empty and idle left in the hands of an estate agent ye dont know whether ttrust sir hugo speculated upkeep not done rats and mice everywhere rent paid tphineas chiswick with little return thats rum what are you gettin at lewrie asked suddenly thinking that that shoe was about to be dropped and he wouldnt much care for it ye havent spoken with phineas chiswick or with burgess his father asked brows up as if surprised that lewrie was still in the dark as little as possible to the first and not since the funeral to the second lewrie answered why ye really havent sir hugo realised sitting up straighter and seeming to squirm his lined face turning pinker damn wouldve thought yed heard heard bloody what lewrie demanded phineas and governour think that burgess should have a country estate of his own son sir hugo began near his kinfolk dye see close tlondon and horse guards stead of way up at high wycombe with his wifes parents handier for the trenchers tboot do they wish a week or two in the country callin on their daughter and soninlaw and sir hugo said with a sly worldly look i do recall that the trenchers are simply ungodly rich and ye know how phineas chiswick slavers like a jowly hound if he hears two guineas rub tgether what better sort of neighbours could he wish phineas cant turf me out lewrie snapped not as long as i stay current in my rents and theres no chance o me fallin behind ive prizemoney in the bank interest from the funds and thank god weve had two years o good corn crops and the price o wools still high despite the peace so he cant its a longterm lease dammit i vow i never thought thear ye speak o crops and wool prices like ye knew what they were his father said with a snicker oh he could buy you out any time he felt like it son theres burgess come home from india a chicken nabob with moren fifty thousand pounds theres the trenchers who mightve made a round million since the war began in ninetythree considerin all the improvements yeve made over the years phineas chiswick might have to pay ye twelve or fifteen hundred pounds but he could turn round and offer it to burgess as a lease and make that back before he goes toes up phineas dont have anyone tinherit mind ye sir hugo sagely pointed out his first two wives died without issue so hes no sons tleave it to and hes the miserly sort whod take all his property thell with him could he figure out how or keep it together after hes gone its good odds itll all go to governour since hes the elder of his nephews and governours been doin the old bastards will since he got here schemin tbe his sole heir eatin his shit and runnin his errands and smilin all the while haw haw even so i dont see governour keepin burgess as a tenant lewrie said frowning with concentration thinkin tprosper off his own brother in rents rent for now then will the farm to burgess when phineas dies til then governourd be responsible for upkeep and working the crops and herds same as he does for his own lands and phineass sir hugo explained then both brothers end up freeholders and able tvote in the borough hunt fish trap game both end up country gentry it aint exactly the christian thing tdo turfin ye out so soon after carolines passin but what can ye expect from such a purseproud old miser and theres what ye leave the children tconsider sir hugo added after a long contemplative sip of tea and a fond gaze over his own vista and acres should the french manage tkill ye before ye inherit dun roman that is another twelve or fifteen hundred pounds in the bank or the three percents would help them along their ways why go to all that trouble when phineas could just sell it to the trenchers and burgess could be landed right away lewrie fumed getting to his feet to stamp down the length of the gallery shouting back over his shoulder before he turned to clomp angrily back to his father no matter how landproud phineas chiswick is he sold to you first time in living memory hereabouts that like tove made local folk go into fits it did thought hed gone mad as a hatter hed had a bad investment or two crop prices were down and he needed the money perishin bad sir hugo explained with a shrug not his best land youll note too hilly to plow too wooded and thinner soil dont make tuppence from workin this land son just barely break even its ownin this much land the house and my view is what matters tme be the same for burgess long as hes in the army a pleasant country seat thats all that the trenchers could buy then give to burgess as a weddin present and the deals done straightaway lewrie fumed rocking on the balls of his feet and feeling like he wanted to hit something or kick furniture remembering how phineas chiswick had turfed out that sheeper tenant whod had the place before he and caroline had returned from the bahamas in and had needed a place to live close to the bosom of her family ha bugger phineas chiswick lewrie growled bugger governour and bugger burgess too if he hasnt the nutmegs tspeak with me about it just damn my eyes bugger em all aye his father inexplicably hooted laughing heartily no matter how they wish it though me son they cant run ye outta the shire hark ye shift yer traps an furnishins up here to dun roman and this will be yer new country seat sir hugo schemed with a wry little grin they might think yell end up in london at the madeira club but yer children can consider this their new home whilst yer at sea and yell be able tcome home and be up their noses til the last trump when i go youre heir ttwice as many acres as yer old place and do i not squander all the loot i brought back from india you and yoursll sit in deep clover haw haw theyll never be rid o ye lewrie thought that over hard sitting back down in his chair and taking a long sip of the cool tea considering how much dear uncle phineas might have to shell out to get him out the house theyd run up had cost eight hundred pounds in and was surely worth more now the old wattleanddaub barn had been torn down before it collapsed or the rats ate it and a new stoneandwood barn had replaced it the brickandstone stables and coachhouse the silage tower had gotten added the next year there were good horses for the team and saddle horses hed keep those at his fathers but the rest of the livestock could go with the land with no more rents owing at each quarterly assizes and more money in the bank lewrie sat back in his chair and began to grin ye see sir hugo cajoled onliest problem though is that the children wont have their home any longer lewrie mused where they were born and grew up oh the boys they love comin up here tyour place so i dont imagine itd pain them too sore perhaps sewallis more than hugh it will be charlotte wholl take it worse hard as she took losin her mother tlose our old house too well shed never forgive me for that on top of all that governours put in her head son whos tsay charlotted forgive ye anyway sir hugo pointed out with a sad shake of his head and a reassuring tap upon lewries knee well theres truth tthat lewrie had to agree after a long moment to think that over there is that chapter thirtyfour all worries about being turfed out of his home became moot just two days later when lewrie went down to the olde ploughman after his daily morning ride for a rumlaced coffee and found his old coxswain will cony waving to him and wiping his hands on his blue publicans apron mail coach brought ya somethin capm lewrie will declared coming to meet him near the doors letter from admiralty th most important want a drop o somethin warmin whilst ya read it sir tis a raw sorta day aye will id admire rummed coffee lewrie replied quickly taking his letters and ripping the official wax seal to read it before even taking a seat at a table idlers in the public houses common room turned in their chairs at that announcement worried that a resumption of the war might be coming though none of the newspapers had yet declared it they offered him a ship another frigate of the fifth rate a gunner with pounder mainbattery guns hms reliant now lying inordinary at portsmouth he sat down with a smile on his face an expression that local people had not seen since hed come home from paris closed his eyes and slowly nodded as if in a brief prayer of thanks before hungrily reading his letter again just to make sure that it was real that the offer of active commission was true and not a fantasy is it war beggin yer pardon sir cony asked in a whisper as he returned with his coffee it doesnt say will but lewrie informed him an a mutter of his own it may very well be if theyre recommissioning me therell be a press then soon will cony speculated a hot press recruiters comin ttown from the army but what sorta ladd go for a soldier when he kin be a seadog by god lotta young lads hereabouts capm lewrie barely scrapin by as day labourers or down tthe tanneryr brickworks since the enclosure acts took their folks wee plots o land and the commons id wager i could round up a couple dozen likely lads fer your new ship whats her name sir reliant lewrie told him a fifth rate thirtyeight a big frigate aye will cony exclaimed for one and all in the common rooms hms reliant the capms got huzzah damme did i have two feet tday id go back tsea quickern ya kin say knife ye really think ye could lewrie posed knowing how hard it would be to recruit willing hands in a hard press and thinking that a dozen or so volunteers from anglesgreen whod known him and caroline for years might take the joining bounty as a way to get their revenge on the french for the murder of a local favourite even wif two feet will cony yeve too much belly tshin up a mast these days a patron hooted an th navy wont let ye sling a keg o yer best ale aboard cried another cony takes th kings shillin whod make our ale i ask ye shouted a third we got tkeep im here tie him up fore he gits away lewrie opened a second letter this one from his old superior in the adriatic in and a senior officer in the close blockade of the gironde coast three years before captain thomas charlton he was being given a commission a twodecker third rate he wrote and did lewrie still have need for a midshipmans berth for his son hugh then charlton would be honoured to accept him hms pegasus was lying inordinary at portsmouth happy circumstance so make haste etc and my son hugh has a ship too lewrie told cony runs in the famly th sea it do sir cony beamed proudly ill be all night writin all the people i have to lewrie said hurrying through his coffee and get letters off on tomorrows mail coach thats a temptin idea will our local lads if i could get em past the impress service into portsmouth without half of em being stolen an robbed o their joinin bounty aye will cony agreed with a growl im off and thankee lewrie said springing to depart he rode at a fast lope to dun roman to inform his father spending perhaps an hour arranging for sir hugo to serve as his representative should phineas chiswick press the matter after he departed the next stop was home his news a delight to liam desmond and pat furfy who no matter how pleasant their lives were on the farm found that a chance to serve at sea again suited them right down to their toes then it was fingercramp ink smudges and hot sealing wax on his fingers all through the day and early evening with only a few very brief breaks for dinner supper and trips to the necessary first came his reply to admiralty the next to capt charlton then to his solicitor coutts bank sewallis and hugh urging them to come down to london and lodge at the madeira club til he arrived and informing hugh that his fondest wish would soon be realised after all those he had to write all the other naval officers from whom hed asked a place for the boy telling him that charlton would take him note for ya sir mr gower intruded into the library office hmm lewrie perked up this late from whom dye know governour chiswick i reckon sir gower replied lewrie tore it open and read what governours wife millicent had penned charlotte wished to sup with them and sleep over with her girl cousin they would fetch her home by midmorning tomorrow awflly damned highhanded of em lewrie muttered thinking that a request sent much earlier would have been more polite not this oh by the by note as if they were her parents not him christ shes been over there all day lewrie realised ive eat dinner and supper and didnt even note she wasnt here well maybe they areor will have tbe charlotte couldnt stay at dun roman not if his father was not present nor could she reside with him in london as the old rogue had made very clear somebody had to take her on and who better than family her only kin disagreeable as most of them were have tride over there and see if theyll board her permanent he told himself arrange for all her clothes bedchamber furniture and toys tgo with her have familiar things round her poor tyke or he reckoned for a long minute or two he could do the right thing by his children turn down reliant thus ending his active royal navy career he could go on halfpay the rest of his life live here in anglesgreen as farm agent at dun roman perhaps with an occasional jaunt up to london and the madeira club when country living got too boresome no he whispered sadly shaking his head in the negative sir asked gower who was still hovering thinkin out loud no matter mister gower he told him right ho then capm lewrie gower said cheerfully doing a sketchy bow before slouching off to the kitchens lewrie heated the sealing wax and daubed it on the flap of his final letter then snuffed the candle heater and leaned back with an ache in the small of his back from sitting hunched forward too long he rose and arched himself to work out the kink fists in the small of his back and decided that hed done a fair piece of work and was now well deserving of a healthy measure of whisky the sun was not only far below the yardarm by then it was two hours past sunset desmond and a stable boy were going round closing the outside shutters for the night as he poured himself half a glass of bourbon they closed the shutters on the french doors to the backgarden leaving his office lit only by the candelabra on his desk and the glow from the fireplace he paused after his first sip looking round slowly at all his books and possessions his furniture his weapons and the hanger hed recovered from napoleon now hung over the mantel where it had lodged years before after another sip he stepped out into the foyer looking over the sideboard and mirror the framed portraits the venetian bombй tables hed brought back from the adriatic and into the parlour and dining room in the other wing of the house and all those ghostly pale sheetcovered furnishings there was a bit of a moon that night and before desmond and his lad began to close the shutters over all those windows he got the shivery feeling that he was looking at a coven of spooks i will never see this house again he whispered with a new shiver trilling up his spine back in service and out to sea within a month hed not return for years and when he did it would surely be burgesss and theadoras house in freehold he would be invited over to dine or dance at holidays but by then it would look totally different done to theadoras taste the nursery might even be occupied by chiswick children thered be new servants a lot more of them too ask my father tclose it down and move everything over to his place in storage lewrie decided making a mental inventory of furnishings he could use aboard his new ship that sense of finality was not dread he felt those shivers for an ending not like a premonition like the old adage of sensing that rabbit running over ones grave he knew what he was doing aboard a shipeven if he didnt know much ashore let the french try to do him in hed give them measure for measure and more to boot sorry caroline he muttered finishing his drink and sure he would soon have another idve liked tkeep everything just as ye liked it but i cant i cant live with all your ghosts either never see this place again he asked himself bloody good chapter thirtyfive it was a tossup as to who peered out from the coachs windows more eagerly as it began the long descent from portdown hill to portsmouth properhugh sewallis or their father the lads squealed and oohed at the sight of the harbour so crammed with warships at anchor so many water hoys and supply barges working to succour them and the lugsailed or oared boats dashing back and forth like so many roaches scuttling from a sudden flood of light and once they were on level ground before the george inn the one lewrie preferred most the streets leading into hm dockyards were even busier with dray waggons and seamen with parties from the impress service chivvying along their latest catches to the tenders to ferry them out to the hulked receiving ships with files of marines tramping along at the quickstep with officers strolling together in twos and threes for whispered conversations or sharing cockawhoop japes stay close or get trampled now lewrie chid his boys leaving it to his father sir hugowho had coached down with them for the nonce and who would see sewallis back to london and the diligence coach to his school once the necessities were doneto deal with the driver of the dray waggon which bore all his personal goods and furnishings and hughs seachest and to supervise desmond and furfys unloading lewrie closed his eyes and sniffed deeply feeling a swell of satisfaction as he realised how different a seaport smelled and how much he had missed it other than the horse dung of course there was the fishy smell of tidal flats and the kelp and hard marine life that clung to wood and stone piers at low tide the scent of salt of cablelengths of hemp or manila fresh from weaving at the ropewalks hot tar or pitch turpentine and rosin and the sweetness of newsawn wood and sawdust newbaked ships biscuit small beer by the keg the heady aroma of a leaking rum cask from a passing waggon and there were the sounds mewing crying gulls the clatters of sail signal or flag halliards on masts staffs or poles faroff rustles of loosed canvas from one of the nearer ships as its rusty or newly impressed crew went through an exercise in harbour drill roars and shouts barked orders fiddle music and laughter and the rumbles of a great many men of a myriad of skills all congregating to launch a great enterprise and the bulk of them knowing what they were about i think im home lewrie told himself opening his eyes to take it all in a damned deprivin one once were out at sea but home just the same yes well lets see about our lodgings first then well see my goods aboard reliant lewrie said abandoning his reverie ive written ahead so the george may be able ttake us all all of us father to go out to your new ship sewallis asked him looking more eager than was his usual wont aye you can be there when i read myself in he agreed and an hour later with two hired boats to bear all his goods and the six of them they went alongside hms reliant she was still reduced to a gantline with none of her upper masts set up and her gundeck empty of artillery riding high in the waters not too far off southsea castle in the deeper water twixt spit sand and horse sand boat ahoy one of her midshipmen challenged pro forma that for there was no doubt that the first boat carried a postcaptain and the second his possessions aye aye their boatman shouted back showing four fingers to declare that a postcaptain was indeed aboard might ye have need of a bosuns chair father lewrie teased bedamned if i will sir hugo snapped back last in first out lewrie said laying a restraining hand on sewalliss shoulder as he stood to grope for the main channel platform the deadeyed mainmast stays and the manropes of the boardingbattens sir hugo next then hugh then you sewallis he tucked his sword behind his left leg stood on the gunnl of their boat and stepped onto the main channel then the battens making a quick way up to the starboard entryport he was greeted with a sideparty of marines a bosun and his mate piping a long call and two officers and a clutch of midshipmen once safely inboard lewrie doffed his hat to the flag at the taffrails the officers and the crew hastily assembled along both sailtending gangways above the bare gundeck and in the waist captain alan lewrie come aboard to command he told his two commission officers mine arse on a bandbox he gasped a second later though quite ruining the solemnity of the occasion mister spendlove last i saw of you twas ninetyseven when we paid off jester congratulations on your lieutenancy sir thank you sir lt clarence spendlove proudly replied geoffrey westcott sir the older officer said it appears im to be your first officer unless mister merriman turns up and proves senior to me your servant captain lewrie sir mister westcott how dye do sir lewrie said with another doff of his hat to match westcotts well shall we get on with it he turned to see that sir hugo had scaled the ships side right handily and both hugh and sewallis were behind him too one of ours sir lt westcott enquired as the both of them walked to the hammock nettings at the forward end of the quarterdeck and amidships no my son hughs down for captain thomas charlton and pegasus a twodecker lewrie told him his first ship ive never very much cared for kin on the same ship lewrie was too busy extracting his precious commissioning document from the safety of his coat to see westcotts approving nod he had eyes more for his sons and sir hugo who stood off to one side as he unscrolled his paper ships compny off hats and hark to the quarterdeck lt westcott ordered in a voice that would carry in a full gale by the commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral of great britain and ireland and all his majestys plantations and et cetera to captain alan lewrie hereby appointed to his majestys ship reliant by virtue of the power and authority to us given we do hereby constitute and appoint you captain of his majestys ship reliant willing and requiring you forthwith to go on board and take upon you the charge and command of captain in her accordingly strictly charging all the officers and company belonging to said ship subordinate to you to behave themselves jointly and severally in their respective employments with all due respect and obedience unto you their said captain and you likewise to observe and execute such orders and directions you shall receive from time to time from your superior officers for his majestys service hereof nor you nor any one of you fail as you will answer the contrary at your peril and for so doing this shall be your warrant given under our hands and the seal of office of admiralty this twentyfifth day of april eighteenohthree in the fourtythird year of his majestys reign he concluded in a matching quarterdeck voice the ritual done lewrie rolled up the document and looked down at his hands in the waist on the gangways men it seems that that corsican tyrant that ogre napoleon bonaparte hasnt learned his lesson yet like a wolf pretendin tbe a setter hed like tenter the house pretend he can grin and wag his tail and all the while just waitin to eat up the whole house and all of europe including our island your homes your people from lands end to john o groats only problem is nobody ever told napoleon ye cant playact a trusty setter if ye keep piddlin on the carpet and shittin in the parlour were called once again tteach him proper manners he told them as the laughter that his billingsgate not usually heard from a gentlemancaptain died away and if he cant learn tlive peaceful among the worlds nations then its our job the royal navy this fine frigate and every one of you volunteer or pressed man experienced tar or raw landsman true blue hearts of oak to put him down like a rabid stray like a ravenin wolf in the sheep fold that napoleon is and stop his business all french business for good and all before reliant raises anchor and sets sail on the kings business he promised them in a slightly softer voice i and your officers and mates will make sure that evry man jack of you know all you need tknow to work this ship to sail her into any corner of the wide world over as shipmates as men who can boast that theyre the best in the entire world that theyre british tars reliants that raised a cheer even from the dubious first draught of men from the impress tenders and the receiving ships thats all for now mister westcott aye sir ships compny on hats and dismiss carry on westcott ordered ah those two are ours sir lewrie said pointing to desmond and furfy who were just gaining the deck with the first light loads of lewries dunnage and the wicker cage for the cats who were peering wideeyed braced on their haunches with their noses to the wicker to sniff out their new home the cats sir lt westcott dared jape or the sailors youll find my coxn desmond and ordinary seaman furfy more use to you mister westcott lewrie drawled back in like humour my cats keep me from turnin a floggin tartar very good sir lt westcott said with a grin ill see to hoisting your goods aboard now the ceremony of reading himself in was over the midshipmen yet aboard reliant were circling round hugh very much like a pack of the aforementioned wolves ready to put john newcome in his place at the bottom of their pecking order gentlemen lewrie said going to rescue him allow me to name to you my son hugh who will be going aboard hms pegasus tomorrow and you are young sirs uhm vincent houghton sir the oldest and most senior of them quickly said he looked to be upwards of twenty as the navy required of a fellow who had done at least six years at sea and was able to stand before his first oral examinations for his lieutenancy may i name to you sir mister entwhistle a stocky lad about eighteen or so mister warburton that worthy was a slim fellow with dark red hair and a very fair complexion about fifteen or sixteen a lad with a cheeky expression and mister grainger sir the last was the youngest about fifteen lewrie judged a tad shorter than the rest and a bit chubbier were two short so far sir houghton said all of you have sea experience lewrie asked and was happy to learn that houghton and entwhistle had at least six years at sea in various ships whilst warburton had had one threeyear appointment and grainger the same damme lewrie chuckled someone at admiraltys erred badly tplace so many tarry young gentleman in the same ship stead of tossin us a pack of codsheads ill be countin on you to make sure we put to sea with a crew that knows the ropes count on us sir midshipman houghton vowed quickly seconded by the rest purser aboard lewrie asked further the marine officer mister cadbury sir houghton said he and his clerk and his jackinthebreadroom are ashore sir leftenant simcock went ashore with him tsee to wardroom stores very well catch up with em later lewrie decided which of you have a good copperplate hand two shot up their hands capital lewrie cried ill put you mister entwhistle and you mister grainger to copyin out my order book for six midshipmen and all officers blankfaced looks from the two volunteers faint sneers from the others even a snicker from warburton carry on lewrie told them uhm could we look about the ship father sewallis asked mister warburton lewrie said stopping him in his tracks would you mind showing my sons about the ship all the cautions of course sir ill be aft lewrie said turning to go but stopping at the foot of the larboard ladderway to the gundeck to watch his sons get the first bit of their tour sewallis a head taller in his usual dark and sobre suit his hat in his hands to bare his darker hair and hugh uniformed and kitted out in london before they had coached down his newstyled narrowbrimmed and thimbleshaped hat still on his head though with his mothers blonder hair tumbling in its usual unruly way over his shirt collar and his ears would she have been proud of his choice lewrie wondered much as caroline disliked it would she have cursed me for lettin him go to sea pushed him to it damned demandin what ye read sir hugo commented as he came to join him all my promotions and such started out with to our trusty and well belovedfill in the namegreetings well ye paid enough for em i shouldt wonder why the king wouldnt lewrie teased now there was a proper captain aboard whose privacy and goods must be guarded there was a marine private in full kit outside the door to the greatcabins right aft he stamped presented his musket in salute and roared sah good christ sir hugo barked once laying eyes on the place it was bare the blackandwhite chequer canvas deck cover was faded and worn the dealandcanvas partitions and all the inner faces of the planking above the line of empty gunports and the usual dark red paint below the wainscot lineeverything was done in a pale blue picked out with giltpainted mouldings replete with wee painted cherubs the last captain ship his wife with him or did he run a bawdy house repaint soonest lewrie vowed and turn yer cats loose sir hugo added pointing with his walkingstick at a particularly large rat with a brace of his smaller brothers busy gnawing at what might have once been a tufted dark blue pad atop the transom settee yer brothels got rats hee hee chapter thirtysix nce sending sir hugo hugh and sewallis ashore for a while as desmond and furfy supervised a workparty in setting up his cabins to his liking lewrie made it a point to meet the purser mr cadbury and his clerk the bosun mr sprague and his mate wheeler their master gunner who turned out to be the prussian johan rahl who had served with him long ago the gunners mate mr acres and the yeoman of the powder kemp sailmaker mr yearsley and his mate duncan and all of the people who formed the standing officers who lived aboard while she was laid up inordinary as well as those few other petty officers who had already come aboard then he spent some time with his lieutenants discussing the ships history her material condition her lacks and how many hands were aboard how many were rated able ordinary or landsmen and how many remained to be recruited by fair means or foul ive spoken with a printer sir lt westcott said though i have not yet placed an order didnt know who to advert as our captain you see he said with a grin how boastful to be lt geoffrey westcott was about lewries height of five feet nine inches a bit slimmer in build and carried himself with a quick urgency his hair was dark and cut quite short almost as short as a fellow ashore who preferred a wig and had his scalp shorn to keep the risk of bugs down he had a highcheeked and slightly narrow hatchet face which on a villain might have looked menacing westcott though seemed possessed of a merry if slightly worldlywise disposition he smiled rather a lot sometimes only the briefest flash of a smile with a lifting of his rather short upper lip to reveal his teeth weve a partial proof sir lt spendlove contributed showing lewrie a postersized sheet of paper which featured volunteers at the top the kings royal crest and gr iii and a paragraph of type that called for englishmen good and true etc below that came bold royal tars of old england but the rest was yet blank youve chosen a rondy mister westcott lewrie enquired i have sir a centrally located public house adjacent to the docks lt westcott assured him though i fear there are many more ships rendezvous in competition with us along with the impress services which will recruit for any ship i put a deposit down but ill repay you lewrie told him liking westcotts initiative well faint heart neer won fair ladies and well not reel anyone in without proper bait lets go allout and not be shy together they thrashed out the salient points that reliant a fifth rate frigate was spacious come all loyal searovers who wished action speed and dash and the chance of prizemoney never to be had aboard a ship of the line prime rations full issue of rum bounty to be paidј for able seamen ј for ordinary seamen ј for landsmen and ships boys and death to the french even in a hot press william pitts quota acts of had made the counties offer more and more to fill their required numbers and the navy had had to follow suit raising the joining bounty from the prewars single guinea or ј for able seamen and even then merchant service was more lucrative lets use my notoriety lewrie decided which resulted in the blurb that reliant was commanded by capt alan ramcat lewrie black alan the liberator of the west indies victor of dozens of sea fights amp fortunate in prizemoney confusion and death to the french true blue hearts of oak and all who seek glory and adventure ask of lieutenant g westcott at the et cetera and et cetera he concluded oh might toss in cape saint vincent camperdown and copenhagen too should that do it sirs toppingwell sir indeed lt westcott agreed i will seek out the printer this afternoon and have him polish it up ill go ashore with you mister westcott lewrie announced as he got to his feet as you can see i badly need new paint in this boudoir and you may fetch it back aboard as you return from the printers have desmond supervise the painting ill also lodge ashore for tonight to see my son off early tomorrow then will be back aboard by eight bells of the morning watch very good sir their last supper together at the george though quite tasty and filling was not without its uneasy moments there were many navy men and their wives dining there and hugh was enthralled by the sight of them all but preening in his midshipmans uniform and excited about the beginning of a naval career sir hugo told amusing tales about his military antics the clean ones it must be noted to raise sewallis from his gloom and disappointed mood when not discussing more practical matters lewrie mostly kept a sombre silence through their repast knowing what hugh was facing from his own experiences as a lowly mid and fearing all that weather the sea combat or stupid accidents could do to such an eager and callow thirteenyearold would he lose a child as well as a wife all of a sudden it struck him that once he saw the lad off in a boat to his new ship it was good odds that they might not see each other ever again and even if hugh prospered took to the navy like a duck to water grim duty might demand three or four years separation before rencontre and what sort of stranger might his youngest son be when they did manage to remeet he felt every bit of his fourty years and wondered where so much of them had gone but why cant i fight the french sewallis was asking fetching lewrie from his dreads its so unfair that hugh gets to go and i cant and i want to so very much youre eldest sewallis sir hugo gently told him its the way it is ancient right o primogeniture ye see the way things are done in english families i didnt ask to be first its sewallis protested as much protest as hed raise in such a distinguished supper crowd and as much as his usual reticence allowed firstborn sons always inherit everything sewallis the others have to make their own way lewrie explained its your place to be the elder to hugh and charlotte provide for them through good management of my estate which goes to you if i fall if uncle phineas takes our house and farm we wont have an estate would we sewallis cleverly though pettishly pointed out my investments in the funds my savings and your grandfathers place eventually is my estate our estate rather lewrie told him wondering what had gotten into him tdo that means ye have need of more education and business sense so ye dont go squanderin it all or make foolish decisions dont mean ye cant have a career of your own besides those duties as much a duty tyer family as hughs duty to his service and his ship sir hugo stuck in before waving for a topup of claret finish at your school perhaps a year or so at university lewrie went on sir hugo rolled his eyes heavenward to show what he thought of that and lewrie took a moment to shrug agreement with him or ye might wish tspeak with our solicitor mister mountjoy about learnin more about the law learn the cautions after terms there is my barrister macdoug all who might advise ye about entering one o the inns of court once youre of an age tlive in london on your own mind not before ever given thought what ye might wish tbe lad what career a civilian career that is ye wanted ttake up sir hugo asked him well i once thought of becoming a churchman like our vicar at saint georges sewallis hesitantly stated going up to oxford or cambridge then taking holy orders but he shrugged to silence that idea made sir hugo sit up like someone had goosed him and blare his eyes lewrie was forced to squint and fight the grimace that threatened to bloom on his phyz sir hugo coughed well and thats an honourable profession im bound lewrie was quick to say though shifting uneasily on his chair and theres many a churchman the eldest of his family with his own income beyond the manse the glebe and his share of the tithes he pointed out but since mother was murdered i only want to fight and kill frenchmen sewallis said with unaccustomed firmness i dont think i could ever take holy orders with that in my heart if not the navy could i not go into the army grandfather you once offered your influence at horse guards to help hugh obtain a commission know why they call downwind a soldiers wind sewallis because any fool can do it hugh took that moment to interject laughing at his own jape dont taunt your brother young man lewrie snapped its not the best timeyoure going and all of us not knowing when well clap eyes on each other again hugh though was irrepressible only pretending to be subdued turning back to sewallis lewrie said firstborn sons lives are never intentionally placed in jeopardy me lad like yer grandfather just said your familial duty is to grow up to be the heir and carry on the family name and properties younger sons in the army sir hugo added if theres a title or estate and their eldest brother passes ye know what they must do resign sell off their commissions and go back to civilian life ttake his place take on the late elder brothers duties to his family get the title the lands and rents and do right by his younger brothers and sisters seen enough of it in my time the old rascal grumbled take their seat in lords or stand for commons like harry embleton sewallis asked but hes in the army and hes sir romneys eldest if the king called out the yeomanry and the militia hed get to fight the french only if they invade us sewallis sir hugo said with a smirk of disapproval for that fool harry and the dubious worth of militia or the yeomanry theyll never be called tgo overseas to fight the french where the french are harrys just playin at soldierin well then couldnt i join harrys regiment at least i could get some military experience sewallis cajoled when school term is over lewrie wryly shook his head it would be too embarrassing and take much too long to explain to sewallis the enmity that harry still held for anyone named lewrie and why and how slim his odds were of a commission under harry embleton if harry ran the selectionand just how badly sewallis would be treated if he did get such a commission better ye enjoy whats left o your youth at dun roman with your grandfather son lewrie gently told him coach to london with him and stay a week or so now and again stay with your sister and yer uncle governour and aunt millicent too sir hugo was very quick to add looking as if hed bitten into a lemon at the suggestion that he give up his pleasurable activities to play daddy to the lad not the avuncular nowandagain grandfather do a summer term at school he hastily suggested i know its the way its done but it still seems so unfair sewallis mournfully said in a chindown sulk him stay with governour and millicent lewrie thought in dread good god theyll turn him against me too maybe he should go into one o the services fore i lose all my children uhm school father sewallis hesitantly said looking up headmaster said to tell you that the tuition uhm thought id paid it lewrie replied after a bite of juicy roast beef and a sip of wine ye took my noteofhand with you when ye returned for easter term not that one sewallis told him theres the extras for equitation the swordmaster the dancing instructor and all and there is a summer term not too many students attend and not all of the faculty are there but i suppose i could attend and take only a few courses that way i could have long weekends to visit grandfather in london now and then and theres an interval round midsummer day long enough to go home to anglesgreen and see charlotte and the family perhaps that might be best this summer at least sir hugo said after a long headcocked thought know how much itd be dye have a list of the extra fees ill foot it my treat hey thank you grandfather sewallis said to him with warmth if i must become half an an orphan then i suppose i must be about it as best i can and gain more education as you say father for fulfilling my lot in life could i feel any lower lewrie wondered any guiltier they retired fairly early since hugh had to rise so early the next morning hugh and sewallis to one bed and sir hugo and lewrie to another and the old bastard snored and made strangling noises like a wheezing ox about to expire sending hugh off to his own uncertain entry into a hard cruel adult life abandoning sewallis to his mournful and shy loneliness to be batted like a tennis ball between school his begrudging grandfather and his bitter kinfolk was enough to keep lewrie awake and tossing long into the night even without his fathers snores and the occasional fart to recall his parting with charlotte was even worse pahpah why must you go away shed wept at one minute then why cant mistress gower and her husband and my nanny take care of me at our house the next followed by must i move in with uncle governour and aunt millicent followed by will i keep my pony my dolls and my own bed my puppy no matter how much millicent assured her that all her things would be with her that she could play every day with her cousinshadnt it been grand last summer when she had stayed with them after all hadnt they had ever so much fun dont you know we love you like our owncharlotte had been disconsolate and utterly bereft but that was when mama was coming back shed stubbornly objected pahpah and mamathat was governours and millicents doing when he and caroline had coached away it had been daddy and mummy and she had been so gay delighted to spend her time at their estate and play to her hearts desire visiting her grandfathers estate daily changin her into their sort o miss priss lewrie fumed then had come the hateful vindictive along with a fresh flood of tears and wails id still have my mama if you hadnt taken her off to france id still have my house the way things were but for you she didnt have to add i hate you just go away to wound him any deeper as shed stomped her feet ignored all his attempts to explain it was the french whod taken her mother she had shrunk from his attempt to hug her and console her then dashed from the parlour and the house screaming inarticulately with a flying banshees wail recalling that all over again made lewrie start fully awake and upright in bed to scrub his face with both hands and wish for dawn seeing again millicents stricken look and governours grim satisfaction awakened at am to dress scrub up comb their hair and for the adults to shave and they were down to the dining room for breakfast even more subdued than they had been at supper say goodbyes here sewallis father lewrie instructed hugh and i will go on to the docks by ourselves hey they were english of the country gentry so public displays of emotion were not for them sir hugo chucked hugh under the chin and told him that he was proud of him and that he should be careful and follow all his orders and remember to uphold the lewrie name and its honour yer fathers brought lustre to it and ye can do no less so long hugh sewallis said his arms folded cross his chest and his chin up ill write you be sure to too right tell us of how you get along you lucky imp gbye sewallis hugh said in return sticking out his hand to shake give my regards to the other lads at school put ink in the proctors port like we planned and when you go to grandfathers make sure you see to my horse now and then well ive a cart for your dunnage lewrie said ill be back in a bit have a bit of time before i go aboard reliant and you coach back to london and we can say our goodbyes right ready hugh aye sir hugh replied easily turning nautical the carter trundled along before them as they strolled along behind past the last of the civilian part of town to the dockyards and the warehouses then to the docks it was a raw day with solid grey overcast clouds and a fitful april wind damp and a bit chilly strong enough to clatter halliards and blocks and make the seabirds complain as hugh and his father reached the stone stairs down to the boat landing one for pegasus lewrie shouted to the bargees selecting the nearest lugsailed boat the size of his gig and leaving it to its twoman crew and the carter to heave hughs seachest into it well hugh muttered childishly shuffling his feet in his new pair of hessian boots eager to be away yet loath to say a real nighpermanent farewell god how i hate this hugh lewrie spat i know its what ye want what ye were fated for as my second son but still it hurts tsee ye off navys a damned hard life no matter youre in great hands with thom charlton ill worry bout ye every day ill be fine father just you see hugh assured him naпve despite all the cautions lewrie had drummed into him well put the french in their place here lewrie said reaching into his boatcloak your navy pay as a midshipman aint much so youll be needin some extra funds soon as ye report to captain charlton give him this tdole out tye the midshipmens messll always have need to whip round for luxuries just dont let the others gull ye outta your money on foolishness or gamblin and dont let on youre better off than ye are or youll be the one they strip right down to your bones he gave him a noteofhand and a small washleather purse containing ten pounds of coin and this from the small of his back hooked to his own sword belt under his uniform coat he withdrew a midshipmans dirk in its scabbard wondered why i didnt buy ye one in london thats because i was havin my old one regilt leather of the scabbards a bit worn but thatd happen to a newun too after a few months at sea your own dirk hugh exclaimed turning it over in his hands drawing it and waving it in the weak sunshine his eyes agleam in joy take good care of it mind lewrie told him and showed him how to slip it through the white leather frog on his belt and how to thread the clamshell catch into the slit in the leather there he said further satisfied that it was secure and when you attain your lieutenancy my old hanger will be yours too your napoleon hanger hugh gasped no daddy sir not that one ill not wear a sword that murderer touched thisun then lewrie offered patting the hanger that hung at his left side when the time comes hugh looked relieved and nodded his beaming acceptance well then might notve said it often enough but you must remember that i love you hugh lewrie told him wishing he could put his arms round the lad kneel down and give him a good squeeze and i am so proud of you i could bust my regards to thomas charlton and my thanks for taking you into his ship spose its time though he said pulling out his watch to check the time might take half an hour treach pegasus on this wind and its best did you report just at eight bells and the change of watch goodbye da father sir hugh manfully said sticking out his hand for an adult shake though his eyes had suddenly gone a bit tearful they shook and to shun the grief lewrie pulled him in to give him that last brief hug after all and thump him on his back remember all the pranks were played on me when i first joined the molasses in the hammock come hear the dogfish bark gather dilberries from the maintop and for gods sake never go cryin for a marine private cheeks and absolutely refuse if they play building a galley ill remember sir hugh said with a shaky laugh as he stepped back settled the fit of his coat and doffed his hat in a salute which lewrie returned in equally grave manner write me often as you can ill write as well goodbye hugh make us proud then hugh was down the slippery greencoated stairs and into his boat she shoved off the lugsail raised as soon as the last of her dock lines was free lewrie stood with his hat aloft for another long minute and hugh gaily waved back at him with his til the boat was fully under way already shrunk to a toy another minute or so and it was almost lost in the early morning boat traffic and that was the end of a major part of lewries life his care for his children his role of a father now what he had was a ship and a war book v let the die be cast begin the war and try your mettle yet my case is already won with so many brave around me gaius petronius the road to crotуn chapter thirtyseven never seen the like sir lt westcott marvelled again as a fresh boatload of real actual willing volunteers came aboard direct from the rendezvous tavern weve almost all our necessary hands rated able lack but a dozen ordinary seamen and so awash in landsmen and boys that the surgeon mister mainwaring is rejecting people for piles and lack of teeth i told you i was notorious mister westcott lewrie drawled as he enjoyed a morning cup of coffee on the quarterdeck a bit of fame good or bad deserved or otherwise goes a long way my sort well ive dined out on it for years wonder of wonders people in portsmouth had flocked to his recruiting rondy free black sailors from the west indies who knew him as saint alan the liberator a sobriquet he detested because he had stolen a dozen plantation slaves on jamaica and made them free to crew hms proteus back in there were irish and west country men whod heard that he had a lucky geas upon him good cess the lure of prizemoney and adventure had brought some eager young lads that and the fact that frigates had more elbowroom per hand than other ships will cony had come through with his offer of local lads from anglesgreen two hay waggons of them for a total of twentyone they would be landsmen of course totally ignorant and unable to hand reef or steer but they could learn and they could man the guns haul the lines and fight god amighty lads but for tuppence id gladly sail with ya all will had declared when hed come out to the ship with them and assured lewrie that hed sternly told them what theyd be in for so every man jack of em was there willingly despite what shipboard life would be like the third lieutenant george merriman had shown up and he had proved to be no threat to westcotts seniority merriman had passed his examinations bare months before the peace of amiens and had lingered on halfpay as a passed midshipman til the government had decided to go back to war his name fit him aptly for he was a cheerful sort their last two midshipmen had reported aboard both very young and with only a year or two at sea between them the twelveyearold was named munsell the thirteenyearold midshipman was the honourable phillip rossyngton rossyngton lewrie had exclaimed at the time i served with a midshipman rossyngton in the old shrike brig the tailend of the american revolution any kin my father sir rossyngton had proudly said soon as we knew who commanded reliant he said to extend to you his fondest regards he said i would be in good hands though at risk of cat scratches and are you as big a tongueincheek scamp as he was lewrie had teased but of course sir im a midshipman and allowed it the lad had rejoined with a laugh that had made him feel even more ancient the last time he had seen rossyngton whod been about seventeen or eighteen and the lad was his second or third son after that even more people from his past showed up reliants ships cook the typical onelegged lamed gammer who had been a part of the standing officers whilst laid up inordinary a jack nastyface whose idea of done was either burnt black or boiled to the bones had finally become too feeble to serve and pled for discharge and a pension to replace him up had popped gideon cooke one of the beauman plantation slaves lewrie had freed on jamaica hed cooked for scores of slaves and when liberated had taken cooke with an e as his new name and the crew of the proteus frigate had sworn theyd never eat so well in any ship then there was pettus his former cabin steward in his previous ship hms thermopylae hed practically fallen into lt westcotts arms outside the recruiting rondy so eager was he to sign aboard explaining that hed been lewries man before whatve ye been up to since pettus lewrie had just had to ask did you ever get back together with that girl of yours nan thankee for recalling sir pettus had told him i traipsed about doing this and that til i landed a place as barman at the black spread eagle as for nancy though time i finally discovered her whereabouts and her employment well there was another man had her heart pettus had said heaving a worldweary shrug shed married and already had a babe and ye know sir he resignedly had related perking up though he asked still have your cats sir toulon and chalky along with desmond and furfy itd be good to see them again sir if youll have me as your steward that is but ill gladly sign aboard for anything hed vowed i do and theyll all be glad tsee you again too pettus lewrie had assured him and put him to work straightaway pettus had proved very useful too in discovering a cook for the greatcabins and a lad whod serve as the cabin servant he knew a man who fancied himself a chef whod lost his position when the chophouse he worked in burned to the ground a few weeks back and was yet in need of a new place pettus was quick to vouch for joseph yeovill and his culinary skills he even came with his own pots pans knives and utensils and a middling chest of spices and sauces and from the intake of youngsters who would serve as servants and powder monkeys pettus had chosen a likely orphan with a quick wit and a very sketchy year or so of schooling a twelveyearold lad by name of jessop who til hed signed ships articles looked to be a halfstarved street waif puppygrateful to be issued clean clothing have three meals a day and a pittance of pay to boot lastly lt westcott had presented lewrie with a likely fellow to be his clerk james faulkes had been an apprentice clerk to one of portsmouths counting houses and had just completed his terms of indenture though he seemed to suffer pettuss malady for hed not only been let go from his position when the previous owner died but faulkes had recently been disappointed in love and like many a heartsick young cully believed that the lass whoever she was would take pity on him and accept his suit did he run away to sea no matter for his handwriting was copperplate and precise his sums always added up and he seemed very organised of course reliant had to resort to the impress service drawn mostly from the quota men a group that most officers most tars looked on askance they were the derelicts the drunks the chronically underemployed and desperately poor the turfedout farm labourers who had nothing once the crops were in for the winter the foolish and unwary civilians who had been swept up willhenillhe from the streets public houses and brothels by press gangs eager to make their numbers whether the men they collared were sailors or not and the petty criminals from the gaols with them came the risk that theyd been got at by radical levelling troublemakers and their french jacobin ideas as well as the theft and pilfering that came with them some of them surely would be insubordinate obstreperous sealawyers constant discipline problems the leaders and enforcers of the slyboot cliques that would try to dominate their decent messmates prey on the others rations tobacco and rum issue their better slopclothing and shoes with violence or the threat of it given his druthers lewrie would have gladly arranged a swap with the armyhis worst men for cashand spent the proceeds on joining bounties or bribes to the regulating captain of the impress or one of his more venal subordinates but needs must in war time and as reliant filled with men and boys she filled herself to the gills with supplies a constant stream of barges hulks and hoys came alongside beginning at eight bells and the start of the forenoon watch at am and might not cease til the middle of the first dog at pm clean new water casks first then thousands of gallons of water from the hoys were pumped below to fill them bales of slopclothing to garb the hands blue chequered shirts red neckerchiefs and white sloptrousers cotton and wool stockings and waistlength dark blue jackets with brass buttons bags of shoes and steel buckles square wood trenchers or cheap china plates and bowls bales of blankets and bed sheets piles of thin battstuffed mattresses and pillows and the canvas hammocks in which theyd be placed kegs of saltbeef and saltpork came aboard from the victualling board warehouses all carefully inspected by the purser mr cadbury to ensure that none were spoiled rotten or previously condemned and the brand marks effaced there was no guarantee though that the kegs actually contained eightpound chunks of preserved meat and not more bone and gristle than meat or folded scraps of old sailcloth masquerading as rations dropped in to bring the keg up to the proper weight cheeses oatmeal small beer safer to drink than water after a couple of months in cask wine both red and white better known among sailors as black strap and miss taylor respectively vinegar and tobacco dried raisins currants and plums for duffs and puddings in the rare instances came aboard as well and bread each man aboard got a pound of it a day though issued at fourteen ounces to the pound else the purser would not profit in the form of prebaked biscuit a toothbreaker unless soaked when it was fresh and a crumbling dusty slab of cracker riddled by weevils after six months at sea salt and pepper meat sauces sugar honey and everdesired mustard to liven the taste of the rations and the flour for the duffs were solely in the cooks possession though mustard pots could be purchased by each eightman mess for a fee to the purser two complete sets of sails plus spares and acres of sailcloth for repairs patching or whole refashioning came to the frigate along with tar pitch resin and turpentine miles of cable and rope from thighthick cables for the anchors to smallstuff twine and enough spare yards and upper masts to totally replace any shot away in battle or lost to weather all the sailmakers or the bosuns vital stores and hundreds of boardfeet of lumber for atsea repairs the upper masts had to be set up to lewries and lt westcotts standards the miles of standing and running rigging roved and blocks of varying purchase placed at the most efficient locations belaying pins in pinrails and fiferails had to be sent for from shore once the rigging was set up lewrie found that lt westcott agreed with his notion that their ship would be more weatherly if the jibboom and bow sprit were steeved at a shallower angle than the usual upthrust boartoothed manner and the jibs and upper foretopmast staysls were made larger and deeper then came the artillery hms reliant rated twentyeight pounder greatguns eight quarterdeck pounders two pounders for chase guns and eight pounder carronades all with the wood truckcarriages or pivotting wood recoil slides the carriages came aboard first the cannon second then came the kegs and kegs of black powder to fill the belowdecks magazine all the gun tools to load worm out swab or shift the united carriages and barrels and a bale or two of empty cartridge bags for the master gunner his mate and the yeoman of the powder to fill and stow away and cutlasses and boarding pikes and muskets with all their accoutrements and clumsy and inaccurate sea pattern pistols to be put in the locked arms chests til needed for drill or combat it was a neverending series of barges of hoisting aboard with the mainmast course yard as a crane and human muscle power to hoist it all from the boats over the bulwarks and gangways and down onto the deck or into the holds just above the bilges or onto the orlop and each and every bit of admiraltys largesse seemingly down to each pot of mustard or each shoe buckle had to be signed for and carefully inventoried by both purser and captain the usage and depletion of which over the course of the ships typical threeyear commission was to be carefully meticulously accounted for as well or the ones responsible would be at their financial peril ten days it took to prepare hms reliant for sea for journeys to any of the far corners of the world for battle against the foe and alan lewrie found that he revelled in it it was not so much that he sprang from his bedcot each morning at the end of the middle watch at am with joy no it was more like being so engrossed in details in projects in planning and supervising the labours of stowing and arming that he had no time to brood on his childrens fates the coming loss of his rented farm and his house or the lingering remnants of grief over carolines loss he found that he could actually go an entire day without thinking of all that so busy with making decisions that it was only in those rare hours he spent on shore purchasing things he would need three months six months at sea or the evenings when he dined alone and did not invite his officers and midshipmen in a few at a time to get a better grasp of them and their personalities that he had time in a proper captains solitude for musing over twentythree years in kings coat he realised one evening as he sprawled on his familiar old settee his stockinged feet rested on his low old hindoo brass traytable before it with a cat nodding on either thigh and a glass of claret in his hand and now this is all i am my fathers house for a home do i ever set foot ashore again the navy a substitute family just damn my eyes mine arse on a bandbox all these young sprogs come aboard middies and children of mids from long ago good christ he supposed it was natural and inevitable did he live long enough there were only so many warships and only so many officers to command them large as the royal navy had grown since and the start of the war with france it was still a small esoteric and arcane world of its own and he had risen to become a somewhat senior member of that salty tarstained clique he had to stumble across former shipmates sometime whether they were worth the time to know again well that was another matter you ready tgo tsea again lads lewrie whispered to chalky and toulon they opened their eyes to stare at him chalky yawning as he stretched every muscle front legs out straight by god i think that i am no more shore shite lets get orders and be about it chalky took that comment as an invitation to stand arch up and clamber up his chest ready to play chapter thirtyeight the next two weeks at anchor were spent at harbour drill the basic training of lubbers and johnny newcomes in the mystifying maze of sheets halliards lines and cables of braces jears and lifts clews and brails the proper way to tie a host of knots at sea to go aloft and lay out on a yard to set sail to reef in or gasket to strike or hoist up topmasts without being injured maimed or killed older experienced hands got the rust scaled off their skills as well and were urged to take newlies under their tutelage men who had never touched a firearm or held anything more dangerous than the hoe axe or scythe in their civilian lives learned how to wield the cutlass and boarding pike and were made familiar with pistol and musket til the loading charging and firing process could be done with some skill and speed dryfiring first then livefiring at a painted target on a scrap sail held aloft by two oars in an anchored rowboat at fifty yards range off the ships beamwith no one aboard it of course during the firing and well clear of other ships or workboats beyond it the ships people practiced with the swivel guns as well then came practice on the greatguns the quarterdeck pounders and carronades the pounder chase guns and the heavy main artillery pieces down each beam with half the hands hauling quickly on the runin tackles to simulate recoil to teach the newlies how quickly and brutally arms and legs could be broken feet torn off or crushed did they not look lively and keep clear of the truckcarriages and their tackles blocks and ring bolts lewrie could not risk actually loading and firing roundshot in crowded portsmouth harbour but he could spend powder in fullmeasure charges to get his people used to the noise and the heartfluttering lungflattening power of their discharge along with the drill that would hopefully result in three broadsides every two minutes then when orders came they came in a rush barely after his morning shave and spongeoff lewrie was summoned to the deck noting the arms of the semaphore towers in town working like demented dervishes hardinge sir a midshipman said doffing his hat to present himself from the modeste sixtyfour captain stephen blanding he wishes s you and your first officer to attend him on board as soon as possible sir indeed mister hardinge lewrie replied deciding to put on a scowl of displeasure hands in the small of his back why the haste and not a written request he pretended to grump haste indeed captain lewrie sir the young fellow assured him chin up and proud to be his captains emissary on a vital mission i am given to believe a squadron will be formed for a specific duty and captain blanding wishes me to inform you that this morning word came from admiralty that the king has given orders to begin issuing letters of marque and reprisal if that satisfies you as to the urgency of the matter sir that does mister hardinge lewrie answered feeling a thrill of satisfaction that what all had expected had come to pass mister warburton pass the word for mister westcott at once my compliments to him and that he is to attend me in proper order aye aye sir his own midshipman warburton shot back beaming with joy that it would be war where away mister hardinge lewrie asked of modestes anchorage after turning aside to summon his coxn and boat crew off the monkton fort sir yonder hardinge supplied she will be the twodecker flying a broad pendant with white ball and has dark red hull stripes sir cant miss her speak for yourself young sir lewrie japed its a bit too early for my coxns eyes captain blanding plannin to breakfast us i am certain he will sir midshipman hardinge further assured him smiling for the first time and relaxing his tense pose hed not had his head bitten off after all a red broad pendant with a white ball upon it denoted a senior officer who would command a small squadron a postcaptain who for all appearances might as well be a commodore but lacked that rank and had to captain his own ship without another of postrank to take that burden and modeste his putative flagship was a sixtyfour gunned twodecker of the third rate with a french name and of obvious french constructiona previous capture for certain sixtyfours were a bit too light to stand in the lineofbattle anymore but were still useful outside european waters her lines the fineness of her entry and bow and her aft taper made her look fast for a twodecker i live long enough i could do worse when my frigate daysre done lewrie told himself as he took the salute from modestes marines and sideparty then was escorted aft to capt blandings greatcabins under the poop captain lewrie and lieutenant westcott of the reliant sir his escorting midshipman announced aha lewrie captain stephen blanding said with a glad bark of pleasure and welcome as he came from his sideboard in the diningcoach cup and sauncer in one hand and the other out for a cheerful shake heard of you sir good things all welcome aboard my wee barge mister westcott is it welcome aboard to you as well blanding was a stocky fellow no doubt strong as an ox but giving a rolypoly aged cherub impression with his belly girth and his very curly long blond hair which he still wore clubbed back into a long sailors queue bound with black riband the others say they know you well captain lewrie blanding said waving his tea cup and saucer hand at the other officers seated in the daycabin captain stroud of the cockerel frigate and captain parham of pylades good god above it is a family reunion lewrie blurted out at the sight of them william parham had long ago been one of his mids aboard the alacrity gun ketch a converted bomb tween the wars in the bahamas stroud we were together in the adriatic in ninetysix sir captain stroud more sobrely told him i was first officer in myrmidon a commander fillebrownes sloop of war aye lewrie said going to shake hands with him warmly even though he barely recalled him i do recall he lied congratulations on your command captain stroud and cockerel my first ship in ninetythree as her first officer a fine vessel even if her old captain and all his kin aboard drove us nigh to mutiny and madness lewrie recalled to himself and parham look at how youve risen since lewrie went on greeting yet another old shipmate and pylades im sure you know that she was with us in the adriatic too with captain stroud captain benjamin rodgerss old ship and you surely recall him from the bahamas ha ha indeed i do sir parham enthusiastically replied happy to serve with you again happy indeed and pray do express my greetings to your good lady when next you write her and say that i recall her kindnesses to callow young mids in those days quite fondly ah lewrie said i he stumbled as a chill came over the cabins with blanding coughing into his fist and ahemming mistress lewrie was most foully murdered by the french last year sir blanding told parham by that tyrannical despot napoleon bonapartes orders to murder captain lewrie here as well god i am so sorry sir i didnt the news of it did not reach me til this very instant parham stammered blushing deeply the bastard parhams first officer spoke up condolences sir strouds first lieutenant said and lewrie gawped to see that that worthy was martin hyde yet another of his midshipmen from hms jester hyde by god ive an old friend of yours as my second lieutenant clarence spendlove lewrie informed him as they greeted each other spendlove sir aye id admire a chance to come aboard and renew his acquaintance before we sail lt hyde said glowing with delight well now ive drug you all from your breakfasts pray allow me to provide one whilst we get further acquainted and i discover to you what this is all about capt blanding chearly offered he introduced parhams first lieutenant bilbrey and his own lt gilbraith all round as they took their seats there were hot slices of hamslabs ratherthere were crisp rashers of bacon sizzling spiced sausages even smoked kippers with all that came fresh eggs scrambled or fried to individual order shredded potato hash and fresh loaves of bread from a shore bakery cut two fingers thick offered with a hunk of butter as big as a mans fist and four different pots of jam all sluiced down with coffee or tea to each officers preference they reminisced for a time and it was all quite jolly sharing memories and hijinks of younger days modestes first lieutenant mr gilbraith mostly followed his captains example as a trencherman par excellence chuckling over others war stories now and then whilst piling it down as heartily as captain blanding did stroud well as lewrie remembered him hed been a drab muchputupon figure who made very little impression a grey sort of fellow of unremarkable expression and wit or looks two of em with but the one epaulet on their right shoulders lewrie took note as he ate less than three years seniority and both parham and stroud commandin fifth rate gunners anyone to join us later i wonder or am i tbe second in seniority in whatever this turns out tbe all stuffed captain blanding asked at last wont eat this well where were going belcher clear away then take everyone out on deck for a spell ill call should i have need of you a bit more conversation of the idle sort as the tablecloth and plates were cleared and fresh pots of coffee or tea set on the sideboard for their convenience and the steward and cabinservants left now then blanding said by way of beginning rubbing his hands together with as much eagerness as hed greeted his first helping of breakfast in point of fact capt blanding put lewrie in mind of commodore ayscough with all his boisterous bonhomie and energetic way minus the haggises boiled mutton and bagpipers of course the crowns decided theres no living with the french so were going back to war no secret there what were to do is to seek out intercept if possible in european waters but if they slip past us go in chase of and bring to action a french squadron preparing to sail to the americas specifically from bonapartes little puppet batavian republicholland to good christiansfor new orleans any of us familiar with new orleans and spanish louisiana i am sir lewrie piped up wishing he could let out the buttons of his breeches after such a feast i was there once excellent captain blanding barked with delight i trust your experience in those waters will prove of eminent use in our endeavour sir why spanish louisiana sir captain parham asked raising one hand like a dutiful student id think the french would wish to establish a stronger naval presence at martinique or guadeloupe after we handed those colonies back to them last year before we place all their coast under blockade once more or a new squadron at cape franзois on saint domingue wed not winkle them out of there without an army lt martin hyde added sensible conjectures all captain blanding congratulated as he stirred sugar into his fresh cup of coffee but the fact of the matter is about two years ago napoleon made a secret treaty with the king of spain to exchange tuscany or etruria or whichever pisspot conquest of his in italy for the return of louisiana and new orleans seems the king of spain has a new brotherinlaw with nowhere to hang his crown or needs a crown and a place to hang it suitably grandsounding to suit his dignity bonaparte would get the incredibly rich trade entrepфt of new orleans and territory to the west of the united states so vast that no one knows how far it goes well blanding hooted neither great britain nor our republican american cousins would ever stand for that and even the corsican halfbreed ogre could realise the fact yet for a time he did consider building an american empire and gathered an army in holland to go take formal possession this whole past winter theres been a general victor in holland with an army of three or four demibrigades whatever the pluperfect hell those are anyone my brotherinlaw tells me a demibrigade is about two thousand men sir lewrie contributed with engineers artificers and a large artillery contingent to fortify new orleans and the forts strung down the mississippi at the major bends that might be an army as big as ten thousand men cant cram much more than five hundred of them aboard each transport so thatd be twenty ships plus escort damme that would mean at least six or eight lineofbattle ships and frigates capt parham spoke up mean to say sir are we all thats meant to oppose them thank the good lord this victor chap was iced in all winter and has had foul winds all spring during which time the situation has changed captain blanding was quick to assure them laughing the thought away even before easter anyone could see the wars renewal if they paid the slightest bit of attention or read but one newspaper a month we will not face such a large force you see captain blanding got as close to the dining table as his girth would admit hunching bearlike on his elbows as he imparted his news in a softer mutter there are sources in paris dye see what sort i mean they tell our people who deal in such matters that bonaparte has given up on his dreams for an american empire and will settle for cash with which to expand his army and navy and prepare to fight us the french foreign minister talleyrand has been negotiating the sale of new orleans and all of formerly spanish louisiana to the yankee doodles holy shit on a biscuit lewrie thought stunned and what will charitй de guilleri make o that i wonder hide a pistol up her bum get to handkissin range and shoot that bastard bonaparte serve her right serve him right and spare us a sea o bloodshed so theyll still send a squadron to louisiana sir parham enquired puzzled and do our sources say how big it is much smaller for certain captain blanding said leaning back and making his poor collapsible dining chair creak alarmingly else admiralty would not be sending only four ships in pursuit of them i expect that the french will now use the formal exchange as a pretext for despatching more warships to the west indies perhaps even using the suddenly neutral port of new orleans as a shelter for frigates and privateers if there are transports i also expect that they will be sent into cape franзois on saint domingue to reenforce whats left of their army fighting the slave rebellion poor devils perhaps only one or two of those demibrigades will sail with a much smaller escort which might see a single battalion to new orleans to make the ceremony of handing the place over all elegant and shiny fireworks cannonades a saluting volley or three a band playing la marseillaise he disparaged with another hearty chuckle then the french warships are free to pursue a guerre du course against our west indies trade excuse me sir but the french would find new orleans not very useful to them even if it were american and neutral lewrie pointed out the city is over an hundred miles upriver from the mouth of the delta so the best they could do would be to establish themselves at the head of passes and fort balise where the mississippi flows out to the gulf through several easily blockaded passes fort balise is a small weak and easily defeated water bastion but once the exchange is done its an american fort and i doubt our yankee cousins would let them anchor there or supply them with goods from the city if were now at war with france youve seen this fort balise blanding asked intrigued aye sir lewrie replied trying as usual for the proper english poohpoohing modesty but again as usual failing badly at it that and the city of new orleans in fact a job of work for some foreign office types a few years ago in mufti as the hindoos say french creole patriots who wanted spain out and france back in and turned pirate tfinance their scheme dye see thats not tsay the creoles and the pirates and privateersmen still there might not wish thelp the frogs but i dont see it done directly from new orleans covert supplyin through the bayous to barataria timbalier or terrebonne bay or further west out of atchafalaya or the cote blanche bays but those are all very shallow waters sir barely deep enough for local schooners or small brigs not corvettes or frigates and they are bad holdingground in a blow with no shelter from the barrier islands id expect one stiff diplomatic note from you sir to the new american authorities would force em to kick the french out and sit on anyone whod sell em supplies if panton leslie amp company still does business in new orleans we could send a boat to fort balise and a letter upriver and know which merchant houses are involved within a fortnight then turn em in to the local american government internment by god lt gilbraith blandings first officer perked up and spoke for the first time since might you pass me that strawberry jampot sir over an hour before do we bottle them up and send that note the french could not remain forever at anchor in the city or at this bloody fort where the river forks the americans could be convinced to enforce the threeday rule and tell the french squadron to sail or surrender their ships on parole til the end of the current hostilities they come out to give us honourable battle or they strike their colours and hang out in new orleans taverns til the last trump and either way weve eliminated them as a threat ha germane and canny as usual jemmy captain blanding told him but dash my eyes weve orders to go looking for a fight and ill be very disappointed should it end that way i want powder smoke and close broadsides struck colours prizes and a slew of dead frogs to which fierce sentiment they all gave loud hearty huzzahs pray god then gentlemen lewrie seconded we catch them up at sea before they can take shelter in any french possession or get to the mouth of the mississippi i wager we all wish an ocean of frog blood and huzzahs for that too how soon might your ships be ready to sail captain blanding demanded posing the question to each captain and first officer two days more for pylades only one for cockerel this very afternoon for modeste gilbraith was quick to announce and a oneday delay from lt westcott we lack the last of wardroom provisions and livestock sir westcott said we could fall down to saint helens patch whilst we see to all that if i may suggest sir he said turning to lewrie for permission a long sail or row for the victuallers captain blanding but he concluded with a shrug and one of his brief toothbaring grins lewrie took note for the first time that westcott had a pug nose almost irish in its short sweep chicks blanding boomed aloud chicks and rabbits and game hens they take much less room in the manger and much less feed and water than pigs turkeys or beef on the hoof mature rapidly and are prolific at reproduction a sack of fat rats tbe let loose in the flour sirs lewrie suggested tongueincheek cant forget tfeed our midshipmen id imagine weve rats enough for a dozen ships by now sir captain blanding roared with laughter slamming a meaty palm on the table top in appreciative mirth saint helens patch it will be as quick as dammit soon as youre all back aboard your ships i trust your frigates will prove fast enough to keep up with me sirs she is french modeste and very quick for a sixtyfour or so her former captains records tell me shes six more feet of waterline than the usual sixtyfour from our yards second one of the same name weve taken off the frogs blanding happily imparted with a wink built at toulon in ninetyseven and lost in the med a year later oned think the french would see her names bad luckfor them at any rateand drop it for good uhm harbour drill sir lewrie had to point out weve barely had a fortnight to train the landsmen and newcomes id like at least another ten days of it before considerin my lads ready for sea and battle to get the best speed from reliant from all of our ships and safe and efficient handlin well he trailed off as he took note of the disappointed looks round the table growl we may but go we must lewrie captain blanding said with a scowl aye were all short of complete training but take a page from the french and deem our crews ready enough to get to sea then work them to perfection on the voyage what to war gentlemen blanding bellowed in a throaty growl with another slam of his palm on the table top for emphasis we will shift our anchorages down to saint helens patch and pray for a fair wind just as soon as you complete your lading from there we will prowl twixt ushant and scilly til the french come down to us or should we miss them there well hare cross the atlantic in pursuit into the west indies and gulf of mexico either way i am bound to see all of them in hell before were done admiraltys chosen us given us specific orders blanding said in a calmer tone fussing a bit with his coat lapels given us a grand opportunity and a demanding task to smite the devil on his snout right from the outset and he is napoleon bonaparte if not satan come to the world then his dread minion the antichrist as many people of my circle have come to suspect of late we on a personal crusade o his lewrie asked himself suddenly wary of such an apocalyptic outlook and the messianic zeal for such a quest blanding might display to their overall detriment when they did cross hawses with the french squadron how bout we fetch back the holy grail too or the golden fleece his captains and sailors are the devils disciples and i mean to see them returned below as failed imps and demons captain blanding declared with a roar which delighted everyone attable with lewrie the only leery exception though he did throw in a wee huzzah just to be sociable youve chaplains aboard gentlemen blanding enquired no ah well no matter for mine shall suffice for all does wind and sea allow his calling aboard each ship for divine services on sundays and with god with us who can be against us hey my god ive been got at by a leapin methodist lewrie quailed chapter thirtynine the crowns issuance of letters of marque and reprisal had been announced on the sixteenth of may by the nineteenth their little squadron had briefly set sail and had come to new anchorages in st helens patch near the isle of wight to await a suitable slant of wind thankfully the weather had proved perverse for several more days giving lewrie and his officers warrants and petty officers just a bit more time to train and exercise their raw crew with sailhoisting reefing and handing and recovering the anchors and stowing the thick cables of the most importance and only three hours of the working days spent on the artillery or small arms at long last on the morning of the twentythird of may the wind came round to the noreast and a flurry of signal flags fluttered up hms modestes halliards so many and so quickly that lewrie could imagine the boisterous and impatient captain blanding standing over his men and patting a foot drumming his fingers on his substantial midriff and clucking at the delay human failure and beelzebubs minions all ships numbers and to weigh twoblocked sir midshipman entwhistle cried with a telescope pressed to one eye hands are at stations to weigh sir lt westcott reported very well lewrie replied upanchor and make sail when the preparative is struck mister westcott aye aye sir lt westcott said eyes glued to the wee bit of bunting aboard the flagship i must own it feels rather good tgo to sea again lewrie idly commented hands in the small of his back head down and pacing his quarterdeck for you mister westcott well sir considering the deprivation and discomfort were in for i may be of two minds westcott confessed with a brief grimace and i thank you for a last night ashore in which i could savour the pleasures we leave behind tother day wine women song a fine repast or two women he flashed one of those short teethbaring grins which was as quickly gone i trust she was handsome sir lewrie asked lifting a brow in surprise to hear his first officer admit hed rantipoled one of them special they were uhm both equally fetching and special sir lt westcott said with a sly smile christ am i in the presence of a master cocksman lewrie just had to wonder two in one night hes miles ahead o me even on my best old days are either of good family then our sailing is your salvation sir lewrie barked in amusement so to speak indeed sir westcott replied chuckling preparative is down sir midshipman entwhistle cried get us under way sir lewrie ordered turning sterner hms reliants departure was not exactly manowar fashion or even bristol fashion it was sloppy and inelegant no matter how much time had been spent at harbour drill the lighter kedge anchor had come up easily from the ooze the slimy thighthick cable trotted forward in an undulating snake but the best bower proved stubborn and the confusion at the main capstan to wind up the messenger could have been almost laughable if it had not been a serious matter yards creaked up from their rests as acockbill as theyd be set for a sea burial and sailtending linesand braces once half the sails were unfurledwere swaying loose and free til the bosun and his mate and the petty officer mastcaptains bellowed roared and rushed among the raw newlies to urge them to tail on and haul it did not help that much larger squadrons of third rate lineofbattle ships first and second rate threedecked flagships leading them out had been waiting for that shift of wind to sail and take up blockading stations off the french coast too each of them thinking that their orders took precedence over the others and especially took precedence over a lowly and her three frigates closest ive seen to bedlam since the last time i toured the realun with a water squirt and a pokin stick lewrie told himself as reliant at last got way enough on to be steered into modestes wake and take station in a very rough inlineahead with his head swivelled like a crazed compass needle to avoid so many imminent collisions if this is the best we can do after a year idle god help us reliant ghosted along the second in their short column about a cable and a half astern of modeste close enough for everyone on the quarterdeck to witness captain blanding as he strode from one side of his poop deck to the other too enraged to stay on his own quarterdeck a brass speakingtrumpet in his hand to bellow at the columns of lineofbattle ships sailing along on either beam some too close for comfort and others slipping a bit loord or slanted as if to drive right through his own column god rot you cummings i know you can edge up more windward than than that blanding roared to larboard then dashed to starboard and warned that you fairbairn haul your hellish wind a point or youll be aboard me do you hear there haul off i say andrew haul off oh the devil take it gilbraith load a gun and well hull anyone who gets within a cable of us lewrie wrapped his arms across his chest and tried to maintain a stern determined expression on his phyz but began to shake with amusement reduced to making snorting noises and howd i miss makin his acquaintance all my years in the navy he guffawed turning to look at westcott who was also laughing as silently as he could we had best take a first reef in the main course mister westcott do we run too close to his stern he just might fire at us once clear of the isle of wight and into the chops of the channel their little squadron was pressed to maintain course souwest as if bound for the channel islands a long line of at least a dozen big twodeckers and their flagship passed down their starboard side about a mile alee taking their own sweet time to wheel about to westsouwest altering course one at a time when they reached the large disturbed patch of sea where the lead ship had first turned after the last of the liners had made the turn modeste put up a signal for them to do the same alter course in succession and a second hoist indicating course due west a third signal went up another halliard ordering a threecable separation down came the preparative and modeste came about already making more sail as reliant reached modestes disturbed patch the helm was put over and she went about with lt westcott busy instructing the hands to brace about for taking the wind on her starboard quarters when lewrie judged that the flagship was almost three cables distant he called for the reef to be shaken out of the main course and all plain sail set there was still another long column of ten or eleven twodeckers astern of them looking as if they would either slice between cockerel and pylades or run right over parhams frigate but they were on their way dismiss the hands from stations mister westcott and set the larboard watch lewrie ordered if everything is squared away all tiddly that is it is sir right down to the hawse bucklers lt westcott informed him with a squinty look of amusement still on his face my word now that was excitin lewrie said chuckling softly clumsy embarrassin cunnythumbed lubberly but excitin so sorry sir westcott said suddenly downcast not your fault mister westcott lewrie assured him with a crew as raw as ours and with so little time allowed for workin em to competence im just relieved we got out without killin anybody in the process or bein trampled by a twodecker now were out at sea though we can continue drillin em proper to pur mutual satisfaction of readiness thank you sir westcott said with a nod of his head damn my eyes its a nice morning aint it lewrie said as he looked up at the commissioning pendant streaming towards the bows at the windful sails and set of the yards bracing at the clouds and the patches of blue sky a merry may morning indeed sir westcott agreed and the seas moderate well give the hands one hour in which to gawk and get used to her motion lewrie decided and some musicd suit desmond capt lewrie called out your lappipes and the other musicians and give us some cheer right away sor his coxn shouted back liam desmond and his uilleann pipes the young marine drummer and two fifers a couple of older hands who produced their fiddles and one fellow with a shallow irish drum even the cooks assistant with a set of spoons beaten on his thigh all joined together amidships in the waist atop a hatch grating farewell airs like portsmouth lass and over the hills and far away spritelier tunes such as the parson among the peas and one misty moisty morning drinking songs like ill fathom the bowl and he that would an alehouse keepan item mentioned in the recruiting flyers strewn about portsmouth had promised music and dancing nightlywent down well with all hands prompting some experienced tars to teach the lubbers how to dance a hornpipe it was pleasant and delightful on a midsummers morn when the green fields and the meadows were buried in corn the sailors began to sing bringing a touch of a smile on lewries face for the first time and the larks they sang melodious and the larks they sang melodious and the larks they sang melodious at the dawning of the day lewrie joined in under his breath though his right hand beat the measure in the air feeling a swell of unwanted emotion the sort best hidden aft and below in the greatcabins said the sailor to his true love im bound far away im bound for the indies where the loud cannons roar and im going to leave my nancy he turned away to face outboard to larboard pacing down to the lee rails squinting with suddenly damp eyes he reached into his coat for a handkerchief and if ever i return again and if ever i return again and if ever i return again i would maake you my bride damned nonsense he muttered blowing his nose yet the last verse ohoh no my love farewell saying may i go along with you saying may i go along with you saying may i go along with you ohoh no my love farewell a fresh cup of coffee sir his cabin steward pettus asked arriving on the quarterdeck with lewries old blackiron pot uhm aye pettus thatd be welcome lewrie told him taking one last embarrassed swipe at his face he wandered back up the slight cant of the deck to his proper place at the windward bulwarks his and his alone as captain coffee mister westcott aye sir thank you westcott eagerly replied accepting a cup from pettus but waving off goat milk or sugar preferring it noir is our wardroom musical sir lewrie asked as desmond led the musicians into the jolly thresher one or two decent voices sir but no instrumental talents that ive been able to discover lt westcott told him i believe however that the midshipmens mess is where youll find fiddlers and tootlers on recorders flutes and such perhaps a guitar and you mister westcott lewrie further enquired i clap and beat time marvellously well sir westcott said a brief chuckle of selfdeprecating humour punctuating his claim may i ask if you are musical sir ive a pennywhistle lewrie allowed with a modest shrug an host of people have begged me to toss it but he took a sip from his battered old pewter mug chuckling himself unable to remember if he had packed it in his seachests or had left it with his furnishings that had been carted over to his fathers house no matter for the winds seemed to increase a bit and reliant heeled loord a degree or so more sunlight breaking through the thin clouds dappled the deck and straining sails and glinted diamondlike on the sea before the bows desmond and his band were now giving the crew a rendition of a minuet one unfamiliar to lewrie and its pacing seemed to synchronise with the frigates stately motion she rolled a bit to loord then rose up horizontal she snuffled her bows into the sea and came gliding a bit bowsup with the jibboom and bow sprit an orchestra leaders baton even the chop of the channel that could make a passage feel as rough as an unsprung waggon on a rocky road felt as smooth as a chalked dance hall floor over which reliant swanned with the grace of an elegant young woman pleasant and delightful indeed lewrie muttered taking more than a little joy in the feel of a ship under him once more savouring the sunshine the moderate and pacific seas the wind and the far horizon beyond the thrusting jibboom what lay there well that was up to fate but didnt they say that the getting there was the most fun chapter forty nce modestes squadron was alone on the atlantic free and able to manoeuvre without being flanked by those other columns of warships captain blanding began to act more like a rearadmiral even as they made their way to a point midway twixt ushant the northwestern most tip of france and the scilly isles and lands end he worked his four ships like one of those massive columns they wore in succession off the wind they tacked in succession to windward he signalled for them all to tack to form a lineabreast then come about as one to form a line of battle they sailed norwest to the scillys inlineahead then reversed course by wearing in succession at one instance or wore or tacked together to reform line on the reciprocal heading for the most part captain blanding preferred that hms reliant be the lead ship incolumn with his flagship hms modeste the second and the lighter frigates cockerel and pylades astern of him obviously planning for the wishedfor combat to come and placing the heaviest weight of metal and the largest artillery at the forefront where his initial broadsides would do the most damage cause the most consternation he would though alter their order to give captains parham and stroud experience at leading he also worked the signalmen half to death blanding had gotten copies of adm home pophams revised signals book of for all ships and was so delighted with how many thousands of words how many phrases and orders could be expressed by onetofour numeral flags that mids and men of the afterguards aboard all four warships could swear that the fellow had flux of the flags from dawn to dusk ordering up any idle thought that rose in his head to be transmitted to one and all night signals thank the good lord were so rudimentary and simple that they were more like the inarticulate bellows of a village idiot desirous of a bowl of pudding lanthorn frames false flares all of them announced by the discharge of a cannon several cannon for some of them with the lanthorns hoisted aloft in the frames arranged in diamonds squares or other shapes a row of three lights meant tack with four guns the signal for execution and a further gun for each point of of the compass to be crossed capt blanding was mostly mute during the night especially when it came to manoeuvring ships in the dark though he did issue rather a lot of invitations to supper the good weather on their day of departure did not last long of course though that did not deter the fellow from continuing their workingup in the occasional half a gale of wind or rain and with no consideration of the seastate by jingo it wont be all cruising and claret til we meet up with the frogs haw haw blanding would declare with a fierce scowl and a meaty palm slammed on his dining table just before breaking out in a hearty bellylaugh after a fortnight of such training with no sign of the french squadron in the offing blanding broke them up into pairs to scout a line from norwest to soueast lewrie and reliant paired with one of the fifth rate s with ten or twelve miles between them depending on the weather and the limit of visibility and no more than ten or twelve seamiles between the two pairs resulting in a scouting line fourty or fifty miles in length cross the hundred miles twixt ushant and the scillys through which the french must passif they were indeed coming except for sundays then blanding would order all ships into two short columns abreast and send his chaplain to each ship in turn for divine services chaplain brundish was a much younger fellow than lewrie had expected almost as stout as his patron but agile and energetic he was well read and a charming erudite suppertable guest as full of bonhomie as blanding and like many gentlemanly members of the church of england spoke glowingly of steeplechasing and the fox hunt of how he missed his hounds and his favourite hunters he had a wealth of decent amusing tales and japes played the flute recorder and the violin and was possessed of a loud deep baritone voice his homilies were marvels too oh hed rail against the common sailors sins of giving in to boredom and ennui of petty theft and drunk on duty nodding off on watch but they were mostly short pithy and very nautical full of animus against their foes mateyness between their own of upholding god king and country as a moral religious calling as a good work that would lead them all to salvation and the eternal glory all of it bracketed by wellknown beloved hymns of the uplifting muscular sort that left even the leery men with grins on their faces and humming the tunes as chaplain brundish departed in captain blandings cutter to minister to the next ship and crew he surprisingly for a man of the cloth knew his way with the cutlass and smallsword and had a keen eye with a musket after the third sunday at sea though modeste put up a signal for reliant to come close alongside with both ships loafing along under reduced sail both rolling heaving and snuffling foam about fifty yards apart blanding took up a speakingtrumpet and bellowed this is looking to be a rum go lewrie the only frogs weve seen are prizes took by other people wars could be declared but merchantmen onpassage had no way of learning of it warships returning from overseas or cruising on an innocent patrol beyond the reach of coastal semaphore towers could not be informed either and the first they would know of it would be the pugnacious approach of an enemy warship or privateer with gunports open and artillery run out such surprises would happen to ships of both sides frustratingly whilst their squadron had scouted round the approaches to the english channel other luckier british warships had sailed past them with french prizes in tow or the odd enemy merchantman sent in under a prizecrew with the union flag flying above the french tricolour to mark the new possessor at several of their suppers aboard modeste blanding had wrung his hands or gnawed his napkins to nubbins to be bound by specific orders which denied them the chance to hare off in search of prizes too and was forced to watch other captains send in fresh fortunes to be made in the admiralty prizecourts if they didnt sail before the war was declared they may not have come out at all sir lewrie had shouted back to him this could be a wild goose chase and did they put to sea a day or two before then they are weeks ahead of us by now blanding had roared back despair in his voice it just aint on dash my eyes we will go the west indies and the mouth of the mississippi lewrie our orders demand we do no less whether they are really there or not bring to battle or pursue were ordered then pursuit it will be order of sailing pylades your reliant then me with cockerel the hindmost two miles separation tween ships and shape course westsouwest half west cross the bay of biscay aye aye sir lewrie had bawled back wondering if his whisky mustard and store of jerked meat and sausages for the cats would last that long more disturbingly would he have to sift rinse and dry their litter for reuse should the level of sand in the barrel run low the indies sir lt westcott asked after coming up to the windward side of the quarterdeck with a brief tap of two fingers upon the brim of his hat for a salute it appears so mister westcott lewrie said with a sigh the hands damned few of em have had a chance to go there damned few have ever been exposed to yellow jack and the other fevers cept for some of our older hands our blacks and such well be arriving right at the height of summer when its the sickliest if we dont have to spend too much time close to shore we might escape the worst of it but perhaps our surgeon mister mainwaring has some fresh insights about yellow jack and malaria a long passage to get there sir westcott said shrugging in a fatalistic way do we not run across any foes on the way at least we will have captain blandings hopedfor skills imparted to them before we start to lose some of them that made lewrie cock a brow and peer closely rather let us hope must we lose some of our people it comes in battle and not the fevers first mister westcott he told him chapter fortyone they went roughly souwest cross the bay of biscay hundreds of miles out into the midatlantic and offshore from france and the newly established british blockading squadrons reaching most days on the prevailing westerlies with the winds abeam and sails set all to the royals when the weather allowed making haste captain blanding let them be to bowl along like a cambridge coach and work on their sailtending and gunnery practice his desire to press on overriding his penchant for squadron manoeuvres and unwilling to lose a single mile a single hour of his pursuitwhether they were chasing a willothewisp or not they encountered only one other ship off cape ferrol the very northernmost tip of spain and that was another british frigate headed home from the far east and unaware that the war had resumed until they informed her then they plunged on further south with the winds shifting til the latitude of cape st vincent where the first of the noreast trade winds began and they could alter course west and ride them cross the atlantic to the west indies running down a line of latitude for the most part it was only then that the four ships surgeons held a meeting aboard modeste to discuss preventatives against the yellow jack and malaria it was not productive theyre certain that we should avoid all shore miasmas sir mr mainwaring told lewrie in his cabins after returning back aboard mainwaring was a stout fellow in his midthirties so grizzled though that he put lewrie in mind of a professional boxer with massive hands and thick fingers the jungle forest marsh and swamp night mists we should avoid any anchorage that does not have a sea breeze to keep land winds and the noisome mists at bay and there is the chichona bark powder which is efficacious at combatting either of the fevers he explained shifting in the collapsing chair and making it creak in an alarming way as he sipped a welcome glass of lewries rhenish once theyre caught lewrie grumbled not before the medical records show no usefulness in administering chichona bark tea to prevent outbreaks sir sorry and the citronella i wrote them about sir lewrie asked my former surgeon mister durant in proteus used it in lanthorn oil and in candles and we suffered very few cases of yellow jack after our initial plague the spanish and portuguese colonies burn citronella candles by the ton in fever season and they dont die by battalions ehm the uses your former surgeon cited captain sir were accompanied by keeping their houses their windows shut at night to keep out the miasmas mr mainwaring hesitantly related with a faint scowl on his rugged face secondly the others reckoned that the dons and the portuguese have after a couple of centuries developed a toleration and their only mortalities are some of the newborn and those just arrived in their colonies and thirdly sir its the cost of it the others are loath to purchase large quantities of what may be a folk nostrum of no use like all their other medicaments it comes out of their own pockets out of mine sir he pointedly added humour me mister mainwaring lewrie stubbornly told him do we put in somewhere that citronella candles and oils are available i will buy it and we will employ it even if the other ships do not ive seen it work god knows why but it seems to if anthing else it seems to keep the hordes of mosquitoes at bay well place tubs of candles round the hatchways at anchor burn candles belowdecks instead of the issue glims after dark do we cruise close ashore or in a lee of an island and for good measure im certain youll wish to get more chichona bark powders do our people come down with yellow jack of course sir mainwaring replied though it was uncertain whether he was agreeing about the chichona bark powders or submitting to a captains odd caprice in his experience as a ships surgeon and in discussions with his fellows mainwaring had come to learn that navy captains could be an eccentric lot weeks later in late june the squadron was alee of martinique and looking into the major naval port of fortdefrance surprisingly the windward approaches from the atlantic and the harbour itself were already being watched by a slim squadron of three frigates or sloops of war who reported that no fresh french squadron had been seen there and what few enemy warships were present were effectively bottled up hear about commodore hood sir the senior captain had called over to them with a speakingtrumpet hes already taken their island of saint lucia and the port of castries and is now off to do the same to tobago capital what further north at guadeloupe and it was much the same story off the fortified leeside harbour of basseterre rearadmiral sir john thomas duckworth commanding the jamaica station must have had early premonitions or secret despatches alerting him to the fresh outbreak of war for he had sent his few warships of a peacetime squadron out to sea just like commodore sir samuel hood of the leewards islands station they were informed that some french privateers had gotten out to prey on british merchant shipping but there were hardly any warships in basseterre and they showed no signs of sallying the ships watching guadeloupe had not seen blandings mythical french squadron either and suggested that they might try further to the north at st barthйlemy or st martin st domingue and the very best of luck to you at whatever it is youre doing were i a cursing man a blasphemer gentlemen id be in full cry by now dash it dash it i say captain blanding fumed as he stomped round his greatcabins his face going plummy whilst holding yet another officers conference aboard modeste and why can i not engage in some raw billingsgate brundish he demanded of his chaplain when it would feel so bloody good about now stoic acceptance of frustration and misfortune are the mark of the christian english gentleman i fear sir brundish calmly replied over a glass of claret better to light a candle than to curse the darkness all that spurs the mind to finding solutions i vow blanding let out a clenchedteeth growl of displeasure best bets saint domingue sir lewrie pointed out enjoying a glass himself dont know much about jacmel on the south coast toussaint louverture took it and eliminated his rivals long ago so i doubt the french ever got it back but theres portauprince if the frogs got that far south but itd take a proper fleet and a big army tgo in there if thats where they shelter after that theres mole saint nicolas up on the western coast then cape franзois the main port on the north im fairly sure the french still hold those by the skin of their teeth ive heard sir captain stroud stuck in the fellow who took over from louverture when the french caught him and shipped him off to france general dessalines has run the frogs from the interior do they land troops id think theyd be more than welcome at one of those two ports captain lewrie cites mouth of the mississippi captain parham spoke up that or french guyana we took it in ninetyeight or ninetynine i forget which but in southrottingamerica sir captain blanding squealedor gave a fair approximation of a squeal he rushed to pour himself more claret not waiting for a cabinservant failing saint dominguan harbours sir we might have to look into spanish ports on the gulf of mexico as well lewrie said with gruff despondency despite how amusing capt blandings outbursts were havana on cuba pensacola mobile in spanish florida then theres tampa bay and theres a quite good deepwater harbour just above the east end of the florida keys tamiami or something like that no proper town garrison or fortification like saint augustine on their eastern coast but itd suit lewrie turned to poll his fellow captains anyone know if spanish florida is part of the territory to be traded to the french and sold to the americans along with louisiana god rot the blanding snapped even further exasperated next you know well be poking our noses into the arctic prowling the coasts of bloody greenland by all thats holy i he shut up quickly admonished by a stern finger wagged by chaplain brundish captain blanding sat himself down heavily into a stout chair damme but hes fun twatch when hes explodin lewrie thought theres oceans of prizemoney being reaped blanding mused aloud absently patting his curly blond locks and gazing upwards at the overhead as weve heard on our way up the leewards sirs there is fame and glory being won and more to come when all the rest of the french west indies islands are seized yet we we swan about like a pack of imbeciles let loose from bedlam hunting for ghosts ghosts i say who might never have sailed why by the time weve looked into all the ports weve suggested lurked off the mouth of the mississippi and found nothing ah well be forced to turn ourselves over to duckworth or hood for general duties now all know the wars on blanding trailed off and stuck his nose into his wine glass it was not exactly the proper thing for a senior officer to express himself so freely to doubt aloud well lewrie mightve but only in his early days and hed learned better since lose his broadpendant for starters lewrie thought busying himself with his own wine as the others shuffled their feet and got very silent and depressedlooking admiralty picked him for this hunt special and whatll a failure do to his career even if the french squadron never existed and hell have to report that not his fault really but hmmm when did duckworth and hood learn of the declaration of war when did the frogs look here sir lewrie said assume the french sailed before us by a fortnight or less letters of marque were issued in midmay and the official declaration of war came on the eighteenth now did they get downchannel before thatby a fortnight or lessthey wouldve sailed in a fog whilst we whats the dashing weather to do with it sir capt blanding quickly sneered back metaphorical sir a lackofinformation sort of fog they couldnt know of the state of war when they left holland lewrie continued warming to his topic no one could catch them up ttell them once they were out to sea and when they got to the west indies no one here knew of it either they arrived ahead of the news no idea they had to get a way on no need for haste dye see sir hmm go on blanding urged perking up considerably aye grasp any straw when drownin even mine lewrie told himself with secret glee poor bastard if they were as raw as the typical french sailors who learn their trade onpassage like they usually get sent out lewrie further said their crossing wouldve been slower than ours sir if theyd sailed a line of latitude tpick up dominica to fix their positionspot the mountains sixty miles out at sea on a clear daylet us say did they carry at least a demibrigade to mole saint nicolas or cape franзoisle cap the frogs call ittheyd have to take on water firewood and fresh victuals after landin the bulk of the soldiers and perhaps even give their sailors shore liberty wastin even more time before they went on to new orleans for the handover even were they five weeks ahead of us before we left european waters sir lewrie quickly speculated we mightve made up a week on em with our fast passage and made up another week sailin a line of latitude above dominica and perhaps two more whilst they anchored at cape franзois or mole saint nicolas and frittered then if they finally heard of the declaration of war they might dither a bit longer before heading for new orleans sir after all their senior officers got strict orders tbe in new orleans for the ceremonies the same sort of firm orders as us really sir lewrie concluded a slyboots smile on his face a failured not do his career any good by jove blanding said at last after munching that over in his head his jaws actually working as if chewing the concept by jove and by jingo lewrie of course he has strict orders hell not waste time on the smaller isles in the leewards hell have put into saint domingue first then blanding shot to his feet beaming for a rare once since theyd departed their patrol of the channel entrances thats where hed be hiding thats where he wishes to run from soonest sir lewrie asked puzzled hed thought to goad the fellow into a better mood spur him into action and out of the slough of despond but where was his head going now he fulfills his orders to go up the mississippi to new orleans hell find shelter from our ships blanding explained sort of kind of he cant be blamed if he cant get out after the exchange of ownership there and if hes less than a week ahead of us i say topups and i will have a glass with you all we will crack on at once for the anegada passage twixt anguilla and the virgins and then its all to the royals stunsls too for the old bahama channel and the florida straits does he flee saint domingue hell not wish to take a course south of cuba too close to jamaica and our squadron there duckworth not have them we will several fresh bottles of claret had been uncorked to breathe so refills were quickly done blanding held up his glass on high sirs i give you confusion to the french sloth to the french captain william parham amended sloth and timidity but not too much timidity parham lewrie added else they never come out chapter fortytwo they dashed roughly norwest past montserrat nevis and st kitts passing far alee of st martin eustatius and almost within sight of saba then turned north for a time on a close reach to thread through twixt anguilla and the easternmost isle of the british virgin islands anegada which gave name to the passage from the caribbean to the atlantic once more from there it was wind on the starbd quarters again with stunsls boomed out on either side of the main course and tops yards the fore courses of all four warships partially reefed to take downward pressure off their bows and allow them to spear their bluff entries through the sea instead of pressing too deep and snuffling robbing them of half a knot or more per hour the noreasterly trade winds were strong and steady despite it being almost late july never varying more than a point from noreast and only fading lighter after dusk as the squadron ran down the line of the th latitude due west there were spells of late afternoon rain squalls now and again through which they drove onwards without reducing sail there were grey and charcoaldark storms on the horizon so dense they resembled island mountains but far away and unthreatening though they were well into hurricane season when any mariner in those waters continually looked over his shoulder and watched the cabinet barometer leerily spanish puerto rico passed alee as did the mona passage their squadron plunging along at an impressive rate of knots and hms modeste proving captain blandings boast that she was very fast for a gunned twodecker drill on the greatguns drill with small arms and edged weapons filled both forenoon and day watches under a warm sun white clouds and the occasional afternoon rains that sluiced off the sweat the hands had worked up sometimes lasting long enough for a thorough scrubdown with a stub of soap and a washrag then came the coast of spanish santo domingo the eastern half of hispaniola the long northern coast looming up to larboard forcing them to alter course a point or two and lewrie was back in his old hunting grounds in the proteus frigate and his memories of that time in hispaniolan waters when he had been more carefree monte cristi ten miles off the larboard beam sir lieutenant westcott said lowering his telescope and cape franзois about fourty miles to the west the rebel slaves tried to blow us to kingdom come round about here mister westcott lewrie recalled aloud and the lone survivor we picked up after the last of their boats sank slit the throat of one my hands tryin thaul him up the battens fanatics all of em kit cashman and his regiment ashore outside portauprince a night in a restaurantcumbrothel the blind shelling theyd fired over the heads of british troops at mole st nicolas his intense dislike of sir hyde parkers staffcaptain at kingston the wine keg aye and that captain blaylock too the duel hed seconded for kit against that beauman git ledyard and his cousin and how they had cheated and gotten gunned down the yellow jack that had decimated proteuss crew and officers the theft of beauman slaves to replace some of them matching wits with guillaume choundas cooperating with the american navy finding he had a bastard son itll be beat to quarters in the next hour or so westcott he said shrugging off his memories at long last sir his first officer said with eagerness if theyre here if lewrie replied staring at the impossibly green mountains of santo domingo so far all their landfalls had been french islands only one of them guadeloupe he had been at all familiar with here though here were islands hed known at coasting distance every bay fishing port inlet and shoal close to an host of other places hed known at firsthand the turks and caicos isles to the north and the bahamas further north of them and when he was prowling these shores it had been antigua the danish or british virgins kingston jamaica the coast of cuba apalachicola bay in spanish florida so long before they all sprang to mind in a flood of remembrance from his midshipman days in the hiredin parrot schooner the desperate sloop and halfmad capt tobias treghues then old hms shrike and lieutenant lilycrop and all his damned cats and his first the sullen william pitt the best mouser in the fleet and when hed gone to the far east india and china in telesto under capt ayscough hed left pitt with caroline to care for him long before their wedding in anglesgreen when he returned in that didnt hurt he thought shouldve but it didnt callous hardhearted bastard or what am i feelin happy memories joyous recollections of past ships and former associates for the most part treghues blaylock and the wine keg excepted and days like this in aquamarine and ginclear waters with the wind in his hair and the sun on his skin in the west indies hmmpf wonder if i did pack my pennywhistle in my traps he wondered carry on mister westcott he said and ambled away towards the starboard bulkheads just off cape franзois with reliant at quarters four hours later they encountered two ships one was a british brigsloop keeping an eye on the port to which captain blanding sent a blizzard of flag signals summoning her captain aboard modeste the other vessel was an american brigantine just clearing the harbour and offshore by at least five miles blanding ordered reliant to close her and speak her hermaphrodite brigs they called them neither one nor tother with crossed yards and square sails on their fore masts and foreandaft schoonerlike on the after masts for a bit she looked as if she might wish to run as reliant bore down on her but working out of port against the noreast trades she was already slow through the sea and did she haul her wind and flee westerly she would never work up enough speed to escape lewrie could understand her masters wish to get out of it a call to fetchto from a royal navy ship to have his papers and muster book read usually resulted in the impressment of some of the crew and a search for contraband that could result in seizure lewrie turned the deck over to lt westcott and was rowed over to her instead of loftily summoning her master to come aboard his own ship his only escort was his boat crew who remained in the boat as he scaled her sides alan lewrie royal navy he began with a pleasant smile on his face doffing his cocked hat to both flag and quarterdeck morning ansel vincent her master sourly announced himself with his papers already under one arm the brigantine seneca outta mystic in connecticut bound home with rum molasses and sugar i spose ye wish tsee my papers capm lewrie my muster book he added suspiciously almost accusingly as he glowered in displeasure the muster books not necessary sir lewrie told him were fresh out from england with full crews so far i will look at your papers however you are partowner haw captain vincent rejoined i wish shes a sweet sailer and a fastun im hired on with a lay of the profits for now and her owners lewrie asked the crowninshield brothers o mystic as ye can see vincent said waving at the papers in lewries hands ezekiel and gabriel crowninshield lewrie exclaimed delighted i met them at antigua in ninetyeight when america and france almost went to war with each other two of their trading schooners had gone missing and i helped recover them from the french mohican and i forget the name of the other he added with a shrug you did vincent barked in surprise and doubt a britisher helpin yankees i thought it was our navy done it we cooperated for a time on the sly lewrie said with a grin and a wink as he handed back the ships papers mostly unread youve been in port a while now were hunting for a french squadron that left holland a bit before the war was declared you didnt share the harbour with them did you they were bound for new orleans to be there for the official handover of louisiana to the united states might have landed some troops here as well were gettin louisiana vincent gawped it was news to him lock stock and barrel sir lewrie assured him and news of that stirred senecas small crew to glad buzzing well hallelujah capt vincent exclaimed removing his old tricornestyle hat to scratch his head and ye wish to stop it by takin em dont ye he accused a second later no sir lewrie told him the last thing the united states or great britain wishes is to have the french empire in the americas if they have everything west of the mississippi how would your nation continue to grow my country prefers the french not have a large army present for the ceremony of exchange but more power to you and the best of good fortune for your acquisition so did a french squadron put into cape franзois while you were here lewrie asked again or were they here and revictualling before sailing for new orleans even from here i can spot the masts of a number of ships in port i dont ask if theyre ships of war theyre not my pigeon at the moment aye theres a lotta ships in port vincent reluctantly said twodeckers and frigates and indiamansized transports dont have all their guns though they come from france en flute without em or landed em tbuck up the defences genral rochambeau wont let any sail he needs em all if he has to surrender to the blacks and get as many of his people away before they all get massacredmen women and kids tgether genral noailles over to mole saint nicolas is in the same straits dessalineshe took over after the french captured louverture and took him awayhas em hemmed in damned close the mole and le cap here is all the french have left on the island you brits had an ounce o christian mercy yed leave off yer hunt for that squadron an fetch as many ships as ye can to help the french get away before the blacks slaughter em all captain vincent groused i trust rearadmiral duckworth on jamaica is aware of that and will do all he can to help lewrie said hoping that was so his brief exposure to the savagery of the rebel slaves and the atrocities the french had dealt out in reply had been spinechilling he wished he could help but believe it when i see it capt vincent drawled though his anger was growing there werent no cause for you to make war on the french again napoleon wanted peace but i reckon your country just cant abide republics where the people have rights and freedom stead o kings queens and titled fools tellin folk what to do ill not debate the whys sir lewrie said stiffening a bit though striving to keep a peaceable and agreeable expression and air did general rochambeau keep the squadron from sailing or were they sent to mole saint nicolas to help the evacuation over there landed fresh reenforcements here or there we were told they would or have they already sailed yell not cotch em admirl a sailor whod been listening to the conversation hooted theys off an gone two day ago stop yer gob ye vincent roared rounding on the fellow but it was too late pleased astonishment over the gain of louisiana and new orleans a chance to insult the despised royal navy and send a tyrant packing before he could press some of them were all just too tempting capm decean hes got two big frigates and a seventyfour guns as big as tree trunks a whole regment o soldiers the crew of seneca jeered before their master bellowed them to truculent silence ill thankee tgit off my ship whoever ye are vincent demanded safer for ye less ye have all yer marines at yer back my regards to the crowninshield brothers captain lewrie said as he doffed his hat to the ships master then to one and all as he made his way to the entryport have a good voyage oh la maman ce sont les anglais came a childs wail of fear drawing everyones attention to the companionway that led below two children appeared briefly before being snatched away by a palefaced woman gonna seize em cause theyre french too vincent snapped how many did you manage to evacuate sir lewrie asked him in a softer tone bout nineteen is all weve room for vincent told him with real fear now that lewrie a dread brit would do that very thing daddies wives and kids mostly some whole famlies but most the kin o men who haveta stay behind paying passengers lewrie wryly asked aint chargin full rates but why had you an ounce o christian mercy sir id expect you would make room for more for free sir lewrie drawled as he began to descend the battens to his waiting boat theyre in deep dire trouble ashore sir lewrie told capt blanding after he had reported aboard modeste even as the squadron got under way westerly for the old bahama channel and florida straits low on rations powder and shot just about everything and hangin on by the skin o their teeth i gather that the black general dessalines has demanded their surrender already if duckworth is late in arriving here if he plans to come at all itll be worse than a red indian massacre sir might we consider offering this rochambeau an alternative surrender to us instead and escape the exslaves vengeance the prizemoney for so many ships warships and merchantmen would be astronomical not to mention the head and gun money on thousands of french soldiers he beguiled its a christian stay here blanding countered sounding shocked by the suggestion dash it captain lewrie theyre only two days sail ahead of us the french squadrons real it aint a myth some admiralty clerk some sneaking spy didnt weave them out of moonbeams by all thats holy sir this decean is it this captain decean has his orders just as i have mine his to reach new orleans no matter what and mine to catch them up and bring them to battle no sir i will not let them get away now we know how close we are on their tail and where theyre bound right brundish well sir his chaplain said with his head cocked over to one side it would be christian to assist the french and avoid a bloodbath yet we are at war with france there you have it captain lewrie blanding barked ah ha weve a grand battle in the offing by jingo so lets be at it chapter fortythree the first three days of urgent pursuit were sunny and clear as they made a rapid transit from st domingue westnorwest crossing the windward passage and rushing along the northern coast of spanish cuba squeezing between that shore and the great bahama bank then up the narrow deepwater throat of the old bahama channel after they threaded the narrowest part twixt cayo cruz and cayo lobos though the weather turned foul and boisterous with fretted and mounting seas rain squalls and rising winds forcing them to reef courses topsls tgallants and royals and stow away the stunsls pressed by winds fine on the starboard quarters all four ships rolled and pitched and heaved and gundrill or smallarms drill had to be put aside for constant sailtending rain hissed down by the bucketfuls seething on the upper decks and gangways sluicing to either beam or fore and aft with every jerking motion so much at times that it gurgled out the scuppers no matter how snugly the deck planks were payed with sealing pitch over the poundedin oakum water seeped through the gaps to drip and drizzle belowdecks and plop cold on hands trying to sleep in wildly swaying hammocks at night onto the mess tables during meals and making everyone thoroughly miserable to be caught short to stumble forrud to the beakhead rails and the seats of ease resulted in a complete soakingfrom freshwater rain and salt water spray pitched up by the bows as they plunged and rose no matter the watchfulness of the midshipmen the masteratarms and ships corporals it was dryer simply to piss in the odd corner of the messdecks shit in a wood bucket and hope to pitch it overside when no one was looking and the hands who got caught at it ended on report before captains mast rrrow toulon complained as a dollop of water caught him on the head as he tried to eat his supper from his dish by lewries place setting mrrf was his mournful plaint as he looked aloft to seek the source of his annoyance i trust the wardrooms dryer lewrie commented to his first officer as they supped together along with the sailing master mr caldwell and midshipmen grainger and munsell a deck above you and i catch all the rain intended for you he drolly pointed out it seeps through eventually sir lt westcott replied with a brief toothbaring grin it was well that he wore his napkin tucked into his shirt collar for a drop of water raised a shotsplash in his pea soup spattering the napkin not his uniform grainger and munsell thought it amusing we keep tarpaulins on our bedding same as you i fear no need to dampen the tablecloth i vow mr caldwell sniggered no plated dare slide tonight munsell and grainger found that funny too more searoom lewrie said out of the narrows of the old bahama channel and into the nicholas channel by morning is that your reckoning mister caldwell aye sir into deeper water that worthy cautiously said cross the tropic of cancer by noon sights perhaps as we enter the florida straits pray god the weather clears for the straits are a boisterous place of their own quite the equal of the seas weve experienced lately that wont make captain blanding happy westcott said with a smirk as he dabbed his lips with his napkin even with clear skies and steady winds wed lose a knot per hour make all sail conformable to the weather hey lewrie added chuckling that had been modestes signal for two days per perhaps the french are slowed by the same conditions sir midshipman grainger essayed in a meek voice sailing two days before us i doubt it mister grainger mr westcott told them the worst theyd get ahead of the squalls is the gustfront wind which will only make them faster beg your pardon sir westcott said to lewrie for talking shop attable ive always found such constructive mister westcott lewrie assured him i know no poetry to recite cept for some doggerel not fit for young ears no hightoned books in my library tdiscuss and were all mostlike horrid at music so why not then sir should we have stayed at cape franзois and taken the french surrender lt westcott posed shifting in his chair and looking a bit distressed i know theyre the enemy but id not wish such a fate on anyone we have explicit orders mister westcott lewrie answered as he dabbed his own lips then took a sip of wine it was i imagine a trial for this french fellow in charge of their squadron decean he could have stayed added his last battalion of troops to defend the city and taken hundreds of civilians aboard for new orleans its a french city after all and every refugeed be welcome same as it is a trial for captain blanding both have explicit orders and if we had stayed sirs mr caldwell stuck in what are the chances the french wouldve surrendered to us their general may have thought he could hold out for months or delayed til he could deal with rearadmiral duckworth a man of rank suitable to his own theyre touchy the frogs too proud to admit theyd have to surrender or accept terms from anybody and wed have failed to execute our orders to our peril and captain blandings career lewrie said as pettus and his own cook yeovill bustled in with large covered trays fetching roasted quail raised from the eggs or chicklets bought in portsmouth potatoes and beans and the entrйe of saltbeef are the french really all that bad sir midshipman munsell hesitantly asked all of them that is if their commodore or whatever took pity on the people at cape franзois and took aboard as many refugees as he could as you said sir their big indiaman might be full of women and children stead of soldiers might we uhm aye they bloody are lewrie quickly angrily thought as for munsells fear we could end up killin as many civilians as those black rebels no surely theyd strike their colours soon as we get to hailin distancewouldnt that make blanding tear his hair out a bloodless victory oh the poor bastard if this decean fellow did take civilians aboard there would not be that many mister munsell lewrie told him after a long frown and think not aboard his armed ships for certain hed have to work his guns if overtaken to protect the transport he mightve kept no more than two or three companies of troops mean tsay how many frogs does it take tmake a dumbshow or fire a ceremonial volley his frigates and seventyfour would mostlike come about and fight us mister munsell lt westcott added giving the indiaman a shot at escaping to leeward if shes swift enough shes probably already placed ahead of their other ships against that very chance to shepherd her sir midshipman munsell said nodding as if he understood the concept almost just as wed shepherd a convoy of our own aye lt westcott replied then lowered his head to finish his cooling soup once out in the gulf of mexico though the sailing master said with a shrug slurping up his last spoonful and looking eagerly in yeovills direction as the cook filled plates its needle in a haystack as to finding them the surest wager would be to race on westnorwest on a beeline for the mississippi delta if the french didnt put into havana and think it over first now they know they are at war again oh spiced rice with the quail too good oh easy to make sir yeovill said as he and pettus set plates before them and rice is cheap but filling can do wonders with it mister caldwell too close to jamaica and duckworths squadron lewrie said frowning again as his soup bowl was removed and the next course was placed before him he drummed his fingers on the table top pondering if decean knows were at war and the beeline is so obvious hmm sir lt westcott prompted if he sheltered in havana hed fail his orders lewrie said looking up but if he steers closer to pensacola or mobile thatd take him north of the obvious route but still get him to new orleans as far out of duckworths reach as he can get if discovered he has a chance tduck into one of em under the protection of a fort and its artillery and send his troops overland through spanish territory his missions a success even if his ships are interned lewrie exclaimed fighting the urge to rush to the chartspace to fetch dividers compass and ruler and spread a chart over their supper dishes were i captain blanding id steer norwest thunt for em if we had enough ships that is or spread out what we have to the limit of signallin and sightin distance stretched as far north of the usual track the most direct course as we can glass of hock with the quail sir pettus suggested hovering with a fresh bottle of white wine aye pettus thankee lewrie agreed tossing back the last of his claret and offering his glass to be filled just a thought he told the others with a shrug and a lifted eyebrow would the dons let them march through their territory though sir lt westcott wondered aloud from what ive read the spanish might as well be puppets of the french but are they that eager to become bonapartes active allies again their minister godoy is a spineless wretch ready to do whatever the french want ive heard would it be a hard march sir mr caldwell asked on what sort of roads i wonder after all this captain decean needs them to be presentable when they reach new orleans alive too i should imagine he added with a laugh lewrie recalled his time in west florida up the apalachicola there were no roads just game trails indian trading paths closer to new orleans then he announced with a sudden smile much closer almost to lake pontchartrain we need a chart chapter fortyfour six days out from cape franзois and the weather relented the squadron cleared the florida straits and entered the gulf of mexico at last with the dry tortugas a bit over the horizon on their starboard beams drill on the greatguns and smallarms practice resumed on all ships all sails that could be bared to the winds bloomed aloft again including stunsls with them came laundry damp and mildewed changes of slopclothing and bedding while it had rained so hard canvas sluices had thriftily been rigged and some of the deluge had been funnelled into spare butts that the cooper and his mate had assembled from hoops and staves stored on the orlop the first depleted casks and butts of the voyage hoisted out scrubbed and rinsed then refilled with fresh water and stored below once more there was so much spare water for once that every hand could wash his slops shorefashion instead of soaping the worst smuts then towing them astern in net bags hoping the churning ships wake would get them mostly clean that method engrained salt crystals in the cloth and when worn resulted in ugly saltwater boils which the ships surgeon and his mates spent time lancing and daubing with ointment the cost of such services deducted from the sailors pay the same as a mercury cure for the venereal pox modeste signalled for livefire exercises on the greatguns at least once a day demanding three rounds from each gun every two minutes and god help the ship and the captain and the signals party of any ship that did not meet his standards captain blanding would not veer from his urgent chase to the westnorwest long enough to set out old kegs for targets then double back to fire at them in passing inlineahead the rate of fire was paramount not the proper elevating or aiming to his mind after all would he not bring the french right up to closebroadsides where proper aim did not matter fair enough mister rahl lewrie congratulated the grizzled older prussian their master gunner had suggested that they shift the guns as far forward in the ports as they could fire a round from one of the forecastle chase guns then let the individual guncaptains aim at the shotsplash as they sailed past it and it seemed that most of the crews of the allimportant pounders were catching on quickly one more from the starboard chase gun and well see how close they come with a full broadside before we cease for the morning sehr gut kapitдn sofort mr rahl barked standing at the base of the starboard companionway to the waist so stiffly at attention that he resembled one of kaiser friedrich the greats grenadiers ja very gut sir at once he amended before turning to speak to lt spendlove and lt merriman relaying lewries orders quite the odd duck sir lt westcott commented once a soldier forever a soldier crashbang about turn hep hep damned good gunner though lewrie replied though i dont know what hed do if he ever ran out of wax for his mustachios go mad i expect he pulled out his pocketwatch to check the time it lacked a quarterhour to seven bells of the forenoon and the morning rum ration last broadside then secure from quarters cant delay the grog aye sir westcott said with a grin and may i say that i envy you your chair sir he added tongue in cheek i must admit i own to a certain wish to sit through part of a watch whether the navy approves or not sprawl rather mister westcott lewrie corrected him even snooze i already stand accused o bein an idle improper bastard and freely confess to the charges in my last days in the west indies i was even known to sprawl and tootle on my pennywhistle the carpenter mr mallard and his mate swift had cobbled together a canvasandwood collapsible slingchair to his directions and it was now almost a permanent fixture on the windward side of the quarterdeck the weather permitting we both know that half the captains in the fleet are eccentric so he said with a shrug and a pleased grin starbd battry by broadside fire lt spendlove was shouting stop ears lewrie warned the guncaptains properly waited for the scend of the sea the uproll before jerking their lanyards to trip the flintlock strikers then the guns exploded oh well shot westcott enthused to see the tall feathers of spray rise all round the chase guns first fading shellsplash close enough to satisfy even captain blandings standards mister merriman mister spendlove sponge out and secure from quarters signal sir our number and its well done midshipman warburton reported from the taffrail flag lockers and secure then rum sir spelled out how oddly terse of him lewrie said with a laugh must have too much on his mind god help us sir when he does have so much on his mind hell signal it to one and all westcott snickered flag flux lewrie had come to appreciate lt westcott not only was he an experienced and tarryhanded officer he was a likeable one firm but fair was his manner in bringing reliant to nighperfect competence to present the frigate on a servingplate to her captain as a going concern any crew appreciated a commission sea officer who seemingly had eyes in the back of his head his finger on the pulse of everything yet was not a tartar or a soured tyrant westcott did almost all duties with longpractised ease and a quirky grin on his face a brow cocked in perpetual amusement over the failings of humankind and rarely had to rage or shout except to call from the quarterdeck to someone halfway to the foesle to pass an order where other officers might yell and fume a stern look from westcott was sufficient to let his men know he was wroth with their performance and westcott rarely had to bring a defaulter to lewrie for corporal punishment he was not a flogger but for the most extreme faults and his personality offduty was slyly wryly witty and worldly causing lewrie to imagine that they were kindred spirits two peas in a pod rascals with the same sort of tongueincheek humour ballard now dead and gone at copenhagen hed mistakenly thought was a friend but that had been a dutiful sham ralph knolles in hms jester had been earnest likeable and immensely competent but had never attempted to cross the line from subordinate to friend anthony langlie had come as close to being a companionable confidant as any of his officers in the proteus frigate then had come edrd urquhart in savage intensely sobre and determined so new to the frigate and dumped into her longserving officers mates and crew which had turned over from proteus entire and theyd barely spent a year together before lewrie had lost her to another before his trial geoffrey westcott was as close as lewrie had come in his entire career at sea to finding someone he could unbend with or he thought he could lewrie liked him it was risky to do lest a friendship could be taken advantage of detrimental to good order and discipline and the enforced separateness required of a captain like favouring one of his offspring over another it could lead to bad feelings in the wardroom permission tpipe clear decks and up spirits sir westcott asked as seven bells chimed from the forecastle belfry carry on sir the guns were swabbed out tompions replaced muzzles washed and the barrels and carriages bowsed below the port sills the ports secured and all guntools returned below the marine drummer began to beat and the fifers launched into the bowld soldier boy one of lt simcocks particular favourites the purser his clerk and assistant the masteratarms mr appleby and the ships corporals scammell and keetch escorted by marine sergeant trickett and corporals mogridge and brownlie brought up the redandgilt painted rum keg raising a chorus of huzzahs and hurrays from the waiting sailors i like that tune lewrie told himself my father and i sang it once in hyde park drunk as lords mostlike or well on the way to it where did i pack my pennywhistle he strolled about the quarterdeck as the ships people queued up for their tots hands in the small of his back he studied the sails and rigging for a way to wrench a bit more speed from her where the winds stood off her starboard quarters by craning up at the commissioning pendant looking ahead then astern to the other ships lined up with a mile between them humtootling the tune under his breath and while up the street each girl ye meet will cry oh isnt he a daruhllin my bowld soldier boy mouthing the words almost silently this wont do lewrie thought suddenly losing his good mood mister warburton he called heading aft a signal to modeste submit then form lineabreast after that send extend hunt to norwest take this down believe chase will hug north coast aye sir midshipman warburton said scribbling it down with a pencil stub on a scrap of paper then turning to his signalmen and the flag lockers some of that only took one or two flags in the popham code but the rest took a long time to spell out letter by letter it was nigh to noon sights before modeste replied and that was a laconic set of flags for acknowledged after that nothing and it was midafternoon after lewries midday meal before modeste sent up hoists first a general for all ships prefaced by one gun to get their attention alter course westnorwest half north sir midshipman mr entwhistle spelled out at least hell compromise halfway between lewrie thought then uhm entwhistle continued thumbing through his book to interpret the rest form lineabreast order of sailing northernmost number three pylades lewrie said aloud number two thats us sir number four then one distance between ships ten miles day five miles night entwhistle read off haltingly the preparative is up sir very well mister westcott all hands ready to haul up to windward and form lineabreast lewrie ordered at the drop of the preparative modeste surged on westnorwest while cockerel wheeled off to her starboard side and reliant and pylades swung onto a beam reach bound due north headed for the horizon though it was hard on captain blanding to change his mind or take heed of a suggestion lewrie was learning he wasnt entirely pigheaded modeste could scan the seas out to twelve miles to larboard and ahead and have cockerel ten miles north of her looking ahead another twelve miles as would reliant ten miles north of her lastly pylades could see twelve miles ahead and to the north making a scouting line that could search a swath of ocean fiftyfour miles across during the daylight hours signal from cockerel sir a repeat from modeste for all ships all private numbers midshipman warburton puzzled out once they were ten miles north of cockerel and steady on westnorwest half north make all sail conformable with the weather sir but of course he did lewrie hooted i trust the ship is in your good hands mister merriman well aye sir the third officer answered not knowing quite what to say to such a statement or was it a question of his ability good lewrie said plumping down into his slingchair wake me at the start of the first dog here laddies he beckoned patting his chest to attract his cats toulon and chalky who had been sunning themselves atop the tarpaulin cover of the hammock nettings both got to their paws stretched yawned then hopped down to swarm up his legs to his chest for a spell of wubbies as soon as the cats tired of that lewrie actually pulled down his hat over his eyes crossed his arms sprawled out his legs and gave the impression that he really had fallen into a nod lt westcott came back to the quarterdeck after an hour or so of papershuffling and stopped dead at the top of the starboard companionway ladder from the waist cocking a brow at lt merriman before going to join him the captain seems in rare takings sir merriman whispered to the first officer with a boyishly shy grin higher spirits than hes been is he really napping westcott wondered aloud sure enough lewries head was over to one side his mouth slightly open and there came a nasally sleep sound good lt westcott decided its been a year since the french hes mourned enough dare i speak of it mind hes a ship to command i expect that helps merriman opined and the chance for action and revenge back where he belongs in familiar waters to boot westcott added he might even be happy better for us to serve a happy captain stead of a gloomer is that a word who cares chapter fortyfive lewrie cheated a bit of course by edging out northrd til the masthead lookouts could barely spot cockerel and covertly signalling parham to take his pylades out away from reliant to the limits of her lookouts vision as well four more miles could make all the difference was his main thoughtif the french had shied as far away from any patrolling vessels out of jamaica as they could another day passed full of boresome ships routine and gunnery practice decks were scoured meals were served rum was issued twice a day hammocks and bedding came up from below at am for stowing in stanchions and nettings then taken below at sundown after the reliant stood evening quarters watches were set and rotated noon sights were taken and their position reckoned by the height of the sun and by the halfhour casts of the chiplog aft with stunsls set the squadron reeled off an average of nine or ten knots during the daylight hours much less in the darkness but still managed runs of nearly miles from one noon to the next and they were running out of ocean another day and they would be off the approaches to lake borgne and the first passes through the lowlying mississippi delta lewrie paced his quarterdeck from taffrail flag lockers and lanthorns to the companionway ladder and back again head down hands in the small of his back all his recent good humour gone fretting he had been wrong horribly wrong fearing that the french had kept their twoday lead and had made good time and were even now anchored at the head of passes off fort balise ready to sail up the river to new orleans as safe and unassailable as babes in their mothers arms as he paced forrud towards the bows the lowering sun was harsh in his eyes still yellow though in the next halfhour it would go red and amber as it neared the western horizon already the seas astern were beginning to be lost in dusk and the seas ahead were a sheet of wrinkled copper fresh from the forge with the wavetops tinged a coral red atop their fleeting bluegrey shadows lovely sunset in a bit sir lt spendlove commented mine arse on a bandbox lewrie all but snarled back at the end of the first dog watch which was due in a few minutes dammit they would have to put over the helm and slink back to the south to take station five miles off cockerel shrinking the line to fifteen miles northtosouth and the lookouts vision shrunk down to five miles or less depending on cloud cover or the lack of moon deck there a lookout called down pylades is haulin her wind an comin down tus signalling lewrie looked about for one of the midshipmen of the watch and found grainger first aloft with you mister grainger with a glass and your signals book mister rossyngton make ready to answer with flag signals hop to it he watched grainger scale the windward shrouds and ratlines to the catharpings go out the futtock shrouds to the maintop then get up the narrower topmast shrouds to the crosstrees to join the sailor posted there as a lookout glared rather urging haste before the evening got too dark to see deck there the lookout bawled relaying what grainger told him phrase by phrase four strange ships night lights on th horizon chase in sight enemy in sight what course do they steer lewrie shouted back hands cupped either side of his mouth in a quarterdeck fullgale cry deck there the lookout prefaced needlessly chase is sternon bound nornorwest chart lewrie demanded going to the binnacle cabinet and the traverse board lt spendlove spread out the chart already pencilled with the sailing masters reckoning of their position at noon hours before and a rough dead reckoning track of knots logged on the course since the chandeleur islands lewrie exclaimed poking a finger at the long lowlying string of isles that lay almost dead on their own bows theyre going northabout the chandeleurs into sheltered water sail down the lee side with breton island to starboard and get to passe a la loutre where itd be hellishhard thave at era good lord sir they just threw away their lead over us lt spendlove said with a gasp it would have been safer to stand on direct for the east pass and theyd have been inside the river mouth hours ago why would they do that theres deepenough water in the mississippi sound up there lewrie told him sweeping a finger along the coast east of lake pontchartrain and the string of barrier islands that sheltered a very small settlement named old biloxicat ship dog and horn islands he could anchor there he be hard to get at and land his troops at biloxi or send all his boats through the rigolets pass here at the spanish fort coquilles and get into pontchartrain and down to new orleans by the back entrance no one could touch em then then if he wished he could even land his boats here from lake borgne and its not fifteen miles up the chef menteur road to new orleans proper lewrie said stabbing at the very beach where long ago he and an agent from panton leslie amp company had explored a landing place for british soldiers hell use these little islands as a barrier between our ships and his sir spendlove excitedly said even if he dont know there are british ships so close the decean fellow on the lee side ofem and us or anybody elses squadron on the windward and its as good as an iron shield lewrie spat standing back and letting one corner of the chart roll up mister rossyngton signal to pylades come down to me he referred to the chart once more the chandeleurs did anyone live there hed never enquired it was a bowshaped arc of sand isles and shoals about fourty miles end to end lewrie dug into the binnacle cabinet for a rusty pair of dividers stepping off distances they were sixty miles or so off the chandeleurs the french not twelve miles norwest of pylades when spotted another twelve miles to the norwest of reliant and were fourty miles off the island chain goin almost due north now so they dont run aground on them in the dark lewrie quickly speculated hmm twenty miles on that course say twentyfive to round the end of the last one well clear o shoals under reduced sail too feelin their way in the dark damn slow then fourty milessouwest down the lee of the islands they might be clear of em by dawn tomorrow landin his toy soldiers aint enough lewrie crowed tossing the dividers back into the cabinet drawer hes this close tsuccess hell make for the pass а la loutre and get his ships upriver too lt spendlove leaned over the chart to where lewries finger rested seaward of the passes but south of the chandeleurs windward of breton island and the bay ronde there by first light tomorrow mister spendlove lewrie said feeling his excitement rising i think weve got em uhm beg pardon sir but how do we inform modeste and cockerel spendlove asked delighted wolfishly excited himself but a bit mystified once its full dark none of the night signals will be able to convey any sort of message we go tell him mister spendlove lewrie crowed we barge up to him invite ourselves to supper and tell him after all where he is steering the course we must steer to meet up with him and a course tplace us where we need tbe is prettymuch the same chapter fortysix do you imagine sir that the reason the french sailed northabout the islands is a result of navigational error lt westcott mused in a low mutter as they stood by the starboard bulwarks near the beginning of the sailtending gangway with their telescopes extended as dawn began to break we know theyre cunnythumbed and cackhanded the first days they manage tget out tsea but that cackhanded lewrie gawped thirty miles at the most off their intended landfall after the passage from cape franзois about thirteen hundred miles all told would be acceptable to most mariners if their chronometers were out by a few seconds westcott speculated or they ran into a contrary slant of wind for a day or so and their dead reckoning was off by just a tick just so long as they manage tfind their way back down to us i could give a bigger damn lewrie said in a soft growl teeth bared in a whimsical smile he lowered his glass and looked about the decks hms reliant all their ships were darkened their taffrail lanthorns extinguished with only tiny glims burning by the sandglasses at the forecastle belfry for a ships boy to determine the half hours to ring the watch bells and a hooded one in the binnacle to illuminate the compass for the helmsmen sailing master and officer of the watch they were all at quarters rousing the crews at the end of the middle watch at am and omitting the deckscrubbing with holystones or dragged bears or the rigging of the washdeck pumps hammocks had been stowed in the stanchions down the tops of the bulwarks on either beam rolled snug to pass through the ring measures and used as protection from smallarms fire and splinters the hands had been fed early then summoned to quarters a little after am and the galley fires had been staunched there had been time for lewrie to sponge off with a pint of water and some soap to shave then dress in clean underclothes with silk shirt and stockings in hopes of what the day would bring he and his officers and mids were dressed in their best uniforms with pistols in their belts and swords at their sides chain slings were rigged aloft on the yards to keep them from crashing down if shot away antiboarding nets were laid out down both sides ready to be hoisted gunport lids creaked open and softly came thumping back with the easy roll of the frigate as she crept along under all plain sail with the main course at two reefs ready for hauling up clear of catching fire from the discharges of their own cannon and men stood swaying by their pieces guntools in their hands powder monkeys had the first cartridges in their leather carriers as they knelt facing the guns down the centreline lt simcocks marines were fully kitted out in red and scarlet white breeches and kneehigh black denim spatterdashes white crossbelts and black leather accoutrements standing down either gangway behind the bulwarks and hammock nettings waiting below in the waist aft in lewries greatcabins tiny red battle lanthorns glowed guardedly out of sight from outboard from a foes sight the slowmatch coiled round the water tubs between those guns had not yet been lit if the flintlock strikers failed to ignite or broke a flint or spring the fuse could light the feather quills in the touchholes sparking off the finemealed priming powder well be silouetted against the dawn i suppose lt westcott said on rocking on the balls of his booted feet good odds lewrie agreed grunting no helpin it pray the frog lookouts are blind or late in bein posted aloft stead of the decks gives us five minutes more tclose em they go about well just chase them westcott said sighing as he lifted his telescope again to peer ahead off the starboard bows lewrie looked up but could not quite see the long lazy whipping of the commissioning pendant the wind was scant that morning a touch cool on the skin from the starboard quarter they were angled enough off the winds to be able to feel the wind for once he turned and peered aft at modeste she was a large dark shadow as wide and bluff as a baleful barn her grey weathered sails eerily rustling to the winds vagaries equally dark against the predawn gloom she was only a little over a cables distance astern yet lewrie had to recall what she looked like bowson with little more than the faint mustachio of foam under her forefoot that creamed to either side of her bows to positively mark her place damme is she fuzzy lewrie thought pinching the bridge of his nose and rubbing his eyes as false dawn only slightly began to grey the horizon astern revealing charcoalsketch impressions of the ships aft of reliant are my eyes goin he wondered no its mist mine arse on a bandbox of all the shitten luck the false dawn sketched his own decks as he looked forward gave slightly more detail of artillery sailors sails rigging and mastsall misted with a thin predawn fog land ho a lookout shouted down island on th starbd side two point off th starbd bows five mile off the souwest tip of the last chandeleur lewrie growled as he went to the sailing masters chart befogged though were closer than five miles if he can see it three miles morelike sir it appears to be a thin fog sir mr caldwell the sailing master cautiously pointed out using dividers to measure possible distances then lean closer and peer at the depth notations still in deep water sir do we hold to this course mist or fog however thin though lt westcott fretted near them fingers flexing on the hilt of his scabbarded sword we could miss them in it even so sir shouldve remembered lewrie muttered turning away to pace to the forward edge of the quarterdeck he chid himself for forgetting that the coasts hereabouts were so lowlying and marshy the summers as humid as canton calcutta or the ivory coast of africa and a cooler sea air just naturally bred fogs and mists deck there the lookout shouted once more just as the first hints of true dawn and the first colours could be ascertained ships four ships hullup fine on th starbd bows mister grainger lewrie bellowed over his shoulder as he lifted his telescope to peer outboard a sense of relief of success beginning to fill him hoist to modeste enemy in sight aye aye sir the fifteenyearold piped back four bells chimed from the focsle belfry am and it was true dawn at last close enough to the exact time for sunrise noted in the ephemeris grey murk retreated westward as brightness surged up from the east coastal waters went from black to steely grey then to dark blue with flecks of white there were thin clouds and the first pale smears of blue skies there was the mist of course a pearlescence to the west closer to the shore where it would be thicker next hoist to modeste mister grainger lewrie ordered as he returned to the helm make it four ships fine on starboard bows aye sir tip of the last o the chandeleurs here lewrie eagerly said jabbing at the chart were about here and the french are there do we bear off a point or two to larboard and well have them on our starboard beams bowson to us and open to rakin fire or we hold tthis course and we barge into them bowson to their larboard batteries up to modeste that lt westcott commented shrugging aye but id prefer to haul off place ourselves twixt them and the east pass into the river lewrie schemed aloud theyd have to fight through us or go about and run back the way they came with breton island tlarboard and the waters shoalin fast the closer to biloxi or lake borgne they go they fight us or they go aground up yonder and strike their colours theyre hullup already lt westcott said looking dubious surely theyve spotted us round the time we spotted them sir aloft there lewrie shouted cupping his hands about his mouth have they turned away and what is the order of their sailing sailin as before sir the lookout replied same course a twodecker leadin then a frigate another twodecker and another frigate the hindmost makin sail sir theyve seen us right enough lewrie told his officers on a tear tget into the delta to the head of passes before we can close em and in the same order as they were last night with their troop ship to leeward so they could protect her shell turn away the sailing master speculated shell press on even if the others engage us lewrie countered shes too close to the end of her passage tdo else mister westcott shake the reefs from the main course and drive her hard helmsmen helm up and steer west norwest just pray jesus that blanding sees what i intend and dont interfere lewrie thought peeking astern in dread of anxious bunting one can see them from the deck sir midshipman grainger cried from the starboard mizen shrouds and a perch most of the way up them lewrie raised his telescope focussed then by god there they are he exulted in silence they were real not willothewisps and not more than six or seven miles off i was right lewrie felt like shouting this frog did hide his arse behind the chandeleurs or gave himself the option of landing his troops up north damme i was right whats the world comin to inside that pearly mist there were four complete sets of sails rustling like spooks on the scant winds there were darker smudges of hulls below them and the mastheads they were above the mist and clear as day now only five miles off he reckoned deck there a new voice called midshipman rossyngton had gone aloft to join the lookouts and it was his thin piping that they heard lead twodecker stands on the trailing ships haul their wind one point off the starboard bows avast moving to two points off lewrie could see the hairthin mastheads pivotting aligning themselves atop each other as the three french warships came about to point roughly bowson to their own line of battle theyre lasting lewrie realised sailin a bowandquarter line oblique to us clever devil yonder the french would close them with a frigate nearest to them and their twodecker perhaps a cable further away off the frigates larboard quarters and the trailing frigate even further away off the s larboard quarter like the last three fingers of lewries left hand worn to larboard tack sir mr caldwell said scratching his scalp with a pencil stub up under his hat theyll have to come off the wind fore they can cross our bows and rake us a clever way to close the range quickly lt westcott mused no sirs not clever at all lewrie suddenly whooped all but startling his first officer and sailing master a new signal for modeste mister grainger submit new course west by north enemy is lasking on larboard tack aye sir grainger replied hustling back to his duties by the flag lockers perplexed by the term he shouldve changed course no more than two points in lineofsuccession not all at once lewrie pointed out that wouldve placed him cross our bows but no he had em all wheel as one and wear to larboard tack we turn more westerly hell barge up to us with all of our guns directed at the nearest frigate and the twodeckers fire is masked as is the trailin frigates they stay as they are and think tsail down our starboard beam for broadsides on opposin tacks theyre stacked on top of each other less the followin ships luff up in order tfall in trail of the lead ship lewrie urgently explained arms swinging and his hands clapping before him almost skipping about the deck in glee and do they come back to their original course theyll end up bowson to our line and under raking fire from all four of ours lt westcott quickly grasped just too clever by half the poor bastard now lets all pray captain blanding sees what we see lewrie replied turning to peer intently at modestes signals halliards the troop ship might escape us whilst were engaged with these three but i spose it cant be helped better for us had cockerel or pylades led our line if captain blanding sent one of his lighter gunned frigates off in chase that instant from the rear of their line it would take hours for one of them to fetch the twodecker transport into even long gunrange perhaps only a few miles off pass a la loutre or have to chase her right up to fort balise and the head of passes in what at the moment was still officially spanish territory signal sir midshipman grainger crisply reported form line of battle course west by north with all despatch weve got em mister westcott lewrie exulted with a growl by god weve got em chapter fortyseven theyre coming back to lineahead sir midshipman rossyngton shouted down from the mainmast royal yard a perch even more precarious than the crosstrees thankee mister rossyngton lewrie shouted back now come to the deck and take your station at quarters hellishodd he said in a much softer voice to westcott as he lifted his glass to peer out for a sign of the foe they see our masttrucks and commissioning pendants we see theirs and all else is damnall squiffy aha sir lt westcott said pointing with his telescope i can just make out the lead frigate there sir shell be directly bowson to us square on our starboard beam does she not alter course lewrie swivelled found a ghostly bow sprit and jibboom about a mile to windward found jibs and a foretopmast staysl then the taninwhite square shapes of the leading frigates forecourse and fore topsail to windward of us now theyre silhouetted gainst the dawn the damned fools french he sniffed they just cant keep it simple all that elegant jeune йcole bumf they came up with two wars ago back in the seventeen sixties what oddsd ye give me mister westcott do they load with starshot and chainshot and try tdismast us as their doctrine demands i doubt theyll have time to turn a whole battery upon us for that practise sir lt westcott replied he was smiling not one of his brief toothbaring flashgrins but a gladsome widespread mouth theres her mainmast a hint of her mizen and lewrie looked up at the commissioning pendant their line was on starboard tack with the light winds from the noreast by east and the french after their last manoeuvre into lineahead formation were now sailing with those winds fine on their larboard quarters and theres their seventyfour just emerging astern of her westcott added as the ponderous behemoth loomed up more solid from the mists about a cable astern of the frigate stand by mister spendlove lewrie alerted the second officer in charge of the main guns in the waist you will make sure that all pieces fire as they bear and bowrake her not quite yet not quite lt westcott was muttering to himself flexing his knees to ride the easy scend and roll of the ship as he peered intently at the lead ship judging the range here it comes lewrie said with a grunt as the frenchmans two chase guns exploded from her forecastle at last those projectiles did not sound like roundshot there was a whole thin chorus of light shot that went soaring high above the decks expanding barshot chainshot and starshot shouldve laid a wager mister westcott he said with another pleased grunt as sails aloft were pierced a few lines parted and some splinters were torn from the topmasts i make the range a bit over a quartermile sir lt westcott informed him good enough for me sir lewrie told him then lifted a brass speakingtrumpet mister spendlove as you bear you may open upon her aye aye sir as you bear fire spendlove shouted as if paced by a metronome atop a parlour piano forte the guns began to bellow from the pounder chase gun forrud then down the long battery of fourteen pounders gushing great clouds of powder smoke and amber sparks that merged into a single thunderhead along the starboard side then lingered and was blown back into the gunners faces by the light winds and only slowly thinned and trailed away to the unengaged larboard side blotting away their view of the foe for a long minute or so aft hms modeste began her first broadside as well a greater louder roaring from her heavier pounders and pounders spewing out an even denser cloud of spent powder smoke deck there a lookout high aloft above the mists and powder smoke shouted er foremasts by th board sprit an boom timbers be shot away lewrie had a dimmer view from the quarterdeck even so he could make out the french frigates foremast crashing down in ruin the light royal and tgallant topmasts above her crosstrees collapsing zigzag and yards and sails swirling like a broken kite the stouter timber of the mast above the foremasts fighting top was leaning forward like a newfelled tree to drape over her forecastle roundhouse beakheads and the shattered jibboom and bow sprit bowraked for certain by god sir lt westcott was enthusing reliants guns or modestes heavier ones no matter the curved plankings of any ships bluff bows were not as stout as a ships sides with their heavy closerspaced frames and thicker scantling bows like the delicate squaredoff stern transoms could be holed and when they were the roundshot all that broken lumber and clouds of whirling jagged wood splinters got funnelled down the length of the gundeck shattering deck planking overhead beams frame timbers and dismounting massive guns turning truckcarriages into more splinters snapping the carline support posts and slaughtering enemy sailors by the dozens lamb tthe slaughter mister westcott lewrie growled utterly delighted with the mental image of that murderous chaos the terror dismemberments and wounds they had just inflicted yonder i dont see why their flag officers comin at us this way but more fool him mister spendlove serve her another skin the bastards if the plan had been to get up to gunrange to the british then wear insuccession and lay the french squadron broadsidetobroadside that hope was unravelling fast with her foremast gone and all of her foreandaft headsails lost with it the leading frigate was crippled in a twinkling unable to turn quickly to parallel reliant she wallowed and sloughed trying to wear about northerly but shed been gutshot from an agile gazelle to a sluggish snail pressed on by the light winds and slow to wear across them with her vulnerable already ravaged bows still offered up for slaughter ready lads as you bear fire lt spendlove roared the starboard focsle pounder bow chaser erupted once more followed by all the starboard beam pounders joined this time by the stubby pounder carronadesthe smashersand the quarterdeck pounders the range was even closer and they could not miss over the deafening bellows of their own artillery reliants people could hear the parroty rrawks of solid iron shot slamming into her a loud rawk crack then the screech of something substantial giving way the smoke slowly cleared from their second deliberately aimed broadside revealing the french frigates new hurts she had managed to come about at degree angles baring her larboard side as if trying to bring her guns to bear but her mainmast had been decapitated a few feet above the fighting top perhaps by a lucky hit from one of the pounder carronades and the press of wind had brought all above it down onto her larboard bulwarks the crossdeck boattier beams and her waist her reefed main course sail lay like a funeral shroud over it all if she tried to fire back there were good odds shed set herself on fire from the sparks scattered among all that wreckage only her mizen mast still stood flying tgallant tops and her spanker now she was completely unable to manoeuvre or maintain steerage way her tricolour flag was missing yet after a minute or so someone over there took a small harbour jack tricolour up the mizen shrouds to the fighting top and nailed it to the mast zut alors monsewer lewrie cried through a speakingtrumpet to them thumping a fist on the caprails mort de ma vie whatre ye goin tdo now hey sacrefuckinbleu he sneered as reliant swept on past the frigate putting her on her starboard quarters to subside slowly into the thinning mists yet in those thinning mists now they were clear of the frigate lewrie had a much clearer view of that hulking french gunner she had been about a cable astern of her consort when the first broadside had been fired she had yet to be engaged and what are you goin tdo sir lewrie asked aloud as if he could speak with the french senior officer aboard the modeste was firing as his own guns were being overhauled swabbed out and reloaded decide quick monsewer if ye care for yer paintwork he added as modestes shot began to pummel their flagship the lead frigate was now an immobile hulk unable to sail and making no discernible way except for a painfully slow wheel to the north laying herself almost at right angles to her flagships course as that twodecker came on under a full press of sail on the light winds and her captain suddenly faced a horrid choice wear cross the wind and turn northerly to avoid ramming into his crippled frigate and continue the engagement in more traditional lineagainstline or put up his helm and pivot souwest to avoid going aboard the frigate and meet modeste starboardtostarboard with her massive guns on opposing tacks she turns to face modeste she lays herself open to a raking sir lt westcott pointed out shaking his head in wonder at how anyone could put himself in such a predicament not completely bowson mister westcott lewrie countered in calmer takings one good sharp broadside into modeste and hes the lighter frigates tdeal with after oh shit shes wheelin tstarboard lewrie told himself as he saw her bows begin to swing northerly shell be blowin us tflinders next if she clears the frigate sir westcott said taking a deep breath as the twodecker barrelled down on the crippled frigate wheeling with her helm hard down and her tall sides heeling so far over her lower gundeck ports were only a foot or so above the sea lay us due north sir lewrie snapped to his first lieutenant mister spendlove we will engage the twodecker aye sir lt spendlove answered though lewrie was sure that he had to gulp in alarm first in great sea battles the fighting was left to the lineofbattle ships and frigates stood by to aid any who needed assistance or to repeat signals down the smoky line they mostcertainly did not trade fire with warships that bore three or four times their weight of metal thatll open his gunarcs to nigh abeam he told westcott a collision would be nice about now lt westcott said with a hopeful note to his voice after passing orders to the helmsmen and the bracetending hands it could get intrestin in a minute or two either way sir lewrie agreed but does he get past the frigate hell use her for a shield against modestes fire beats the bowrake hed have taken had he swung sutherly modestes guns were hammering the french flagship hulling her twixt wind and water and raising great bursts of paint splinters and engrained dirt from her sides heeled over as she was some shot shattered gangway bulwarks sending rolled up and stowed hammocks and bedding flying like disturbed nests of snakes but some of modestes broadside was striking the immoble frigate not the twodecker as she ducked behind her consort in her frantic turn come on ram the bitch lewrie prayed in silence and it did look as if the s jibboom and bow sprit would spear into the starboard mizen shrouds of the frigate but she slid on past scraping her larboard bows down the frigates starboard side she lost her cathead timber and larboard bower anchor and visibly staggered rolling almost upright for a moment but she sailed clear with little more damage to show for it by broadside mister spendlove open upon her lewrie cried now while shes unable to respond reliant had come up to nearly a close reach to the north with the wrecked frigate almost dead astern and the french twodecker only two points astern of lying abeam and she was still turning as if to fall in trail of reliant or cut through between modeste and lewries vessel and rejoin her fleeing transport there was a scramble on the gundeck to shift the aim of the artillery as far aft as possible but if they did fire at such acute angles when the guns recoiled there would be no controlling their backward lurches lt spendlove looked up at the quarterdeck with a shrug and a lifting of both arms modeste clear of the wrecked french frigate was firing again at the twodecker the twodeckers larboard side erupted in a reply the range was only about a cable and everyone on reliant quarterdeck who could look aft let out a groan to see the avalanche of shot that struck modestes sides punched through her sails and raised feathery plumes of shotsplashes all round her engaged side cockerel and pylades are engaging the trailing frenchman sir midshipman grainger called forward with no signals to send at that moment he could use his telescope for his own amusements sorry sir lt spendlove said from the foot of the starboard companionway ladder the guns wont bear unless we alter course both batteries mister spendlove lewrie answered leaning to smile at him if shes almost dead astern of us well weave about from tack to tack and rake her bows til she takes notice aye sir thatll take some of her attention from modeste at any rate lewrie told himself as he went back to the helm to rejoin westcott and explain what he wished may i suggest we haul our wind to larboard for the first shots sir lt westcott posed with a brief grin give her the larboard guns then come back due north else our eastrd turn would put us dead into the eye of the wind and in irons if were not quick about it very good mister westcott lets do it mister spendlove larboard battery first were going to haul our wind aye sir two points downhelm first mister westcott lewrie decided after a quick lookabout get some way on her and some lead to windward so we can lay spendloves guns dead abeam aye sir stations for wear westcott called out to the crew reliant surged up to windward on a close reach for a moment with braces hauled in the deck heeling and the sea swashing more urgently down her flanks the french twodecker still duelling with modeste shifted from a point off the starboard quarter to a point off her larboard quarter now mister westcott wear her stand ready on the guns mister spendlove lewrie snapped reliant lost a lot of her gathered speed as she came about the decks canting the masts wheeling cross the skies pivotting on a wide patch of disturbed foamed water as she swung to due west steadying and laying herself cross the twodeckers course two cables off as you bear mister spendlove lewrie yelled as you bear fire hard iron roundshot caromed off the sea round the twodeckers bows dapping from first graze to smash into her bows more iron hit her directly punching holes into her lower gundeck ripping away her figurehead her curving beakhead rails and bowling down both her upper and lower gundecks her jibboom disappeared in a cloud of splinters collapsing her inner jib and outer flying jib and her fore topmast stays as reliant shot hit her captain blandings modeste delivered another broadside lower deck first then upper deck and all her carronades and the french flagship was visibly staggered stay on this course til shes on our larboard quarters mister westcott then well go back on the wind lewrie ordered just a bit longer so our next broadsides at closer range aye sir starboard side next mister spendlove lewrie called down to the waist signal sir our number midshipman grainger said from aft engage the enemy more closely sir very well mister grainger lets do that ready about lewrie replied grinning about now mister westcott reliant wheeled about to due north once more slowing again but placing the french warship squareon to the gunports of the starboard battery with her at a degree angle a bit west of her course i leave it to you mister spendlove serve her a goodun he shouted down to the waist god but i love this lewrie thought imagining that he had wakened from a long dull sleep mostlike its all im good for but i need this big guns shot and powder stench and killin frogs as you bear fire spendlove rasped hoarsely it would not be a proper bowrake but the bulk of their fire would slam into the twodeckers forrud larboard quarters this time the range no more than a single cable and closing quickly as reliant crossed the frenchmans course almost on the ragged edge of the wind and the sailing master lt westcott the quartermasters on the wheel watching her luff damned close waiting for the very last gun to fire to order the helm be put up and haul off from north by west now sir lewrie shouted as the last gun aft in his cabins erupted full and by due north and lets get some space ahead of her fore we try that again oh lovely marine lieutenant simcock exulted until action was at close pistolshot or until a boarding action was called for he had no proper duties on the quarterdeck and had been strolling about a curious onlooker thatll ruin their digestion hms modeste was meeting captain blandings requirements for three broadsides every two minutes still deliberate and controlled not a ragged catchascatchcan cannonade resembling the firing line of a hunting party potting pheasant when ships were so close together that guncaptains were allowed to fire at will she was taking punishment but she was dealing it out in spades compared to the speed and skill of the french modestes last broadside had struck almost in conjunction with reliants raking fire and they had just mauled her together upper bulwarks were disappearing in great clouds of shattered wood the twodeckers mizen mast was hit below the fighting top and leaped skyward for an instant before crashing down over her quarterdeck and poop falling to larboard alee like a titanic sweepoar to drag into the sea with her helm crushed under all that wreckage she began to slew downwind the light upper masts and topmasts slashed down separately raking away stays and mainmast yards and sails before slamming down into her waist as well she sagged further downwind wear mister westcott lewrie snapped seizing the opportunity larboardbattery mister spendlove and itll be a proper bowrake this time the french flagship was losing way painfully turning alee and sagging towards modestes waiting guns as reliant came off the wind to a reciprocal course due south the enemys bows were squareon to her and the range slow as all the manoeuvring had made her reliant would be very close this time no more than yards under her bows for the broadside ruin yer digestion aye lewrie thought in murderous joy hammering his fists on the crossdeck hammock nettings to urge his gunners to take advantage of this sudden change in fortune rip yer bloody guts out morelike blow yer bloody heart out come on come on the last of the roundshot was being rammed home the wads were being shoved down the muzzles quills were inserted flintlock strikers were cocked and trigger lines hauled taut as you bear fire both spendlove and merriman shouted i think shes struck by god lt westcott exclaimed opinion lost in the deafening bellows of the guns sir captain sir ignore him lewrie told himself eyes intent on the damage they were causing as each piece erupted in smoke flames and sparks then leaped rearwards i want gore reliant sailed on past the devastation the broadside done mister westcott uphelm and steer souwest before we tangle with modeste their own flagship was only a cable off their larboard beam as they swung away alee of her scampering to avoid being trampled you say something mister westcott lewrie asked massaging his ringing ears as if he hadnt quite heard what hed said i think shes struck sir yes theres all her colours on the way down sir weve beat them sir theyve struck to us lt westcott came close to say to point his arm at the foe glorious ah well hmm in that case mister spendlove mister merriman stand easy lewrie ordered taking out his pocketwatch to ascertain the time as if it was no great matter at all although he felt sudden rage to be denied complete vengeance he had to playact a proper phlegmatic sea captain deck there a mainmast lookout shouted down tother frigates struck t cockerel an pylades fourtyfive minutes lewrie marvelled not a whole hour and its done goddamn the cowardly secure from quarters sir lewrie told westcott who was congratulating the men of the afterguard the quarterdeck gun crews and the helmsmen and ready the ships boats to take charge of the foe mister simcock work for your marines tguard the prisoners most welcome sir simcock crowed back lewrie went to one of the larboard quarterdeck carronades and clambered atop it to the bulwarks then into the mizen stays and ratlines so he could ascend a few feet above the deck to look things over with a glass cockerel and pylades lay to either beam of the trailing french frigate all three warships fetchedto and boats already working between them she looked mostly undamaged with all her masts still standing and her sails whole the first frigate was still wallowing and rocking and lewrie could see gushes of water jetting overside from her bilge pumps two frigates and a seventyfour why that has tbe worth at least fifty sixty thousand pounds for the lot the sailing master was speculating aloud two years pay for every man jack i wager goddamned sham sailors you bloody cowardly bastards lewrie muttered under his breath mine arse on a bandbox is that all the fight ye had in ye he said louder over four thousand or more miles we came for this damn yer thin french blood sir lt westcott asked from below him you said something i said the frogs are a lot o poltroons who dont have grit enough for a real fight mister westcott lewrie gravelled descending from his perch i spose we should come about and work our way under modestes lee marvellous sir lt merriman was saying as he mounted to the quarterdeck dye know weve but two hands wounded none dead one fellow was splintered in the foremast top and one of my gunners had his ankle broken in the recoil tackle bloody miraculous what signal from the flag sir our number midshipman grainger intruded with a sharp cry general chase and transport sir the indiaman too hmm mr caldwell the sailing master speculated further that might mean another ten thousand pounds all told headandgun money on all their soldiers too what she cant be more than an hour ahead of us sir westcott said consulting his own timepiece crack on for pass a la loutre sir aye mister westcott lewrie agreed pretending to perk up in false glee when what he wanted to do most dearly wanted to do was send his hands back to the guns barge up to the nearest french ship and finish the job the prizemoney bedamned mister caldwell the best direct course for pass a la loutre if you please weve a ship to catch up fore dark aye aye sir the sailing master responded still rubbing his hands together as he turned to the traverse board to consult a chart three cheers lads midshipman the honourable entwhistle was urging down in the waist as the last cannon was secured and cleaned three cheers for our good reliant three cheers for captain lewrie huzzah midshipman houghton added its victory bloody toady lewrie sourly thought squirming inside to hear that burst of cheering hooting and clapping in his honour oh he had to recognise it standing at the forward edge of the quarterdeck and look down into the ships waist where his crew capered and danced in joy of their first battle together and their victory he had to doff his hat to them nod his head yet keep a stern demeanour that wasnt all that hard for anger still rumbled in him for being cheated of the ocean of french gore he so heartily desired three cheers for yourselves men he shouted as the din died down a bit for three rounds every two minutes and good gunnery that went down like a christmas pudding and pleased them right down to their toes he envied them their jubilation now lads weve a last ship ttake over yonder lewrie told them pointing westward with his hat and thatll make it a clean sweep are ye ready for one more aye sir aye lets be at em they shouted back then lets be about it lewrie shouted soon as were steady on course well splice the mainbrace best course will be souwest by west sir the sailing master supplied as he turned away from their last cheers make it so mister westcott lewrie ordered souwest by west and crack on chapter fortyeight and take her they did sixteen miles from the entrance to the mississippi out of sight of land and any watchers from fort balise or the delta shoal islands she was a converted twodecker third rate sailing en flute with only half her lowerdeck guns and none of her upperdeck artillery even before reliant fetched up to her at range to random shot she struck her colours and reduced sail stealing any hopes that lewrie might have nourished that there would be more fighting there would be no more vengeance to be exacted when lewrie went aboard with his boat crew and half the marine complement even he could not summon up any more anger the twodecker carried only two companies of french infantry and was not manned to the establishment eitherthere were not over of them led by an older major who openly wept as he handed over his units colours and his sword there should have been a full regiment the major explained through an interpreter but sickness onpassage sickness once they had reached cape franзois and the desperate need for defenders on st domingue to hold off the savage slave army had reduced their numbers et lembarras des rйfugiйs msieur the major said waving an arm about the decks shrugging helplessly and swiping at his eyes with a calico handkerchief yes i see lewrie told him looking past him to the hundreds of civilians aboard older men and matrons married couples with their children so many children tant de pauvres orphelins the major added with a huge sigh and a sniffle his captains and lieutenants standing behind him were just as morose as their commanding officer and even the french sailors were hangdog miserable so many orphans msieur the interpreter said zey ave nozzing left mos of zem what zey ave to wear everyone lewrie glowered as he paced about the quarterdeck of the ship as it wallowed and rolled fetchedto and with the way off her there were simply too many frightened utterly miserable faces to avoid too many pathetic pleas in their eyes damn em lewrie thought i should take em all back to jamaica intern em til their evacuations arranged back to france but his men were busy gathering guntools muskets and short hangers and bayonets by the boatload disarming the soldiers and emptying the ships arms chests to leave them nothing with which to resist or rise up in the middle watch once back out at sea for kingston and a prize court he owed these pathetic frogs nothing not after what they had done to him to caroline yet you send zem to ze hulks msieur the interpreter wheedled as he dogged lewries steps turn zis ship to ze prison zey perish msieur you mak retourner au send them back back nestce pas back to le cap ze noirs sauvages will mak ze massacre oh stop yer bloody gob lewrie snapped at him going back to the entryport to look down at his empty boats he pursed his lips thinking hard he looked round and everywhere there were french men children and women all looking at him in dread some softly weeping into their handkerchiefs children wailed and clung to their parents legs or skirts lewrie went back to the interpreter pointing him towards the twodeckers captain ask him how many boats he has four that all and how many refugees per boat does he judge would be safe given the weather and sea state only sixty at a time damn how many of em are there over three hundred hell and damn it would be impossible even if the french seamen cooperated to the utmost with his three ships boats and the frenchmans he might be able to land ninety or so per trip ashore four trips in all but he would have to close the coast to within half a mile or more violating spanish territory and raising one hell of a diplomatic stink louisiana was still spanish the handover to france had not yet happened as far as he knew better for him if it had reverted to france then he could barge into enemy waters with impunity if the french sailors manning the oars refused to return for a second load preferring to scamper and escape imprisonment it would be over before it began and land them where lewrie paced to the shoreward bulwarks hands in the small of his back recalling how bleak and barren were the alluvial mississippi delta shoals either side of the passes both banks of the main river might as well maroon em on the chandeleurs he scoffed an hundred miles downriver from new orleans close to fort balise damn that would do the refugees no good fort balise was but lightly garrisoned a joke on the term fort and mostlike the few dons there lived handtomouth already and would have no victuals to share and there was the problem of a british warship in a spanish river again even if he could land them there in the name of christian charity how long would it be before the spanish got word upriver and sent a boat back to fort balise with extra food he turned to look north the squadrons got boats he realised do we take this ship and our other prizes into the mississippi sound anchor up near old biloxi we could barge em into lake borgne and land em on that little beach i found from there its only fifteen miles up the chef menteur road tnew orleans send a letter along with em whats the bloody name o that panton leslie trade agent i worked with pollock gideon pollock aye and if the squadron used all thirteen of their own ships boats commandeered all the undamaged french ships boats manned by british tars there would be no risk of losing prisoners who could not be trusted to honour their temporary parole he went back to midships of the quarterdeck to the interpreter once more tell them that i mean tget the civilians ashore but not here tell the major i must order him his officers and soldiers to go below msieur capitaine he and his officers will go aft under guard as well along with his sailors warn them that any attempt at revolt will result in great bloodshed i will not take them back to saint domingue tell them lewrie snapped cutting off the quick objections the civilian refugees will be allowed to go to new orleans the short way up yonder he said pointing an arm to the north any resistance on the part of the crew of this ship or the soldiers aboard and they will not comprendre msieur you swear zat zey will the interpreter pled upon my sacred honour and the honour of my country he told him and i will require the same oath from every officer here upon their sacred personal honour and the sacred honour of france and pray god i dont have tsay that moren once a century he thought keeping his phyz stern and immobile though the idea of the sacred honour of france almost made him gag they swore some reluctantly but they swore then dispersed to be herded below and locked away under marine guard desmond row back to reliant and deliver my compliments to lieutenant westcott and bid him ferry over a prizecrew armed to the teeth mind we will sail back to rejoin the squadron aye sor come on pat his coxn replied that frog shit doesnt sup with us this evening sir lewrie asked as captain blanding hosted his captains in his poop cabins ten days after the action and almost to kingston jamaica captain julien decean our worthy french opponent is under the weather captain lewrie blanding replied with a wink as his steward indicated that supper was ready to be served a dyspeptic distress to his touchy digestion dont much care for english cooking it would appear blanding added as he thumped his chair close to the table so the napkin he tucked into his neckstock could cover his girth there is also the matter that he feels we didnt quite fight fair mans an idiot sir blandings first lieutenant gilbraith commented the very idea that he expected to penetrate a line and separate us into defeatable pieces ha ah portable soup well admiral duncan did at camperdown mister gilbraith and doubled on the dutch lewrie pointed out as a bowl of soup was placed before him if hed had equal numbers well or was it tried in a fleet action with two or three columns let us pray that their navy is full of such dubious tacticians and lofty fools captain parham chuckled perhaps we should send him back to them to let him try it on again as few of our postcaptains are in french custody it may be a long while before decean is exchanged captain blanding drawled as he tested how hot his soup was blew on a spoonful then tasted it we may only hope that men of his stripe are entrusted with the command of their ships and that napoleon bonaparte continues to be as ignorant of the sea as he seems and continues to appoint men like decean hear hear captain stroud of cockerel heartily agreed upon my word captain lewrie blanding went on but i would not have suspected you to possess a shred of charity towards the french given your uhm dealings with the devils but i must own that it would have cut a bit rough with me to be so heartless as to doom those refugees to a jamaican holding pen we dont make war on helpless civilians it just aint christian hear hear sir lt gilbraith seconded between quick slurps a most fitting end to our endeavour indeed chaplain brundish stuck in it is one thing to show implacable wrath to those most deserving of it yet quite another to extend the sweet kind hand of mercy to those who do not so british so english that it makes me swell with pride to be church of england well said sir captain blanding exclaimed a most fitting act to gild the laurel wreaths of our victory for which we have captain lewrie to thank for the suggestion hear hear captain stroud piped up lifting his glass toady lewrie sourly thought well thankee for sayin so sir lewrie said striving for proper modesty and for acceptin my thoughts on what tdo with em all not their fault theyre french those refugees i dare say chaplain brundish said after a sip of wine and a dab at his lips with his napkin that news of our victory as well as our merciful conclusion to it will make all good englishmen swell in pride when it is made known in the papers back home that and the casualty list capt parham of pylades added looking slyly droll aye parham not over a dozen of ours slain not two dozen wounded captain stroud proudly said the most modestes sorry to say but then you did bear the brunt of the action sir most proficiently and ably as opposed to the french losses that is blanding bowed in place pleased as punch by the compliment aye the mobll be mad for it lewrie commented it was what the publick at home had come to expect of the royal navv the impossible victory by an outnumbered outgunned squadron or lighter single frigate gainst a bigger with a pleasing butchers bill of enemy slain to report in the papers that they had accomplished the leading french frigate had had over men aboardthey always overmannedand when she had struck and been boarded nigh half of them were dead or wounded with the rest staggering round in shock or slumped deaddrunk after breaking into the spirits stores of brandy wine rum ratafia or arrack the french flagship had had over in her crew and a quarter of them had perished or been horribly maimed the trailing frigate that had struck to cockerel and pylades well that was another sterling example of british pluck and daring and french timidity though she had taken very little damage and very few casualties her captain had seen the futility of vigourous resistance and had fired off only two or three broadsides before striking her colours and surrendering parham a considerate young man towards his sailors seemed satisfied though stroud out to make a name for himself lewrie suspected still seemed disappointed as we lay up treasure of a temporal nature in a prizecourt i expect we also lay up more treasure with admiralty and the nation for a job well done captain blanding congratulated himself smugly as his soup bowl was removed and a fresh plate laid before him oh the seapie good ho and treasure in heaven sir chaplain brundish added with a deep blessinglike nod of his head for the christian mercy bestowed upon the innocent at its conclusion quite so ha ha stroud seconded we may only hope that our temporal treasure will be paid out in honest measure though sirs lewrie said as he took a fork full of the hearty seapie there are half a dozen prizeagents at kingston and only one or two may be trusted not tscalp us bald i know of only one i ever dealt with who played me fair and god only knows if hes still in business after the long peace bedad yes blanding exclaimed why between the four ships we took all of them french national ships not merchantmen there may be an hundred thousand pounds owing and none of it due to admiral duckworth haw haw headandgun money on the twodecker transport too stroud reminded them all those soldiers to boot be months before theyre condemned and bought in to the navy blanding cautioned even so some small advances may be made to us enough for a proper wine cellar i trust captain parham enthused chuckling serving with captain lewrie in the past i gained an appreciation for fine wines and lashings of prizemoney from our previous captures some of the ships we took back then their masters or captains were possessed of discerning palates were they not sir a few ofem aye parham lewrie wistfully agreed but some with the taste of philistines the piratical sorts mostly and what might you do with your spoils captain lewrie any special wishes stroud asked trying to be chummy you know lewrie said sitting back to ponder that query for a long moment he took a sip of wine then grinned i think i will buy a pennywhistle to the rest it was a jape an amazement but lewrie really meant it epilogue that if good men called werriours would take in hand for the commons succours to purge the sea unto our great avayle and winne hem goods and have up the sayle and on our enemies their lives to impart so that they might their prises well depart as reason wold justice and equitie to make this land have lordship of the sea hakluyts voyages chapter fortynine uhm strictly speaking sir lt westcott said the transport we took the rest of the squadron wasnt in sight when we took her would she not he our prize alone sir in the spirit of amity i allowed captain blanding to present her as a squadron capture mister westcott lewrie told his first officer lewrie looked over his shoulder through the opened sashwindows of reliants transom at their prizes now safely anchored in kingston harbour under guard of the jamaica station with all their prisoners penned up aboard the hulks or in shore prisons and felt a smug pride to see the french tricolours idly flapping beneath union flags lewrie was being his usual lazy self stretched out on the transom settee cushions in white sloptrousers and shirt with the sleeves rolled to his elbows propped up on an upright timber a piddlin matter mister westcott he told his first officer after the fulsome things he wrote about us to admiralty he shrugged and grinned pointing to the prizes theyll be goin home after the hurricane seasons done months from now dependin on the ruling of the prize court a man who commands one for the passage stands a good chance of promotion once back in england interested sir should i put your name forward or let rearadmiral sir john duckworth reward one o his favourites not really sir lt westcott replied shaking his head as he sat in a chair near lewries desk nursing a tumbler of cool tea id prefer to remain in reliant better the devil you know mister westcott lewrie japed more like liking the company i keep sir westcott said flashing one of his brief toothy grins good then for my part id hate to lose you lewrie told him glad of that news ye never can tell we might get stuck into some new harumscarum adventures or like the old sayin goes his mend follow him anywhere just tsee what hed get into next westcott diplomatically said nothing just laughed then began to gather up the paperwork they had been going over preparing to leave by the by sir the purser and the surgeon have found a source ashore for citronella oils and candles to combat the fevers theyre not at all expensive in bulk but they dont know how much to purchase and ah it would be an outofpocket expense not covered by the admiralty board ill speak to them lewrie replied though he had left things to his former ships surgeon mr durant and hadnt a clue how much it would take to fume the ship each day at anchor he got to his feet to see westcott to the forrud door of the greatcabins oh your mails on your desk sir westcott reminded him thankee mister westcott whilst you find some amusement in the town ill have that and my new pennywhistle to keep me amused good day to you sir good day sir lt westcott said departing once westcott had left the greatcabins lewrie bade pettus to pour him another glass of cold tea and sat at his desk to sort through his letters they had left england in late may and here it was late september and this was the first correspondence the ship had gotten he looked through the official letters first dealt with what few required answers or explanations then turned to the personal mail there was one from hugh aboard pegasus and he tore into it the lad was prospering nicely captain charlton was very kind to him and he was learning his trade among a swarm of other midshipmen most of whom were friendly he had not fallen for most of their japes played on newlies though he had been the victim of a few new ones that lewrie had never heard of lewrie grimaced as he picked up one from his father and broke the wax seal sure that he was now a thousand pounds richer but a lot poorer in land or house my son his father began i write to inform you of the most distressing turn of events anene your eldest sewallis oh christ lewrie groaned passing a hand over his eyes had he not suffered enough this last year he did not return to his school though i assure you i saw him into the coach myself he has run away to sea employing his term tuition extracurricular fees and a sum of money he evidently had saved up including i regret to admit ten pounds i gave him as a gift for sweets and such mine arse on a bandbox lewrie yelped jerking to his feet after i did not receive any correspondence from him for a fortnight he sent me a letter from sheerness just before i was going to coach to his school to ask of him and his health his fathers missive continued with more guile and perserverance than we may have ever given the lad credit for he kitted himself out as a midshipman and has found himself a captain willing to take him on he boasted in his letter that he had employed a rough draft of one you penned when first seeking a place for hugh copying it and substituting his own name forging your signature as best he was able holy shit on a biscuit lewrie gawped forgery does run in the family christ the damned little fool two actually one to admiralty and one to give to a captain benjamin rodgers fitting out his third rate aeneas for channel fleet he posted his letter the very hour of sailing so i was unable to retrieve him and i must confess am loath to take the matter to the attention of admiralty or his new captain lest our familys good name and sewalliss repute be tainted forever by the admission of forgery in short i am at a loss as to what to do which would not redound to our good credit didnt know we had any lewrie gravelled as he paced about for the nonce his father went on i have sent the lad a noteofhand for fifty pounds spending money with which to keep himself in his mess along with a stern letter of admonishment but i do not know what else we may do and neither do i goddammit lewrie spat fetching up near the open transom windows once more his shock deflating with a long sigh of exasperation what got into him he muttered he aint cut out for this life he aint tough enough tprosper bad news sir pettus asked as he and jessop tidied up the greatcabins uh no not really lewrie lied sprised morelike he looked down to the letter once more reading it may be for the best alan sewallis has need of exposure to life and its harshness in the end his actions may make a man of him he is a lewrie and partly a willoughby may i so imagine at any rate it is his choice rash and foolhardy though it may be he has made his bed perhaps we must allow him to lie in it and make his own way but if hes a miserable failure at it hes ruined forever lewrie thought sitting down on the transom settee again the letter drooped from a limp hand conjuring how crushed the gentle scholarly and stiffly withdrawn sewallis would come out of it of how jaundiced he would be against himself for his failure or any other career open to him once sent ashore as a cackhanded cunnythumbed lubber why the hell did god ever let me be a father lewrie whispered surely he knew id be so miserable at it poor wee chuck still sewallis was scholarly and learned quickly retaining facts like a sponge if he was reticent he was bookish and good at mathematics so he might turn out to be a dabhand navigator theyd taught him how to shoot and ride and handle a sword if he was shy hed be the butt of all the japes in his mess perhaps be bullied by the older crueller lads but surely hed already survived treatment like that at his schools it wasnt as if the lad had gone to sea with stars in his eyes after all and it hadnt been done on a passing whim hed schemed to get ready for it he was determined i never knew he had the pluck lewrie realised idve expected it of hugh were he the eldest but sewallis so be it lewrie muttered hes on his own bottom least hes benjamin rodgers for a captain in a seventyfour there would be fifteen or more other midshipmen aboard hms aeneas was it no one would expect too much right off of a johnny newcome in such a large mess and if aeneas was down for channel fleet shed mostlike serve on the blockade of france far out to sea with a squadron of lineofbattle ships not close inshore with the frigates and sloops in almost constant risk of going aground or much in the way of fighting either the lad might never hear a gun fired in anger which fact settled lewries fears somewhat now what anglesgreen his neighbours and his family and inlaws would make of it was another matter they would naturally decide that hed deliberately sent sewallis to sea the facts bedamned he looked back to his fathers letter noting that sir hugo had urged sewallis to write and confess it all to be a man about what he had done thatll be a wonder when it comes id wager lewrie told himself with a cynical snort as for other matters his father continued your property is still in negotiation with phineas chiswick unwilling to pay more than ј though i hear that he intends to garner ј when he sells to the trenchers we hold out for ј my pardons if the subject is still grievous but you mentioned one sir pulteney plumb and his wife lady imogene whom you said had been of great avail when you amp your late wife fled paris and france shortly after the services after consulting debretts i could find no evidence that a man of that name has ever been knighted nor any plumb for that matter a fortnight ago though i attended a new theatre in the hay market with brigadier heathcote a friend at horse guards and who should be the owner and lead actor in the sketches but one pulteney plumb assisted by his йmigrй wife imogene while not a garrick this plumb was quite impressive at comic turns but a few seconds behind a screen where coat or wig changes transformed him to half a dozen roles amp the same for his wife their entire show is a series of entreacts employing jugglers mimes and scantilyclad girls as well as song amp dance turns heathcote of an age with me was allamort for he remembered an ensign pulteney plumb then in his late teens on the staff of gentleman johnny burgoyne round the time of that worthys defeat and surrender to the yankee doodles at saratoga heathcote a lieutenant then further recalled to me that this plumb fellow was appointed more for his theatric abilities than his martial skills gen burgoyne famed for his own amateur acting and play writing there was some scandal anent plumb who sold up his commission before a courtmartial could be convened though after yrs the particulars escape heathcotes memory if ever back in london you might attend for the girls are quite fetching and obliging ha the man must have prospered nicely for plumb owns the theatre a townhouse and a retreat out in islington as well as several other rental lodgings i have learned lewrie felt a fresh shudder of dread to think that he had put his life in the hands of a comic quickchange artiste a mountebank and an utter fraud it could have gone a lot worse the yellow tansy mine arse he gravelled picking up another letter hello a captain speaks oh yes he muttered breaking the wax seal and opening it relieved that speaks whom he had replaced in command of hms thermopylae had survived his pneumonia sir there were four coalburning franklinpattern stoves when you relieved me of command stoves which i had purchased with my own funds for the comfort amp health of my officers amp men where the hell are they i am unable to contact the purser mr pridemore as to the whereabouts amp can discover no trace of them with shore authorities at chatham or sheerness when thermopylae was laid up in ordinary they are quite valuable i would not like to entertain the notion that a postcaptain amp commission sea officer so distinguished could be so remiss as to lose them or sell them for personal gain but do you know their whereabouts i urge you to discover it to me by the next post else i shall press a suit in the london court of common pleas to recover the stoves or their value oh christ lewrie said with a disbelieving groan another bloody court appearance it was too silly to be countenanced he called for his steward aye sir pettus replied my shoregoin rig lewrie said shovelling that letter into a desk drawer for much later right away sir ive earned it im due it lewrie told himself as he rose to dress im goin ashore and get very very very bloodydrunk afterword after the initial sense of relief the english people felt when told of the peace of amiens they soon realised that there really was no living with an expansionist republican france or napoleon and his ambitions and that the war would reerupt sooner or later when it did start again they were mad for it volunteeering by the hundreds of thousands for the army and navy the addington goverment was pressured from the sidelines from the outset by lord grenville windham the ousted william pitt and later by the king himself to goad the french into taking the blame for it by the means described in this tale and when the crown finally sent napoleon an ambassador their pick was the haughty supercilious toplofty lord whitworth who with his wife the equally insulting duchess of dorset could piss off just about anyone from bootblacks to saints most especially the touchy napoleon bonaparte there are two very good books i can recommend to readers with a desire for more background napoleon by vincent cronin a wonderful biography and the war of wars by robert harvey which covers all the events of the french revolutionary war and the napoleonic war from the start of the revolution to waterloo providing even more insight into napoleons life it was not napoleons short stature that formed his psychobabble napoleon complex most people were short in those days his insecurity came more from a lifetime of being the perennial outsider and a poor one at that more italian and nearpeasant corsican than a frenchman even if the buonapartes were very minor aristos in their provincial hometown of bastia jeered at for his olive complexion his grammatical errors when speaking or writing french that wasnt pure parisian his simple tastes in food and wine and his utter shyness at his schools he mightve only had one testicle too and if the provenance of the physical remains of his privates are true he could have been cruelly teased as pinkyfinger the flea fer by prostitutes he hired or early lovers he attempted to woo once in a position of power and wealthrecall he was corsican born to the vendetta the get evenhe trusted his untrustworthy kinfolk who were just like him rather than more sophisticated and more capable people than himself one of the things that really got up napoleons nose were the british papers and the caricatures of him which depicted him as an african an arab after his failed egyptian campaign a wee fellow with a big nose and a yellow complexion think homer simpson and he truly didnt understand that the crown could not censor or stifle those caricature artists essayists and editorialists like he could any french paper that did not please him napoleon could make himself consul for life crown himself the emperor of the french form a bonaparte dynasty with his brothers and sisters to rule the rest of europe with all the trappings of a roman emperor yet never understood why the world treated him like a boorish nouveau riche parvenu that rankled him new orleans and the louisiana territory man is charitй de guilleri going to be mad enough to kick furniture when she learns that napoleon will sell it all to the united states to finance his new war enough so to try to murder him in a future book perhaps talleyrand the french foreign minister was negotiating with the american emissaries livingston and monroe in paris offering not just new orleans but the whole kit and kaboodle for a hundred million francs and dealing under the table for a cut of it to support his hedonistic lifestyle napoleon did want a french empire in north america but with a war sure to come saw that he could not hold it for long they the american commissioners ask of me one town in louisiana but i already consider the colony as entirely lost napoleon wrote according to george w cable in the creoles of louisiana congress actually debated whether to pony up all that much whipout or just march down to new orleans and take the bloody place struth cable also cites napoleons private conversation in the gardens of st cloud with m mirabois one of his ministers he trusted a lot more than talleyrand even then well you have charge of the treasury let them pay you million francs pay their own claims from the quasiwar us vs france in and take the whole country when asked about the sentiment of the french in louisiana who had longed to be reunited to france he rather coldly told mirabois to send your maxims to the london market napoleon always was a coldblooded bastard when it came to what france thought or to his casualty lists m laussat a french colonial prefect with a very small mostly civilian party reached new orleans on march to let those creoles know they would soon become french again and that general victor remember him loafing around in holland waiting for a slant of wind would follow with a large army to secure the territory on november the official exchange was held in the place darmes before st louis cathedral cannon were fired the flag of spain was lowered and the tricolour soared aloft to the tune of la marseillaise the keys to the city of new orleans were handed to laussat to the delirious joy of louisianans just twenty days later however on december laussat handed those same keys over to representatives of the united states and the grand illusion was over to louisianans utter consternation the bulk of the troops present were american there was no gen victor no large body of french soldiers and the actual french contribution might have amounted to a corporals guard with so few weeks between exchanges there certainly were some bemused spanish troops loafing about to witness it all waiting for a ship out now was that captain blandings and lewries handiwork id certainly like to imagine that their taking of those ships off the chandeleurs caused their absence after all thats what historical fiction is all about aint it so heres alan lewrie with his lifelong nemesis that crooked guillaume choundas dead as mutton and the version of petsmart crab food his house and rented land sure to be lost hey it happens in the best of families dont it and not one but two sons in the royal navy will sewallis prove to be good at it or will he come a cropper and rue his forgery and his decision hugh is in good hands but will he survive and prosper lewrie has had his period of grief and mourning the demands of his frigate his men and the navy are now his life but at some point in the future we all know the life of a monkish widower simply cant be tolerated any longer and its good odds hell kick over the traces and get back to his old troubles ashore in his idle hours and what about those pestiferous franklinpattern stoves will he end up in court again if he cant find what mr pridemore did with them will the prizemoney due for the defeated french squadron get him off the hook all these matters and a few moreperhaps with some naughty bits slung in for giggles will be revealed in the forthcoming installment of the alan lewrie naval
