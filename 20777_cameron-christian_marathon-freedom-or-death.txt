another style is the white corslet seen to appear just as the persian wars begin reenactors call this the tube and yoke corslet and some people call it erroneously the linothorax some of them may have been made of linen well never know but the likelier material is athenian leather which was often tanned and finished with alum thus being bright white yet another style was a tube and yoke of scale which you can see the author wearing on his website a scale corslet would have been the most expensive of all and probably provided the best protection daidala cithaeron the mountain that towered over plataea was the site of a remarkable firefestival the daidala which was celebrated by the plataeans on the summit of the mountain in the usual ceremony as mounted by the plataeans in every seventh year a wooden idol daidalon would be dressed in bridal robes and dragged on an oxcart from plataea to the top of the mountain where it would be burned after appropriate rituals or in the great daidala which were celebrated every fortynine years fourteen daidala from different boeotian towns would be burned on a large wooden pyre heaped with brushwood together with a cow and a bull that were sacrificed to zeus and hera this huge pyre on the mountain top must have provided a most impressive spectacle pausanias remarks that he knew of no other flame that rose as high or could be seen from so far the cultic legend that was offered to account for the festival ran as follows when hera had once quarrelled with zeus as she often did she had withdrawn to her childhood home of euboea and had refused every attempt at reconciliation so zeus sought the advice of the wisest man on earth cithaeron the eponym of the mountain who ruled at plataea in the earliest times cithaeron advised him to make a wooden image of a woman to veil it in the manner of a bride and then to have it drawn along in an oxcart after spreading the rumour that he was planning to marry the nymph plataea a daughter of the river god asopus when hera rushed to the scene and tore away the veils she was so relieved to find a wooden effigy rather than the expected bride that she at last consented to be reconciled with

heavy bronze kidney belt for war general note on names and personages this series is set in the very dawn of the socalled classical era often measured from the battle of marathon bc some if not most of the famous names of this era are characters in this series and thats not happenstance athens of this period is as magical in many ways as tolkiens gondor and even the quickest list of artists poets and soldiers of this era reads like a whos who of western civilization nor is the author tossing them together by happenstance these people were almost all aristocrats men and women who knew each other well and might be adversaries or friends in need names in bold are historical characters yes even arimnestos and you can get a glimpse into their lives by looking at wikipedia or britannia online for more indepth information i recommend plutarch and herodotus to whom i owe a great deal arimnestos of plataea may just may have been herodotuss source for the events of the persian wars the careful reader will note that herodotus himself a scribe from halicarnassus appears several times archilogos ephesian son of hipponax the poet a typical ionian aristocrat who loves persian culture and greek culture too who serves his city not some cause of greece or hellas and who finds the rule of the great king fairer and more democratic than the rule of a greek tyrant arimnestos child of chalkeotechnes and euthalia aristagoras son of molpagoras nephew of histiaeus aristagoras led miletus while histiaeus was a virtual prisoner of the great king darius at susa aristagoras seems to have initiated the ionian revolt and later to have regretted it aristides son of lysimachus lived roughly bc known later in life as the just perhaps best known as one of the commanders at marathon usually

typical of a class of aristocratic men professional warriors adventurers occasionally pirates or merchants by turns from euboea heraclitus c bc one of the ancient worlds most famous philosophers born to an aristocratic family he chose philosophy over political power perhaps most famous for his statement about time you cannot step twice into the same river his belief that strife is justice and other similar sayings which youll find scattered through these pages made him a favourite with nietzsche his works mostly now lost probably established the later philosophy of stoicism herakleides an aeolian a greek of asia minor with his brothers nestor and orestes he becomes a retainer a warrior in service to arimnestos it is easy when looking at the birth of greek democracy to see the whole form of modern government firmly established but at the time of this book democracy was less than skin deep and most armies were formed of semifeudal war bands following an aristocrat heraklides aristides helmsman a lowerclass athenian who has made a name for himself in war hermogenes son of bion arimnestoss slave hesiod a great poet or a great tradition of poetry from boeotia in greece hesiods works and days and theogony were widely read in the sixth century and remain fresh today they are the chief source we have on greek farming and this book owes an enormous debt to them hippias last tyrant of athens overthrown around bc that is just around the beginning of this series hippias escaped into exile and became a pensioner of darius of persia hipponax c bc a greek poet and satirist considered the inventor of parody he is supposed to have said there are two days when a woman is a pleasure the day one marries her and the day one buries her histiaeus tyrant of miletus and ally of darius of persia possible originator of the plan for the ionian revolt homer another great poet roughly hesiods contemporary give or take fifty years and again possibly more a poetic tradition than an individual man homer is reputed as the author of the iliad and the odyssey two great epic poems which between them largely defined what heroism and aristocratic good behaviour should be in greek society and you might say to this very day kylix a boy slave of hipponax miltiades tyrant of the thracian chersonese his son cimon or kimon rose to be a great man in athenian politics probably the author of the athenian victory of marathon miltiades was a complex man a pirate a warlord and a supporter of athenian democracy penelope daughter of chalkeotechnes sister of arimnestos sappho a greek poetess from the island of lesbos born sometime around bc and died between and bc her father was probably lord of eresus widely considered the greatest lyric poet of ancient greece simonalkes head of the collateral branch of the plataean corvaxae cousin to arimnestos simonides another great lyric poet he lived c bc and his nephew bacchylides was as famous as he perhaps best known for his epigrams one of which is go tell the spartans thou who passest by that here obedient to their laws we lie thales cc bc the first philosopher of the greek tradition whose writings were still current in arimnestoss time thales used geometry to solve problems such as calculating the height of the pyramids in aegypt and the distance of ships from the shore he made at least one trip to aegypt he is widely accepted as the founder of western mathematics theognis theognis of megara was almost certainly not one man but a whole canon of aristocratic poetry under that name much of it practical there are maxims many very wise laments on the decline of man and the age and the woes of old age and poverty songs for symposia etc in later sections there are songs and poems about homosexual love and laments for failed romances despite widespread attributions there was at some point a real theognis who may have lived in the midth century bc or just before the events of this series his poetry would have been central to the world of arimnestoss mother im not any younger and thats a fact but i gather my storys a good one or you young people wouldnt cluster around so eagerly to hear my tale honey youve brought your scribbler back to me hes promised to write it all out in the new way although if i was allowed id rather hear a rhapsode sing it the old way but the old ways died with the medes didnt they its all different now the world im telling you about is as dead as old homers heroes at troy even my thugater here thinks im the relic of a time when the gods still walked abroad eh you young people make me laugh youre soft but youre soft because we killed all the monsters and whose fault is that and the blushing girls come back ah it makes me younger just to see you child id take you myself but all my other wives would object hah look at that colour on her face my young friends theres fire under that skin marry her quick before the fire catches somewhere it oughtnt it looks to me as if my daughter has brought every young sprig in the town and some foreigners from up the coast as well just to hear her old man speak of his fate flattering in a way but you know that ill tell you of marathon and you know that there is no nobler moment in all the history of men of hellenes we stood against them man to man and we were better but it didnt start that way not by as long a ride as a man could make in a year on a good horse for those of you who missed the first nights of my rambling story im arimnestos of plataea i told the story of how my father was the bronzesmith of our city and how we marched to fight the spartans at oinoe and fought three battles in a week how he was murdered by his cousin simon how simon sold me as a slave far to the east among the men of ionia and how i grew to manhood as a slave in the house of a fine poet in ephesus one of the greatest cities in the world right under the shadow of the temple of artemis i was slave to hipponax the poet and his son archilogos in time they freed me i became a warrior and then a great warrior but when the long war began the war between the medes and the greeks i served with the athenians at sardis why you might ask my thugater will groan to hear me tell this again but i loved briseis indeed to say i loved her hipponaxs darkhaired daughter artemiss avatar and perhaps aphrodites as well helen returned to earth well to say i loved her is to say nothing as you will hear if you stay to listen briseis wasnt the only person i loved in ephesus i loved archilogos the true friend of my youth we were well matched in everything i was his companion first as a slave and then free and we competed at everything and i also loved heraclitus the greatest philosopher of his day to me the greatest ever almost like a god in his wisdom he and he alone kept me from growing to manhood as a pure killer he gave me advice which i ignored but which stayed in my head to this day in fact he taught me that the river of our lives flows on and on and can never be reclaimed later i knew that hed tried to keep me from briseis when her father caught us together it was the end of my youth i was cast out of the household and thats why i was with the athenians at sardis and not in the phalanx of the men of ephesus to save hipponax when the medes gave him his mortal wound i found him screaming on the battlefield and i sent him on the last journey because i loved him even though he had been my owner it was done with love but his son archilogos did not see it that way and we became foes i spent the next years of the ionian revolt the first years of the long war gaining wordfame with every blow i struck i should blush to tell it but why when i served at sardis i was a man that other men would trust at their side in the phalanx by the time i led my ship into the persians at the big fight at cyprus i was a warrior that other men feared in the storm of bronze the greeks won the seafight but lost on land that day at cyprus and the back of the revolt should have been broken but it was not we retreated to chios and lesbos and i joined miltiades of athens a great aristocrat and a great pirate and we got new allies and the fighting switched to the chersonese the land of the trojan war we fought the medes by sea and land sometimes we bested them miltiades made money and so did i i owned my own ship and i was rich i killed many men and then we faced the medes in thrace just a few ships from each side by then briseis had married the most powerful man in the greek revolt and had found him a broken reed we beat the persians and their thracian allies and i killed her husband even though he was supposedly on my side i laugh even now that was a good killing and i spit on his shade but she didnt want me except in her bed and in her thoughts briseis loved me as i loved her but she meant to be queen of the ionians not a pirates trull and all i was in those years was a bloodyhanded pirate fair enough but it shattered me for a while i left thrace and i left miltiades and i went home to plataea where the man who had killed my father and married my mother was lording it over the family farm simon and his four sons my cousins your cousins too thugater simon was a wreck of a man and a coward but id not say the same of his get they were tough bastards i didnt hack him down i went to the assembly as my master heraclitus would have wanted me to do the law killed old simon the coward but his sons wanted revenge and the persians were determined to finish off the ionians and put the greeks under their heel and briseis kept marrying great men and finding them wanting the world you know is shaped like the bowl of an aspis out on the rim flows the edge of the riversea that circles all and up where the porpax binds a mans arm is the sun and the moon and the great circle of earth fills all between medes and persians scythians and greeks and ionians and aeolians and italians and aethiopians and aegyptians and africans and lydians and phrygians and carians and celts and phoenicians and the gods know who else fill the bowl of the aspis from rim to rim and in those days as the long war began to take hold like a newstarted fire on dry kindling you could hear men talking of war making war killing dying making weapons and training in their use all across the bowl of that aspis from rim to rim until the murmur of the bronzeclad gods chorus filled the world it was the sixth year of the long war and hipparchus was archon in athens and myron was archon for his second term in plataea tisikrites of croton won the stade sprint at olympia the weather was good the crops were rolling in i thought i might settle down and make myself a bronzesmith and a farmer like my father before me ares must have laughed part i lade the time will come milesians devisers of evil deeds when many will feast on you a splendid gift for them your wives will wash the feet of many longhaired men and other men will assume the care of my temple at didyma oracle of apollo to the men of miletus in herodotus book shield up thrust overhand turn catch the spear on the rim of my shield pivot on my toes and thrust at my opponent he catches my spear on his shield and grins i can see the flash of his grin in the tau of his corinthian helmets faceplate then his plumes nod as he turns his head checks the man behind him i thrust overhand hard he catches my blow pivots on the balls of his feet and steps back with his shield facing me his filemate pushes past him a heavy overhand blow driving me back half a step the music rises the aulos pipe sounding faster the drums beating the rhythm like the sound of marching feet i sidestep faster and my shield rim flashes like a live thing my black spear is an irontipped tongue of death in my strong right hand and i am one with the men to the right and left the men behind i am not arimnestos the killer of men i am only one plataean and together we are this plataeans i roar i plant my right foot every man in the front rank does the same and the pipes howl and every man crouches screams and pushes forward and three hundred voices call the ravens of apollo the roar shakes the walls and echoes from the temple of hera the music falls silent and after a pause the whole assembly all the free men and women the slaves the freedmen erupt in applause under my armour i am covered in sweat hermogenes my opponent puts his arms around me that was there are no words to describe how good that was we danced the pyrrhiche the war dance with the picked three hundred men of plataea and ares himself must have watched us older men the archon the lawmakers clasp my hand my back is slapped so often that i worry they are pulling the laces on my scale armour good to have you back they all say i am happy tingting tingting the day after the feast of ares and i was back at work planishing planishing is when you use a hammer to smooth out finished work taptap taptap the hammers need to be polished and the anvil needs to be crisp and well surfaced and you need a stake of just the right shape with a polished surface and your strokes need to be perfectly placed crisp and all the same strength it was not my strong point i remember it well because i was making myself a new helmet and thinking of miltiades all my other orders were completed winter was coming and there was no reason that i shouldnt play with my equipment my barns were full my people fed and i had a sack of silver buried under the shop floor without having to send to miltiades for my gold i had decided i would not go back to miltiades miltiades of athens the tyrant of the chersonese was my fathers patron and sometimes mine id fought and killed for him but id left him when the killing became a habit i had to break and when briseis said she would not have me hah one of those is the true reason but athens mighty athens the bulwark of the hellenes against the persians was deeply divided miltiades was no hero back then most athenians saw him as a fool and a tyrant who was bringing the wrath of the great king of persia down on greece rumour came over the mountains from attica and athens that he was to be declared atimos and lose his citizen rights that he would be exiled that he would be murdered we heard that the faction of the tyrantslayers the alcmaeonids was ascendant i have to tell you as an aside that calling the alcmaeonids tyrant slayers is both incorrect and laughable but a fine example of how easily fooled mortal men are by good orators the mighty alcmaeonids the richest family in attica and perhaps all of greece one of their many scions killed one of pisistratuss sons in athens it was a private quarrel but we still call the overhand sword cut the harmodius blow and most men think that the dead man was the tyrant of athens in fact the only reason that the alcmaeonids would have arranged the death of the pisistratids was so that they could seize the city and rule themselves they were all in the game all the great men of athens they prated about democracy but what they wanted was power in the early days of the long war i was bitter disillusioned even to find that the heroic miltiades was a pirate and a thief not a freedom fighter oh he was brave as achilles and wily as odysseus but beneath his aristocratic manners lurked a man who would kill a beggar for an obol if it would finance his schemes after a while i took to hating him for his failure to be the man i wanted him to be but ill tell you this my children he was a better man than any of the pisistratids or the alcmaeonids when he wanted something he reached for it at any rate it was late summer and the rumours of open conflict in athens our ally had begun to disturb even sleepy plataea as the saying went when athens caught a cold plataea sneezed i recall all this because i was thinking of miltiades while i was working on my helmet i thought about him a lot because to tell the truth i was already bored id shaped the helmet twice first id made the bowl far too deep and the result looked so odd that id melted the bronze added a little more tin and poured a new plate on the slate where pater had done the same i made a wine bucket from that bronze i didnt trust twiceforged stuff for armour the second time i was more careful with my prayers and i made a real invocation to hephaestus and i took time to draw the curve in charcoal on a board as part of the invocation i raised the bowl of the helmet carefully for an hour or two each day after propping the vines and gathering olives with my slaves and my household and this helmet grew like a child in a mothers belly like a miracle so on that day i remember i was growing afraid i who feared no man in the meeting of the spears was afraid because the object i was making was beautiful and better than i ever expected of my own work and i was scared that i might ruin it so i planished slowly tingting tingting the anvil rang like a temple bell with every blow my apprentice tiraeus held the work and rotated it as i requested he was older than me and in some ways better trained but hed never settled with one master and before he met me hed never even learned the signs that any man can learn who dedicates to the smith god id had him a month and hed changed just like that like molten metal settling into the mould hed been ready to take a new shape and he was no work of mine but it still felt odd to have an older man and in many ways a better smith as my apprentice he raised his head as if listening tingting tingting like a temple bell my anvil called aloud to the gods i was deep into it the focus that the gods send to a man intent on a task when i heard what tiraeus heard the same focus to be honest that comes in combat how aristides would writhe to hear me suggest a link between the two i ramble i heard a horse in the yard dont stop my apprentice ordered thatll give you an idea of his actual status he gave me orders behind me bion my fathers former slave apprentice and now almost a master smith in his own right was rewelding a pot his hammer rang on his own anvil heavier blows than mine what the man says bion grunted never stop once youre in a task that was a long speech for bion but i was young and a horse in the yard promised adventure as i said months of farming and smithing had left me bored i took water from the bucket by the door and saw a young man in a fine wool chlamys slip off his horses neck showing a lot of leg and muscle as pretty young men are wont to do i have a message for lord arimnestos he said portentously his disappointment showed in every line of his body hed expected better pen my sister penelope came down the steps from her eyrie with the women and hermogenes bions son and my best friend came in from the fields both drawn by the horseman i let pen have the boy he was handsome and pen needed some suitors or my life was going to become very difficult indeed my mother stayed in the womens porch and didnt emerge probably because she was drunk hades for a certainty she was drunk she was the only child of the basileus of hispae a small place west of plataea she ran off with my pater a smith but a powerful man in his own right she thought hed become a great man he did but not in the way she wanted he became a great smith she became a drunk did i say this was a pretty story back to it then the handsome boy with all the muscles paid me no attention at all i had a rag wrapped around my groin and was otherwise naked i was covered in soot and looked like a slave and hed have had to be a careful observer not something usually found in handsome boys to note that i had the muscles of an athlete not a farrier i am lord arimnestoss sister penelope she told the young sprig my brother is busy may i take your message sir that flustered young paris i can tell you my message is for the lord himself he looked around for a social equal someone to punish all these slaves and women i laughed and left pen to the enjoyment of his discomfiture my helmet was calling me i drank another dipper of water and got my hammer back in my hand tingting ting i realized that there was a boy in my workshop where in hades had he come from he was styges the dark boy from the heros tomb no one was clear whether hed been a prisoner or a bandit hed become part of idomeneuss retinue i think hed been a thief he was silent as the grave so much to explain idomeneus was cretan a soldier and archer who had been my hypaspist my squire in the fighting for years when i cleared out my fathers house idomeneus made himself priest of the heros tomb i had trained at that tomb as a boy and it was my place my sacred place and idomeneus for all his madness and his delight in killing and his debauchery was my friend and a member of my oikia my household my own retinue of trusted men and women styges was in idomeneuss oikia he was the cretans lover his eromenos and his hypaspist too as they do things in crete my master needs you lord the young man whispered his eyes downcast my hand hesitated the head of the iron hammer high in the air i let it fall tang and cursed a clear misstroke and id left a small flaw in the surface of the helmet tiraeus put his hand to my mouth curses wont change the metal he said see he had ten more years than i had in many ways i was an overgrown boy with a talent for ripping mens souls from their bodies he was a mature man a man whod seen enough hardship to learn to make better choices fuck i said but i didnt throw the helmet across the shop id learned that much nor did i gut styges with the heavy knife i always wore even in the shop or lying with a slave girl although the red rage flashed over my eyes instead i placed it on a leather bag washed my hands in the basin and nodded to styges i need a cup of wine and ill be happy to give you one as well i did my best to imitate achilles and be a man of warm hospitality even to a catamitethief who had just caused me to miss a hammer stroke i was growing up styges bowed i am honoured lord of course in crete men who were called lord were seldom covered in soot and bronze scale with hands so black that the skin couldnt be seen but in boeotia things were different besides i had a great deal more respect for styges than for the perfumed boy in my courtyard my sister penelope came out of the house with wine she poured a libation to artemis as was right for her and then to hephaestus for me before serving the rest of the pitcher of wine to tiraeus bion hermogenes styges and my guest of the crowd only the guest and pen could be said to be wearing clothes i just want you to see this in your heads only when styges had a cup of wine in his fist did i question him why does idomeneus need me i asked he killed a man styges replied what man i asked a plataean by which i meant a citizen or a man of no account no lord styges said in fact we killed two men one a soldier at the shrine the other and styges smiled i killed myself one of the bandits lord they knew each other were planning to escape or perhaps take the shrine lord idomeneus thinks they meant to kill all of us he had a fresh cut i realized running from his shoulder to the middle of his side he saw me looking at it and nodded beaming with pride he had a knife and i did not this sort of heroic understatement was the rule of the greeks and idomeneus for all his bloodmadness ran a tight ship up there on the mountain the soldier we killed was athenian styges said his smile fading my master is afraid that he was a man of consequence that got my attention my lord is it nothing to you that i have travelled here from sardis the beautiful young man asked in truth they were both quite handsome the aristocrat like a statue of an athlete and styges a more practical downtoearth set of muscles scars and smooth skin i could tell that pen was pleased by both i smiled at the aristocrat young man i apologize for my rude dress and quick welcome and i ask that you stay a day or two this matter concerns my honour and must be dealt with immediately he blushed i hid a smile and his eyes flickered to pens i would be honoured to be a guest here but i have an important message which ill hear when i return i nodded to him the gods were blinding me if i had paused a moment to listen to him but i thought my duty was calling me and i didnt like him or his airs mind that they dont put you to work in the forge pen muttered ill be back by midday i said and ordered the slaves to saddle my horse the gods were laughing and moira spun her thread so fine it was the edge of darkness by the time i rode up the hill to the shrine it may seem comic to you lot to hear that i rode a horse now im lord of a thousand shaggy thracian ponies and half a hundred persian beauties but in boeotia in those days the ownership of a horse was a matter for some remark and i had four laugh if you like four horses made me one of the richest men in plataea styges ran by my side hed fought a mortal combat run thirty stades to fetch me drunk a horn of wine and now hed run thirty stades back to the shrine later when i tell you of the deeds of arms my people performed think on this we made hard men then we bred them to it like dogs to the hunt in sparta they trained aristocrats to be superb in attica and boeotia we trained every free man to be excellent calculate the difference if you like i could smell the blood at the tomb even over the night air i took the leather bottle off my shoulder and poured a libation to old leitos whod gone to windy troy from green plataea and come back alive to die in old age now that my friends is a hero at the tomb we have a tradition that it was leitos who stopped bold hectors rush at the ships not by clever fighting or mad courage but by getting lesser men to lock their shields and stop his godsent killing rage not a mighty killer but a man who led other men as a shepherd tends sheep who kept his men alive and brought them home so men come to the tomb from all over greece men who have seen too much war sometimes they are broken past repair but if they are not the priest feeds them wine listens to them and gives them work or perhaps a small mission and the completion of that work makes them clean so that they can go back to the world of men who are not killers sometimes though a man comes to the tomb with the mark on him how can i tell this it is the mark of evil or of a soul past saving and then the priest who is always a retired killer himself must face the man and kill him on the precinct wall so that his shade screams as it goes down to nothing lost for ever and his blood waters the souls of the dead and feeds the hero heh heh boeotia is a tough place and no mistake and weve little tolerance for those men whove lost their way can i tell you a hard truth friends if a killer goes bad the best the rest can do is put him down wolves know it dogs know it and lions know it men need to know it too even when the man is your friend but thats another story more wine here idomeneus came out and held my horse as i slid down sorry to call you all the way here lord the dent in my perfect helmet still rankled and i couldnt get the thought of a messenger from sardis out of my head sardis the capital of lydia the satrapy of the persian empire closest to greece who would send a messenger from sardis and why in the name of all the gods hadnt i stopped to ask but idomeneus was a man whod saved my life fifty times hard to stay angry with him i needed to come out anyway if i stay at the forge too long i might forget who i used to be used to be idomeneus laughed his mad laugh achilles reborn now hammering bronze so you killed a man i asked one of the women pressed a horn cup into my hand watered spiced wine just warmed i drank thankfully we just killed us an alcmaeonid idomeneus said his eyes glinted in the last light he stood there on the precinct wall and proclaimed his parentage and dared us even to think of killing him he thought that big name would protect him i shook my head the alcmaeonids were rich powerful and nasty their wealth was boundless and i couldnt imagine what one of them was doing at the tomb of the hero perhaps he was lying i asked idomeneus produced something from under his chlamys it flashed redgold in the last beams of the sun it was a clasp belt the sort of thing a very rich man wore with his chiton and every link was beaten gold it was worth more than my farm and i have a good farm fuck i said he had the mark of evil idomeneus said what could i do i went and looked at the corpse stretched over the precinct wall in the traditional way he had been a big man a head taller than me with a bell cuirass of bronze as thick as a newflayed hide he probably weighed twice as much as wiry idomeneus he had a single wound a spearthrust in his left eye idomeneus was a very very dangerous man the athenian nobleman must have been too stupid to see that or the mark truly was on him and the hero needed blood the armour was of the best as was his helmet fuck i said again what was he doing here idomeneus shook his head behind him men and women were lighting the lamps there were six huts now instead of just one as there had been in my youth my thracians had one and former bandits were four to a hut in the others except the last which was for the women they were clean and orderly dead deer hung in rows from the trees and there was a whole boar and piles of salted skins rolled tight idomeneus ran the tomb like a military camp he was recruiting i said aloud answering my own question perhaps the greyeyed goddess stood at my shoulder and said the words into my head but i saw it he was in his best armour because he wanted to impress but hed challenged idomeneus somehow and the mad fuck had killed him these things happen my problem i thought was how to clean it up they were all in my oikia so i bore the responsibility and it was my place to put it right besides i knew most of the big men in athens i knew aristides and he was related to the alcmaeonids by marriage and by blood i was sure he could make it right if anyone could i considered the alternative i could do nothing it was possible that no one knew where this man was or what he had intended it was possible that even if his people found out they would take no revenge in the morning ill cast an augury i said perhaps the logos will offer me an answer idomeneus nodded youll stay the night he asked just as you wanted you mad cretan i said you need to get away from the farm before you turn into a farmer he said i had the glimmer of a suspicion that my mad hypaspist had killed a powerful man merely to get me to come up the hill and drink with him i sighed styges put a warm cup in my hand and led me to the fire circle where all the former bandits sat we sang hymns to the gods while the bowl of the heavens turned over our heads the firelight dappled the ancient oaks around the heros tomb styges took out a kithara and sang alone and then we sang with him spartan songs and aristocratic songs and i sang briseiss favourite one of sapphos my eyes kept meeting those of a slave girl they werent precisely slaves their status was not simple theyd belonged to a farmer a widow and the bandits had killed her and taken her chattels then id killed the bandits whose were they were they free they slept with all the men and did too many chores she was short almost pretty and one of her legs was twisted our eyes kept meeting and later she laughed aloud while i was inside her her breath was sweet and she deserved better than a hero who thought only of another woman but despite her limp and her odd face she stuck in my head in those days i must have mounted fifty slave girls a year yet i remember her youll see why in the morning i hunted on the mountain with idomeneus but if hed left any deer alive within half a days walk i didnt see them but we did cross the trail where wed ambushed the bandits a year before the road goes as high as it ever does on cithaerons flank then drops down into a mudhole after which it climbs a little before starting the long descent first to the tomb and then to plataea herself there was a cart abandoned by the mudhole and tracks the cart was loaded with weapons and leather armour good strong stuff and there were a few coins scattered on the ground he had servants i said and they ran idomeneus said no need to cast an augury is there the abandoned wagon meant that the rich man had had attendants men who even now were running back to the family estates in attica with a tale of murder we could chase them down and kill them idomeneus said helpfully sometimes you really piss me off i said and i meant it i feel bad he admitted what are you going to do ill ride into attica and make it right i said send to the farm get epictetus to fill a wagon with my work and have it head for athens ill meet the wagon in the agora in athens in ten days before the herakleion then my whole trip wont be wasted fixing your fuckup idomeneus nodded sullenly he had the mark on him he said like a child who feels a parents law is unfair the hero wanted his blood i believe you i said and i looked at him he met my eye but only just you cant come i said not unless you want to die i added he shrugged my entertainment of the night before was standing a little apart i palmed a coin to give her but she shook her head and looked modestly at the ground i want to go she said i can be a free woman in attica ill warm your bed on the trail i considered it for a while yes i said the other two women cried to see her go id have done better if id stopped to cast the auguries but who knows the gods like a surprise we made good time up cithaerons flank up where the oak trees falter i killed a young boar with my bow from there and with that as an omen i took the old road and we climbed all the way to the top of the ancient mountain and made camp in the wood of the daidala the special place of all the corvaxae where the crows feast on meat we provide for the god i made a good camp with a wool sheet as a tent and a big fire then i left the slave girl to cook meat from the heros tomb and i climbed up to the altar in our family we say that the altar is to cithaeron himself and not to zeus who is after all an interloper here there was a sign on the altar the remnants of a burnt offering and a hank of black wool so simons sons lived and they had come here in the dark of the moon to curse someone not hard to guess who i smiled i remember that smile a wolfs snarl hate comes easily when you are young it was a clear night and i could see out to the rim of the world and everywhere i looked i could see fire and i thought war is coming the thought came from the god and his eyes helped mine to see the girdle of fire all around the world standing there on the summit of the mountain i heaped brush on top of the pile of ash on the old altar and i rolled the boars hide hooves and bones around the fat then lit the fire that fire must have been visible to every man and woman from thebes to athens i set the boar to burning and made my prayers i fed the fire until it was so great that i couldnt stand near it naked and then i went back down to where the slave girl waited she served me food will you free me she asked or sell me i laughed ill free you i said with that twisted foot youre not worth selling honey besides i keep my word do i not she didnt laugh i wouldnt know she stuck out her bad foot and stared at it your barley broth is delicious i said and it was thats all the flirtation a slave gets i was a slave honey i know what its like and i know that all my talk isnt worth shit until you have your freedom tablet in your hand but i give you my word by the high altar of my ancestors that i will free you in the agora of athens and leave you twenty drachmas as dowry every god in olympus must have been listening a man needs to be careful when he swears and careful what he promises the sons of men lie she said her voice hollow so that just for a moment i wondered what goddess was sharing my campfire will you be different try me i said with a young mans arrogance i moved towards her and as i put a hand behind her head the ravens came a great flock and they alighted in the trees around my fire the same trees where the corvaxae feed them of course and they knew me i had never seen so many the fire reflected their eyes a thousand points of fire and when i put my mouth over hers her eyes glowed red in the fire too we made love anyway ah youth we were five days crossing cithaeron at least in part because i became infatuated with her sometimes one body just fits another hard to describe to you virgins suffice it to say that despite her twisted foot and odd face my body adored hers in a way i have seldom experienced i wanted her every minute and the wanting was not slaked by the having as it is so often with men especially young men after we had made love on a rock by the trail where you can first see the rich blue of the sea over attica she rose from my best efforts smiled and threw her chiton over her shoulder and strolled on naked by my horse dont you want to get dressed i asked her she smiled and shrugged why it will only come off again before the sun goes down a fingers breadth and she was right i could not have enough of her she wouldnt tell me her name and sometimes i called her briseis that got a bitter laugh and a hard bite i begged her and tickled her and offered her money but she said that telling her true name would break the spell so i called her slave girl and she resented it after the slowest trip over the mountain in the history of the greeks we came down by the fort at oinoe where my brother had died i poured wine to his shade and we rode on the horse useful now we didnt camp in attica i was a man of property and we stayed in inns or i claimed guest status from men who i knew a little like eumenios of eleusis who was happy to see me toasted me in good wine and warned me that hed heard that the alcmaeonids were out for my blood i sneered they dont even know who i am i said im just some hick from boeotia eumenios shook his head no youre a warrior and a friend of miltiades and aristides its said in the city that you can lead three hundred picked men of plataea over the mountain whenever miltiades snaps his fingers i shook my head and drank my wine who the fuck would say that myron is the archon hades brother in plataea we care very little for who lords it in athens as long as the grain prices are good but then i thought of the black wool on cithaerons altar simons sons would spread that story if it would help them to revenge in the morning eumenios pretended hed missed a nights sleep because of my antics with my slave girl he saw me mounted poured a libation and sent me on my way but before id turned my mares head out of his gate he caught my ankle go carefully he said theyll kill you if they can or bring you to law nine days on the road and we came to athens my daughter and young herodotus have both been to athens but ill tell you about the queen of greek cities anyway athens is not like any other city in the world and ive been everywhere from the gates of heracles to the mountains of the moon most men come to athens from the sea we came down from the mountains to the west but the effect is the same the first thing you see is the acropolis it was different then now they have new temples abuilding fantastic stuff in white marble to rival anything in the east but it was impressive enough in my day with the big stone buildings that the pisistratids the tyrants had put up new temples and new government buildings and power in every stone athens was rich other cities in greece were stronger or thought they were stronger thebes and sparta and corinth but any man with his wits about him knew that athens was the queen of cities her acropolis had held the palace of theseus and men from that palace went to the war in troy she was old and wise and strong and rich more people lived within the precincts of athens than in the whole of boeotia or so men said the city was bigger than sardis and had almost twelve thousand citizens of military age athens had bronzesmiths and potters the best in the world and farmers and fishermen and sailors and oarsmen and perfumers and tanneries and weavers and swordsmiths and lampmakers and men who dyed fabric and men who whitened leather and men who did nothing but plait hair or teach young men to fight moreover they had women who did most of these things the world was turned on its head in athens and in my time ive met women who played instruments women who coached athletes women who wove and women who painted pots even a woman philosopher it was the city the city theyre a greedy rapacious foxy lot the athenians they lie steal and covet other mens possessions and they argue about everything ive always liked them id never been to aristides house but he was a famous man even then so it was easy enough to ask directions but i had to turn down a dozen offers on my slave girl the truth is she shone with some power and no man who saw her cared an obol about her limp and for some reason men fancied me too and even offered for my horse and my saddle blanket and my sword and anything else visible we should have passed around the shoulder of the areopagus and walked on down the hills to the cool countryside on the east side of the city instead i paused for a cup of cheap wine what i really wanted was to walk down the street of the bronzesmiths so i left my horse with slave girl and headed to the agora now theres a fancy new temple for hephaestus back then it was a much smaller affair with tiny cramped streets all over the low hill and a small shrine to athena and hephaestus at the top just one priest and no priestess but i went made a small sacrifice and left the meat for the poor as befitted a foreigner and then i walked down into the smiths quarter id have done better to take the boeotian dogcap off my head but i didnt i gave the sign to the priest of course and he passed me the sign for attica so that other smiths would treat me as a guest then i worked my way down the hill looking at their shops admiring their bellows or their tools or their hordes of apprentices i finally stopped where an ironsmith was roughing out spearpoints beautiful things long as my forearm with light sockets and heavy ribs for punching straight through armour you look like a lad who can use one of these the smith said for a dirteating theban i mean he added i spat im a dirteating plataean i said fuck thebes fuck your mother he said with pleasure no offence meant stranger any plataean is welcome here were you in the three battles every one i answered pais the master called and when one of his boys came he said get this hero a cup of chian you i asked politely oh i stood my ground once or twice that week he said he extended his hand and we shook and i passed the sign youre a smith he said need a place to stay thats how it was back then sad to see those old ways go hospitality was like a god to us to all greeks i had started to explain that i was on my way to see aristides when a welldressed man leading a horse leaned into the stall did i just hear you say you were a plataean he asked i didnt know him from oedipus but i was courteous i have that honour i am arimnestos of the corvaxae of plataea the man bowed youve just saved me quite a journey then he said im cleitus of the alcmaeonids of attica and you are under arrest for murder the law of athens is a complex dangerous monster and no foreigner like myself could possibly master it i stood there with my mouth agape like a fool and the smith came to my rescue says who he asked i havent missed an assembly since the feast of dionysus and no one has voted a capital charge the alcmaeonid shrugged you dont look like the kind of fellow to vote on the hill he said casually what he meant was that ironsmiths didnt get invited to join the areopagitica the council of elders mostly old aristocrats who ran the murder trials i think my smith might have let it go except that this cleitus was such an arrogant sod that he gave offence by breathing i dont have to be a sodding aristo to know the law the smith said whered the charge come from none of your business cleitus said he reached for my chlamys best come along boy some men claim that the gods play no role in human affairs such statements always make me laugh cleitus and i have crossed wits and swords often enough hes as wily as odysseus and as strong as heracles but on that day he couldnt spare the time to calm the ruffled plumage of an ironsmith what might have happened if he had the smith stepped around the counter of his shop with a speed that belied his bulk wheres your wand then he asked cleitus shrugged with my men in the agora better go and get it rich boy the smith said hey sons of hephaestus he called down your tools and come cleitus rallied his wits instantly now master smith no need for that ill get my wand but this man is a killer a killer of athenss enemies i said a good shot and it went right into the bullseye not an unlawful killer by then there were fifty apprentices looking for a fight and a dozen smiths and every hand held a hammer cleitus looked around ill be back with my men he said bring your staff of warrant or dont bother my new friend the smith called then he turned to me tell me your tale and make it swift men are missing work so i told him i left nothing out not even the dimple id left in my helmet he sent an apprentice for aristides i sat on a folding stool that was provided for me fine ironwork and very elegant and began to breathe more easily and then i heard the screams there were a fair number of screams in athens highpitched often in fun sometimes in earnest but by the third scream i realized that this was my slave girl i rose to my feet my smith looked at me where are you going he asked thats my slave i said he shook his head ive pledged my people to this he said you arent going anywhere ive made her an oath to free her i said send a boy send a pair of men with hammers please i ask you he spat orders at a couple of shop boys big ones and they hurried out of the door arimnestos eh he asked ive heard of you killer of men right enough thought youd be bigger i tried to sit still the screams had stopped time passed more time passed finally the boys came back cleitus has left the market the bigger of the two said hes got your horse and your girl he talked a lot of crap about what you took from his brother did you kill his brother mister i shook my head no i said and i felt tired did i say i loved athens athens makes me tired they have a great many rules can he really take these things from me i asked the smith he shrugged alcmaeonids do what they like he said most commoners wont even try to stand against them he grinned lucky youre a smith hes no smith said a voice behind my chair and there was athenss leading pillar of justice the greatest prig ever to lead warriors in the field a man so driven by fairness that he had no space left for ambition i embraced him anyway because i loved him despite the fact we had nothing in common it was aristides he was still tall lanky graceful like a man whos had the best training the drachma can buy all his life i gather youve turned to crime he said i like to think it was a rare show of humour and not a statement of fact not true my lord this scion of the alcmaeonids was killed by a man in my service at a shrine for impiety ive given orders for his body and his armour to be brought here and all his possessions that werent looted by his own servants they will be here in a matter of days i shrugged i am a man of property not a freebooter my lord aristides nodded solemnly im pleased to hear it hes a smith right enough the ironsmith said he knows the signs aristides looked at me under his bushy eyebrows always more to you than meets the eye young man so you are a smith young man he called me he was less than ten years my senior but he had the dignity of an old man a bronzesmith i said and a farmer now my property brought me three hundred medimnoi this autumn aristides laughed i never expected you to rise to the hippeis class he said im not sure that i still qualify i returned the alcmaeonids just stole my best horse and my slave girl aristides smile was wiped off his face really smiths and apprentices pressed around him each telling his own version of the story come to my house aristides said ill send to the council and announce that i have you in my custody and that ill represent you at the trial then everything will be legal what about my horse i asked and my girl he didnt answer i shook hands with every smith who had aided me thanked them all and walked off into the evening with aristides and a dozen young men he had about him all armed with heavy staves i noticed when we were clear of the industrial quarter aristides wrinkled his nose ive seen you in the storm of bronze plataean you are a man of worth how do you stand the stink of all that commerce he didnt slacken his step and he was a tall man i shrugged money smells the same whether earned at the point of the spear or in the sweat of a shop i said aristides shook his head but without virtue without glory youre arguing with the wrong man i answered my master taught me that war is the king and master of all some men it makes lords and others it makes slaves i laughed and then my laughter stopped whats happening here your lads are all armed and those alcmaeonids were out for my blood later he said we walked around the steep hill its rock worn smooth from hundreds of men climbing to the top where criminal trials were held and then past the slums on the east side and back up a big road the road to the temple of poseidon at sounion the moon was up by the time we came to a big gate my farm aristides said with pride i dont sleep in the city any more i expect ill be exiled soon if not killed he said it with the flat certainty you hear from a veteran on the night before he takes his death blow you exiled i shook my head five years ago you were the golden boy of athens i still am he said men think i seek to be tyrant when in fact i seek only to provide justice even to your friends the smiths there are noble men men of worth even in the forges and the potters shops i insisted of course democracy wouldnt function if there were not but they keep trying to insist on increased political rights when any thinking man knows that only a man of property can control a city were the only ones with the training that smith could no more vote on the areopagitica than i could dish a helmet aristides shed his chlamys and chiton and i noted he was still in top fighting trim as we talked slaves attended us i was stripped oiled and dressed in a better garment than id worn since my last bout of piracy all while listening to aristides helmets are raised not dished i said just my point he said i shook my head allow me to disagree with my host i said he smiled politely perhaps it is that the perfection of any trade war sculpture poetry ironsmithing even tanning or shoemaking provides a man with the tools of mind to allow a mature man to take an active part in politics i said he rubbed his chin well put and not an argument id heard put in exactly that way before but you are not proposing that all men are equal i sneered ive stood in the haze of ares too often to think that my lord he nodded just so but an equality of excellence i must say that i admire the notion but that equates politics and war which are noble pursuits with ironwork and trade which are not i took wine from a woman who had to be his wife i bowed deeply and she smiled arguing with my husband she said a waste of breath unless its about the running of this house and then he loses all interest you are arimnestos of plataea she had gold pins in her chiton and her hair was piled on her head like a mountain she was not beautiful but her face radiated intelligence athena might have looked so if she were to dress as a matron i am he despoina i bowed again somehow from my husbands stories i thought you might be bigger on the other hand youre as beautiful as a god which he somehow forgot to mention every slave girl in the house will be at your door ill just go and lock them away lest we have a plague of the ninemonths sickness in my house eh she smiled women are not allowed in the assembly aristides said because if they were wed be left with nothing to do but move heavy objects this is my dear wife jocasta she twirled her keys on her girdle and stepped out of the room tell me your notion then aristides said you speak well and men seldom face me in debate i shrugged i am as outmatched as a boy with a stave would be against me in the phalanx lord but as you are so polite as to hear me out you assume that war and politics are noble you assume that they are ends to themselves but you cannot make war without spears and we have no spears without ironsmiths my point exactly the ironsmith is less noble than the warrior because his craft is subordinate aristides smiled as he made his point his killshot he thought but my lord if you will accept my expertise i said carefully because i did not want to anger him war is a terrible end unto itself i have made more war than you although i am younger war is a terrible thing but without it we could not be free aristides said ah so freedom is the higher goal i smiled aristides frowned and then he grinned by the gods he said if all smiths were like you id replace the council of elders with smiths tonight i shrugged and then met his grin remember lord i was the pupil of heraclitus he nodded yes in truth you are an aristocrat as you were educated as one while being a slave i added and drank my wine but aristides did not laugh this is no matter for light talk he said athens is an experiment an experiment that may mean life or death to her were attempting to push responsibility for the city down as far down as we feel that free men have the power to think and vote the further down we push these rights the more fools we must tolerate and the more shields you have in the phalanx i said and the harder it is for the pisistratids or the alcmaeonids to restore the tyranny he countered is that what this is about i asked the tyranny of athens again id had four summers of listening to miltiades plot to take the city frankly i couldnt imagine why any of them wanted it aristides nodded he sat down the medes are coming he said that was news and no mistake i sat on a couch when i have no idea but the city is arming and preparing you know we are at war with aegina he asked i shrugged athens and aegina and corinth ruled the waves so of course they were not friends its not much of a war but were using it as an excuse to arm the great king is coming hes appointed a satrap of thrace of thrace by the gods on our very doorstep datis is his name or so were told were to be the target as soon as miletus falls i started miletus falls i asked every man in athens every political man aristides corrected himself ignoring my interest in miletus is gathering a retinue many i name no names have pledged themselves to the great king he shrugged both factions are gathering warriors citizens and noncitizens i put my wine cup down and laughed aloud you are allied with miltiades well might you laugh aristides grumbled he would be tyrant here if he could only men like me stand between him and power but he cant abide the persians and hes in the field fighting while we sit here piracy for his own profit you mean i said i served with him for four years my lord and i might serve him again but it is not the greater good of athens that drives miltiades to battle more likely it is his attacks on the great kings shipping that have brought the medes down on athens politics aristides said ignoring me again he held up his cup to a slave for a refill and i was annoyed that his slave got a glance and a smile whereas i was merely a sounding board doubtless some busy plotter among the alcmaeonids thought to hire your men for their side and leave you powerless thinking that otherwise your men would serve me or miltiades i snorted with disgust i was at home in boeotia tilling my fields i said please do not take it ill my lord but i care very little who is lording it in mighty athens so long as my bills are paid and my barns are full you disappoint me aristides said i shrugged you have seen a couple of handsome boys wrestling by a public fountain aristides nodded because there are young girls around the fountain i went on he laughed yes every day ever notice that the girls dont even glance at the boys because such posturing bores them silly eh now we were laughing together of course you have the right of it my wellspoken friend aristides glanced away at jocasta and they shared such a smile it was a pleasure to see them together well then we plataeans are the girls by the fountain come back and talk to us when you have learned to listen and to play tricks that please us until then you and miltiades and all these pisistratids and alcmaeonids are just boys wrestling by the fountain i chuckled who made you so wise he asked i laughed a generation of girls at fountains in ephesus i said now how do i get my horse and my slave girl back aristides shook his head ask after the trial he said i coughed trial my trial when is that i thought youd fixed that for me he shook his head the law is the only glue that binds athens he said you will have a trial ill be your speaker when i asked again tomorrow he said the idea of a trial drove news about miltiades and the siege of miletus out of my head in athens a foreigner cannot speak or defend himself at a trial of any kind without a friend a proxenos to represent him a foreigner even if hes a metic who lives in the city and has a trade and serves in the phalanx cannot utter a word in his own defence actually i approve of this law why let foreigners speak in your assembly a pox on them all theyll do is stir up trouble aristides walked with me as far as the first public fountain you are not permitted to speak he said but that changes very little you can still smile and frown and raise your eyebrows you can control your emotions or give them free rein men know who you are and if they didnt yesterday they will by this morning the jurors will watch you comport yourself like a man ask yourself what would achilles do i laughed sulk in his camp until provoked and then kill anyone who offended him aristides frowned the law is not a matter for levity i must leave you i have stops to make and men to see be on the hill of the areopagus by the middle of the day he handed me a threeleaf wooden tablet with wax pages keep this by you he said ive written out the charges and your countercharges just in case another man has to speak for you and i want you to understand were suing young cleitus for the civil loss of your chattels that is the girl and the horse of the two the horse is by far the most valuable and will i think trip young cleitus up handily at the trial understand i read the tablet quickly the writing was tiny and precise but i am a literate man i was taught my letters early will the trials go on at the same time i asked zeus you know nothing of our laws no your trial is for the murder of a citizen that will be tried by the areopagitica the elders of the city friends of the alcmaeonids every man in fact more than half of them are alcmaeonids he nodded gravely the civil trials will be held when the roster allows probably early in the spring well need a jury of at least four hundred i swallowed some rage spring i promised that girl her freedom aristides shrugged i doubt youll ever see her again frankly ill see to it that you receive chattel of equal value i shook my head aristides i trust you but i will have that girl back and i will free her i swore it it may seem a little thing to you he shook his head in turn no oaths to the gods are weighty matters and you are a pious man i apologize i will do my best but if they cannot kill you these men will seek to hurt you even your woman and your horse i spat this is your democracy aristocrats hitting out at better men through their chattels he went down into the agora with the rest of his followers leaving me two young men with staves sophanes who already had a name as a warrior and glaucon his friend they were both aristocrats both followers of aristides and both very serious they wanted me to tell them about miltiades i want a good krater to take home i said ignoring them and shrugging off my rage i put the tablet into the backfold of my chiton a beautiful garment of natural wool something with a hero on it will you take me to the potters quarter i had an errand on the way and so i walked them down past the cemetery and took them to visit cleon my hopliteclass friend from my first campaign he met me in his doorway and he barked like a dog howled and threw his arms around me sophanes and glaucon watched wideeyed as we drank a shared cup of wine terrible wine and traded tales you sophanes he said you have the name of an athlete do you know that this big lummox charged the persians singlehanded at the pass of sardis cleon was proud to know me proud to show me off to passersby i shrugged eualcidas of euboea led the way and there were ten of us cleon laughed it froze my fucking blood just to watch by aphrodites burning cunt his face was red and i thought that hed had too much wine already you look rich and pampered he went on i thought he looked like a broken man how are things with you i asked he had told me that his house was smaller than the stern gallery on a trireme and i could see it was true my wife died he said he shrugged and both of my children apollo sent some affliction and they were gone in a week he looked at the floor then he straightened his spine anyway how are you famous i note talk of my fame made me nervous im here because idomeneus killed one of the alcmaeonids i said to cover the pain in his eyes with facts men do these things men are cowards when it comes to sorrow good for bumboy for a kohleyed catamite hes a fine man killed an aristocrat thats something he said i laughed nervously cleon was drunk and difficult sophanes and glaucon were both aristocrats and they were not pleased i shrugged i have an appointment i said damn you remind me of better times im not even a hoplite any more eh failed the property qualification he looked at the floor and then hugged me damn listen to me all whines and selfpity come and see me again i hugged him hard took my two guards and left for the potters my two aristocrats clucked and muttered and finally glaucon spat that i had a friend of no worth i stopped and put a hand on his shoulder older man to younger cleon looked a little drunk his wife and children have died i held his eyes and the boy flinched he stood his ground and kept men off me many times in the rage of ares when you have done as much then you may speak of him in that way in my hearing glaucon looked at the ground i apologize i liked him for that the young are superb at disavowing responsibility hades i was myself so i know what i speak of but this one was a better man we walked east into the morning sun and i lightened the atmosphere between us with tales of miltiades i was beginning the tale of the fighting in the chersonese and the tearless battle where we took all the enemy boats with the loss of a dozen men and smashed the phoenicians when we crossed the festival road and found ourselves in the midst of a forest of brothels and taverns and free mens houses only athens could so hopelessly overcommercialize something as simple as sex i remember losing the thread of my story as i contemplated well ill gloss over what i was contemplating as you virgins would probably expire on the spot so we took fishing boats i remember saying there was a fair fishing fleet at kallipolis the dagger punched into my back just above the kidney the blow was perfectly delivered and had a great deal of force behind it i staggered fell to my knees and felt the blood leak out over my arse i should have been dead but i wasnt so i rolled through the fall and rose my chlamys already off my throat and around my arm as i came up i had my knife in my right hand glaucon was down but sophanes was holding his own his stick against two bullies with clubs even then at seventeen he was a foe to reckon with my man was big titanic in fact i hate fighting big men they dont feel pain they have a natural confidence that is hard to break and they are strong my man was still trying to figure out why i wasnt dead i shared his confusion but i wasnt going to dwell on it it crossed my mind that i probably didnt want to kill him legal troubles and all that i sidestepped got down in my stance and flicked my chlamys at his eyes behind him sophanes landed a blow with a crack that must have been heard at the peak of cithaeron and his man went down the other backed away my opponent had a club and a knife he cut at me with the gross ineptitude of the professional bruiser i killed him it was no big deal he was big not skilled and as the club rose i put my knife in between the shoulder muscles and the throat interesting point i can remember that i had been planning a much more complicated feint when he left himself wide open from sheer folly and i took him thats single combat i threw my chlamys over sophanes second opponent it had corner weights and the gossamer wool settled like a net sophanes stepped in with his stave in two hands and broke the mans head as if wed planned the move for weeks in the palaestra that was the fight i felt much better when you are enraged at injustice and humiliated by your helplessness in the face of towering bureaucracy killing a couple of thugs is deeply satisfying at least it is to me sophanes must have felt the same as he flashed me a grin and we embraced then he went to his friend who was starting to stir i stripped the bodies of cash each had a little purse with a dozen silver owls quite a sum the daimon of combat was wearing off and suddenly i thought why am i alive the first blow should have been the last i never saw it coming and i was bleeding just a little from a deep puncture above my hip a prostitute fetched water and cleaned my wound and said a prayer for me meanwhile i cast around the ground trying to find the dagger all i could think was that the blade must have snapped the dagger was under the dead titan lost things are always in the last place you look i find glaucon was getting colour back in his face and a pair of local girls were stroking him while a doctor felt his skull sophanes helped me roll the dead man over and there was the dagger a single finger of bright steel sticking out of aristides wax tablet sophanes whistled and made a sign of aversion the gods love you plataean id fought with pleasure but the sight of the tablet with the dagger right through it made me shake for a moment just a moment that close i gave the girls five owls a fortune to make the body vanish sophanes was i think both appalled and thrilled the morning was young and i found a brothelkeeper and had him take the other two thugs and lock them in his cellar which was cut straight into the rock of the hillside i paid him too the freespending habits of a life of piracy instantly conquered a few months attempt to be a farmer kill people take their money spend it recklessly yet i had changed because another part of me registered that id just spent the value of thirtyfive medimnoi of grain at current prices merely to get rid of a body we left glaucon to recover ostensibly to watch the prisoners i went and bought a wine krater its that one right there achilles and ajax playing polis it tickles my fancy that it wasnt all war men had time to gamble at troy the sun was high but not yet noon when we got back to the brothel glaucon looked like a dog with too many bones hed had his flute played i could tell but the two men were both in the cellar one was dead blows to the head can have that effect sophanes didnt like that that hed killed a man i shrugged if you fight you will kill i said the other was terrified he wasnt a citizen and the punishment for his crime would be the silver mines until he died nor was he brave but all he knew was that some men and women all veiled had paid the titan to find me and kill me theyd been paid at sunrise in the grove of pan thats all he knew i looked at him tried a few more questions listened to his tears and cut his throat sophanes was shocked i stepped back to avoid the flow of blood and then handed the brothelkeeper five more drachmas he nodded to me as one predator to another the two boys who had been sent to guard me were spluttering listen lads i said i caught their arms and held them all he had coming was to be worked to death as a slave right i looked at both of them and now the only story that will ever be heard is ours hard to cook up a lie if none of your witnesses can speak you killed him glaucon got out after some muttering he tried to kill you i pointed out that was in the heat of battle sophanes said by zeus soter plataean this was murder its different i shrugged not when youve killed as many men as i have i said console yourself that he was a foreign metic probably an escaped slave and a man of no worth whatsoever he wasnt even brave i wiped my knife on the dead mans chiton poured a little olive oil from my aryballos to keep it bright sheathed it and headed up the rockcarved steps we were a silent crew as we walked to my murder trial i was pretty sure that my two companions were no longer in the grips of hero worship athenian justice is swift i arrived a little early but most of the areopagitica was already on the hill and the last of the old men made their climb just behind me aristides was there he had a bruise on one shoulder that he hadnt had that morning tried to kill you i said quietly yes he said and you i take it i handed him the tablet with the dagger through it heads turned all over the summit he was angry this is not athens he spat what are we some court of medes some softhanded lydians next men will turn to poison but then he calmed this will tell in your favour ill hand it around the symbolism is so clear its like an augury the dagger through the law so i watched the tablet passed from man to man and the muttering must have helped me a little aristides was calm and forceful when the trial started let me digress a moment youve noticed that i wandered the city without much trouble i could have run but of course i didnt thats how it was then athens assumed that i would come to my trial and i did in a murder trial each side gets one speech a couple of hours by a waterclock first the prosecution then the defence and the verdict is delivered immediately after the defence delivers its argument were much the same in plataea although its years since we had a proper murder trial simon my cousin killed himself rather than face the tribunal so we all stood in the blazing sun and cleitus of the alcmaeonids began his speech i cant remember all he said but i know it was damning and at the same time utterly inaccurate i accuse arimnestos of plataea the man who stands before you of the murder of my cousin nepos nepos was murdered within the precincts of a shrine foully murdered with impiety unarmed standing making an oration to the gods cleitus had a good voice i couldnt speak but i could roll my eyes so i did all of you know of this man a notorious pirate a man who serves with the vicious cutthroat miltiades with miltiades he sacked naucratis with miltiades he attacked the great kings ships and those of our allies at ephesus and other places over and over again it is men like this who bring the just wrath of the great king down on our city well i couldnt really disagree with that so i smiled genially dont let this mans reputation as a fighter cloud your vision though gentlemen look at him this is no achilles this is a fighter trained in the pits of slavery a man who has neither arete nor generosity he is merely a killer is the look on his brow more than that of a bestial destroyer is he different from a boar or a lion that kills the men who tend our crops this is a man bred to slavery and what he has now he has stolen from better men first through piracy and then through open theft of a farm in plataea no man in plataea dares act against him they fear his wrath but here in athens we are better men with a better strength of law there was more much more two hours of detailed and fallacious vilification cleitus knew nothing of me save some highly coloured details from plataea and it was obvious where they came from because my cousin simon son of simon who hanged himself was standing a little to the left of cleitus with a look of joyous hate stamped across his features i locked eyes with him and gave him some bland indifference by the time cleitus was finished many of his audience were asleep he had after all repeated the charges and the assaults on my character fifteen or twenty times his arrogance showed through too plainly heraclitus would have taught him better at ephesus one of the things we learned was not to annoy a jury nor to bore it on the other hand none of the men in that jury were my friends and most were bored only because they had made up their minds before they put a sandal on the slippery rock of justice slaves came and refilled the waterclock i leaned over and pointed out simon to aristides who looked at him and nodded to me aristides stood up slowly he walked gracefully to the speakers podium and turned to me our eyes met for a long time then he turned back to the jurors my friend arimnestos cannot speak here today as he is a foreigner he said but although his tongue cannot speak his spear has spoken loud and long for athens louder and longer than any of you alcmaeonids if deeds rather than words were the weight of a man if the price of citizenship were measured in feats of arms not barley or oil he would sit in judgment and none of you would even qualify as thetes ouch powerful rhetoric but a damned annoying way to win over a jury aristides walked across to cleitus you maintain that my friend is a slave or some sort of penniless foreigner cleitus stood i do aristides smiled and you have received my suit against you for the theft of a horse and a woman i have taken them against the mans indemnity cleitus said in other words you admit yourself that my friend was the owner of the horse and the slave aristides stepped back just like a swordsman who administers the killing blow and now avoids the fountain of blood cleitus flushed red he probably stole them he shouted but the archon basileus pointed his staff silence he roared your time is done and you speak out of turn aristides turned to the jurors my friend is the son of technes head of the corvaxae of plataea my friend could if he might speak tell you how his father was murdered by the father of that man standing by cleitus and his farm stolen by the same man and how arimnestos later returned from ten years of war war at the behest of athens i might add to find his enemies in possession of his farm he might speak of how the assembly of plataea voted to punish the usurper that mans father and he might speak of what a twisted claim has just been made accusations void of truth any man of plataea would tell us if called to witness that my friend is master of a farm that provides three hundred measures of grain and oil and wine aristides had them listening now but none of this matters what matters is simple my friend did not kill cleituss useless cousin in point of fact cleituss case is already void because he has spoken and he may not speak again yet he has not troubled to prove that his cousin is dead cleitus had missed the matter entirely his head snapped up his mouth worked really cousin for we are cousins cleitus are we not you are too young to plead before this august body you needed first to prove that your cousin nepos is dead second you needed to demonstrate that my friend was in some way linked to his death beyond the circumstance that he is from plataea if you had remembered you would have maintained that your cousin died at the shrine of leitos on the flanks of cithaeron but like a young man you let spite carry you away and you forgot to mention the place of this supposed murder or any other facts relating to it what you have not told these worthy men is that your whole knowledge of this matter comes from two panicked slaves who returned to you claiming that their master had been killed you have never been to plataea you have no idea if the claim is accurate you have acted on the word of two treacherous slaves and in truth as far as you know at any moment your cousin nepos may stroll into the crowd and ask what this is about cleitus rose again he is dead he was killed at the shrine the archon rose silence this instant puppy listen to me cleitus spat the archon waved and two gaudily dressed scythian archers took cleitus by the arms and carried him off the hill aristides looked around in silence i claim that my opponent has made no case he has not shown a body he has not offered a witness there is nothing for me to answer but the slander of a traitors son i call a vote on the evidence presented stunned silence greeted him the waterclock was running noisily it was still almost full the archon looked them over i cannot direct you he said but if you pretend that cleitus has a case ill make you pay i was acquitted twentyseven to fourteen a carefully arranged vote as it meant that i could not claim damages from cleitus several men tried to force through a different vote that would have made me stand trial again if more evidence could be gathered they were still arguing when the sun set and aristides led me off the hill you are the very achilles of orators i said aristides shook his head that was bad i used arts to win had i argued the case on its merits they would have found a way to kill you he rubbed his nose i feel dirty perhaps i should exile myself this is not law this is foolishness the archon was just the archon hates the alcmaeonids as upstarts and posturers hes no friend of mine but hed raise me to olympus if it would hurt the new men all i had to do was put cleitus in a place where his arrogance would count against him what now i asked i want my horse and my slave girl aristides shook his head perhaps in the spring and if you stay here youll be dead i dont have enough wax tablets to keep you alive we walked to his farm and jocasta served wine i told her the whole of the trial while glaucon and sophanes sulked they didnt love me any more aristides noted them he inclined his long chin in their direction and raised an eyebrow at me hmm i said jocasta was looking at her husband with her eyes shining should i invite this pretty foreigner to live in our house so that i can finally hear what happens at your trials love she asked to me she said he never tells me a word of his speeches the great man looked down his nose if i told you my speeches you would only seek to improve them he said i could not bear that their eyes met and i felt a twinge of jealousy not bodily jealousy like a boy feels when a girl leaves him for another but something in the soul those two had something i had never had something calm and deep why are the boys on edge aristides asked quietly i killed some thugs i said i saw the effect my words had on the lady killing was part of life for me not for her sorry despoina when aristides shrugged i clarified why the two young men were upset one i killed in cold blood aristides shuddered in revulsion how can you do such things he asked its much like killing a man in a fight only quicker i retorted his squeamishness did i mention that he was a prig offended me i cannot have you under my roof while you are tainted with such a crime aristides said i all but fell over in shock they attacked us but i could see it on his face this was athens i had spent too long in the camp of miltiades men didnt simply cut other mens throats here i had unwittingly committed a crime and offended my host and patron im no fool i got to my feet i understand my lord but the man what was before him but death in the mines and he might have been used against us in law aristides kept his head turned away as if breathing the same air as me would hurt him a thug a metic he could never have been used in a trial and you should know better are you a god that you may choose who lives and who dies you killed him because it was easy alas he was right a god or one of the fates might well say that this man had no future but a straight trip to the mines and a few months of wretchedness aristides pulled his chlamys over his head in disgust you have no such knowledge you killed him for convenience your own convenience now i am beginning to doubt my wisdom in defending you jocasta was standing as far from me as possible they were a very religious household and my bloody pragmatism now looked to me as it did to them like selfish crime i had two choices the amoral outrage of the pragmatist or admission that i had acted wrongly rage rose within me but heraclitus was there too you are right i said i clamped down on my anger it was wrong ugly unworthy aristides raised his head you mean that yes i said you have convicted me in the court of my own mind i should not have killed him though he was of no use even to himself i shuddered it was so easy to fall back into the habits of the pirate cleanse yourself he said i need my horse and my woman i said i swore an oath aristides shook his head cleanse yourself and perhaps the gods will provide there were in those days a number of temples that offered cleansing from the stain of death and impiety even the shrine to leitos in plataea although that was open only to soldiers but the principal places of cleansing for crime were olympia delphi and delos and of the three delos was easiest to reach though most distant in stades i suppose and the apollo there was the most ready to listen to a common man i will go to delos i said you can be in sounion by morning aristides said have you money i didnt tell him i still had twenty drachmas from the dead men yes i said gods speed you there aristides said he stood by me while i rolled my blankets and an old bearskin then followed me out of his gate listen arimnestos you may take me for a pious fool or a hypocrite neither my lord we were alone in the dark you need to be gone before your wagon arrives with the corpse and the goods and they find an excuse to take you again i will try to find your girl but this murder is a stain and you must be clean before you come back here it may be that some god led you to it because you do need to be gone and tonight is better than tomorrow he shrugged they will kill you if they cannot convict you i dont fear them i said but i wasnt telling the truth in a year the balance will change right now you cannot be here even plataea might prove dangerous for you go to delos and do as the god bids you he held out his hand i do not fear pollution so much that i would not clasp your hand and then i was walking in the dark down the rocky road to sounion i managed to find a ship at sounion practically on the steps of the temple of poseidon he was a phoenician bound for delos with a cargo of slaves from italy and iberia i didnt think very highly of slavers and i dislike phoenicians on principle even though they are great sailors but i took it as a test from the gods and i kept my eyes open and my mouth shut all the slaves were iberians big men with heavy moustaches tattoos and the deep anger of the recently enslaved they eyed my weapons and i kept my distance they all looked like fighting men the navarch a man with a beard trimmed the aegyptian way curling like a talon from his chin made them row in shifts between his professional rowers he was training them so that hed get a better price he planned to sell the best of them at delos and the rest at tyre or ephesus ephesus i asked ephesus always interested me the satrap of phrygia has an army laying siege to miletus he said his fleet is based at ephesus that was news to me already i asked the fall of miletus the most powerful city in the greek world or so we thought would be the end of the ionian revolt once again i have to leave my tale to explain in those days most of the cities of ionia and there were dozens from beautiful heraklea on the euxine down along the coast of asia to mighty miletus then to ephesus the city of my youth richer than athens by a factor of five times across the cyprian sea to cyprus and crete more greeks lived in ionia than lived in greece except that most of those greeks lived under the rule of the king of kings the great king of the persians while i was growing to manhood in the house of hipponax i lived under persian rule the persians ruled well thugater never believe the crap men say today about how they were a nation of slaves they were warriors and men of honour in most cases more honour than we greeks artaphernes the satrap of phrygia was the friend and foe of my youth he was a great man in those days in my youth the greeks of ionia rose up to throw off the shackles of persian slavery hah now theres a load of cow shit selfish men seeking power for themselves cozened the citizens of many ionian cities to trade the safety and stability of the worlds greatest empire for freedom to most ionians that freedom was the freedom to be killed by a persian none of the ionians trusted each other and every one of them wanted power over the others the persians had a unified command brilliant generals and excellent supplies and money the ionian revolt had lasted for ten years but it was never much of a success and when this story starts as i was sailing as a passenger on a slave ship it was entering its final phase although we didnt know it the persians had seemed at the edge of triumph before and each time the revolt had been rescued usually by athens or by athenians acting as surrogates for their mother city like miltiades but athens had its own problems the near civil war i described persian gold was pouring into the city inflating the power of the aristocratic party and the alcmaeonids and the pisistratids were backed by persia to restore the tyranny not that i knew that then persian gold was paralysing athens and the persian axe was poised over miletus to the navarch of this slave ship all this meant that he could make a handsome profit selling halftrained rowers to the persian fleet anchored on the beaches around ephesus supporting the siege of miletus i listened and managed not to speak we were fifteen days making a threeday voyage and i hated that ship by the time we landed his long black hull was swift and clean and for a light trireme he was the very acme of perfection yet this phoenician cur sailed him like a pig the phoenician was afraid of every cup of wind and he stayed on a coast to the very end of a headland and crossed open water with visible reluctance ive never loved the phoenicians but most of them were brilliant sailors every pack has a cur i sat alone in the bow sang the hymn to apollo as we sing it in plataea i have apollos raven on my shield and prepared myself to meet the god of the lyre and the plague i tried not to think of how easily i could take this ship those days were gone or so i thought the last night at sea i had a dream such a dream that i can remember wisps of it even today ravens came to me and carried my good knife away and one of them set a lyre in my hand as a replacement i didnt need a priest to tell me what that meant the most dangerous of the iberians you could see it in his eyes had a raven tattooed on his hand and another on his sword arm when the slavers stern was set in the deep sand of a delian beach and his people were moving cargo i dropped my heavy knife into the blackness under the iberians bench while he lay watching me exhausted from rowing our eyes met i nodded his face was completely blank i wasnt even sure hed seen the knife and i went ashore poorer by a good blade priests are priests the world around ive noted a certain similarity from olympia to memphis in aegypt many of them are good men and women a few are remarkable genuinely blessed the rest are a sorry lot people who probably in my opinion couldnt make a living any other way except as beggars or farm labour the man who met me as i kissed the rock by the stern of the slave ship was one of the latter his hands were soft and his handclasp was limp and unpleasant and his soft voice wished me a speedy encounter with the god in a voice that seemed all too ready to wheedle and plead you are arimnestos of plataea he said well that took me aback i was naive then and didnt know the effort to which the great priesthoods went to be informed nor did i suspect how carefully engineered this might be yes i allowed brought here by the god to hear your penance for murder he said in the same voice that a man might tease a girl into his blanket roll i didnt like him but he had me i can tell you yes i said the god has spoken to us of you he said he leaned his chin on the head of his staff what have you brought as offering just like that my feet were still in the sand of the beach and the priests of apollo wanted their fees i sighed i have served apollo and hephaestus all my life i said i revere all the gods and i serve at the shrine of the hero leitos of plataea this by way of my religious credentials so to speak he said nothing his eyes flickered to the purse in my hand i have twenty drachmas less the one i owe as passage to that slave trader need i mention that the priests of apollo played an active role in the trade nineteen silver owls that is all the duty you pay to the god you who are called the spear of the greeks he shook his head i think not go back and return when you intend to give the god his due now lest you young people miss the accounting nineteen silver owls was the value of a farms produce for a year but of course it was as nothing next to the profits a man might make trading or as a pirate i didnt know what to say i had more respect for priests in those days even venal creatures like this one these nineteen drachmas are all i have i protested he laughed then lord apollo will give you nineteen drachmas worth of prophecy i can feel his words in my heart go and come back when you have learned enough wisdom to pay your tithe perhaps at eighteen id have obeyed but i was older out of my way i said i need to find a priest he oozed insult i am the priest the god has assigned i shrugged and pushed past him i suspect the god can do better he followed me up the rock and his voice became increasingly shrill as he demanded that i speak to him but i continued up the steps to the temple complex at the gate he was still shouting at me as i asked the porter to find me a priest the porter grunted and i gave him a drachma and he sent a boy arimnestos of plataea the priest from the beach persisted this is not the way a gentleman behaves only eighteen drachmas left i said and by the time i get a new guide to the altar there will be none your arrogance will be your death he said you seek to cheat the god i do not i said i am a farmer in boeotia not a pirate in the chersonese these coins are a fair share of my fortune in the last year i said so but i began to be afraid those coins were as you know taken from the corpses of men who tried to kill me perhaps the coins were polluted but essentially my words were true ones the eighteen coins in my purse were more than a tenth of all the coins i had in the world why have you requested a second guide a hard voice asked this priest was older dressed in a simple wool garment that had seen better days thrasybulus why have i been summoned you may go back to your cell the oily man behind me answered this arrogant boeotian is attempting to bargain with god i wish to be washed by the god for a murder committed in athens i said if the god has words for me to hear i would laugh with delight to hear them but this man asks me for money i do not have i pointed at the younger priest the older man rubbed his beard what price have you offered he asked he is silence thrasybulus the older priest seemed a different kind of man i have offered eighteen drachmas i said it is all i have the cost of three new bulls he looked at me he can do better much better thrasybulus pointed at the metalwork on my empty scabbard the older man sighed this is unseemly the priesthood of apollo does not bargain like fishwives on the beach the porters laugh suggested that this statement was not entirely true i am dion of delos the older man said i am principally a scholar and i seldom lead men to the gates but thrasybulus has i fear earned your displeasure the older man glared at the younger you will need silver for food and passage home as well will you not i nodded give me twelve drachmas for your sacrifices and i will lead you to the god he said thrasybulus spat you are a liar before the god he said pointing at me not an auspicious start to my time on the island of apollo that evening i made the first of my three sacrifices this one on the socalled altar of ash i sacrificed a black lamb a symbol of my crime and i told the god and all the other men waiting to sacrifice how i had come to kill the thug in athens and what my sin was the sin of hubris in feeling that i was as fit to decide his fate as the gods other men sacrificed for other crimes one from crete had killed his son with a javelin an error a grievous miscast while hunting another had slept with a foreign woman during her courses and felt unclean i almost laughed but everyone else seemed to feel this was a serious thing several men were soldiers mercenaries who had come to atone for killing other greeks over dice or in battle two men were guilty of gross impiety my sacrifice was refused i took the animal to the altar and killed it but the fire would not accept the beast i saw it myself the same happened to one of the men guilty of impiety and the man who had killed his son my priest dion led the three of us from the altar he took us to a hut made of brush on the cliff high above the beach you will remain here for a week eating clean food and drinking only water consider how you became unclean consider your life i will return for you that was a long week the cretan was called heracles he was tall and strong noble in his carriage and so broken by grief that it was hard to speak to him he felt the guilt that i did not feel he felt that he had killed his son and deserved the wrath of the god while i felt that i had acted hastily selfishly but that i had now learned my lesson and did not deserve the wrath of apollo yet i had enough sense to see that i had far more culpability than this cretan lord in fact he was mistaking sorrow for guilt i sat with him night after night held his hand and spoke to him of hunting and of crete a place i knew well i could get him to listen and i could make him smile and then some chance of speech would cast him back into the pit i am cursed he said i have killed my son and now my wife is barren take a concubine i said with all the arrogance of youth i cannot replace eighteen years of my life and his just by making another squawking babe he shot back with more spirit than id seen so far lord you can and then you must toil for as many years again until he comes to manhood so that your patronage is secure i spoke carefully for i felt i might be speaking wisdom he sighed perhaps he said you are young when you have seen fifty winters tell me how you feel about lasting through another fifteen seasons of war and the hunt my joints hurt just lying here the other man was a blasphemer i could tell this because he swore by various gods every hour on the hour and cursed the gods for setting him on delos he was a little man in mind not stature and a lesson to anyone who would listen about the vices men can get into through idleness and superstition i might have been a foolish young man but i was the very king of piety next to philocrates if you care so little for the gods why did you come here and confess i asked him he shrugged i swore an oath nothing big just part of a business deal i never meant to pay the bastard he was cheating me but the priest of zeus in halicarnassus will not let me do any business in the agora until i atone he shrugged all mummery no greater liars or thieves than those priests and grunted and now i have to put up with this my money is as silver as everyone elses fuck the gods why am i singled out because they think i should pay more he spat i didnt like his attitude but i had to agree with the sense of his complaint you are hardly repentant i said what are you some kind of aspiring priest he asked fuck off ill eat my bread and water for a week and if they dont take my sacrifice ill sail away and let them dance for the money but the god i asked how much of a bumpkin are you he asked me listen theres a pair of bellows behind the altar they manipulate them to decide which sacrifices are accepted and which rejected right you understand boy or are you too thick there are no gods all you get is what you take i felt the sort of shock that a man feels when lightning strikes too close at sea i had thought of myself as a man of the world i was a hardened killer a soldier of fortune a former pirate but that men would manipulate the sacrifices of the gods or that this man would claim there were no gods heraclitus told us that such men were contemptible but very brave only small men are incapable of seeing something greater than themselves my master once said so i shook my head at philocrates you are a sad case i said he just smirked bumpkin he shot back the week was hard i drank water and watched the sun and i sang a hymn to apollo every day i set myself a task to remember all the men i had killed of course there were men i couldnt remember the carians at sardis and ephesus had died in the anonymity of their armour and the phoenicians id killed on my ship during the mutiny didnt even have faces in my memory but i was able to conjure up fifty men in the theatre of my head and that seemed a great many and i had probably killed twice that or even three times a week of consideration and it seemed to me that the god was right to refuse my sacrifice i killed too easily i decided it wasnt a hard decision to reach after all heraclitus had said as much most of the days of my youth when old dion came for me he was leading another black ram did you dream he asked i shrugged i had dreams i said i dreamed once of a man i killed a boy i put out of his misery on a battlefield and i dreamed of a woman i love dion led me to the highest headland on the island ten stades or more from our hut the ram followed along obediently then he sat me down on a seat carved from the living rock and why do you think the god refused your sacrifice he asked i looked out over the sea there were a dozen ships on the beach below me two of them i knew and i sat up with a start thats my ship i said it was storm cutter and he still had the raven of apollo on his sail the first ship i had ever owned spearwon from the phoenicians even now his navarch was likely to be one of my chosen men dion raised an eyebrow men have been asking for you for three days he said but you are in the gods hands answer my question the god refused my sacrifice because i kill to easily and for little things i said and yet even as i say this i wonder what the god asks of me i am a warrior dion nodded i thought you were a farmer and a bronzesmith dion was a decent priest so i said what came to mind the sight of that ship raises my heart in a way that my anvil never does i confessed so dion said now he smiled so now you are confused i laughed yes i said answer me a question priest he shrugged it is my place to ask but ill answer one question if i can i pointed at the temple is there a pair of bellows mounted in the altar of ash to control the flame of the sacrifices dion nodded when you work bronze do you use bellows he asked i nodded and do you pray to hephaestus to guide your hand when you work of course i said before i started my helmet i omitted the prayer and my work failed dion nodded again and yet you had bellows and a hammer and an anvil i expect i did i said seeing his point and if you sought to work bronze and you prayed and yet had neither bellows nor an anvil he asked id be a fool i agreed some of us here are fools dion said his eyes narrowed i am not one of them are you im still not sure i understand what the god asks of me i said the confession of confusion is often the beginning of wisdom he said and slapped my knee lets make sacrifice my ram died well and the god accepted him in a blast of fire and i walked down the steps of the altar my bare feet treading on the burnt remnants of thousands of animals sent to the heavens here so that i wondered for a moment what a herd theyd make and what the first animal to die here had been let me also note that the god accepted the sacrifice of the impious trader and rejected the sacrifice of the cretan lord who had killed his son my confusion deepened there is more to god than a pair of bellows and an altar dion said hes a good man and the god will send him home when he is ready the next morning in the first blush of dawn i waited in the cleft at the base of the altar clad in simple white linen without so much as a stripe woven in the cleft smelled of almonds and honey and i was afraid hard to say why exactly dion held my shoulder while the first supplicant crawled up and into the cleft he was gone for a long time and when he returned he was as white as a corpse and couldnt stand up so that three acolytes had to carry him when he was able to speak priests gathered around him like sharks around a kill demanding to know what words the god had spoken then it was my turn men were known to die confronting the god in the cleft no amount of spearcraft on my part could avoid death if the god intended it for me and i was afraid the cleft itself was odd a big shelf of rock overhung another and the cleft was between them so that a man had to climb up first as if into a hearth i could just get my head and shoulders through the gap and i banged my knees badly and the smell of almonds grew stronger all around me the priests had told me not to flinch and not to stop climbing so i felt in front of me with my hand all black and me lying on my back and i found the next handhold and pushed myself up with my legs crouching and pressing myself flat against an invisible rock surface my head bumped rock and i felt a breeze on my face i got a knee up and scraped it again but the pain was far far away and then i was up on the second shelf breathing like bellows eheheh said the dying man at my elbow i looked at him and he was younger than me and kalos even at the point of death with big beautiful eyes that wanted to know how his world had turned to shit his skin where it was not smeared with sweat and puke was smooth and lovely he was somebodys son i drew my short dagger really my eating knife from under my scale shirt where i keep it and i put my lips by his ear say goodnight i said i tried to sound like pater when he put me to bed say goodnight laddy gnight he managed like a child the poor bastard go to elysium with the thought of home i prayed and put the point of my eating knife into his brain i tried to stand and my head hit the rock i whirled and i couldnt find the cleft any more i knelt and my knees were bleeding how strong are you killer of men a voice said to be honest i suspect i may have whimpered i have no memory past that until i was kneeling on the sand of the beach puking my guts out like a babe dion held my hand you are clean and the god has spoken through you he said gently i will send word to aristides you know aristides i asked dion smiled the world is not so big he said did the god have words for me i asked dion nodded simple words simply obeyed you are lucky he patted me on the head i was that weak when you leave the temple obey the first man you meet through obeying him you will do a service for the god it will come straight to you like an arrow he held out his hand and i got to my feet a slave brought me water and i drank it are you ready my head was spinning but the world was growing calmer by the moment yes i said i add on my own account the priest said as he led me up to the altar that if you were to hold your hand when you could kill each time you acted so would count as a sacrifice to lord apollo hmm i said but i knew that this was the most important message and the lesson i had come to delos to learn the stuff about the first man outside the temple i had seen miltiades ship on the beach i knew who would be waiting for me outside the temple and i was cynical enough to wonder how much my former lord had paid for me i sacrificed at the low altar and the high altar and then i changed my temple garments for my own boeotian wool with my own sturdy boots and my own felt hat and the hilt of my own sword under my arm i looked for my knife and then i remembered that id given it to the slave or it was lost in the bilges of a phoenician slaver rusting away i kissed dion on both cheeks i couldnt help but notice that thrasybulus was standing by the portico eyeing me the way a butcher eyes a bull thank you i said you doubt dion said i too doubt doubt is to piety what exercise is to athletics but the god spoke to you and in a day or less you will see then i walked down the steps of the portico i contemplated briefly a dramatic assault on my fate i wondered what would happen if i ran to the left accosted the slave sweeping the steps and demanded that he order me to do something so that i might obey but some things are ordained whether the hand of man or the hand of the gods is in it matters little as the petty hands of men may well be the tools of the gods as well dions lesson so i walked down the steps to where miltiades stood his arms crossed over his magnificent breastplate of silvered bronze his helmet was between his feet and his shield was being held by his hypaspist his son cimon stood behind him also arrayed for war in truth my heart soared to meet them command me lord i said follow me he said as his arms embraced me and he crushed me against his chest just those two words and my fate was sealed again miltiades had had a bad season and hed lost two ships in the fighting he had three ships on that beach his own with paramanos of cyrene as his helmsman whom i embraced like a brother cimon with a long low trireme hed taken himself and stephanos of chios a man my own age who had served under me every step of the ladder and now had my own storm cutter take command miltiades said as i embraced stephanos i looked at stephanos he shook his head i cant afford to run a warship yet he said it was true it took treasure to keep a ship at sea scraped clean and full of willing rowers i turned to miltiades all my money gone i asked id left him my treasure when i went back to the farm the athenian shrugged ill repay you he said its been a bad season weve been fighting medes and not taking ships more losses than gold darics he shrugged i lost two ships in the euxine i need captains who told you i was on delos i asked curious not even angry fate is fate i did idomeneus said he stepped out from the crowd of rowers as if produced by the machine in a play i came to athens with a wagon of goods and a corpse aristides took it all off my hands and told me to follow you he grinned i thought you were going back to the real world whos tending to the shrine i asked ajax who served against us in asia and styges he said my hypaspist had an answer for everything i nodded will you be helmsman i asked stephanos he grinned captain my marines i asked idomeneus he grinned too i didnt grin i sighed wondering why it was so easy to fall back into a life i thought id put behind me wondering why the god who asked that i avoid killing men would send me back to the life of a pirate but before the sun slipped any farther down the horizon our stern was off the beach and we were at sea we werent particularly elegant my lovely storm cutter was unpainted unkempt and down thirty rowers from her top form neither of miltiades other ships was doing any better stephanos followed my eyes and nodded its been bad he said artaphernes is no fool that i knew and hearing his name brought to mind the messenger id left waiting in the courtyard of my house in plataea i turned to idomeneus did you stop by my home before rushing after me i asked of course lord he said where do you think i got the wagon or all the bronze any messages i asked he laughed despoina penelope says that if you make money you had better send some home hermogenes says that hell sit this one out and heres a message from the satrap of phrygia he held out an ivory tube slyly knowing that he was causing me a certain consternation i took it inside was a letter from artaphernes inviting me to come and serve him as a captain at a rate of pay that made me gasp i knew he would remember me i had saved his life and he had saved mine this was the message i had spurned in plataea as i contemplated the ways of the gods a single curl of milkwhite parchment fluttered in the breeze peeking out of the scroll tube i almost missed it and when i saw it i plucked at it and it escaped me and flew away but idomeneus trapped it against the mast on it in a strong hand was written some men say a squadron of ships is the most beautiful but i say it is thou who art beautiful come and serve my husband and be famous briseis that night we landed on an empty beach on the south coast of myconos after we had eaten cold barley and drunk bad wine i approached miltiades hear anything of briseis i ventured im sure i asked with the attempt at casual disinterest for which the young strive when they really want something your sweetheart is married to artaphernes he said he shook his head and made as if to rest it in the palms of his hands too weary to go on he was mocking me shes always by his side or so i hear cimon nodded she wanted to be the queen of ionia he said it seems shes chosen her side and her brother is no longer with the rebellion either hes been restored to all his estates in ephesus she may have been the price of his return to the fold i didnt weep i took a deep breath and drank more wine good for her i said though my voice betrayed me and cimon was a good man and let it rest whats the plan i asked miltiades after some time had passed we do what we can to rebuild the tyrant of the chersonese said we prey on their shipping and use the proceeds to rebuild my squadron and then we retake some of the towns on the chersonese youve lost all the towns i asked cimon stepped between his father and me arimnestos he said this is it this is all we have he put his arm around my shoulder and unless we convince athens to get off its arse and help miletus will fall and the persians will win everything when i had left miltiades he had four towns and ten triremes i nodded well i said i guess theres a lot of work to do morning found us at sea south of myconos our sails full of wind as we bore north by east for chios now the heart of the rebellion and the only island on the coast whose harbours were open to us about the time the sun rose clear of the sea stephanos spotted a sail on our bow we watched it incuriously until it stood clear of the water with a hull beneath it and then i recognized my phoenician slaver i closed with miltiades stern to stern see that ship i said phoenician slaver full of iberians to be delivered to artaphernes i remember grinning it was as if the god had sent this gift to me legitimate prize of war i shouted not that we were ever too precise about such stuff any phoenician was fair game miltiades whooped yours if you can catch him he shouted and i was away october is not the best month for a long chase in the ionian sea october is the month when the winds change and the rains become cold and poseidon starts to reckon on his tithe of ships but it was a beautiful day with a golden sun in a dark blue sky and id spent fifteen days on that dark hull his oarsmen hated the slaver and he was undermanned like all men who made a profit selling their oarsmen on the other hand the ship carried more sails than i could and his hull had a finer entry storm cutter had started his life as a phoenician heavy trireme and nothing in his build was for racing even fully crewed he was not the fastest he had one great point he was strong i took storm cutter to windward under oars as if i was departing the rest of the squadron heading north across the wind for thrace when i was over the horizon the sun was already high in the sky and now i put my oarsmen to work pulling hard while the sails were up so that we piled speed on speed sometimes this works but this particular set of oarsmen not the same men id left in this hull ill add werent up to it and in the main their oars served only to slow the rush of water down our side i cursed and put the wind directly aft the wind was stronger than it had been in the morning and the sky at my back was growing dark and many of my oarsmen were muttering all afternoon we raced along until i had to brail up the mainsail to keep something from carrying away and still we had no sight of our prey or even of miltiades now i feel like a fool i said quietly to stephanos he made a face we should be up with them now he said i couldnt figure it out we lost time on our first leg i said but unless he turned south miltiades made chase as soon as we went over the horizon idomeneus said he needs rowers too i grunted id forgotten what a rapacious bastard my lord was pushed him south and didnt catch him i added can we stay at sea with this crew i asked stephanos what in the dark he shook his head no all the good men ran or took their treasure and walked or theyre dead nobody wants to tell you this but your friend archilogos of ephesus he came against us with eight ships caught us beached and made hay i had a hard time seeing archilogos one of the founding voices of the ionian revolt as a servant of artaphernes who had cuckolded his father and shamed his mother on the other hand his father had been a loyal servant of the king of kings before the little incident of his mothers adultery you escaped i asked i had storm cutter off the beach we were washing the hull when your friend came i lost most of my rowers he was ashamed so what i said you saved the ship stephanos turned his head away not the view of everyone concerned he said bitterly we beached for the night and i went from fire to fire getting to know my rowers there were half a dozen men i knew a couple of survivors of the stormtossed days of my first command and they were happy to see me a few former slaves id freed for a years rowing now rowing as free men for wages the rest were riffraff i watched them land the ship at the edge of night and almost get her broached in the surf i was angry but instead of showing my anger i walked around and talked i offered them an increased wage on the spot that helped a little next day we rose with the last light of the moon and we were away before rosyfingered dawn touched the beach we rowed on an empty sea bearing north and east the wind was fitful and the clouds to the north were thickening and looked like a shoreline in the sky an angry dark purple the oarsmen muttered as they rowed about noon the sun vanished behind a wall of cloud and stephanos spoke up from the steering oars time to beach navarch he said formally i shook my head lots of time stephanos a little chop wont slow us this is when we gain on miltiades i had abandoned any thought of my chase now i was just aiming to get back with the squadron or at least get into chios on the same day by midafternoon we were out in the deep blue between samos and chios the sky to the north and east was that terrifying dark bluegrey so dark as to approach black and the sky over the bow was distant and bright like a line of fire id misjudged my landfall or misjudged the rate of our drift on the wind chios was over there past the bow somewhere it should have been a low line punctuated by mountains with the islands coast inviting me in for the night i couldnt understand we were hurtling along as if pushed by the very fist of poseidon and yet i wasnt up with chios yet the muttering of the oarsmen grew we didnt have a proper oar master and we needed one if only to protect them from me i missed this i shouted over the wind take in the mainsail and strike the mainmast down on deck under the boatsail alone we ran into the line of fire the sun began to set red and the dark clouds behind us swallowed the red light and looked more ominous yet just against the white line of the last of the good weather my lookout spotted the hull of our slave ship he had his masts down and his oarsmen rowing for all they were worth he was more afraid of the storm than of pirates we came up on him fast as our boatsail was enough in that wind to throw foam and spray right over the ram in our bow and on to the rowers who sat silently cursing their fates and looking at the madman who stood in front of the helm i summoned idomeneus aft well have to take him fast i said well strip him of rowers and add them to our own and then well live the night idomeneus shook his head in admiration i thought youd gone soft he said dont kill the iberians i said i poured a libation to poseidon for his gift because i knew that it was no seamanship of mine that had caught the fast slaver when we were five or six stades astern of our prey and the storm line was visible behind us a long line of rain flowing in the last light of the sun the phoenician changed tactics and raised his boatsail but poseidon accepted my libation and spat the slavers back before it could be sheeted home his boatsail whipped away on the wind the ship yawed badly and we gained a stade who knows what happened in the last moments as we closed he was a slaver and most of his rowers were slaves and one of the slaves had a knife a wickedly sharp ravens talon by the time idomeneus went aboard the deck crew was dead and the iberians were loose severed ropes hanging from their ankles and their leader had an axe and was cutting their fetters the phoenician was pinned to the mast with a knife through his chest we left him there because sometimes poseidon likes a sacrifice i took every extra slave out of that ship that i could left them undermanned but not desperate and set them a landfall stephanos stepped up he was chian and he wanted his reputation back theyll die in the dark he said send me aboard and give me a handful of marines and ill get them through the night idomeneus nodded do it i said i stepped across to my new ship even as the rain began i walked down the main deck and touched hands with a few of the iberians meeting their eyes and nodding at the men i remembered from my trip to delos and many nodded back a couple smiled the dangerous one clasped my hand hard testing me and then threw an arm around me aft of the mast a voice spoke up in doric by the gods arimnestos get me out of here it was the blasphemer philocrates i leaned down you want to be thrown over the side no i want fuck get me out of here he was pleading you want to live i said row harder i laughed at him pray i suggested the iberian on the opposite bench showed me his teeth fucking coward he said i pointed at the iberian if you dont row these men will certainly kill you i said now rationally you must know that if you do row you may live through the night i stepped up on the bench stepped up again to the rail and balanced there as the swell raised the stern but i dont have to be an aspiring priest isnt that what you called me to suggest that this might be a good time to examine your relationship with the gods i leaped down from the rail into the midship of storm cutter feeling immensely better the storm was coming in behind us but i had done my service for the god and i knew i could weather the storm we turned north and rowed all night and we constantly lost sight of the other ship and as often found him again so that the first fretful grey light shot with lightning found the eyes over his ram just a short stade to windward and about the time that dawn was shining somewhere it was a grey morning for us and lashed with rain i swung the great steering oars to starboard to put the wind astern i could see a great rock the size of a castle or the acropolis rising from the water to starboard and i thought that i knew where we were somehow we had come two hundred stades north of our target and we were off the west coast of lesbos that rock marked the beach of eresus where sappho had her school best of all the beach there was wide and deep and the rock would break the wind and rain long enough for me to get my ship ashore my oarsmen were spent used up long since the iberians had put some strength into them and they werent bad men but i wasnt going to get a heroic burst of power from them not in a month of feast days no way to signal stephanos either but he knew this anchorage as well as i better no doubt so i waved at him and turned my ship hoping that he would read my mind i got idomeneus to come aft only a few hundred heartbeats left before the crisis go down the benches and get every man ready i intend to put him right up the beach bow first i pointed at the lights shining in the acropolis high above the beach hard to miss i waited until i saw him understand idomeneus shook his head youll break his back he said i confess that i shrugged well live i nodded towards asia which loomed ahead ready to catch us on a much less kind coast if we failed to land on the sand of eresus were out of sea room i pointed again every oarsman has to be ready to back water tell them to dip lightly so that they dont get killed by the oars idomeneus nodded and headed forward shouting as he went i hesitate to say how fast storm cutter was moving when we came in under the lee of the rock but id say we were faster than a galloping horse its less than a stade from the rock to the beach we were going too fast oars out i shouted across the gale back water it was ragged i was as scared as the next man now that we were in flat water our speed was shocking the oars bit and i couldnt see that we were slowing at all but the ship yawed and an oarsman screamed as his backed oar bit too deep and slammed into him breaking his arms like a wool blanket that unravels in the wind his failure spread so that the whole portside loom of oars began to fall apart men struggled to keep their oars clear but the ship rolled from the misstrokes and the portside oars bit too deep and men died or were broken we turned suddenly and the port side dipped so low on the roll that we took water we still had so much way on us that we were racing sideways into the beach the portside rowers those still in command of themselves finally got all their oars clear of the water the starboardside rowers were at full stretch and the hull pivoted again rotating on the starboard oar bank and the bow hit the sand a glancing blow as the bronzeplated ram caught the trough of gravel just shy of the beach and skipped along it then we could hear the ram ploughing a furrow in the gravel and suddenly the boatmast snapped with a crack as loud as the lightning and every man not sitting a bench was thrown flat on the deck as a wave picked up the stern and tossed us the kindly hand of poseidon i like to think up the beach stern first over the side i roared although i was lying halfstunned get her up the beach it was the ugliest landing i ever saw wed been rotated halfway round by the sea men were badly hurt all along both sides and i could see broken boards where my ram ought to be but when i jumped over the side my feet barely splashed we were ashore stephanos didnt even try to land he watched us and he assumed we were lost in the waves and he put up his helm and coasted by a few oarlengths offshore in seconds he was past the beach and before we had our broken hull clear of poseidons reaching tendrils his ship had gone around the promontory to the north of eresus i lay by the rope i had been hauling and cursed because the loss of stephanos hurt me more than id expected i hadnt seen him in a year i wanted him back idomeneus had his marines in hand and was driving oarsmen to work gathering wood to put supports under the hull timbers we propped storm cutter on sand that was only wet with rain and then we drove the oarsmen into the sea to fetch the ram before it got buried in stormwrack and sand the ram was heavy bronze plate but with thirty men helping we hauled it above the tide line then we collapsed i sent idomeneus to the citadel to get us help and hospitality then i sat in my sodden chlamys and watched the storm and sang a hymn to poseidon and prayed that stephanos might live the news came back that sapphos daughter had died an old old woman but a great teacher as aweinspiring and godtouched in her way as heraclitus in his and had been succeeded by another woman aspasia who now led the school of sappho so much had changed in just a few years but aspasia was supported by briseiss largesse and she accepted me without question when i told her who i was and she lodged my men and fed them i let myself into briseiss house and sat by her shuttered window drinking her wine and eating her food surely it was she and not artaphernes who had sent me that message hence she must have need of me i reasoned and not a need she dared commit to paper i reasoned with a brain clouded by eros let me add that she must need me i would find miltiades soon enough but if i could get storm cutter rebuilt i would cross the straits and run down the coast to ephesus and visit my love and see why she had summoned me the storm took three days to blow out and my men praised me openly for bringing them to such a safe haven with lamb stew every night and good red wine for every man as if they were a crew of lords the folk of eresus treated us like gods as well they might since it was briseiss gold that kept the school going and her political power that kept it free of outside control and they feared us when the storm was gone we had beautiful weather for autumn i put men on the headlands to keep watch and i prayed to poseidon every day and gave offerings of cakes and honey on the cyprian goddesss altar too anything to bring back stephanos we cut good wood on the hillsides east of the town and rebuilt the bow with two carpenters from the town helping us with the main beams that had cracked we stripped the hull clean and rebuilt the bow and found a fair amount of rot in the upper timbers i built a marine platform like a box with armoured sides into the new bow and a little shelf where an archer or a lookout could stand high above the ram i borrowed from the temple of aphrodite and spent the money on tar and pine pitch and blacked the hull a fresh thick coat so that he was armoured in the stuff watertight and shining i gave him a stripe of poseidons own blue above the waterline and we painted the oar shafts to match all in a day and the women of the town washed our great sail so that the raven was fresh and stark again in such a way we propitiated poseidon but there was no sign of stephanos so after a week of good food and freely given aid we prepared to sail away in a fresh ship i was sombre at the loss of a friend but the crew was wild with delight boys are saying their luck has changed idomeneus said i had appointed two iberians who could speak some greek to be officers my new oar master was galas and he had more tattoos than a libyan for all that his skin was fairer than mine he had blue eyes and ruddy hair and his scalp was shaved in whorls but he knew the sea and his greek was good enough and he had taken command of the portside oars during the disaster of the landing my new sailing master had the same tattoos and his name was too barbaric for words something like malaleauch i called him mal and he answered to it he spoke a pidgin of greek and italiote and phoenician i had thirty of the former slaves on my benches now id lost more than a dozen men in that horrible landing dead or so badly injured that they still lay in lady sapphos temple of aphrodite waiting to be healed or to die the iberians all viewed me as the author of their freedom i explained to galas how small a role id played and how much they owed to the gods but i was not sorry to benefit from their gratitude at any rate we heaved storm cutter into the surf and got the rowers in position as if we knew what we were doing and then we were away galas brought more out of the rowers than i had and we spent two more days rowing up and down the sea off lesbos to drill them until their oars rose and fell like the single arm of a single man then we rowed around to methymna and i put her stern on the beach and asked after miltiades and my friend epaphroditos the archon basileus of the town but the captain of the guard told me that lord epaphroditos was away at the siege of miletus i needed money and epaphroditoss absence left me no choice i had to take a prize and a rich one my men needed paying and i was down to no wine and no stores i got one meal out of methymna based on their memories of me and my famous name but we sailed from that town like a hungry wolf we ran south along the east coast of lesbos and the beaches were empty at mytilene where the rebel fleet ought to have been forming up and just south of mytilene we saw a pair of heavy phoenicians guarding a line of merchantmen aegyptians i thought as i stood on the new bow get the mainmast up i called to mal and motioned for galas who was steering to take us about we could no more face a pair of heavy phoenicians than we could weather another storm fuck i muttered they were none too happy to see us when we put on to the beach at mytilene but men remembered me there and i arranged for a meal and some oil and wine on credit miltiades credit i was sitting alone at a small fire on the beach cursing my fate or rather my ignorance of events and my inability to accomplish anything when a pair of local men traders came up out of the dark lord arimnestos the shorter one asked aye i answered and offered them wine in short they had a cargo of grain several cargoes in fact and they wondered if id like to have a go at smuggling it into miletus the rate of exchange they offered was good good enough to give me some slack so i loaded grain at their wharf and filled the ship so that she sat deep in the water and my rowers cursed were fucked if we have to run idomeneus said really i asked as if the thought had never occurred to me we sailed at sunset ran along the coast of lesbos before full dark fell and were off chios in the light of a full moon my oarsmen were none too happy with me because this was flirting with poseidons rage and no mistake or so they said i made my seamarks off chios and we passed silently along the beaches i had known like family homes in my youth just past false dawn we passed the beach where stephanos had lived before he went away to sea to be a killer of men there was a long low trireme beached there my heart rose in my chest and i abandoned my plan and put our stern to the beach and we went ashore i thought you were done for stephanos said and i thought i could weather the cape by methymna and run free in the channel with the two islands to break the fury of the storm he shrugged those iberians dont know how to row but they have a lot of guts i got us around the corner and they kept the bow into the seas and we determined to land at mytilene but there was a current ive never seen anything like it we went past mytilene in the blink of an eye and north of chios we hit a log that was drifting broke a board amidships and started to take on water stephanos was a big plainspoken sailor who had grown to manhood as a fisherman and his hands moved like an actors as he told the story his sister melaina was beaming up at him she too was a friend of my youth from the heady days when i was newly freed just finding my power as a manatarms we kept grinning at each other then what happened idomeneus asked the back of the ship snapped like a twig we sank and the fishes ate us stephanos laughed his sister swatted him and he ducked one of the rowers shouted that we werent done yet a greek fellow philocrates he put some heart in the boys and we got the head around then the wind let up for a few moments and in that time we got into a cove on the north shore it was as if poseidon agreed to let us live i put the bow on the shingle and to hades with the ram which took a right battering and weve been a week repairing her but we lived as did we i said and we embraced again i looked at his ship what do you call him i asked stephanos grinned his easy grin well we thought of calling him storm cutter but thats taken so we opted for trident the sign of poseidon a fine name he grinned again so how do we make some money he kissed his sister and pointed up the beach go and find harpagos dear harpagos proved to be stephanoss cousin melaina brought him down to the beach and he was no smaller than stephanos and his hands were hard as rock stephanos introduced him with flowery compliments this is my useless layabout cousin harpagos who wants to ship with me hes never been to sea stephanos spat on the sand and laughed harpagos had the look of a man whod kept the sea his entire life his hair was full of salt but he stood abashed i winked at stephanos it was like old times youre a trierarch now my friend no need to consult me on every raw man ive been helmsman on a grain ship harpagos said i want him as my helmsman stephanos admitted then he said i need him where i can see him i liked harpagos his embarrassment at all this attention shouted of the sort of solid quiet confidence that makes a man able to go to sea and fish every day for forty years on your head be it i said harpagos can you fight he shrugged i wrestle he said i teach the boys in the village i can take this big fool he indicated stephanos hmm i allowed well he can take me and that would be bad for discipline ever used a spear and shield i asked harpagos shook his head cant say i have ever killed i asked harpagos looked out to sea yes he said voice flat we all stood together in silence and the fine wind blew across us well i said welcome aboard were pirates harpagos sometimes we fight for the ionian rebels but mostly we take other peoples ships for profit can you do that he grinned the first grin id seen yes lord melaina listened to this exchange and brought more wine and we ate fresh sardines and a big red fish i hadnt eaten often with flesh like lobster we drank too much wine melaina pressed herself on me and i flirted with her smiled even held her for a time while standing by the fire on the beach but i didnt take her into the dark my head was full of briseis and melaina wasnt a beach girl she was stephanoss sister and she dressed like a woman of property somewhere she had a man she was going to marry and to bed her would have been to betray my guestfriendship with stephanos in the morning i gave him half the grain and the next evening full of food and a little too much wine we were off the beach rowing soft in the moonlight for miletus our plan was simple like most good plans we both had phoenician ships both newly repaired and looking fairly prosperous we sailed due south got behind the coastal islands west around samos rowing all the way and came into the bay of miletus from the southwest that is from the direction of tyre and phoenicia as the sun set in the west mostly behind us we stood straight down the bay bold as brass apparently a pair of their own ships bound for the blockade fleet at tyrtarus on the island of lade the fishermen of chios had been able to lay the whole siege out like a scroll for us because they smuggled fish to the rebels and sold them openly to the medes persians greeks and phoenicians who served the great king too miletus is an ancient city founded before troy and she stands at the base of a deep inlet of the sea just south of samos although the bay over towards mycale is starting to silt up miletus has a steep acropolis impregnable or so men used to say and her outer town is protected by a circuit of stone walls with towers the persians began by moving their fleet to ephesus just a hundred stades up the coast once they had a base there they moved in and stormed tyrtarus a fishing village with a small fort and used it as their forward base so that ships from there could easily launch into the narrow channel and catch any vessel heading into miletus mind you it is possible to row north around lade the problem is that anyone holding the fort on lade can see you coming fifty stades away and when you turn north theyre waiting and the currents around the island favour the side that holds it once the persians had the fort at tyrtarus they brought up their land forces on the landward side of the peninsula artaphernes came in person and they built a great camp in the hills overlooking miletus after a few weeks of skirmishing he started on the siege mound men tell me the assyrians invented the siege mound and perhaps they did although as usual the aegyptians claim they invented it either way it was not the greeks who prefer a nice flat field and a single day of battle to a years siege but the ionians and aeolian greeks have fortified cities and when the lydians or the medes come against them they fight a war of shovels the persians dig a giant hill that runs from the flat of the plain to the top of the walls and the greeks in the city counterdig trying either to raise the wall by the mound or to destroy the persian mound and while both sides dig the men outside make sure that the men inside receive no help no weapons and most of all no food sometimes the men inside the walls triumph boring their opponents into backing off and sometimes a single load of grain can be a mighty weapon first because the men inside the walls can eat and their hearts rise second because the men outside the walls know they must struggle for so much longer each time a cargo reaches their enemies but in my experience sieges are rarely settled by the hand of man usually the lord apollo hurls his fearsome arrows of disease into one side or the other or sometimes into both and the dead pile up as if ares had reaped them with a sword but faster sieges eat men i didnt know that then as the sun set over my stern i was twentyfive years old and i had never seen a siege south of samos and no guard ship came to look at us we stood straight on and as we entered the bay of miletus we bore up and sailed along the south coast of the bay as if bound for the island of lade we were sailing in light airs but every bench was manned and we were ready to run in the last light of the day two of their ships headed out to meet us they took a long time coming off the beach and we didnt hurry towards them oarrake and past i called softly to stephanos and he nodded and repeated my orders to harpagos whose hooked nose could just be seen above the stem of the ship we could see miletus in the distance now rising on the next headland due east down the channel theres a world of difference between being ready for action and expecting nothing to happen and that world of difference separated our ships and theirs they came out thinking we were phoenicians we knew exactly what we intended to do and when we were at hailing distance and the lead ship called to us in their phoenician tongue i clapped my hands once i remember that the sound carried over the water and made a little echo against the nearer enemy hull then every back bent on my ship and the oars twinkled in the setting sun if they had been ready theyd have leaped into action right there but many heartbeats passed while their navarch and his officers tried to work out why we were rowing so hard the lead phoenician was so illprepared that his crew caught a crab and he fell away from his course which was almost the end of my plan i wanted to oarrake the pair stephanos taking the portside enemy and i the starboard and my plan was that wed crush their oars and race through before any other ships could launch off the beach but the lead phoenician turned broadside on to us and we had no choice but to ram him or abandon our attempt the channel was too narrow to avoid him so i caught him just aft of amidships and stephanos caught him a few heartbeats later well forward and together we rolled him over dumping his rowers in the water wed turtled one ship but the impacts tested our bows and cost us all our speed and hardearned momentum and we were all astand for the second ship he knew his business and now that hed had a moment to think he was ready he loosed a flight of arrows and some of my rowers were hit but galas had them in hand and we were moving forward oars in i called it was sloppy but we had all our oar shafts in as our bow slammed into the second ship we werent moving fast neither was he and the two ships didnt have the power to get past each other as we came to a dead stop broadside to broadside idomeneus got grapples over the side but at the cost of three marines the phoenicians were poling us off while their archers flayed us galas went down with an arrow in him and my deck crew was melting men were taking cover behind the masts behind screens anything and this from four or five archers i had the helm but we had stopped on the beach men were pushing ships into the water a dozen slim hulls launching all together fuck i said aloud i remember because there was a lull and my imprecation carried clearly across the water i drew my sword and caught up my big hide shield a simple boeotian id bought on the beach at chios i didnt have my armour or my good war gear or my new helmet and i was carrying a shield just two goat hides thick even as i raised it an arrow punched through tore my hair and carried on to sink into the sternposts i ran down our central platform a running man is a hard target for archers but that didnt stop them they knew i was the helmsman every archer fixed on me and two arrows hit my shield but neither pinked me amidships idomeneus had two grapples fixed and guarded by his marines their big shields covering him and his ropes opposite a pair of phoenicians sawed with swords at the hawsers that held us fast i saw all of this in a glance and pivoted on one heel i leaped from the command platform to the gunwale by idomeneus covered for a valuable moment by the two aspides of his marines and without pause hesitation would have been death i was across the gap my left foot on their gunwale and then both feet firm on a rowers bench and i started killing i took the men who were sawing at our grapples in two blows and then i cleared the rowing bench by beheading the oarsman his blood sprayed back on the men behind him and i punched with the rim of my light shield caught one of the phoenician marines who was surprised at the length of my arms and knocked him flat and i was on their command platform hellas i shouted i was fuelled by desperation and the elation of a starving man offered food i hadnt fought like this in more than a year and i was better than a mere man thugater my shield and my sword were everywhere as if they had eyes and thoughts of their own i remember rotating my hips and punching back with my shield rim catching a sailor in the groin and glowing with the joy of fighting so well a winter of training the plataeans had not been wasted each blow each parry blended seamlessly into another it was like dance it might have gone on for ever and then idomeneus was shouting my name and i raised my hand and the enemy deck was clear i had my blade in the air and there was a halfnaked sailor under the edge but i stayed my hand as dion had asked apollo i called and let the man live idomeneus and the marines had followed me aboard there were a dozen warships in the water and stephanos was already past us rowing hard for miletus thats what he was supposed to do mal i called he turned his head and i waved at him at the same time i cut the grapples that held the two ships together go it took three shouts but he got it he started striking men with his stick and the oarsmen on the starboard side began to push against our hull with poles and spears and even their oars idomeneus was on the stern of the ship id just taken i saw him grasp the oars and i picked up a javelin that one of the enemy marines had dropped or thrown reverse your benches i ordered in greek a few men obeyed and others looked blank or mutinous i threw my javelin into one of those who was refusing his duty and he fell across his oar then i pulled the spear free of his corpse reverse your benches i roared they obeyed i pounded the oarbeat against the mast with the spearbutt and they rowed it wasnt good rowing but the men coming off the beaches werent eager to fight in the dark and they werent any too sure what had just happened either we backed down the channel first a stade and then another stade and then the arrows from miletus began to fall on the enemy ships following us one bold ship made a last try before the final bend in the channel a beautiful long trireme with a red stripe went to full speed in half a dozen shiplengths a superb crew and tried to ram us bow to bow idomeneus had the ship and he steered well so that the two rams rang together like a hammer and an anvil and our ship bounced away apparently undamaged arrows fell from the near bank so many that they were visible against the faint light of the sky and there were screams from the red ship and it fell away i could hear a familiar voice cursing and ordering men to reverse their cushions a greek voice archilogoss voice a man id sworn to protect now leading the ships of my enemies the men of miletus greeted us like brothers better than brothers wed killed an enemy ship and seized another right under the eyes of their blockade in full view of the walls and we would have been drunk as lords in a few hours if there had been any wine in the lower city as it was my first hours in the siege of miletus showed me all the things id never wanted to know about sieges the people were as thin as cranes the children looked like old people and the women looked like children a handful of the towns best fighters still looked like men they got extra food and they needed it the rest looked like starved dogs and histiaeus the tyrant of the town had to set his fighters as guards to get our grain ashore i took our pay in gold darics ill be back i promised histiaeus was a tall beautiful man with a mane of black hair and golden skin and a heavy scar across his face his brother istes was another of the same they had been raised at the great kings court and spoke persian as well as greek and they looked like gods i liked istes better he was less addicted to power and a better man but he laughed at me no one comes back a second time he called as my men got the stern off the beach but thanks that stung ill be back in ten days by the fires of hephaestus and the bones of the corvaxae i shouted to istes i craved his good opinion in those days men said istes was the best sword in ionia he was a few years older than me and we had never been matched against each other but we were instant friends that night in miletus so having sworn my oath before men and the gods i ordered my men to row we were heavily laden id filled the ship with all the women and children that dared to come with us we headed straight back to sea it was dark as pitch i reckoned that archilogos wouldnt expect me to try again immediately and i was right we rowed out of the harbour at ramming speed made the turn at the harbourmouth in fine style and tore up the estuary and the medes and traitorous greeks on the beaches at tyrtarus must have watched us go by and felt like fools but none opposed us i stood on my stern and laughed at them and the sound of my mockery carried over the water and bounced back from the bluffs above the town probably a stupid taunt but it felt good and it still makes me smile to think of how archilogos must have writhed at the sound of my laughter and then we were out to sea and running before a freshening wind all our rowers were exhausted by the time we made chios we disgorged our cargo of refugees and the people of the fishing villages fed them but they wouldnt keep them and we still had them aboard when we headed back north to mytilene i had to give command of the new ship to harpagos i was out of officers and idomeneus for all that he was a skilled killer had no interest in the sea and could no more inspire men than i could play a flute harpagos was a good seaman and his quiet solidity was the sort of thing men trust in a storm or a fight i gave him a try and i never regretted it i took all three ships back into the great harbour at mytilene and still there was no sign of the rebel fleet nor had anyone heard a word of miltiades it was as if the persians had already won i paid my grain merchants from the gold id received in miletus and ill buy the rest of your grain i said i offered them a handsome profit for men who never had to move from the comfort of their own homes and i filled three ships with grain in sacks and jars ill say this for them for all the lesbians they took the shiploads of refugees from miletus and treated them like citizens this time we sailed in broad daylight my crew trusted me now and weeks of action had made them better men i knew the process and i used it for my own ends we rowed when we might have sailed and i hardened their muscles as if they were athletes and i promised them a gold daric a man if they got us in and out of miletus again i waited for the dark of the moon and the gods sent me a dark night and heavy seas we had lights on our sterns and we rowed across in the dark with the rowers cursing their illluck and praying with every stroke but after a month of constant adventure my crew could row in the dark we went down the bay with the wind at our backs under boatsails alone north around lade the wind defeated the currents and allowed us to move quickly and the phoenicians were snug in their blankets when we went past because it was raining and winter had come but some fool laughed aloud and alerted them and when we had unloaded and turned our bows to the open sea they were formed across the bay fifteen ships waiting for our three and they were good sailors i watched them for a while from the safety of the milesian archers and then i took my little squadron back into the harbour all the gold darics in the world werent going to save me i was blockaded in miletus and it looked as if our luck had run its course the persian fleet didnt actually have any persians in it of course there were ionian greeks and phoenicians and a handful of very capable aegyptians on those beaches and i stood in the socalled windy tower of miletus and watched them to the south the persian siege mound grew every day no persians there either just slaves culled from the countryside hundreds and hundreds of agricultural slaves from the milesians own farms carrying brush and soil while fending off rocks and arrow shafts and dumping it under the walls so that the siege mound grew the width of a mans hand every night the milesian aristocrats remained confident however their city had never fallen and they still had stores they hadnt killed all their animals yet and only the lowerclass people were suffering when i was taken up to the acropolis it was as if id entered a city free of war i was bathed by slaves anointed with oil and served a meal that included thinsliced beef tongue but in the lower city the people were starving my grain put heart into them and i wasnt the only captain who got through just the only one whod done it twice and this late in the season my second cargo three ships worth saved the city histiaeus and his brother did not hesitate to tell me so my second night in the city istes led the warriors in an attack out of a postern gate and set fire to a brush pile the enemy had been preparing brush piled as high as a city wall intended to help with the last days of the siege mound but they couldnt burn the soil and in the morning the slaves were back at work persian archers appeared periodically and shot into the city fire arrows sometimes but mostly just war shafts carefully aimed every day they killed a man or two on the walls on the other hand they kept the city supplied with arrows archilogos or whoever was in command over there on the beaches of lade was not giving up either they formed a cordon every night and had small boats rowing across the channel and at least two ships out in the bay north of the island at dawn and dusk they sortied out with at least fifteen ships and i didnt see much hope for escape but on the third night the citys defenders sallied out again and this time i went with them it is ironic that once you have the reputation as a great warrior you must support it constantly i could no more sit in the acropolis while the men raided than i could abstain from eating the city was well appointed with regard to armour and lord histiaeus gave me a bell corslet and a fine cretan helmet with a magnificent horsehair plume it was a bit like living in the iliad i took my marines and philocrates the blasphemer who had settled into the life of piracy like a veteran i got him arms as well a full panoply you look like ares come to life i said to him when he was dressed in bronze ares is a myth to frighten children he said i see that a storm at sea and a life of war is not enough to restore your respect for the gods i said he shrugged you cant respect what aint there i stood back a little and regarded him there was something frightening about him he ignored portents laughed at talismans and called the gods by foul names at first only the iberians would eat with him but as he continued to blaspheme and the skies never swallowed him up other men began to accept him that said i have to say that he had changed i couldnt put my finger on why but he explained it himself later as youll hear if you come back for more of this story tomorrow at any rate sixty of us went out of the postern gate nearest the harbour it was pelting down with rain we slipped on the mud and i blessed my good boeotian boots even as the other men cursed their open sandals the ground in front of the walls had been churned to a froth by the passage of thousands of men slaves and soldiers and both sides dumped their waste and filth into that nomansland it was foul youd think that after a hundred of these raids the persians would have set a watch but of all their contingents only the aegyptians kept a regular guard most of their crack troops were cavalrymen who disdained such rigorous pastimes as guard duty and who am i to comment i never knew a greek who was willing to stand a night watch we crossed the mud and the ordure in the lashing rain and then we went over the fresh brush theyd piled in lieu of a wall around their camp no hope of lighting a fire on this night but we had a different goal in mind we werent after artaphernes if hed been at the siege he might have had briseis and my approach would have been very different indeed since im trying to tell the whole truth here ill add that i didnt feel any particular commitment to the rebels they werent plataeans for instance i was loyal enough to miltiades but youll note that i wasnt crisscrossing the seas looking for him nor was i sailing up and down looking for the rebel fleet to offer my services mind you once i was trapped in miletus my options were limited but i wasnt an idealist i was a plataean and i was briseiss lover or rather the same but in the other order but neither the satrap nor his new wife was at the siege that autumn datis was artaphernes lieutenant and our aim was to kill him his great red and purple tent showed clearly across the lines by day and wed worked out a couple of seamarks torches mounted at two different heights in the town to guide us to his tent he was a relative of the great king artaphernes was one of the kings many brothers and this datis was a cousin or some such and a famous warrior and the rumours were that when he took miletus hed be sent with a great fleet against chios and lesbos and perhaps athens or so men said no one expected us to succeed in killing him but it was this sort of constant pressure that kept the besiegers on edge and encouraged them to pack it up for the winter and head home we crept through the dark soaked to the skin squelching in mud turning frequently to get our line of approach from the torches on the walls and we crept forward cursed by men in the tents whose ropes we bumped little knowing of course that we were mortal foes i wondered if this was what odysseus had felt when he left the trojan horse to sneak into the town of troy the iliad is very real at times but no one ever seems to be wet or cold or have the flux i find that these three are the proper children of ares not havoc and panic and whatever else the poets ascribe who ever had a war without wet and cold we were in the middle of the column so we had no idea what or who alarmed the camp but suddenly we were discovered it was raining so hard that no one could light a torch and as soon as the enemy came out of their tents they lost all sense of the situation our men killed the first to come close to them then scattered thats what wed planned the milesians simply vanished they had raided the camp before and knew it well enough my marines were not so lucky and in the dark we followed the wrong men we thought we were following milesians and we ended up in the horse lines where a dozen conscientious persian troopers had run to protect their mounts our men started fighting them with no cue from me my marines were armoured and the persians were unarmed and they died taking two of my men with them persians are brave cut the halters and undo the hobbles i ordered my survivors spread out and caused chaos on the horse lines ripping pickets out of the ground i ran to the top of a low hill and looked back at the city and only then did i realize that we had the whole width of the enemy camp between us more immediately men were boiling out of the camp backlit by the lights on the city wall persians love their horses my ten men werent going to last a minute against a regiment of persian cavalrymen i thought of stealing horses and heading inland but that sort of thing only works in epics in real life your enemies have more horses and native guides and they ride you down besides my men were sailors in armour not cavalrymen most of them had probably never forked a horse i was out of ideas but poseidon stood by us horses scattered in every direction and i didnt have to be odysseus to reckon that we could escape with the herd a few of us mounted and others simply clung to manes even tails and we flowed with the horses moving west and north back towards the city i got mounted lost my bearings and my companions and spent a watch among the rocks south of the city where my horse left me the gods help those who help themselves or so ive heard it said and while i lay in the rocks watching the city and the force of persian archers between me and the walls cursing my fate i realized that it was a sixstade walk along the ridge of rock to the beach opposite tyrtarus and not a sentry on the way i took the time to poke along the ridge of rock every piece of waste ground has trails if you know where to look goats make them and shepherds and boys and girls courting or playing at being heroes the moon came up late and the rain ceased and i walked to the beach opposite lade stripped to my skin and swam to the hulls opposite really just a few horselengths well less than a stade i rose up dripping by the black hulls close enough to the enemy camp to hear the snores of archilogoss oarsmen or so i reckoned then i swam back and picked my way among the rocks as i had expected the persians had gone back to bed i crawled through the mud and shit to the walls of the town and wasted another half an hour persuading the sentry to let me climb the wall without gutting me oh the romance of siege warfare i was the last man back from the raid and my sword had not left its scabbard there were men in the upper city who were of a mind to laugh at me i let them laugh i was no longer a hotblooded boy and i didnt need a blood feud in the town i wanted to take my gold and go although i was keen to show istes what i was made of hed killed three persians and brought in their bows and arrows as proof i slept well enough in the morning i ate honeyed almonds in the upper city and took a long bath to kill the smell of the mud histiaeus and istes joined me your men accomplished a miracle he said not a slave is working on the siege mound today theyre all out searching for the horses he smiled grimly we didnt get datis but we hurt them a deserter says we killed fifteen persians and some others i nodded none of this interested me much this war of tiny increments was not something i could really appreciate to me the city looked doomed and i wanted out before i was sold into slavery again will you raid again tonight i asked he shook his head even he the bestfed warrior in the city had circles under his eyes like shield bags and the lines on his face were as deep as newploughed furrows no he said weve been out two nights in a row we cant keep it up the fighters are exhausted the real fighters the men of worth his eyes flicked to istes who also looked like a man at the edge of exhaustion im leaving tonight i said he shook his head i dont recommend that he said mind you if you stay much longer ill be selling you your grain id appreciate a dozen of your archers to help me get clear i said id bring them back on my next trip you plan to shoot your way out istes asked archers are our most valuable troops he shrugged you are the best friend this city has made in many months but the loss of ten archers would be a blow i understand but i need the archers for my diversion and ill leave you a trireme as surety the phoenician i took on my way in i pointed to the hull on a dark night you might use her to get some people out he shook his head in puzzlement why leave a ship he asked i grunted i didnt want to tell him as in any siege the town was riddled with deserters traitors and double agents i had no doubt well be away in the dark of the moon i said poseidon bless you then the tyrant said but his eyes flicked to his brother and something passed between them that i didnt like oh i was eager to be gone i slept most of the day and mustered all my men marines oarsmen deck crews at dusk i put my plan to them as the sun vanished into clouds and enough men volunteered to give me hope i wish i could say that they all volunteered but a week on half rations in a doomed city is enough to sap anyones morale i took my party out of the harbour sally port when the rain started we made the rocks south of town in the end although i had an anxious time finding them in the dark it is always easier to go to a town than away from it we were soaked through and shivering by the time we made the rocks and then we crept along spearbutts sounding like avalanches as they scraped the stone philocrates cursed steadily when we were on the beach opposite lade we stripped and swam clinging to our spears as best we could we missed our way the darkness was deep and there was no moon let me just say that swimming in the dark no sight of anything cold through so that you shiver clinging to your weapons is perhaps the ultimate test of the warrior men turned back and who am i to blame them we ended up on the rocks east of the ships and there was nothing for it but to crawl id explained this part but the execution was much harder than id anticipated try crawling on a rainy night naked but for a wet chlamys and keeping a spear with you across broken ground thick with brush hah we sounded like a herd of cattle but fools that we were and inept the enemy were as bad or worse i made the most noise as i was wearing histiaeuss gift the bronze cuirass i wore it swimming and it wasnt bad but when i crawled across rocks it was loud and the flare around the hips caught on everything that was one of the longest darkest hours of my life i had not reckoned on losing my way again we only had a stade of open ground to cross but i did in the end i had to rise to my feet stumbling like a drunkard and turn slowly in full view of the enemy sentries if there had been any to realize that i had crawled right past the enemy encampment too late to correct my course i was well south of my target but i could see the black hulls of their triremes just to the left shiny in the darkness i had at least a dozen men with me men who had chosen to follow me even when their sense said theyd gone wrong and now we crept across the dunes then clattered across the tongue of rock that separated the mudflat from the sea until we were crouched by the ships most of the men had packets of oiled cloth and pitch or even bitumen there was plenty of it in miletus and we built a pile of the stuff under one hull although there was no moon the rain abated while we crouched there the camp had fires mostly coals and several iberians crept between the boatsails erected as tents and lit their torches at the fires by now there were thirty or forty of my men among the hulls of their ships and we all called alarm alarm in greek for all we were worth our iberians ran through the camp with lit torches before thrusting them into our prebuilt pyre and then chaos came the fire roared up in the time it would take a man to run the stade from a few flickers of flame to a conflagration twice the height of a mans head and as loud as a horse race the ship caught immediately hulls coated in pitch are an invitation to flame even in the rain my sailors ran back and forth feeding sails and oars into the inferno and then throwing the lit wreckage into other hulls men came out of the tents and we killed them as we were the ones calling the alarm they kept on coming to us for many minutes unarmed or with buckets to put out the fire and we put them down by then we had three ships alight and my two were out in the channel already running free while the archers on their decks shot fire arrows into the black hulls a fire arrow is a feeble thing and none of them caught but it provided further distraction the enemy was misled again into believing that the fire arrows were the cause of the fires it took them a long time to realize that we were in amongst them i had no idea how many men i had under command or how much damage wed done but i knew that it was time to go i had a horn the gift of istes and i ran clear of the flame the men closest to me following and i stopped in the dark to sound the horn but the only sound i made was the bleat of an old ewe looking for her last lamb give me that philocrates said and he took it and blew a mighty blast there was the sound of running feet and we braced ourselves we had no shields and we were going to be reaped like ripe grain if the enemy had a phalanx to set against us but it was idomeneus laughing like a hyena with fifty of our sailors and marines on his heels towards the back of his rout there was fighting but so far our enemies were disorganized get them into the ship i called because the storm cutter was coming ashore for us some men took some hide boats they found there tyche favours the brave or so they say and thirty men made it away in the small boats but the fighting was intensifying and i could hear the enemy getting into a line their shields tapping against each other in the dark and the fires behind them showed me how fast they were building the shield wall the enemy hoplites were backlit by burning ships and mine were hidden by darkness one quick charge i told the men i could find on me on me i called and i picked up a heavy rock get close and throw i said put one man down and run for the ship dont stay and fight maybe a dozen men listened to me and obeyed we ran down the dune out of the darkness and just a pace or two from their shield wall i threw my rock a big rock i can tell you my rock caught my foe in the shin and he went down and i jumped through the gap in their line and plunged my spear into the unshielded side of the man next to me then the night was full of shouts fighting at night is nothing like fighting by day men fall down when no foe assails them they lose their way in the melee i turned to run and somehow found myself deeper in their line i came upon archilogos as another ship burst into pitchsoaked flame behind my former friend i think he recognized me as soon as i recognized him neither of us had a helmet on no one wears a helmet at night i knew that if i stopped moving i was dead or taken so i shoved him he had a shield and i had none i had sworn to protect him so i couldnt try to harm him such a thing would haunt me for ever he roared and cut at me with a long kopis the sword flared like flame over my head i tangled his blow with my spear and jumped back slamming into a man who had no idea whether i was friend or foe i fell lost my spear and rolled and another man fell on top of me that should have been the end archilogos called doru stand and face me and he cut at the man id tripped over thats fighting in the dark i saw the flash of his blow and heard it thunk home in another mans shield i gave up trying to find my spear or even getting to my feet i crawled and then i rolled and at one point a man stepped on my breastplate in the dark the hinges gave but held and he stepped away thinking me a corpse there was shouting behind me where id been i reckoned that the ionian greeks were fighting each other later i heard that the greeks and phoenicians started fighting many men were forced allies of the persians and not sorry to kill a tyrian in the dark i can tell you and it may be that we only lived because the ionians helped us at any rate i got to my feet after what seemed an eternity of being helpless tore my chlamys from my neck cast it at my feet and ran to the beach storm cutter was already backing water i was out of my breastplate even as i ran i cut the straps with my eating knife running parallel to the ships course easily outpacing it as it backed water i dropped the thing on the sand a fortune in welltooled bronze but a small price to give the gods for freedom and i ran to the edge of the sea and dived in without pausing on the shingle my knife still in my hand four strokes out i got my arms around an oar and called for the rowers to pull me in something hit me in the head and i started to go down i took another blow between the shoulder blades and my last thought was that their archers had got me well i wasnt dead does that surprise you idomeneus and philocrates hauled me up the side id been hit on the head by an oar and when i awoke i had a rip on my scalp and a bruise on my side as if id been hit with an axe we lost sixteen men heavy casualties from the sixty or so raiders whod started the night together later i learned that six of them turned back from the swim and remained in miletus the rest were killed two of them were marines men who had been with me for years on the other hand we were free in those days we seldom stopped to mourn the dead although it was a humiliation to me to have left their bones behind greeks pride themselves on retrieving their dead even on a raid the sun was well up in the sky before i could think but my first thoughts were full of joy joy at the cleanliness of the sea and the blueness of the sky sieges are ugly the sea is never ugly even when he means to kill you we made our way north up the samian channel and we took our time because we had three crews packed into two ships with a dozen milesian archers thrown in for good measure they were good men teucer was their leader when a father names his son after the greatest archer in the iliad he must expect the boy to grow to pull a bow eh teucer and philocrates were friends almost before he had his sandals off and they could be seen throwing knucklebones by the helmsmans station all through the day as neither had a station except in combat we stopped for meals and we set good lookouts but the sea remained empty until we were off ephesus there out in the roadstead we caught a pair of aegyptian ships with a pair of cilicians for escort or so we thought now the cilicians were great pirates they preyed on everyone but as the ionian revolt grew they took service with the great king because preying on the ionians and the carians promised the richest pickings cilicians seldom use triremes they are poor men and they prefer smaller lighter ships like the hemiolia a bireme with a heavy sailing rig and a third halfdeck in the stern the two cilicians in the distance were hemioliai their raked masts marked them for what they were my head hurt as if a horse had stepped on it and i had to sit on the bench by the helmsman and watch as idomeneus and stephanos planned our attack on the little convoy closer up we could see that the two cilicians were not guarding the aegyptians they were taking them one of the low merchant ships had already been grappled and there was blood in the water naturally the cilicians thought we were phoenicians not that they cared cilicians are against every race they ran north we let them go and took the aegyptians for ourselves one of their ships had already been taken and abandoned and he was empty of life decks red with sticky blood and already breeding flies but the cargo was mostly intact raw hides and ivory the second ship ran and stephanos showed me how fast the former slave ship really was the sun was not yet at its height when stephanos caught the aegyptian over against the asian coast and brought him back to where we were grappled to the first capture the oarsmen blessing the gods for the luck of a cargo of ivory and praying that the other ship was as rich it was laden with ceramic bottles of perfume and bales of ostrich plumes an absurdly rich cargo that made us all laugh for sheer joy we landed on the beach at chios with the two prizes in tow and the aegyptian captain still cursing his poor luck at being attacked twice in a single afternoon i loaded all the valuables into one ship gave the hides to the chians as payment for their hospitality and let the aegyptian crew take the empty ship south for home unharmed my thankoffering to apollo twentysix sailors alive who id usually have killed the chian fishermen told us that their lord pelagius and his nephews had visited and that the whole fleet of the rebellion was gathering at mytilene then we were away up the coast of chios across the deep blue to lesbos we made mytilene under a tower of cloud and the beaches were lined with ships at last wed found the rebel fleet miltiades had done the work hed gone from island to island rallying the rebels to make a stand hed assumed i was dead until he heard of my first load of grain going into miletus we were sitting in the great hall the boule of mytilene and men toasted me like a hero and it went to my head like neat wine you saved the rebellion miltiades said in front of a hundred captains epaphroditos was there grinning from ear to ear paramanos shook his head and raised his cup to me and cimon stood at my shoulder and pounded me on the back which made my head hurt there were other captains and lords i knew well enough pelagius of chios a few cretans and a dozen samian captains but there were men id never seen before one was a toughlooking bastard called dionysius who carried a kalyx krater on his shield and claimed descent from the god of wine miltiades took me around the hall and introduced me to all the leaders it was like a whole new rebellion and miltiades had done it for all the praise he lavished on me taking his ship from inlet to inlet all through the autumn wheedling cajoling and threatening the ionians and the cretans and the samians until they put together a fleet we drove the medes from the chersonese in a week miltiades bragged and you kept miletus alive at our backs in a few days well run down the coast and flush out their squadron and then well fill miletus with grain everyone smiled it was a turning point in the rebellion we all agreed next day i sold my ivory my ostrich plumes and my fine aegyptian glass to the same merchants who had sold me grain id brought two sacks of gold darics from miletus and now i added a quantity of lapis a stack of gold bars and a pile of silver to my hoard with idomeneus and philocrates and stephanos and galas and mal and teucer to help i carried it all across to miltiades great ship ajax i laid it out on the sand and divided it in half choose lord i said he shook his head you are the best of my captains he said he says that to all the girls cimon added thank the gods you earned some gold we earned nothing but abuse sailing about like busy mice i took a good prize over by cyprus but it turned out to be the property of one of our allies and we had to return it cimon glowered at his father who shrugged may all the gods bless you arimnestos miltiades said then my debts cleared i paid my oarsmen by common consent we included our milesian archers in the payout most men received a pair of gold darics and some change id seldom managed such a rich payout and stephanos and i watched with unconcealed glee as our boys went up the beach roaring like fools determined to spend it all in a haze of wine and fornication then i paid the officers galas and mal counted as officers now and they were unable to believe their good fortune and young teucer a mere archer looked at his wool hat full of silver and shook his head stephanos the fisherman was doing the same never had so much money in my life he said save it brother i said putting my arms around him youre a captain now youll need to keep treasure against a rainy day when i take an arrow or when you go your own way he might have protested but instead he gave me a serious nod and went off he sent almost all his money home to his sister in a fishing boat commanded by his brother teucer gambled when he was poor it wasnt an affliction as he and philocrates played for stones from the beach and shells but once he had money he was a terror the more so as he won constantly i put a waxedlinen wallet full of lapis and gold and a fine goldworked bottle of rose scent into my leather bag and shook my head it is easy to be rich if you take other mens wealth i had the value of my fathers farm and forge in my bag ten times over those aegyptian merchants had a year of the value of my crops in every pair of ivories but even as i grinned at my wealth i saw the lawless men on the mountain at cithaeron the bandit gang id broken and i knew that i was no different it was a sobering thought and one i dismissed as quickly as i could that afternoon we had a council of all the rebel captains and lords at boule the seams in the rebellion showed a lot faster when there wasnt any wine to drink the samians felt that miltiades had wasted them taking them north to the chersonese the cretans wanted a battle and cared nothing for the odds the lesbians and the chians seemed to me to be the only men who actually cared about the rebellion they were the one contingent that thought in terms of the good of all perhaps it was because they were between the northern chersonese and the southern cretans the men in the middle everyone argued about the loot that had been taken demetrios of samos rose in late afternoon and pointed at me this boy took two ships full of ivory but he has not shared with the rest of us he said i hadnt expected it to be honest im always surprised by the foolish greed of men and their envy i thought i was a hero i expected everyone to love me so i just looked at the fellow see something you like boy he sneered lets have a share of your precious ivory or did your lover miltiades take it all for himself i stood there angry as orpheus in hades gulping like a fish i wanted to gut him on the spot but i couldnt think of a thing to say miltiades glared at me he didnt want to step in thats what the samian wanted to show that miltiades was my master finally my head began to work im sorry my lord i said my voice low to force men to be quiet i bowed my head in mock contrition you are he said if i had understood that we were to share prizes taken before we joined the fleet i said i owe a great deal more than just two ships worth of ivory and painful as i will find it to hand over my gains ill comfort myself that at least i contribute something besides hot air he leaped to his feet what the fuck are you saying he snarled that i cant earn my keep is that it i shrugged i gather youve never actually taken an enemy ship i said in my softest voice as you seem to need to pay your crews from my profits dionysiuss great belly laugh carried through the hall sit down demetrios no man needs to share what he took before he came to the fleet as our young plataean knows full well dont be an arse what we need to decide is a strategy voices came up from every part of the hall miletus some shouted cyprus called others not a few insisted that the fleet should make for ephesus miltiades son cimon appeared at my elbow my pater wants to see you tonight he said to plan for the future i nodded cimon slapped my back and went out apparently uninterested in the fate of the rebellion a cynic would say that miltiades had spent the summer and autumn rallying rebels so that he could use them to reconquer his holdings in the chersonese and a cynic would be correct miltiades needed the power base that the rebellion offered him he needed the rebellion to continue so that when he dealt with athens he could appear as a great man on the front lines of the conflict what miltiades didnt need was for the rebels to defeat persia if the rebellion was victorious he would suddenly be nothing but the tyrant of the chersonese athens wouldnt need him and neither would the rebels further his greatest rival among the ionian tyrants was histiaeus aristagoras had been his greatest rival but id killed him in thrace aristagoras had been histiaeuss lieutenant and miltiades had no reason to want miletus to be free of siege and powerful in the east at one level miltiades wanted control for himself at another level he was an athenian and athens wanted miletus humbled miletus and ephesus and all the ionian cities that rivalled athens for supremacy at sea i wont tell you that i really understood all this that dark autumn and winter with the rain lashing the shutters and the fires sputtering and smoking and a hundred bored and angry greeks fighting like dogs for the leadership of the rebellion but i understood that all was not as it seemed and it slowly dawned on me that whatever men said aloud samos and lesbos and rhodos and miletus all hated each other and athens more than most of them hated persia so you children can see that its a miracle we ever got a fleet together at all cimon left but miltiades and i both stayed and over the course of hours of debate it was decided to relieve miletus for the winter fill the city with supplies and go back to our homes we were to rally in the spring on the beaches of mytilene find the persian fleet and crush it with the main persian fleet finished wed have the initiative and then we could act against the persian land forces as we saw fit it was a good plan dionysius and miltiades hammered it out even against their own interests miltiades had no love for miletus as i have said and dionysius had every reason to favour a long war of commerce as he was a pirate by profession but the two of them joined together in something like alliance and the lesbians and chians backed them it is odd a thing ive seen many times that men will rise to nobility out of squalor and greed especially when there is competition and worthy fellowship on their own miltiades and dionysius were greedy pirates together they competed against one another to be the saviours of greece their plan left a lot unsaid there was nothing about rescuing the cities of the asian coast rather it was the strategy of all those greeks who had water between them and the hooves of the persian cavalry it left the mainlanders as slaves it was also the first realistic plan the rebels had ever made dionysius offended everyone by insisting that most of the ships were illtrained and that we should spend our first months when we rallied together in spring training our rowers and marines i agreed with him but his manner of stating this obvious truth was arrogant you aristocrats are like children when you go to sea he said my boys do nothing but row they dont go to sea with their heads full of the iliad they go to sea to win to take enemy ships and turn them into silver and gold have you seen the phoenicians manoeuvre have you seen how hard they train their crews ever face a cilician in narrow waters can your oarsmen row you into a diekplous turn on an obol and ram an enemy under the stern no hardly one of you when we come to the day the moment of truth theres not twenty ships here that can be trusted in a close action let me train your crews a little sweat now and liberty is the prize if hed stuck to that as a theme he might have won them over but every one of them fancied himself the greatest captain of the ages fit to be trierarch on the argo it is a greek failing so with nothing decided on save action we loaded grain and root vegetables and ships full of pigs and goats and we sailed for miletus in midwinter which was thought to be daring in those days not like now when we make war in every season we were so powerful that we went through the samian channel caring nothing whether the persians knew we were coming the enemy squadron at lade had had word of us and their sails were just notches on the horizon by the time we sailed down the bay and their camp was a field of burning embers they hadnt even left a garrison we took the island and landed the stores in miletus the populace of the lower town hailed us as heroes and we all feasted together but i noticed that whole families wanted to be taken away when we sailed histiaeus frowned but he didnt forbid any of the lowerclass families to leave i drank wine with istes wine id brought myself we sat on folding stools in the agora and drank from a kylix his slave boy carried athenian work with two heroes fighting ever think of leaving i asked he watched my ship for a long time drank his wine and shook his head no but yes he laughed youre a hero you know the rules i cant leave ill die here this year or next a stickfigure girl came by with a heavy pot on her head carrying water she glanced admiringly at the two of us fine wellmuscled men and killers too whats her glance worth istes said what would it be like for you to awaken one day to find that she spits on your shadow i understood all too well but if we take too many of your people away i began istes shook his head dont say it my friend he whispered my brother does not feel as i do how do you feel i asked i think we should go to sicily and start again far from the persians the medes the lydians and the fucking athenians he shrugged i am filled with joy at every citizen family that gets away to remember what miletus was i must have looked startled at the force of his expression because he leaned back and drank more wine you asked i answered but my brother he is determined that we will meet our ends here all of us sail before he makes a law against emigration his deep brown eyes locked with mine take all the families of those archers i looked around why istes shrugged he is mad he said and then would say no more we sailed that afternoon as the first of the great winter storms brewed to the east we were the last to be allowed to take citizen refugees out of miletus the city had new heart and food for the winter but the siege mound was not any smaller and datis did not decamp as the persian army had in other winters he stayed and his men built a proper wall around their camp so that the raids had to stop and the mound grew higher i took sixteen citizen families to lesbos most of them had money and they offered us me and stephanos a good rate to take them all the way across the deep blue to sicily miltiades convinced them to come and settle in the chersonese instead and before the second heracleion we landed them at kallipolis and settled in for the winter my redhaired thracian had found another man but there were more fish like her in the sea and i caught one quickly enough with a necklace of gold beads a delicate blonde with a heartshaped face and no other heart at all she spoke lydian and greek and another language too close enough to what the iberians spoke to make each other laugh it might have been a good winter for me except that there was a long letter from penelope about the farm and it wasnt good epictetus the elder was dead some of our stock had died in a pest and she needed me to come home so that she could be wed but not a word of whom she might marry and enclosed in her letter was another slip of white vellum written in the same hand some say a phalanx of infantry is the most beautiful thing but i still insist it is you who is the most beautiful come and be rich i held the parchment close to an oil lamp and more words came through on the surface written in acid and now burned into the hide come soon i was able to help penelope i sent my gold home to her with idomeneus as my courier he went with a good grace he wasnt missing any killing and he knew it briseis was another matter it is harder when the first flush of love is past to understand what value to place on that love i had gone to her rescue before more than once and never been better for saving her in fact i was never sure i had saved her should i cast life aside crew up my ship and race for ephesus id thought about it all autumn ephesus is less than six hundred stades from miletus and on that night when id found myself on a stolen horse avoiding persian archers my first thought had been to ride for ephesus and find her but i was no longer eighteen i was fulfilling my duty to apollo or so i thought in fact in my head it was clear to me that i was one of apollos tools in the success of the ionian revolt apollo was leading the greeks to victory the constant luck of the autumn the escapes from miletus the seizure of the two rich aegyptians all pointed to the lord of the silver bows favour and in my head the needs of the ionian revolt outweighed the needs of a single selfish woman which tells you two things first that i still held her refusal of me against her second that i was as much a fool at twentyfive as i was at eighteen but i could rationalize my irrationality better so i spent the winter calling my blonde briseis and forging excuses as to why i could not possibly go to her rescue spring when it came was the longest wettest stormiest spring anyone could remember i took storm cutter to sea before the cakes were fully burnt on persephones altar and i brought him right back in when a combination of wind and wave snapped my boatsail mast like a twig we spent four weeks locked in the bosporus when we should have been at sea and a rumour started to spread that miletus had fallen but no real news came to us at kallipolis and we fretted and quarrelled with each other and my decision not to go to briseis in the autumn began to look shockingly like faithlessness we tired of exercising our crews of painting our ships of games and contests we tired of girls and boys and we even tired of wine but the wind howled outside the bosporus and every attempt i made to round the point at troy and head for lesbos was foiled by a cold dark wind demeter showed man how to plant grain and the new grain peeped above the earth and finally the sun leaped into the heavens like a fourhorse chariot and the ground dried and the sea was blue miltiades had a good squadron he had two volunteers from athens who came in with the first good weather aristides sailing a fine light trireme and his friend phrynichus the playwright with cleisthenes the spartan proxenos and a powerful man in the aristocratic faction who was nonetheless a solid supporter of the ionian revolt aristides had glaucon and sophanes with him but they didnt meet my eyes i laughed they were in my world now the athenians brought disturbing news its all but open war in the city aristides said quietly are you exiled miltiades asked aristides shook his head no i thought id come and do my duty before i was sent away without having the ability to influence the decision the alcmaeonids have almost seized control of the assembly themistocles is the last man of the popular party to stand against them miltiades sneered our blood is as blue as theirs he said dismissively bluer why do they get called aristocrats aristides shook his head you dont need me to tell you that the colour of our blood is not the issue lets defeat the persians first and worry about the political life of our city second he frowned at miltiades dont pretend you are a byword for democracy sir miltiades threw back his head and laughed i thought the laugh was a trifle theatrical but he pulled it off well enough not much democracy here he admitted pirates asians and thracians all living together by the gods we should have an assembly except that the first debate would be on what language to debate in he drank some more wine and you are a fine one to talk aristides the just for all you prate of this democracy you distrust the masses and when you need company you run away from the aristocrats to me aristides bit his lips i stood up no one has run from anyone i said raising the wine cup tomorrow we sail against the great king aristides looked at me in surprise a surprise that wasnt altogether complimentary well said he replied youve made your peace with apollo or so i hear not yet i answered but i am working on it no man can say fairer when he speaks of the gods miltiades answered miltiades believed in the gods to exactly the same extent at philocrates which is to say not at all but he spoke piously and offended no one cimon hid a guffaw and paramanos winked at me dont imagine that because i dont mention paramanos i didnt see him every day drink with him every night hed gone his own way and left my oikia to be a lord in his own right a lord of pirates but he was a fine man and still the most gifted son of poseidon on the winedark let us drink to the defeat of the medes miltiades proposed as the host we all rose from our couches and we drank each in turn aristides cimon cleisthenes paramanos stephanos metiochos who was miltiades younger son herk who had been my first teacher on the sea the aeolian herakleides who now had a trireme of his own harpagos and me eleven ships as big a contingent as many islands sent all in the name of athens not that athens paid an obol i remember that sophanes was there and phrynichus the poet his eyes flitting from one man to the next so that we knew we were living in history that this cup of wine might be made immortal we drank in the morning we rose with the dawn and put to sea we were a magnificent sight sails full of a good following wind as we passed the cape by troy and sacrificed to the heroes of the first war between greeks and barbarians miltiades was like a new man full of his mission and his place as its leader every night we camped on the headlands and beaches of ionia samothrace methymna mytilene and celebrated the unification of the ionians and the victory we were going to win our rowers were at the height of training a month trapped in the bosporus had allowed us to work them up as few crews have ever been hardened and the rich pay of last autumn kept them loyal to their oars i noted that all the athenians kept their distance from me when we came to mytilene the beaches were empty and in the boule the old councillors told us that the storms that had trapped us in the chersonese hadnt blown on lesbos the allied fleet had gathered three weeks before and sailed for samos and they had appointed dionysius of phocaea as navarch if we hadnt had aristides and the athenians with us i think miltiades would have deserted the rebellion right there but he couldnt appear petty in front of his athenian rival and we sailed south for samos suddenly we were a surly crew keep that change of daimon in mind thugater for we were the bestdisciplined of all the greeks we came into the fleets anchorage on the beaches of samos a little before dusk and my breath caught in my throat i had never imagined that the greeks would do as well i stopped counting at one hundred and eighty blackhulled triremes in fact i was later told by dionysius that at its height we had more than three hundred and seventy in the fleet probably the mightiest gathering of greek ships that there ever was everyone had come nearchos my former pupil from crete was there with five ships and the samians had a hundred miletus itself had crewed seventy leaving the city with a skeleton army to guard it and miltiades was a great enough man to smile and shake dionysiuss hand however it had been done the alliance was the work of gods not men never had so many quarrelling greeks come together they filled the beaches of samos and the persians ought to have surrendered in terror but both datis and artaphernes were made of sterner stuff than that datis fortified his camp to an even greater degree and sent out the word all along the asian coast demanding the service of every vassal that the great king had and artaphernes gathered his guards and his court and moved his personal army to miletus he was not the kind to lead from behind dionysius was a fine admiral and a great sailor but he was a poor orator and worse leader of men and his constant harping on the illtraining of the ionian and aeolian oarsmen smacked of racial superiority as his own men were mostly dorians the samians hated him they hated miltiades just as much and openly pressed for a samian demetrios in fact to take command of the fleet let me just say thugater that their claims had a certain justice they had a hundred ships and no one else had nearly that number miletus had but seventy despite being the richest greek city in the world and histiaeus declined to leave his citadel anyway even though he was the one man who might have taken command without a voice being raised against him at any rate dionysius instituted his training programme and as so often happens the ships that needed the training least volunteered to undertake it while those who needed it most the aristocrats from crete and the softhanded volunteers from lesbos chios and samos were the most reluctant to work ill say this too dionysius knew his business i thought my crew to be the besttrained oarsmen in the world but dionysius quickly disabused me of my notions of arete when he laid out a course with inflated skins i told him it was impossible for a trireme to row through it and he put me to shame by showing me how in his sea snake i spent a week training and the more of his tricks i learned the more i disliked his manner of teaching them he was abusive when he might have been instructional and abusive when he might have praised and when i attempted to explain to him how deeply he offended most of his navarchs he dismissed my criticism as a petty attempt to get back at him for his superior shiphandling youre a quick learner he said but in your heart you are no seaman just another petty lordling dont linger on the sea when weve beaten the medes boy its for better men what do you say to that i said nothing but i was searching for an excuse to sail away at least for a few days my excuse came up quickly enough i was a captain in my own right for all that i served miltiades and i attended the fleet council when i had time which was all the time while dionysius focused on seamanship miltiades and old pelagius of chios wanted intelligence miltiades had spies in sardis but no way to contact them and what we all needed to know was the progress of the persian fleet where were they did the fleet even exist were they forming at tyre sidon naucratis we imagined that the persians feared us i knew someone who could answer all those questions she lay on a couch just a few hundred stades away drop me on the beach by ephesus i said every head in the council turned i know the town as if i was born to it and i have friends there people who are no friends to the persians perhaps i can even contact one of your spies in sardis miltiades i bowed to him give me the word one of the great advantages of being a hero is that when you propose something daring no one will stand in your way its as if everyone assumes that this sort of thing is your destiny by early summer i was growing a trifle cynical about my role as a hero but the greeks were sending me to ephesus we had spies in the persian camp at miletus and i knew that briseis had not accompanied her husband to war she was alone in ephesus i set off the next day free of bloody dionysius and his seawrack tyranny and free too of the ugly competitions between miltiades and aristides and the samian leaders i daydreamed about taking storm cutter up the river to the city of artemis bold as newforged bronze but i didnt instead i bought a sailing smack from some samians and idomeneus and harpagos and i sailed him ourselves with philocrates our unpaid passenger the blasphemer had grown on me and hed shown no interest whatsoever in returning to halicarnassus to trade grain for hides and lie when he swore oaths i was born for this he said not less than twice a day and he smiled his curious smile of selfmockery i miss teucer the bastard he needs to come back aboard so that i can win back my money teucers family were snug in the chersonese but the archer himself was back on the walls of miletus and we all missed him we sailed the fishing boat through easy seas right around mycale we spent the night there frying fresh sardines on an iron pan and drinking new wine from a leather bag in the morning we were away again up the coast and past the ruins of the old town that guard the promontory beyond ephesus and in the last light of the second day i could see the temple of artemis glow in the sunset the old granite lit red like sandstone in the setting sun they left me on the coast road twenty stades from the city i told them to return for me in three days and i put on my leather bag checked the hang of my sword and pulled my chlamys about me i had two spears and a broad straw hat like a gentleman hunter i walked and no one paid me a second glance as i made my way up the road to the city i thought of my last journey up that road delirious with fever a slave bound to the temple destined to die hauling stone ten years or less separated me from that boy indeed the river of time flows in only one direction as my master loved to say in a few hours i would see him he at least would never betray me or any other greek who served the rebellion i had determined to go to heraclitus first because i loved him and because i had no idea what to expect with briseis nor had i any notion of where her loyalties would lie she must have heard by now of my encounters with her brother the previous autumn and winter in truth i was afraid of meeting her but as always fear forced me to act i can never abide to see myself as afraid and even as a child i would drive myself to do things that i feared only to prove myself to myself briseis had always seen through this aspect of my character and used it against me i heard her voice as i walked and i tasted her tongue on my lips and other parts of her too in my imagination i thought of the first time she had come to me fresh from humiliating her enemy for her just as she had expected me to and of the reward although at the time i thought her another woman entirely see you are blushing my dear boys only think of one thing and how to get at it boys are predictable girls when i looked up i had walked to our gate to the house of archilogos which had been the house of hipponax to the house of briseis i was standing in full view of the gate like a fool id like to say that i did something witty or wily like odysseus but i didnt i stood there in the sun and waited for her i suppose i thought that the cyprian one would send her into my arms no such thing happened only when the tops of my shoulders started to burn from the sun did i come to my senses and turn away i walked up an alley cut north to the base of the temple acropolis and then went to the old fountain building it was gone that was a shock in its place was an elegant construction of parian marble and local granite with fine statues of women carrying water cut so that that hydriai on their heads supported the roof i didnt belong there there were a few free women and a great many slaves and i was the only free man the only man armed and as such a figure of fear heraclituss river had flowed right by and i could not dip my toe again i fled i went up to the temple where hunters were never uncommon although i was a stranger and i was a man in a city where most of the men were at war i left my spears with the door warden and i climbed to the palaestra made a small sacrifice to the goddess and looked around the porticoes for my master thank the gods he was there had he been absent i think my panic might have killed me he knew me immediately his performance was admirable he finished his lesson a point about the way pythagoras formed a right triangle then he teased a new student and finally as naturally as if wed planned it he came to me took my arm and led me away you cannot walk abroad here my boy he said and yet i have done so all day i said that others are fools does not make you less a fool he said oh i had missed you my master he sent all his slaves away before he let me take the cloak from over my head then we sat for hours drinking good wine and eating olives he was thin as a stick as if he lived in a city under siege and i forced him to eat olives and his skin seemed to grow better even as i watched why are you starving yourself master i asked i fast until greece is free he said then eat i hugged him we have nigh on four hundred ships at samos all the cities of ionia have united and the persians will never find a fleet to stand against us no later than next spring youll see us sail up the river and ephesus will be free he smiled then four hundred he asked and ate olives at a furious rate i found olive paste and anchovies and fish sauce in the pantry and made us a small dinner with bread and lots of opson and i told him everything from the day that we helped hipponax die until the start of this mission he shook his head your life is so full and mine is so empty you teach the young i said not one of them is worth a tenth of you or archilogos i would trade ten years of my life for one bright spark to shine against the heavens he nodded but i have had my great pupils and plenty of them and the last not the least you are called doru the spear of the hellenes i have heard this name he narrowed his eyes and you think you have learned something about killing men i shrugged nothing different from what you endeavoured to tell me ten years ago sometimes the logos works one way to truth and sometimes another he said if we understood everything we would be gods not men too soon i realized i had nothing left to say he was not very interested in my forge and my farm although in his presence they suddenly gathered a kind of worthiness that they didnt have when i stood on the command deck of storm cutter we gazed at each other for a little while you wish to see briseis he said suddenly my heart beat faster i expected him to say that she was away from town resting from childbirth dead i often read to her he said nor should i have excepted her when i spoke of the bright sparks of intelligence i have brought to the logos for of the three of you the logos burns the brightest in her i smiled to hear the most beautiful woman in the greek world praised for her brain but what he said was true come he said we will go to her gate in the near dark ephesus was inhabited mostly by slaves and men looking for prostitutes no one paid us any attention as we walked together i followed him up to the gate of the house of my youth this time my heart slammed against my chest and i was unable to think much less speak my master took me by the hand and led me to the gate as if i was a young student i didnt know the slave on duty there but he bowed deeply to my master and led him into the courtyard where she lay on a long couch a younger woman fanned her and the smell of mint and jasmine filled the garden and my head suddenly it was as if no time had passed my eyes met hers and i remember giving a twitch as did she i think such was the power of our attraction in those days she never spared the greatest philosopher of the age a glance you came she said after time had passed i trembled you called to me i said i was surprised at how calm my voice was you didnt hurry she said we are no longer young lovers playing at the iliad i said we never were she returned and her smile widened by some small fraction of one of pythagorass figures we never played i nodded why have you summoned me helen i asked she shrugged and her voice changed and she tossed her hair like any other woman boredom i suppose she said lightly my husband needs captains it is time you became a great man i was not eighteen she filled me just lying on a couch i could barely breathe and yet i was not eighteen i took a deep breath bit back my sharp response turned on my heel and walked away you were never promised a happy story my young friends im afraid that we are coming to the part where you might prefer to stay home i headed out of the gate and back to my masters house i shivered as if from cold i was so angry and so afraid as i stood in my masters tiny courtyard i raised my face to the stars what have i done i asked they didnt respond my head was full of thoughts like a bag of wool stuffed to the very brim that i should go back and beg forgiveness that i should send a note throw rocks at her window kill her yes that thought came to me too that i should kill her and be free instead without much conscious thought i packed up my leather bag rolled my spare cloak tight and walked out into a quiet night in ephesus i had decided that if i could not have her i might as well test myself or die it is curious that we do our strangest thinking while we are under the influence of deep emotion suddenly i was not a trierarch or a lord i was a young man bereft angry seeking death that is love my friends beware of the cyprian beware ares in his bronzeclad rage has not the power i see consternation on your faces i can only assume that none of you have ever been in love you thugater id put a sword in you if i thought that you had you minx but listen to me love the allconsuming fire that sappho tells of the dangerous game of alcaeus the summit of noble virtue and the depth of depravity described by pythagoras love is all the gods fade the stars grow pale the sun has no heat to burn nor ice to freeze next to the power of love when she said that she had written to me from boredom she struck me with a rod of humiliation no lover can accept such a blow and remain the same i have had many years and many night watches and the long hours before a hundred fights to think about love and how each of us might have been if we were not such proud and insolent animals i think close your ears girls i think that men come to love though a mixture of lust and challenge while women come to love through a different mix of lust and wonder at their own power and desire to subdue another as with miltiades and dionysius and many others locked in a competition there is more dross than gold in the ore but what is refined in the fire is finer than either of the lovers could have made alone men come to love by challenge the challenge of sex the challenge of holding the loved one against all comers the challenge of being the better man in the lovers eyes briseis never ceased to challenge me her company never came free because she valued herself above any mortal and her favours were the reward for heroic action heroic determination heroic luck the idea that she would summon me from boredom was a mortal insult to both of us so i shouldered my pack and went down the hill past the sentries on the wall and out of the main gate the moon was bright enough that i never stumbled i was walking to sardis the persian capital of lydia the heart of the enemys power did i say i wasnt eighteen any more when briseis is involved honey im always eighteen or perhaps fifteen i walked all night and all day the next day i climbed the great pass alone my head almost empty of thought from exhaustion but i stopped and poured a libation for the men who died there fighting the medes at the last moment speaking my prayer i added the medes who had fallen there to my spear and to others my voice hung on the air and i shivered involuntarily the gods were listening i walked down the far side of the pass in a daze and i didnt stop to eat or rest and by the evening of the third day i came to sardis just as on my first visit the gates were open unlike my first visit i didnt kill anyone sardis is a great city but not a greek city there are greeks there and persians and medes and lydians a swarthy handsome people and the women are darkhaired with large eyes and beautiful bodies which they dont trouble to hide i was not of this world when i entered the gates i must have looked like a madman but sardis had plenty of them my persian was still good and i spoke it rather than greek and men made way for me most probably thought that i was one of the many prophets who afflict phrygia wandering and foretelling doom in my head i was locked in a fearful fantasy where the waking world of shops and handsome women merged with the chaos and death of the battle i had fought here in the agora i looked from booth to booth trying to find the dead men i knew must be lying there i sound mad but even as i was having these thoughts i knew i needed rest sleep food it occurred to me to hurry back to heraclitus to tell him that i had found a place where the stream ran twice that i could be in two times at once merely by running a few hundred stades without rest or food my next memory is of sitting in a cool garden eating lamb it is a curious thing one i have experienced all too often that as soon as the rich sweet food passed my lips the curious half world of battle and gods vanished and i felt like a man again i was sitting across a broad cedar table from cyrus now captain of a hundred noble cavalrymen in the bodyguard of datis i ate ravenously and he watched me carefully a healthy mixture of friendly concern and suspicion wed crossed swords often enough in the last years for him to know perfectly well where my sympathies led on the other hand i had saved his life and his masters and that means more to a persian than mere nationality he watched me eat and he put me to bed and the next day his slaves awakened me and i ate again i was young bold and healthy i recovered swiftly on that second day he was waiting in the courtyard welcome to my house he said in persian i knew the ritual so i made a small sacrifice barley cakes to the sun and ate salt on bread with him he nodded at my bag and gear you are carrying a fortune he said my gold and glass aegyptian bottle was sitting before him on the table he twirled his moustache it pains me but i must ask you how you come to be here he looked into my eyes and why slaves brought me a hot drink persians drink all sorts of things hot because mornings are often cold in their mountains or so ive been told this had the aroma of anise and tasted of honey i held his gaze and i decided that having come all this way i would behave as a hero and not as a spy my lord i said i will tell you everything and to the utmost degree of honesty like a persian and not like a greek but let me first say three things and then you may decide if you need to know more he nodded well spoken please be my guest he waved at bread and honey which he knew i loved from the days when i was doru the slave boy and he and his friends fed me just to see how much i could eat he raised a hand i doubt not that you will tell me the truth but lest you misunderstand i know exactly who you are you are a great warrior he smiled persians dont lie and it was a genuine grin of admiration i often dine for free or am given gifts of wine because i can tell stories of when i knew you as a boy it is an honour to be your friend i stood persians are very formal it is an honour to be the friend of cyrus captain of the hundred that guards artaphernes i said he blushed and rose and i saw that his right arm was swathed in bandages wounded i asked yes he sighed a petty skirmish over horses at miletus last autumn at the edge of winter i asked he nodded i was there i said he nodded i know young doru so you will tell me three things i must hear them i sat back and warmed my hands with the ceramic cup full of hot tea i serve miltiades of athens i said carefully cyrus nodded i love briseis daughter of hipponax wife of artaphernes i said cyrus started and then slapped his knee of course you do he said may ahura mazda blast my sight i should have known then he schooled his face he is my lord of course i am in sardis seeking news of how datis will fight us i said but the bottle of scent is for briseis and the money is my own and none of it is to buy treason cyrus drank tea looking at the roses that grew up the wall of his courtyard in the morning sun if i arrest you he said you will be sent to persepolis the great king has heard your name you will be a noble prisoner and a hostage in time you might rise in court and be a satrap you might command me i shrugged or i might kill you you do not deny that you are the enemy of my master he raised his eyebrow no nor do i deny that i am here to learn your weaknesses you see i am a bad greek i laughed he did not laugh i never thought to say this but a small lie on these matters would have let me sleep better i shrugged i had the advantage that i didnt care i never loved the ionian alliance friends they were mostly east greeks to me softhanded men who argued about firewood while the flames of their fire died they had great men among them nearchos and epaphroditos come to mind but briseis had hurt me and i cared for nothing but my role as a hero required me to speak instead of a lie ill give you a truth i am here as a private man i seek to give my gift to briseis and speak with her in ephesus i make no war on sardis i frowned unlike the last time you rebel he slapped his knees again i was sword to sword with you in the marketplace he looked around does she love you doru i shook my head i dont know cyrus i have loved her since i was a boy and she loved me i shook my head once she loved me you have lain with her cyrus asked persians are not shy about such things many times i assured him he nodded she loves my master he said he twirled his moustache again now i have to go off the tale again to explain that among persians adultery a mortal offence among greeks is something of a national aristocratic pastime like lionhunting so my passion for his lords wife made me all the more persian to cyrus i wasnt in a mood to calculate and manipulate but i knew that this simple truth would render my mission for miltiades almost incidental why i asked he ruined her mother of course cyrus knew it as well as i we had both been there i would say to a brother that she tastes the forbidden because it is forbidden that she loves power but not artaphernes i might have rushed to her defence except that his words struck me as truth to lie with the mother and the daughter is a sin in persia cyrus went on many of us want him to leave her i took a breath and let it go and the balance changed let me go and i will try to take her with me i said hmm he put his hand on the table i am caught between what i want for my lord and what he wants i will not be the agent of corrupting his wife despite my misgivings he contemplated me and combed his beard i find i cannot order your death although to be honest i have a feeling that would be best for the king of kings i remember shrugging a foolish response but then what should a man do when his death is proposed swear to me that you will do nothing to harm my master and that you will leave this city in the morning he said i put my hand in his i swear that i will return to ephesus tomorrow and once there my only purpose will be to see her and leave i said if your wits are quick youll see how full of holes my oath was we clasped hands and he finished his tea i have business in the marketplace he said gather all the news you like it will only discomfit you you cannot fight the great king his power is beyond your imagination i should send you to persepolis as a prisoner i would be doing you a favour but i will let you see your doom and then let you go to it perhaps you will save a few greeks to be the great kings subjects he pointed out the gate go learn and despair and leave briseis to her own end is my advice we embraced like old comrades it is odd how we saw each other only in snatches here and there and how he had known me not as a great hero but as a slave boy and yet we were ever friends even when our swords were bloody to the wrist and we swung them at each other never believe that persians were lesser men their best were as good as our best or better his permission and it was that to go and spy in sardis chilled me and i dressed and went out into the agora i passed from booth to booth buying wine at one a packet of herbs at another listening to the gossip and the news i had been a slave and i knew how to avoid being watched cyrus may have loved me but he was a professional soldier and before the sun was above the low houses i knew he had put two men to watch me lydians darkhaired men one had a bad scar on his knee that gave him away even at a distance when he walked and the other had the habit of crowding me too close afraid hed lose me i had learned about such things when i was a slave slaves follow each other aiming at masters secrets masters train slaves to follow other slaves also searching secrets out slaves take free lovers and have to hide or vice versa i noticed them before i completed my first tour of the shops and stalls of the agora and i lost them by the simple expedient of walking into the front of a taverna on the corner of the agora and passing through the kitchens to exit at the back then i walked up a steep street to the top sat in a tiny wine shop and watched my back trail the way a lioness watches for hunters i watched for an hour and then i walked through an alley spattered with someone elses urine and walked down the hill on another narrow street until i came to the street of goldsmiths i went into the second shop kept by a babylonian and examined the wares he had a speciality tiny gold scroll tubes for men who wore amulets of written magic they were beautifully done i bought one the owner had a syriac accent a huge white beard like a comic actor and more hand gestures than an athenian we haggled for a cup of tea and then a cup of wine i was buying a tube of gold not silver or bronze and my custom was worth ten days work so i played at it as long as he wanted to although our haggling was largely done in the first five exchanges he wrapped it in a scrap of fine tyriandyed leather miltiades sent me i said after i counted my coins down i should have charged you more he shot back but he raised an eyebrow and winked and put my coins in his coin box ill send for more wine i thought the greek had forgotten me when we lost ephesus we lost the ability to contact you i said he made a face i have written some notes he said and went upstairs into his house i could hear him talking to his wife and then moving around finally he returned these are written in the hebrew way he said and no one no one not a sage like me could ever read them he smiled would you like a nice spell to go with your pretty amulet soldier its not for me i said beautiful woman he asked youve been her lover for many years and she loves you and both of you too proud to surrender to the other eh i stared at him openmouthed not for nothing am i called abrahim the wise son besides its not exactly a rare story is it he laughed wickedly and began to make tiny dots on a piece of vellum he was making a pattern a tiny pattern meticulous and perfect of course he was a goldsmith and such men can always draw the persians i prompted him he peered at his work datis is forming his fleet at tyre he said he intends to have six hundred ships i confess that a curse escaped me despite my newfound piety thats not the worst of it son abrahim continued he glanced at his notes and shook his head with his lips pursed datis has approached each of the islands and all the leaders with money gold darics sacks of them he looked at his work again i saw the money caravan come through from persepolis not three weeks ago datis is determined to take miletus and break the rebellion even if he has to buy it what of artaphernes i asked abrahim shrugged i am an old jew of babylon and i live in sardis he said dont ask me about ephesus i dont live in ephesus datis comes here and his money and his plans come on couriers from persepolis artaphernes is a different animal he strives to be great datis seeks only to win and curry favour artaphernes wife is my love i said whatever prompted me to say that ill never know briseis daughter of hipponax abrahim asked he looked up and our eyes met and it was as if i was looking into heraclituss eyes eyes that were a gate into the secrets of the logos the man had seemed comic even while bargaining now i felt as if i was in a presence his eyes stayed on mine you then are arimnestos ahh he nodded interesting i am pleased to have met you i shot an arrow at random you know my master heraclitus i said he nodded i do even among the goyim there are great men he finished his work and he sat still for a moment and then he passed his hand over the tiny scroll rolled it tight and put it in the tube like most young men you are in a war between the man who acts and the man who thinks take my advice and think more he tucked the scroll tube into the red leather six hundred ships ready for sea by the feast of artemis in ephesus datis will command them gold to every lord on every island watch for treason understand i nodded do i owe you something i asked he laughed i am a jew boy the persians broke my people and i will help any man who is their foe i clasped arms with him and in his doorway he called me back i dont know you boy he said but i will try to give you advice nonetheless go straight to your own people and never see her again my scroll cannot protect you from from what is between you i smiled embraced the old jew and went back to the agora where my shadows picked me up with obvious relief i let them accompany me as i bought philocrates a fine knife and idomeneus a bronze girdle and my sister a pair of fine scissors something the men of sardis make to perfection i bought myself a lacquered persian bow and then on impulse another for teucer i bought sheaves of arrows and i bought a horse a fine gelding saddle bridle and all it is good to have money buying things makes you feel better when someone has just told you that the enemy has six hundred ships i bored my shadows to complacence and then i walked back to cyruss house we ate together cyrus was quiet and so was i but we were good companions pledging each others healths and saying the prayers and libations together you are as sombre as i am he said at the end of the meal the rumour of the market says that your datis has six hundred ships and a mule train of gold i said what did you expect little brother cyrus asked and he was sad as if the victory of his master was an unhappy event you cannot fight the great king i shrugged yes we can i thought of the beaches full of ships at samos and the training ship to ship we can take any number of aegyptians and phoenicians were you at amathus i asked he shook his head no he said artaphernes and i were campaigning in phrygia i nodded i took four enemy ships that day cyrus if datis gathers six hundred ships half of them will be unwilling allies like the cyprians and after we beat him the persian empire in ionia will be at an end cyrus shook his head it is a noble dream he said and then all you greeks will be free free to be tyrants free to kill each other to rape and steal and lie free of the yoke of persia and good government low taxes and peace he spoke in quick anger the way a man speaks when his son or daughter is thoughtless at table now i had to shake my head because i knew in my heart that he spoke the truth the world of ionia had never been richer or more at peace than when persia ruled the waves the freedom you prate of benefits the heroes cyrus said but the small farmers and the women and children they would be happier with the king of kings he drew his beard down to a point twirled his moustache and grunted we grow maudlin little brother i fear what will happen when we win i think there will be a reckoning i think this revolt scared my master and even the great king blood will flow and the greeks will know what an error they have made i swirled the wine in my handleless cup and felt persian but i had one more arrow in my quiver despite the way my head agreed with everything he said cyrus i asked when he had been silent a long time it was dark in the garden and no slaves were coming i am tired of war cyrus said listen big brother i said i was pleased i had received this honorific from him that i was part of his family he grunted a few feet away in the dark if you were greek and not persian how would you think then i asked he laughed i would fight the great king with every weapon and every lie at my disposal he said persians do not lie we laughed together in the morning i rode away after we embraced i thought about him as i came to the pass and i thought about him when i poured another libation for the dead of the fight there i thought about greece and persia while i stood in the remnants of ruined grape vines at the top of the hill where the athenians stopped the men of caria at the battle of ephesus where eualcidas fell the greatest warrior and best man of all the greeks and of course i thought about briseis about her words and her body and how often the two are at odds it is the terrifying error of all boys to think that a womans body cannot lie that her words may lie but her kisses are the truth chastity is a myth made by men to defend territory for men women care little for it or rather women like briseis care little for chastity their territory is not lessened when they take a lover but expanded they are in fact like men who are killers they have learned the thing if you dont know what i mean i shall not be the one to burden you then i mounted my little horse and rode down the ridge to the river took the ferry above the town and just after supper i came to heraclituss house he embraced me i didnt let him speak beyond blessing me in the gateway and told him that abrahim the jew of sardis sent his greetings datis has all the gold of persia and six hundred ships i said i have to go to miltiades but i need to see briseis will you take me to her again he looked at me a long time i think i dont really remember or perhaps i dont really want to remember why he asked i must see her i said even sages make mistakes very well he said she sat in the dooryard where the porter would usually sit her face hidden in the dark where her father had led me into his house where her mother had first toyed with me where artaphernes had befriended me in truth if the toe can touch the same water in the stream twice there were many echoes of the logos there you left me she said and then in a matteroffact voice and now you return i shrugged the silence deepened and i realized that she couldnt see me shrug i ran all the way to sardis i said you hurt me i added and the honesty of that statement carried more conviction than all my pretend nobility and all the speeches id practised sometimes i hate you she said i remember that i protested no listen to me she said you have all the life i crave you are the hero you sail the seas you kill your enemies when you feel powerless you turn and leave you run to sardis she laughed and it was a brittle sound in the dark i cannot leave i cannot come or go kill or leave alive it is greatly daring of me to come here to my own gate but i am a slut and a trull and a traitoress and no one will think worse of me if i spend the night here though they may think worse of poor heraclitus come with me i said so that i can pine for you from your house perhaps i could talk of you with your sister while you make war on the persians only then did i realize that she was crying but when i went to her her strong right arm pushed into my chest hard and she shook her head tears flew and one landed on my cheek and hung there come and be a pirate queen then i said she reached out and caught my hand at that contact everything was healed or rather all our troubles were pushed away for a few heartbeats datis has six hundred ships or so im told i said this is courtship she asked he has what he needs to crush the rebellion but my husband will win without him instead of answering her i kissed her being not entirely a fool she returned my kiss with all her usual passion our bodies never indulged in all the foolish pride of our minds our bodies united the way tin and copper make bronze but lovers must breathe and when we separated she pushed me away datis has more than six hundred ships she said her voice a trifle breathy i put my hand on her right breast and traced the nipple she caught my hand licked it and pushed it back into my lap listen achilles i am married now to a man not that posturing fart you killed artaphernes is my choice i really didnt care i imagined that she sought power through her marriages but i was hardly in a mood to say so my husband still seeks to reconcile the greeks to his rule but datis wants them broken datis has been promised the satrapy to be made of europe when the greeks surrender datis has enough gold to buy every aristocrat in every city from thebes to athens the tendrils of his power are felt among the ephors in sparta and he has bought every pirate on the great sea from cilicia to aegypt and libya she smiled into my eyes i need to help my husband see i dont even lie if datis triumphs my husband is the loser every time she said husband was like a blow a wound ah she said and kissed me again i never mean to hurt you like this then she pushed me away she put a smooth ivory tube in my hand for more than a year i have tried to contact you you fool artaphernes loves you he speaks of you he needs you most of his captains are fools or simple men with us you could be the man you should be a great man a lord of men she put a hand behind my head why did you take so long to come to me then i felt defeated and a fool and my love and my hate were a deadly brew mixed together you want me to stay here and serve your husband you thought i toyed with you she said incredulous no i confessed i remember it so well if only i had walked away from her if only i had never gone to see her i thought you wanted to be rescued i said you fool she muttered you need saving as a pirate achilles as a pirate come come and be with my lord and with me you spurned me when i killed aristagoras i said and now you propose that i should share you with artaphernes i shook my head trying to clear it of the red rage i had enough sense to see that if i killed briseis my life would end i have children she said softly i have dependants women and slaves and family my brother cant live without my protection you expect me to leave all that abandon my own so that i could live as a farm wife in boeotia she sat up i have said it arimnestos i love you you foolish child of ares but i will not be a farm wife or a pirates trull i have found a way for all of us to be happy the persians artaphernes is the best of men and he loves you and he is not young she smiled i have enough honey for both of you she said yes i said i had lived for two days as a persian and honesty was coming a little too easily to my lips i could see it taste it like poison you could i said and my contempt was too obvious oh how i could hate you she said i should hate you as you by your last statement have told me that you think im a faithless whore who lies with men for power and yet you love me which of us is the greater fool i stuck by honesty i have wronged you i said but i love you and i dont want to lose you through pride our pride come away with me she stood up she was tall and even barefoot her head was just below mine and her lips were inches from mine and she pressed close i have offended you but i love you and i dont want to lose you through pride either she smiled then and standing i could see her face in the torchlight from the garden but i will not be second to you you wish to be the hero of greece so be it she must have given a sign the blow to my head might have been from a rock or a sword hilt i awoke with a pain in my head like a lance driven into one eye the sort of pain boys get from drinking unwatered wine too many blows to the head can add up and this second felt as if it had fallen directly on the one received from the oars off miletus i couldnt see very well i must have moaned there he is philocrates said you all right mate they were all around me my friends someone caught my hand and i was gone again recovery from wounds is dull storytelling and not very heroic when you find that youve been wounded by the woman you love not by any barb of eros either briseis didnt hit me herself later i learned that it was kylix but it might as well have been her own hand and she was never a weak woman ares and aphrodite i cursed are both figments of the imaginations of men philocrates blasphemed we thought you were a corpse he grinned a pair of slaves brought you to the beach with that philosopher you prate about bony thief of a man he laughed even in the dark he was wise idomeneus said which was high praise from the cretan as he was not much for wisdom as a rule fuck her i muttered heraclitus told us to run philocrates said we didnt linger as you were covered in blood and he told us about the six hundred ships i had been outgeneraled by the lady briseis knocked unconscious and sent back and in my pack was the ivory scroll tube in which she had meticulously detailed the ships that would serve datis the names of the men who she thought had already been bribed so that i would use the knowledge to crush datis and help her husband i had to laugh this scene was never going to make my version of the iliad i thought but im telling it to you and i hope your busy lad from halicarnassus puts it in his book she played me like a kithara between love and lust and hate and anger and duty and i sailed to miletus with the information she provided because to withhold it to spite her would have been foolish how well she knew me i lay in the bottom of the fishing smack and tried not to look at the sun and the pitching of the waves made me sick for the first and only time of my life and we sailed along with perfect weather all the way back to samos and the rebel fleet we were four days sailing back and my head was better by the time we landed on samos i put on clean clothes then idomeneus and i went directly to miltiades he was sitting under an awning with aristides playing at knucklebones datis has six hundred ships i said they are forming at tyre and they intend to crush us here at samos in two weeks time i looked around ignoring the consternation on their faces datis has men in our camp offering huge sums of gold to the commanders to desert or even to serve the persians i said aristides nodded i was offered ten talents of gold to take the athenians and go home he said i was deflated you already know i asked miltiades laughed grimly to think that datis offered such a treasure to aristides and not to me he shook his head i think im offended he made his throw and rubbed his beard where has he got six hundred ships eh so i told them everything id heard from the old jew and from briseis they listened to me in silence and then went back to their game should i tell dionysius i asked aristides nodded you should he said but i doubt hell pay you much attention i suffered through his classes i said hell listen to me so i walked across the beach my fighting sandals filling with sand at every step dionysius had a tent made of a spare mainsail an enormous thing raised on a boatsail mast with a great kantaros cup in tyrian red decorating the middle there were armed guards at the door of the tent idomeneus spat with contempt and we almost had a fight right there but leagus dionysiuss helmsman was coming out and he separated the men and then faced me can i help you plataean he asked i have news of the great kings fleet i said and immediately he ushered me into the tent idomeneus followed me after a parting shot at the guards act your age i spat at him were all greeks here dionysius was sitting on a folding stool of iron looking like any great lord he was surrounded by lesser men no aristides or miltiades here so plataean how went the mission on which i sent you he asked i saluted him he liked that and it cost me nothing lord i went to ephesus and contacted a spy paid by miltiades and another a woman i didnt love him and saw no reason to mention briseis dionysius smiled spies and women are both liars that stung me this spy does not lie but briseis lied very easily i thought spare me your romances the navarch said women are for making children and have no other purpose except to ape the manners of men and manipulate the weak are you weak i summoned up the image of heraclitus in my head and refused this sort of petty combat my lord i have intelligence on the fleet of datis will you hear it he waved his hand datis has six hundred ships at tyre i said he has the whole fleet of cyprus over a hundred hulls as well as two hundred or more phoenicians and as many aegyptians he has mercenaries from the sicels and the italiotes and cilicians in huge numbers dionysius nodded thats worse than i expected they cannot surely all be triremes i shrugged lord i did not see them i merely report what the spies report he rubbed his beard all business now the cilicians at least havent a trireme among them theyll be in light hulls and the aegyptians light hulls and biremes but still a mighty fleet both spies also report that datis is sending men the former tyrants and lickspittles to buy some of the ionians contingents aristides of athens received such an offer i suspect other men the navarchs face darkened with blood useless children to fritter their freedom away on a few pieces of gold tell aristides hes welcome to go and fight for his new master lord aristides of athens would sooner die than take a bribe on a law case much less a matter as weighty as the freedom of the greeks i said i owed aristides that much are you another of them the schemers dionysius came off his chair how do i know these reports arent planted by the enemy eh in fact even blinded by a mixture of love and hate i had wondered if briseis had sent me as a poisoned pill to scare the greeks with numbers and threats of persian gold except that abrahim had said the same i stood my ground my lord you sent me miltiades has been fighting the persians since the war began and you pardon me have not for you to doubt me to doubt him is sheer folly leave my tent and never return dionysius said you are in the grip of some ill daimon i said we are all one fleet dont create divisions where none exist take your ship and leave he ordered screaming at me traitor leagus escorted me out of the door and down the beach then he took my arm hes the best seaman i know leagus said but the power has unhinged him i have no idea why the mere sight of so many ships it did something to him i thought your words might sober him i didnt know what to say men come to power in different ways and they react to it in different ways as they do with wine and poppy juice and other drugs but when i walked back to miltiades i was sombre and my head hurt i threw myself down on one of the rugs he had laid over the sand i thought you ought to see that for yourself miltiades said i tried to tell him about the bribes aristides said he ordered me killed then exiled on and on hes lost his mind miltiades gave me a tired smile it is odd i should have had the command but now a madman has it and yet the fleet seems unable to take the command from him and i cant seem to rise to the occasion miltiades looked at me i sat up are you suggesting i should do something i asked miltiades shrugged i looked at aristides and he would not meet my eye oh everyone in athens is so pious until the moment when the need of the city outweighs all that petty morality you two want me to kill dionysius i asked aristides looked resolutely away miltiades shrugged again i certainly cant do it neither can i i said it would be an offence against hospitality and i have sworn an oath to apollo aristides turned and met my eye good he said and suddenly i knew that id misjudged him i had passed some sort of test well miltiades said i guess were with the gods that was all right with me i trusted apollo to save the greeks the next week saw more training i had storm cutter in the water constantly working on various manoeuvres most of the lesbians did the same and a few of the samians and all the cretans we may not have been the paragons that dionysius wanted but we were a hardened fleet and the rowers were in condition miltiades insisted that we learn some squadron manoeuvres so we practised every day as a squadron and nearchos chose to throw in his lot with us nearchos was the boy i had trained to manhood son of achilles lord of crete he was no longer an arrogant whiny puppy of seventeen either he was a man now a hero of the seafight near amathus in cyprus and he led five ships he was popular with the athenians and it was through him that i became friends with phrynichus the poet phrynichus went about collecting stories every afternoon when men lay down for a nap and after he had met nearchos and heard his version of the decktodeck fighting at amathus the two of them sought me out i was lying on a carpet in miltiades tent my head on a rolled chlamys unable to sleep to be honest those days were as black for me as the days after hipponax sent me from his house and tried to kill me my head hurt and pain is often part of low spirits but i could not get the thought of her out of my head as if her image and the pain were one thing arimnestos nearchos asked i sprang to my feet went out into the sun and we embraced for two men encamped on the same beach we hardly ever saw each other he introduced the playwright who asked me about the fight at amathus and i sat by the fire and told my story when i was done phrynichus asked me how many men i thought i had put down that day i shrugged ten i said twenty i must have frowned because he smiled i mean no offence he said you have the reputation as a great killer of men perhaps the greatest in this fleet what do you say to that i thought that i probably was but it would have been hubris to say as much sophanes of athens is a fine warrior i said and epaphroditos of lesbos is a killer too phrynichus raised an eyebrow i leaned forward he was a great poet a man of honour moreover his words could make a man immortal if you believe that wordfame lasts for ever and i do you have fought in a close battle i asked he rolled his hand ive been in a few ship fights he said i faced a man on a deck once never a big fight in phalanx i smiled but you know how it is then when you ask me how many men i put down how can i answer if i cut a mans hand does he fall is he finished if i put my spear in his foot hell stay down for the whole fight but i suspect hell till his fields next season yes he nodded when i fight my best i dont even know whats happening around me in my last fight off miletus i put a man down with a blow from my shield and he was behind me i shook my head because i wasnt putting this well listen im not bragging i just dont know i fight by area not by numbers in a ship fight i work to clear an area and then i move he smiled you are a craftsman of war he said i met his grin perhaps he leaned forward may i serve with you in the battle id like to see you in action look short of pindar or simonides or homer risen from the grave he was the most famous poet of our day and he was asking to watch me in the great battle where we were going to break persia what was i to say by an irony that i have long savoured young aeschylus and his brother were both in cleisthenes ship as marines so that we had in one squadron the greatest living poet and the next they had not yet competed head to head but young aeschylus could be seen haunting the same fires as phrynichus so that no sooner did i befriend the playwright than i met his young rival this is the thing that makes the greeks strong it seems to me aeschylus admired phrynichus so he sought to best him admiration begets emulation and competition and in the same way i was already a famous fighter and men already sought to emulate me and best me never mind i speak of phrynichus truth to tell simonides was a better poet and aeschylus wrote better plays but phrynichus made me immortal and besides he was a quicker man with a pun or a rhyme than either of the others he could compose a drinking song on the spot it must have been that same week that we were on the beaches of samos and we were all lying around a campfire a huge fire having a beachside symposium there must have been a hundred men there oarsmen and aristocrats mingled as it used to be in those days we had samian girls waiting on us paid for by miltiades and they were fine girls not prostitutes but farm girls brisk and flirtatious despite their mothers hovering nearby but one girl stood out she was not a beauty but she stood square and straight like a young ash she had a beautiful body muscled like an athlete firm breasts broad hips and a narrow waist and she talked like a man straight at you if you asked for wine or some such when she played at jumping the fire showing her muscled legs and leaping high enough to fly away into the smokefilled dark all the men wanted her even those who usually preferred men she had that spark that in briseis is a raging fire i felt it too though i was only a week from my love and in that week i hated all women with equal fervour the girl moved among us and we all admired her and then phrynichus leaped to his feet and seized a kithara that one of the boys had been playing and he sang us a song how i wish i could remember it he called her artemiss daughter of course and he sang that her portion and her dowry was time honour the wordfame of man and that her sons would conquer the world and be kings and her daughters would sacrifice to the muses he sang of her in a parody of the elegies that men receive when they win games at olympus or nemea and he praised her skill at jumping fires and he did all this while rhyming inside every line so that his pentameters rolled like a marching army we were spellbound the girl wept when it was done what have i to live for that will compare to this she asked and we all applauded her there were some good times i asked phrynichus later if he had bedded her and he looked at me as if i was a child and told me that grown men do not kiss and tell which shows you that i still had a great deal to learn another night phrynichus debated with philocrates about the gods philocrates dared us to consider a world where there were no gods and he suggested through good argument and some sly inversion that such a world would bear a remarkable resemblance to our own then phrynichus rose and proposed that we consider a world where the gods did not believe in philocrates his satire was brilliant and so funny that i cant remember a word of it except that i threw up from too much wine and laughing so hard phrynichus drank when he wasnt using his head and he and philocrates and idomeneus formed a drinking club whose members had to swear to be drunk every day as an offering to dionysus i tried to make fun of philocrates for this display of piety but he refused to be mocked saying that dionysus was the one god whose effects were palpable just after the local feast of hera our navarch bestirred himself from his tent and ordered us to sea to seize the island of lade before the persian fleet arrived by now we received daily reports from merchant ships and outlying galleys and the lesbians had a dozen fast biremes and a pair of light sailing hemioliai on hand and they did what scouting got done so on the morning after the feast of hera we rose manned our ships a scene of complete chaos let me tell you and sailed in a surprisingly orderly manner down the coast of samos to lade the enemy squadron led by archilogos slipping away ahead of us we had so many ships that we filled the island the samians landed first and they took all the good ground so that by the time the lesbians and chians had landed we the extreme right of the line and the last in sailing order were left with the rocks near the fort and nowhere else to camp i was leading miltiades ships and nearchoss squadron and i directed them to follow me to the beach opposite the island the beach from which id launched my raid a year before we were not sorry to be separated by half a stade of water from the excesses of dionysius and the growing tensions of the camp later aristides was listening to phrynichus recite the iliad which always delighted him and when he reached the scene where diomedes takes the army forward and routs the trojans he turned to me and frowned we need to get to grips with the medes before the fleet collapses he said the samians have refused to train any more theyve mutinied and the lesbians are just as bad that night epaphroditos and a few of his warriors swam over to us drank wine and complained of how mad our navarch had become were not pirates epaphroditos said the mans notions of training are insane secretly i suspected that all the ionians could have used harder hands and stronger backs but they were brave and as far as i could see this was one fight that would be settled through courage not tactics besides he went on i hear the persians are on the way we need a rest i talked with him half the night and phrynichus listened to every word he said as if he were hector returned dionysius declared that we should have games to propitiate the gods in preparation for the contest against the persians it was the most popular decision hed made since he ordered us to lade men were bored restless and yet listless i felt that the ionians were dangerously lazy we were on the edge of victory and they wanted to behave like men who had already won the prospect of games didnt excite me the way it had when i was younger it makes me laugh now to think that at twentythree or twentyfour i imagined myself a hardened old man i had already triumphed in a set of military games youll recall back on chios when the revolt was young five years before so i decided not to compete in every event or to strive to win the whole competition but events decided otherwise next morning phrynichus said that he wanted to see miletus before we fought i had business there so i collected a heavy bag and a letter for teucer and we walked across the mudflats into the city slipping past the persian archers in the last gloom of morning to have a cup of wine with istes he depressed me by showing me the siege mound now all but level with the height of the wall twenty days he said care to come with us i asked and istes shook his head my place is here with my brother he said we will die here cheer up i insisted apollo will not let us fail i could see the future so clearly that i was surprised other men worried so much we will destroy their fleet and then we will liberate all of asia istes had lines around his eyes that were not there a year ago and pouches from sleepless nights he looked twenty years older than me and he drank constantly i glanced at phrynichus this is the greatest swordsman in the greek world i said istes grinned someday perhaps we can measure each other he said i agreed it would be good to face such a gifted man that is the admiration by competition that makes greece great but i would rather stand beside you as we smite the persians flattery will get you anywhere plataean he said you think well win this naval battle i do i said we would win i would take briseis as my war bride and that would be that my spearwon wealth would make a palace for her on my farm thats what i had decided to have her and punish her as well feel free to laugh i have to say that ive now fought the persians every fucking day for a year istes said if you destroy every ship in their fleet kill datis drown their navarchs this war still wont be over theyre much much tougher than that he yawned but if you lose miletus falls and the revolt is fucked you are tired i said you know how it feels after a fight he asked me one killer to another of course i allowed imagine fighting every day he said every fucking day ive been at it a year and im starting to go mad my brother is worse he was never the fighter i am and fear is getting into his gut of course you are familiar with the character of istes in the play phrynichus knew his business he was a great man and he knew greatness when he saw it i left him to study his new hero and i went out on the walls and found teucer he was at the top of a tower a rickety thing of hides and wood and stone fill just completed behind a section of wall that had been mined from beneath the stonework of miletus was so old and so good that the wall simply subsided without breaking thats why we didnt use mortar in those days mortar adds strength but when a mortared wall is undermined it collapses not so heavy stones fitted by master masons often the old way is the better way something for you children to remember theyd built a tower behind the subsided wall and i had to climb a dreadful ladder to reach him far above the battle he had a big persian bow and he shot carefully at the slaves who were working to clear the rubble in the notquite breach he seldom missed and very little work was happening he had another man spotting for him too and they passed comments on individuals as they shot them see redscarf hes got a death wish oops wish come true whitebelt hes getting ready to step out to get that fascine here he comes you missed left now hes going to come around the other side of the wicker shield ooh nice dropped like a sack of barley teucer i asked oh he put his bow down and embraced me a pleasure to see you my lord i sat on my haunches after an enemy arrow ruffled my chlamys hot work here teucer laughed this is my life these days care to ship out for the battle i asked as casually as i could manage he glanced at me shot another arrow and exchanged a long look with his spotter we cant he said after a delay so long i thought id offended him the spotter was kreusis a younger archer whod also served aboard my ship his face was marked with soot and i hadnt recognized him at first sorry lord histiaeus would cut our ears off were to hold the windy tower while you sailors fight their fleet our lord is afraid of an escalade during the seafight i couldnt argue with that it was the sort of thing id have tried myself i handed teucer a bag of things from his friends on the storm cutter a skin of wine a sack of dried athenian sausage and other delicacies for a city under siege he and kreusis ate bread and sausage as i watched i also had a letter from his wife who had wintered in kallipolis and who id sent to plataea when the weather broke with a pouch of money and a long letter he wept a little as he read it then folded it away finally i gave him the fine persian bow id bought for him at sardis he took it without acknowledgement it was just a tool to him a sign of how far gone he was in his head were going to die here he said but i know now thanks to you that my wife and son will live means a lot to me wish i could sail with you sail away i told him to stop talking nonsense that the persians were as good as beaten but i could tell he was beyond such things ive been there when the horizon is no longer the next week or the next day even it is merely the next instant when you are there you cannot see out we embraced again and i climbed down the tower thinking dark thoughts phrynichus was still talking to istes i hugged the swordsman well win i said youd better he answered as phrynichus and i walked back from the harbour a couple of persian archers had a go at us racing along the rocks above us thats terror being shot at from long range with no chance of reply we had to wade to get around the end of their lines and we couldnt move fast and i cursed my arrogance in going by day and not bringing a shield one of the persians gave a great scream and plummeted from his rock into the sea i walked over and retrieved his bow and arrows soaked but not ruined i saw teucer waving from the wall hed shot the man at some incredible distance phrynichus has that shot in the play of course phrynichus shrugged he was a cool man in the rage of ares its a little like living in the iliad he said imagine what a jumpy bunch they were after ten years at troy i said and the poet nodded i was thinking of istes he said exactly i said idomeneus claimed my new bow as soon as i reached the ship dried it restrung it and shot at everything that he could he was an excellent bowman as ive said before and hed decided that he needed a bow in the coming seafight which was fine with me after all archilogoss archers had unsettled me in the fight by the harbour he told us that the persians were coming theyre camped just down the coast he said epaphroditos has seen them later that afternoon leagus dionysiuss helmsman came across in a skiff and went to miltiades for permission to hold the games on our beach we were delighted and miltiades and aristides competed to build fires lay out courses and prepare an altar and sacrifices the next day dawned grey with weather threatening from the west but the athletes came across in boats and more than a few swam the halfstade in their exuberance arrogance or poverty miltiades acted as host and he and dionysius sat together in apparent camaraderie made sacrifices with the priests and watched the competitions as if they were brothers all of us were delighted by this display of propriety we were further delighted when the men of miletus sent a contingent to compete led by histiaeus and his brother istes they too sat under the great red awning that miltiades had set up and watched the competitions were in order the onestade run the twostade run the javelin throw for distance the throw for accuracy the discus archery for accuracy the run in armour the hoplitodromos the pankration the fight in armour i had intended to enter only the fight in armour but as i lay on my bearskin by the awning where the judges watched young sophanes of athens came up naked and glistening with oil and squatted next to me you are the most famous man as a fighter in this host he said he gave me a shy smile we had not been friends since i killed the thug in athens i want to compete against you these ionians most of them are hardly fit wait until you run against my friend epaphroditos i said but his desire was genuine i he paused and looked around i think that i blamed you that i had killed a man it made me feel he stopped blushed and looked at the ground between his feet i nodded it made you feel greater and less than a man yourself eh you slaughtered that thief like a lamb and made me look like a boy he shrugged i am a boy but i want to win today and i want to win against the best the noblest and i came to say that i wronged you over the killing i didnt like what i had done i made that part of you nicely put i said goodness he was earnest and polite and handsome and probably brave and morally good to boot he made me feel old at twentythree but i have spent a year coming to terms with killing what i did that day was ill done i dont regret the man i killed in the fight but the man in the cellar what aristides says is true that was murder i have spent a year atoning to lord apollo and all the gods for my hubris sophanes grinned then you should run lord competition is a sacrifice to the gods what could i do he was right besides he made me feel like a slacker so i pulled my chlamys over my head and idomeneus came up with my aryballos oiled me and smacked me on the back about time you got off your arse he growled he was very tender of my reputation which in a way was his as well a word about exercise though i normally try not to drone on about how much time i spent on my body every day still do when we were at sea i rowed at least an hour a day with the oarsmen the pyrrhiche of plataea included a set of exercises with an aspis and i did that portion of the dance every day lifting the shield over my head and moving it back and forth across my body on a full exercise day i would run eighteen to twenty stades and lift heavy stones in the way that calchas taught me at the tomb of leitos in addition i would practise against one of my marines with a wooden sword some days against all of them my favourite sparring partner had become philocrates he was by no means the best of them but he fought hard and had long arms and was a dangerous opponent with surprising inventiveness at any rate i tell you this so that you wont think that i went soft between bouts of combat none of us could afford to be soft in those days when freedom from slavery depended on your ability to cut a rival down i made the final heat in the onestade run and again in the twostade run where i finished second to my own delight sophanes won the onestade and finished behind me in the twostade which epaphroditos won i was surprised and pleased to see stephanoss cousin harpagos run well in both events he was by virtue of his position a gentleman now and he rose to it some men cannot i shared a canteen with him and epaphroditos after the second heat we laughed together and told each other that we were still the men we had been five years before stephanos placed well in the javelin throw for distance and i lost the throw for accuracy by the width of a finger i think it was at this point that i recognized i might win for those of you who have drunk the heady wine of victory you know this moment when you start to pull away from the pack the next contest was a surprise as philocrates my philocrates won the discus throw with his first throw a throw so far and so mighty that much bigger men simply shook their heads and declined to throw they put the olive wreath on his head before the last men had thrown and men said the gods had filled him which made me laugh but the victory made him a different man openfaced and beaming with good will i have no idea where that throw came from he said im still not sure it was me have you made your victors offering i asked no he said do not forget i said blaspheme in private if you like but if you serve on my ship you make public obeisance when you are in command you are always in command children even when a man you call friend wins at the games it pleased me to do well but as commander it pleased me more that many of my people were also doing well i walked around and congratulated them the sun was still high in the sky and the judges declared an hours rest for all competitors then the archery started the lesbians had several fine archers and the samians had one asclepius whose shots were so strong that i didnt think he could be beaten most mens arrows lofted into the target at fifty paces but asclepiuss arrows flew straight as if shot from apollos bow but as a group the cretans were the best i was out in the first round i can shoot a bow but not with archers like these teucer was there and he shot patiently and seriously he just made the first cut and went on to the second round the lowestranked man there in the second round he had to shoot against asclepius that was a bout to see every arrow thudding home into the stretched hide at fifty paces every shot inside the charcoal marking of the highest score none of us had ever seen shooting like this the judges sent both men to the third round with the issue undecided idomeneus also went to the third round and one lesbian an archer in service to epaphroditos the four of them poured libations and drank wine together and then the target hides were moved to one hundred paces at that distance even asclepius had to loft his arrows he shot first and hit the charcoal every time idomeneus was next and he placed two of his three arrows within the charcoal but the third was caught by a flutter of breeze and sailed high over the target we all sighed together and idomeneus bowed and was applauded by two thousand men out of the competition but with great honour the lesbian shot next and only hit the charcoal once he too received the applause of the whole army finally teucer stood to the line he shot all three arrows so fast that a man who turned his head to speak to his neighbour might have missed the whole performance and every shot went home in the charcoal now there was open argument about how to carry on whether to award both men or to move the target miltiades rose to his feet and held up the baton of the judges for the honour of lord apollo we will have both of these men shoot again he said although we deem both worthy of holding the prize there was much applause and the hides were moved to one hundred and fifty paces at that range a bulls hide is smaller than the nail on your little finger a moments inattention and your arrow drops short at a hundred and fifty paces a man with a greek bow must aim it at the heavens to drop the arrow into the target it was teucers turn to shoot first he used the persian bow i had brought him which pleased me he shot one arrow as directed and it hit the charcoal we roared for him asclepius took a long time with his shot by his own admission the samian was an expert at close flat shooting and he didnt excel at the long shots he waited patiently for the breeze to die there was no rule against it i drank water suddenly without warning asclepius lifted his bow and shot his arrow went high very high and came down at a steep angle into the target dionysius proclaimed it in the charcoal and we roared again this was competition dear to the gods i remember slapping phrynichus on the back and saying that now he had something to write about and then an arrow came from behind us it lofted high over the spectators and the red awning where the judges sat and it plummeted to earth like a stooping falcon to strike the target just a few feet from where dionysius stood he leaped in the air and stumbled away because i was near the awning drinking water i turned and saw the archer who had shot from at least two hundred and fifty paces in fact i counted later two hundred seventy paces his shot hit the charcoal he raised his bow in triumph gave a long war cry and ran he was a persian he must have slipped over the mudflats while we all watched the competition he killed no greek he shot further and better miltiades awarded him the prize an arrow fletched in gold we roared our approval even teucer and asclepius both of whom had shot like gods but later much later i saw teucer pace off the distance night was falling and he thought that no man watched him he raised his bow and his shaft fell true but a fist of breeze moved it and later he told me that he missed the charcoal by the width of his hand we were elated by the shooting the sort of heroism in which any greek and apparently any persian might take joy i put on my armour with some trepidation it wasnt really mine it was a good bronze bell cuirass that miltiades had given me and while i liked it it lacked the flexibility and lightness of the scale cuirass i had won in my first games a cuirass that was hanging on its wooden form in my hall in plataea with my shield and my war spears a bronze cuirass never seems to fit just right over the hips it flares there so that the hips have full play in a long run but that same flare makes a waist where much of the weight of the armour is borne just over the hard muscles of the stomach and that can make running uncomfortable worse by far is running in illfitting greaves they snap over the lower leg covering a warrior from the ankle to the knee and if they are too big they slip and bite your arches and if they are too small they pinch your ankles and leave welts that bleed even in one stade id spent all my spare time fitting and refitting those greaves a plain pair in the cretan style worn over linen wraps it was a strong field epaphroditos sophanes stephanos aristides himself lord pelagiuss nephew nestor nearchos of crete and his younger brother neoptolemus sophanes friend glaucon and dionysius of samoss son hipparchus a fine young man without his fathers arrogance he was next to me in the first heat and i made the mistake of giving way at the first step i never caught him but i placed second and went on to the next round the men i named had all gone on in their rounds we were down to two eights and the men running were the heroes of our army the champions of the east greeks and their allies i was proud just to run with them i drank water pissed some of it away and lined up the aspis on my arm as heavy as lead after just one race i was between epaphroditos and aristides chatting with both waiting for miltiades to start us when the cry went up the persian fleet was sailing around the point their fleet was immense and it came and came and came they crossed the bay under sail and put in to the beaches at the foot of mycale and i stood on the shore and counted them five hundred and fiftythree ships first to last biremes and hemioliai included just two hundred more ships than we had including all of our lighter ships on the other hand the cyprians sailed like fools and the aegyptians were so wary that they edged away from us though we didnt launch a single ship we took it as an omen that the persians had come while we competed we watched them and we laughed and called out to them to come and join us and then as if by common consent we turned our backs on their display of imperial power and went back to our athletics i remember that walk away from the shore because i hated the aspis i had on my arm an awkward thing with a badly turned bowl and an illfitting bronze porpax i still had the cheap wicker boeotian i had purchased on the beach at chios a year before a far less pretty shield with a splitash face and a plain leather porpax but it weighed nothing in those days there was no rule about competitions and shields and besides the boeotian was in fact the shield i would carry to fight i dropped my heavy aspis on my blanket roll picked up my boeotian and trotted to the start line aristides looked at my shield with interest surely that big thing will impede your running he said i shrugged it weighs less on my arm i said i seem to remember that you beat me in this race four years ago he said i grinned luck my lord good fortune aristides smiled you are rare among men arimnestos most men would tell me that they were about to beat me again i shrugged watching miltiades go to the start line in a few heartbeats we will know i said epaphroditos laughed listening to you two is like an education in arete he said me ill just run my best but for the record aristides he may have beaten you in this race he grinned and his teeth sparked but i beat him as i remember we all laughed i remember it well the eight of us laughing in all the long war there were a few moments like that that sparkled like bronze in the sun we werent fighting for our lives we werent freezing cold or burning hot no one was going to die we were comrades captains leaders but men who stood together later when all greece was at the point of extinction we never laughed like that there is a spartan joke that eirene peace is an ideal men discern from the observation that there are brief intervals between wars you laugh children hmm i wish i could end this story right there with eight of us lined up on the sand ready to race i remember it so well young hipparchus the samian was retying his sandals when miltiades called us to order and the poor boy fumbled the retie and ended up running with one sandal miltiades held his cane even with the ground and then swept it away like a sword cut and we were off the race itself was an anticlimax of the worst sort because aristides and epaphroditos became entangled within a few lengths of the starting line and although neither fell they never caught the rest of us and they should probably have been first or perhaps not but they were the two i had expected to have to outperform and their removal gave me wings i passed sophanes in the first five steps and ran easily knees high arms pumping because my greaves fitted perfectly in the race in armour the armour is part of the contest and my armour fitted sophanes wasnt going to surrender meekly however and after fifteen paces we were side by side well in advance of the other runners he tried to cut inside me at the turning post and i shoved him with my big boeotian shield and he had to fall back a step hipparchus running with one sandal flapping was still game and he came on past the men who should have been the frontrunners because they were disheartened by their collision i suspect but his badly tied sandal finally fell away tripping him and he went down he let out a cry as he fell and i think sophanes must have looked back and that was the step he never retrieved i ran to the finish and crossed first by the length of my leg then i had a long rest while the other heats ran three of them the final eight had me and sophanes of athens as well as my own man the aeolian herakleides nearchos of crete and some chians i didnt know nearchos came and put an arm around me this is the life he said better than ploughing fields on crete youve never ploughed a field in your life lord i said and they all laughed he was my war tutor nearchos told sophanes no wonder you are a hero now sophanes said the boy had a nice turn of phrase that was a race no one fell and no one clashed at the start line where most mishaps happen we all went off at full stride and in that final race no one had a loose sandal strap a bad shield a pebble we ran for the gods i dont remember much of it i was tired and i was flying like a ship before the wind without a thought in my head but i remember that as we came to the turning post all in a clump nearchos was first by a hands breadth but his paces were a little too long and he landed his left foot well past the post and started his turn late quick as a shark takes bait i turned inside him my light shield almost catching the post as i scraped by so that sophanes nearchos and i were exactly together as we came out of the turn and ran for the spear miltiades held out across the finish what can i say we ran we flew we were in step stride for stride all the way home and the army roared its approval at us although i remember none of that what i remember is how fast that spear grew and how nothing mattered but reaching it nothing i won because my shield was a palms breadth larger than theirs and touched the spear first nothing else rather than arrogance my victory made me feel humble and i embraced both of them im not ashamed to say that i wept as they say at olympia for a moment i had been with the gods i think that all three of us had been the rest is a blur of exhaustion stephanos took me out in the second round of pankration but sophanes of athens put him down in the third round before losing to aeschylus the poets brother in the finals athenians are good at games they train harder than other men even the spartans i passed at boxing and i watched a big lesbian brute callimachus no less and never was a fighter better named beat his way through other men like a plough through a field on its second pass when all the big chunks are broken and the bad rocks already pulled aristides caught him again and again but he was big enough to shake off the blows and continue and he finally wore aristides down and hit him hard and aristides raised his hand in surrender and then we were lighting the fires and men were preparing for fighting in armour i was tired and i suspected that i had won the games i was surprised at my own hesitation is this how cowardice begins i wondered or how youth ends but i tied my corslet back on my torso picked up my shield and went down the beach to the fires with idomeneus carrying my shield and my sword aristides grinned sheepishly at me and shook his head he was wearing a clean chitoniskos and no armour that brute almost killed me he said ruefully he grinned at the brute to take the sting out of his remark i want to live to fight the medes i nodded i felt the same way myself but i also felt that as one of the best fighters i would be seen to shirk if i balked at the armoured combat paramanos helped me into my armour and gave me a drink of wine i think the gods have stolen your wits he said fighting your friends in the dark with sharp weapons grow up but he cuffed me on the back and wished me good fortune not much of a field eh there were only a couple of dozen men brave enough or foolish enough to fight with sharp weapons in armour at the edge of dark many of them were athenians and milesians the fewer the men the greater the honour i said but i remember giving him a sarcastic grin to go with the line from pindar i faced aeschyluss brother in the first round and he hit hard cutting pieces from the oak rim of my shield but i ticked him in the pectoral under his sword arm on our third engagement drawing blood from a place that showed when he overexposed his side in a long sweeping cut the cut itself was under his armour and i had to make him take the breastplate off to show it and he was as surprised as dionysius i was awarded the victory and the young man apologized for doubting my word i had a long rest and my muscles started to stiffen before my second bout which was against another athenian sophanes of course he was good fast light on his feet careful he wanted to dance i faced him with the opposite strategy i stood my ground barely reacting offering nothing allowing him to dance while i waited with bovine patience there isnt much to hit on a man wearing greek armour and greaves and fighting behind an aspis or a boeotian i stood my ground backing from his wilder rushes and waited him out after a number of engagements some men were booing me because i was so dull my blade licked out and cut him on the bicep and it was over you fight like an old man miltiades said to me i plan to be one i said which got a good response most men felt i had won the games by that time and my friends began to gather dumping wine on my head kissing me or throwing their arms around me epaphroditos and two of his men picked me up carried me to the edge of the water and threw me in then a small crowd came and fished me out and i cursed them for the effect on my armour the third round was just two of us too many bouts resulted in double hits or real wounds and knocked both men out of the competition in our rules then a double hit disqualified both men so it was me and istes he was reputed to be the greatest swordsman in greece so was i it was still bright enough to fight and we had fires lit on either side of us and i think almost every man in the fleet was on that beach for our fight if i had thought i had wordfame before that fight i realized that every oikia in greece would know me after this when we faced each other we reached out our blades and touched them together istes grinned under his helmet and i grinned back lets show them what excellence is he said what can i say he was a great man both of us must have decided the same thing to dispense with the slow testing that most swordsmen employ in a bout when dionysius lowered his spear we closed instantly and the crowd roared i threw three blows in as many heartbeats and he fought back a blur of motion and our swords left sparks in the air then we circled apart and neither of us was touched and the crowd roared as if by consent we closed again immediately and this time i launched a combination an overhead cut to draw his shield and then a punch with my shield rim and a backcut to score on his thigh i have no idea what he planned but our shields struck rim to rim a jar like an earthquake up your arm and my backcut fouled with his overhead cut as i turned my body i kicked out with my right foot as we both rotated on our hips and i caught him behind the knee luck i suspect and he went down rolling away he rolled right over his aspis something that up until then i had never seen a man do and came to his feet a horselength away if i had thought the crowd loud before they were a force of nature now we saluted each other and charged shield to shield both of us cut high and our blades rang together backcut forecut for the third time we fell back and still neither of us bore a wound i had never faced anyone like him he was as graceful as a dancer and as fast as me with arms as long as mine our next engagement was as cautious as the first three had been heroic and we both tried countercuts at each others wrists he was a bit faster and he could do a wrist movement i had never seen a roll of the blade that caused a direction change so fast i couldnt believe calchas hadnt known it i gave ground at his next rush and tried a complex feint to get a cut at his shoulder the same combination id used so successfully against sophanes instead we had a chaotic muddle as he was feinting into my feint both of us closed our shield rims slipped inside each other and suddenly we were chest to chest i rotated on my hips to get away and saw my opening as i stepped back i kicked with my left foot straight to his hip and he leaned out went flat on his back and the tip of his sword caught me on the sandal he was down and i stepped over him hed gone down on his shield he was mine but he was grinning well fought brother he said then i felt the coldhot of a cut on my ankle but my head resisted it for a heartbeat im proud to say that no man would ever have seen that wound i wore spartan shoes as i always did to fight and his blade by some ill fate had slid between the leather and the ankle bone to cut me the wound was invisible and darkness was falling im proud because although i felt the sly temptation to act the cowards part i stepped back from istes the best swordsman i ever faced in a contest and saluted him as he got to his feet then i put my sword and shield on the ground unlaced my sandal and showed him the cut perhaps some sighed for disappointment but most approved and istes wrapped his arms around my shoulder and headbutted me helmet to helmet not in anger but in elation he got the crown of olives i got a cut on the foot but we both felt like heroes the sun was a red ball on the horizon when all the winners sacrificed even philocrates and i was declared winner of the games i suspect istes would have won if he had competed in two or three more contests and i think aristides would have won if he had had better fortune fortune is so much a part of a contest but i won my second games when i had sacrificed again and put my crown on my head i offered to take the archers crown to the persian camp people seemed to think that fitting i wore a chiton because the medes arent big on nudity and i wore my crown and i ran across the nomansland with a torch the sentries were waiting they were all persians of the satraps guard led by cyrus and they had apparently watched the games all day they cheered me i bowed to cyrus are you the man who shot the arrow i asked cyrus gave a dignified smile dont you think that would be the feat of a younger more foolish man he said and then i saw that artaphernes was there and my heart almost stopped artaphernes came forward and i bowed as i had been taught as a slave i was never one of those greeks who refused obeisance foolishness i bowed to him and he smiled at me young doru he said it is no surprise to any of us that you are the best of the greeks why have you come here i come bearing the prize for archery voted by acclamation of all the greeks to the persian archer who dared to wade to our shore and shoot a magnificent shot i am to say that had he remained only honour would have come to him i handed the chaplet of olives and the arrow to the satrap of lydia artaphernes had tears in his eyes why are we at war he asked why are you greeks not one with us who love honour together we could conquer the world i shook my head i have no answer lord only a prize and the good wishes of our army for the man who shot that arrow he presented the prizes to cyrus as i had expected and while the persians cheered their man artaphernes stood next to me have you seen our fleet he asked we will defeat it i said with the daimon still strong on me oh doru he said he took my hand and turned me to face him despite the crowd of men around us and his guards you saved my life and my honour once please allow me to save yours you have no hope at all of winning this battle i honour you above all the men of the parsae i have known i said but we will defeat you tomorrow he smiled it was a wintry smile the sort of smile a man gives a woman who has refused his hand in marriage he clasped my hand like an equal a great honour for me even among greeks and kissed my cheek if you survive the battle he said into my ear i would be proud to have you at my side i started as if he had spat poison in my ear if i capture you i will treat you like a prince i responded and he laughed he was the best of the persians and he was briseiss husband the world is never simple the next day it rained and the next as well which was as well for all the greeks as many of us had small wounds aches and pains that would not have served us well in the heat of battle the samians began to behave badly many of their oarsmen refused to patrol despite the persian fleet being just twenty stades across the bay their odd behaviour enraged the lesbians and the chians there were fist fights accusations of cowardice we on the shore of miletus were protected from all that but not from the persian army laying siege to miletus as if the unspoken truce of the games was over the persians attacked our sentries the very next dawn shooting men on the wicker wall wed woven to protect our ships like the achaeans at troy when it happened again the next day i decided to do something about it on the third night idomeneus phrynichus philocrates and all our marines slept if you care to call it that out in the rain on the rocks north of our camp it was a miserable night long and tedious but we were rewarded when after a lashing thunderstorm that hid the first paling of the sky we heard the telltale clash of metal on stone that heralded the persians moving up to their usual harassment position this mornings attackers were a dozen lydian peasants with slings and a hand of actual persians all officers come for the fun talking quietly as they moved across the rocks their magnificent bows already strung they walked to the same point on the rocks they had used the day before our northernmost sentry was fully visible his dark cloak nicely outlined in the growing light and all five persian officers drew together and let fly im sure all their arrows hit the target but i didnt see as i was moving and the sentry was made of baskets anyway i dont remember much of the first part of that fight because there was so little struggle the lydians were just shepherds and they surrendered not the persians the persians were a tougher proposition five of them and four of us on a smooth piece of rock it might have been part of the games they came at us as soon as they saw us my first opponent was an older man with a heavy beard dyed bright red with henna he had an axe at his belt and a short sword covered in beautiful goldwork that shone in the rising sun i remember wanting that sword i had a shield my light boeotian and a spear one of the short ones we used then a mans spear not one of these long things you use today truth to tell a man with an axe and a short sword has no chance against a man with a shield but no one had told the old man and he came for me fast and determined like a man who knew his tools i put my spearpoint into his chest and it glanced off he had a coat of scales under his cloak but i knocked him down with the force of my blow he put a gaping cut in the face of my shield with his axe two of the other persians leaped at me ignoring idomeneus and phrynichus both attacked me with a ferocity that belied the persian reputation as careful fighters they attacked like thracians all war cries and whirling cloaks i took two wounds in as many heartbeats nothing serious but enough to drive me back but phrynichus and idomeneus were true men and they were not going to let me die idomeneus speared the bigger persian through the side the man screamed but he must already have been dead the smaller man continued to rain blows on me while he baffled phrynichus with his cloak he was a canny fighter and he used his cloak as a shield and a weapon and phrynichus stumbled back when he got a cloak weight in the head but i had my feet under me and i thrust hard with my spear hitting the persian in the head his helmet gave under my spearpoint shoddy work and no mistake and he died like a sacrifice his sinews loosing as if id cut them philocrates was fighting the older man and another opponent and they were both retreating across the rock face philocrates was everywhere his spear was high and low and he kept moving facing one and then another heedless of the bad footing the two persians wanted no more of the fight i could tell but backed steadily away abandoning their comrades the fifth persian shot phrynichus with his bow the shot was hurried and the arrow struck the athenian in the helmet unlike the persian helmet phrynichuss good corinthian held the point but he fell unconscious from the blow the archer now put a second arrow to his bow and turned to philocrates i threw my spear the range was short and in those days any spear you carried could be thrown i hit the archer and knocked him flat with the strength of the blow but even as i threw philocrates missed his footing and fell on the rocks and the younger persian leaped to finish him i sprang forward but idomeneus was faster throwing his spear he missed his target but the tumbling shaft caught the older man in the face blood spurted and the man fell to his knees the archer rolled over and cut at me with a heavy knife he caught my shin and his blow was so hard he dented my greave and almost broke my leg the pain was intense and i fell and then we were grappling on the ground but i was covered in armour and he had only the scale shirt that had saved him from my spear we both had daggers after the first moments and there was no thought of defence we both stabbed wildly the way desperate men do i stabbed him five times before he stopped moving he stabbed me just as often but every blow caught on my cuirass because the gods were with me and it was not my hour to die even unmanned by death he tried to stab me again persians they can fight i got to my knees to find that philocrates was also on his and the younger persian was hurrying the older persian across the rocks and a dozen more persians were on their way i retrieved my spear and stripped the corpse of the man i had killed with my dagger his scale shirt was a model of perfection small scales like the scales of a fish washed in gold with bronze and silver scales in patterns edged in purple leather i stripped him while watching the wary approach of the persian relief column they were calling their camp for more men and a dozen greeks were coming over the wicker walls to help us too but i didnt want to be rushed while plundering when i had the shirt i laid the man out neatly his hands crossed on his chest i left him his rings he had fought well and saved his lord we were all cut up and shaking for an ambush it had been a sharp fight idomeneus carried phrynichus back to the walls philocrates was stripping the man id killed first he too had a fine scale shirt and his bowcase was covered in lapis and gold wirework i ran to the site of philocratess combat and one of the oncoming persians tried a long shot at me the arrow skidded on the rocks missing me by a horselength or more as i had thought the old mans sword was lying between two big rocks as i reached for it two arrows passed through my shield one scratched my hand at the antilabe and only the heavy leather of the strap kept me from taking a bad wound the other went right through the shield face and hit my greave but again the thin bronze held i got my hand on the sword hilt and stumbled back my left leg would barely take my weight i took an arrow to my helmet and two or three more hit the rocks around me i paused stepped up on to the biggest rock and waved my new sword at them and then i ran like achilles for our wall dodging right and left as i passed through the rocks to make their archery a little more difficult miltiades was waiting for me at the walls you are a fool he said fondly i handed him the sword first spoils my lord i said then i hobbled down the wall to paramanos who was better than most physicians at bones and such and showed him my leg he had to cut the greave off my shin the arrow had deformed it underneath the shin was red and black and it wept blood right through the skin other men herakleides i remember and his brother came and helped us out of our armour and we were brought wine after a while i lay down under a sail and slept i was exhausted and my leg throbbed i remember waking to eat a double helping of barley broth and then sleeping again two days sleep in a single day theres nothing like combat to drain a man when i awoke the next day men had brought me a new pair of greaves it is good to be a hero every man is your friend and men you have never met will work hard to win your praise or merely to perform some good act for you as if you were one of the gods those greaves were a poor fit but they were better than nothing and some other greek went barelegged to combat that day idomeneus cut sheepskin from my bedding to make the greaves fit against my legs and he rewrapped my leg which was clearly infected or poisoned i felt fine elevated even and that can be a sign of fever what i remember best was my eagerness to try that fine scale shirt it fitted me the way a shield cover fits a shield it weighed nothing and i felt like a god one of the smiths had pounded the dents out of my helmet and someone had repaired my poor battered boeotian shield which now had a small bronze plate riveted to the rawhide to cover where the arrows had punched through we were all armouring up because the sun was rising in the east across the bay where the persian fleet was putting to sea ive seldom been with men so elated before a battle what the four of us had done the day before was to show the athenians at least that we could take the persians man to man the success of our venture a palpable success id add with looted armour a bowcase and a magnificent sword had a powerful effect on every man on our beach athenians chians even the mercenaries the personal wealth of the persians was legendary but wed just proven it ill say this for dionysius of phocaea his ship was the first off the beach and he rowed up and down coaxing us to greater efforts telling every division and even every ship where to take their place in the line we formed in the bay with lade behind us and our line formed with the samians on the left with the lesbians next these two contingents made up more than half our line one hundred and eighty triremes erythrae and phocaea only contributed ten ships between them but they were the best trained and they were in the centre then came the chians a hundred ships under old pelagius and his nephew neoptolemus the finest of men and the proudest single force for size and beauty on the right we had the smaller contingents from teos priene and myos about thirty ships altogether perhaps the worst of our entire fleet the smaller islands were hardpressed to raise and crew a trireme it was as if they had exhausted themselves by providing the thing and had no energy left for training to the right of the mixed squadron were the milesians sixtyeight ships on this day histiaeus came out of his city and led them in person some said that the men of miletus had told him to go and not come back his madness had worsened and men feared him but he left istes in command of the windy tower and finally to the right of the milesians there was miltiades contingent and the cretans under nearchos they called us the athenians but unlike the force that aristides had led at sardis five years before we were really pirates none of my rowers was an athenian citizen although many of them had been born under athenas gaze more were thracians or byzantines or broken men from boeotia and the peloponnese even our marines were a polyglot bunch nearchoss contingent was another fine one with five wellbuilt ships and highly trained crews i had drummed it into the boy to take war seriously and he did he had spent a fortune on his oarsmen and his ships were painted red his helmet was painted red and he had a red shield with gold fittings a group of us my friends and old comrades and miltiades officers met on the beach as if by common consent to pour libations and pray and drink wine in the new dawn it is nice to be the last squadron to form theres plenty of time to make sure that all the rowers have their cushions that all the thole pins are sound and secure the hulls are smooth every buckle is buckled and every lace fresh new and strong the vanguard must hurry out in the dark leaving their canteens behind or some other thing that irritates you all day in a big fight paramanos got us together going from group to group as we armed and inviting us to miltiades awning when i arrived i accepted the congratulations of every man on my feat of arms the day before nice thorax aristides said he took my hand and a noble fight he added with a smile as istes said what would it be like to awaken one morning and find that you had forfeited all that adulation and from such a man as aristides that is what it is to be a hero unless you never deserved it once you go up that ladder you cannot come down at any rate we were all there all the best men of our contingent aristides made the sacrifices and cimon stood on one side of me while paramanos stood on the other and agios miltiades personal helmsman and my former mentor winked at me across the sacrificial fire they were all there the friends of my first life and some from my second my pirates miltiades and phrynichus and nearchos whom i had trained and his brother and idomeneus stood behind me with phrynichus and philocrates took his share of the prayer without a ribald comment and herakleides the aeolian one of my first men now commander of a trireme and stephanos i smiled because my men had done well we sang the paean of apollo and we made sacrifice and then miltiades handed round a great kylix of unwatered wine today we are not pirates he said today we fight for the freedom of the greeks although we are far from home and hearth let me tell you miltiades was always my model of a man of greatness he stood taller acted taller than other men i still ape his manners the way i swirl a cloak and the way i put my hand on the hilt of my sword are his and when the sense of occasion was on him he was not like a god he was a god even aristides was like a pale priggish shadow next to the blazing sun of his glory we all drank and when the kylix came back to miltiades he raised it on high may we all be heroes he said and poured the rest into the sand my ship was the last one in the water the rightmost ship in the rightmost division it meant that we had to row far to the east well down the bay i must explain the way of it or you young people will never understand what happened in the battle first ill draw the bay a great shape like an empty sack open on the west and with the bottom at the east up near the mouth of the sack the lower side of the mouth see is the island of lade and miletus sticks into the mouth of the sack by the island like a man pushing his thumb in and the persian camp the siege was south and west of the city so that as we formed our line west to east from the top of the sack to the bottom as it were the city and the persian camp were both behind us we were in effect trying to keep the persian fleet from getting to the city and the camp our line extended from the island all the way along the bay to well east of the persian camp our line stretched for almost thirty stades theres an irony too we fought there again at mycale but ill tell that story when i get to it the persians started forming earlier than we did and were still forming when my men rowed us the last few shiplengths to form to the right of stephanos in myrmidon so we rested on our oars and watched as the aegyptian contingent formed opposite us and then more phoenicians beyond them facing nothing their line was in fact almost twice as long as ours part of that was because they left gaps between their divisions and part was because aside from the phoenicians who were great sailors and well trained the rest of their ships had as little notion of keeping formation as the worst of ours i could see the cilicians away at the samian end of the line and they were more like a cloud of gnats than a squadron for all that i didnt like being outflanked by the phoenicians theyd split their best contingent putting a hundred phoenician ships at either end of their great crescent they put their worst ships in the middle their plan was clear to close rapidly on our flanks and crush us before we broke their centre we were still lying on our oars when miltiades came out of the line under his boatsail he was the leftmost ship in our squadron hard by nearchos together we and the cretans had sixteen ships the best manned and probably the best trained except for the phocaeans miltiades passed down the line and hailed each captain as he came up when he got to me he turned his ship under oars so that it came to rest on my right usurping my place of honour when we go forward follow me militades called were going to form a column race downwind to the east and try to sting the phoenicians he laughed fifteen of us against a hundred phoenicians long odds i called back whatever he replied was carried away by the rising wind but i heard the word hero and i waved idomeneus had a mad grin on his face thiss what i came for he said i looked at the mass of phoenician ships and smiled like most pirates most of my rowers were pretty well armed every man had a javelin at least and many had a pelte or a buckler a good number had better gear a helmet a leather hat an aspis on board the mighty ajax every man had a helmet and a spear and some had swords the older and more successful a pirate was the better kit his rowers had and that gave us a huge advantage in a boarding fight on the phoenicians their rowers were slaves or captives or paid freedmen but none of them had arms not that that ever seemed to cause them to row any worse but if a boarding fight lasted more than a few minutes our ships would always overwhelm theirs in fact one of our ships could put two hundred trained fighters against ten of theirs thats why they preferred a fight of manoeuvre wed also killed most of the best phoenician crews at amathus they were shy now and cautious of engagement but fifteen to a hundred was long odds at the best of times i pondered this gathered my marines and my officers amidships on the fighting platform and told them what i knew i pitched my voice to carry so that my oarsmen could hear everything i said were going to sail downwind on our boatsails so lay everything on deck and stand ready i said to my sailing master he was a black libyan with a barbaric name like a noseful of snot but we all called him black and he answered to it id bought him on the beach at lade and freed him on the spot hed been a helmsman way out west at sicily and i knew quality when i saw it for all that he was new to my ship paramanos was black and look how good he was then were going to drop sails turn back west and attack the tip of their pincer i said im going to guess that lord miltiades will try to lure them into a luffing match upwind their rowers against ours until we hit the shore if we do that nothing matters except how far east and north of the battle we can lure the bloody phoenicians dont get locked in a boarding fight if you can con your enemy into trying to outsail you and friends we in storm cutter can outsail anything they offer can we not they shouted back at me and then i went forward to watch as black had his sailors lay out the boatsail and mal coached his rowers while galas took the helm i had promoted him to helmsman when i purchased black he watched black with a critical eye i kept my eye on the persians though there probably wasnt a persian among them except for a dozen noble archers on twenty or so of their command ships somewhere was datis himself hed have a deck full of them but the rest of their fleets people were vassals and slaves and cilician pirates of course men just like us as i watched there was a flash and a ripple all along the front of the persians as their oars came out it wasnt neat or well drilled but the mass of their great half moon began to move it was a terrifying sight truth to tell they outnumbered us so badly and their line filled your eye almost horizon to horizon they must have taken up fifty stades of ocean more than five hundred ships until then no one had ever seen such a fleet i refused to be terrified today was the day apollo would smile on the greeks the day i would win briseis fulfil my destiny and go to glory i had half a notion that i might die in the victory it would suit all i had heard of fates that i die achieving my ambition and my curse to briseis death held little fear for me i was still young then heads up sailors i called from the bow attention to orders miltiades was turning out of the line and he had a square torn from his big red awning flapping at his stern hoist the boatsail i called and black echoed it in his curious singsong accent we turned with the steering oars the rowing oars held clear of the water but ready to engage all to save the rowers strength i looked back along our line and i saw them come from line abreast pointed north to line ahead pointed east in fine style one of the very manoeuvres that dionysius had made us practise in fact nearchos followed us and eight of the chians came out of their line and followed us neoptolemus and his contingent i later learned that made me grin twentyfive ships were shorter odds and now the phoenicians couldnt just ignore us or wed wreck them i wondered what the samians were doing to avoid envelopment at their end of the line but fifty stades is a long way to see on a hazy morning we sailed due east with a strengthening breeze at our backs and the water tore down our hulls and we sang hymns and drinking songs miltiades sent an oarsman over the side and he called out to each ship as it passed ordering us to prepare to turn to port and form line ahead facing north when the red square flew again i understood well enough and i expect that all the other captains did too again dionysiuss training paid off opposite us the phoenicians and the aegyptians didnt react to our manoeuvre but carried straight forward under oars the aegyptians were in a mix of heavy ships and pentekonters light ships that we greeks would no longer put in the line of battle we got three stades to the east before they reacted and by that time miltiades ajax was even with the eastmost ships in the phoenician division so that we were actually threatening to outflank their fleet for those of you who have never fought ship to ship and i think thats every one of you a rowing ship is most vulnerable to a ram in the flank or the long side of the ship where the bronze beak can roll you over or split the planks of your side and leave you to swim in the deep dark sea or sink in your armour and feed the fish we watched them with the avidity of men watching a sporting event late very late the tip of their crescent began to turn east to face us but they were rowing and we were sailing and although they were able to keep pace their squadron began to string out over the sea losing all hope of formation we were strung out too but the wind moves at the same speed for all i suppose and we still held our line and they were rowing flat out to race against us miltiades was the best fighting sailor i served under later every man would praise themistocles he was a rabblerouser and a politician and he made athens the greatest sea power in history but miltiades like dionysius of phocaea was a pirate and a seaman we raced two more stades to windward and the breeze continued to grow behind us the hand of the gods we said to each other miltiades began to wave and i sent a runner to signal stephanos astern of me we were about to turn miltiades stood on the helmsmans bench of ajax the red square bundled under one arm his other arm hooked in the bent wood of the triremes stern watching the ships behind me on mine black had the bow full of sailors standing about the boatsail mast and mal had the oars out and peaked ready to stroke galas had a grin from ear to ear the oars steady under his arms ready to turn prepare for a hard turn to port i roared on my command by the gods i thought this is going to be glorious win or lose i had seldom gone so fast in a trireme the wind directly astern had such power i wondered if we could carry any of it through the turn i also noted that miltiades was stiffening his ship by sending his marines and extra deck crew to the windward side and i followed suit anything to get that railing down as we turned or rather anything to keep the leeward rail out of the water id never heard of a trireme rolling over in a turn but i didnt want to be the first one to do it either heartbeats my heart thudding against my chest as if it would pulse right through the new persian armour i wore the hushed expectancy the sound of the wind and a gull screaming miltiades let fly the red cloth and i raised my fist hard to port i called galas called his orders and long training and good discipline told every port oar dipped together and touched water held the starboard oars gave way the ship heeled like a chariot on a turn over over farther until my heart was in my throat and every man on deck had to hold the rail and the portside rowers had their oars so deep in the water they couldnt withdraw them somewhere amidships there was a scream as an oar broke and a man took the shaft in his guts and then we were around and the sun was shining and our ram was pointed at the phoenicians and we were racing like a spear thrown by poseidon for the flank of the enemy line miltiades was around in style and stephanos was at my side like an eager dog our line filled out even as i watched the cretans were no slower and the chians trailed away in some confusion but that only served to make our line look longer as soon as the phoenicians saw us turn they began to turn to meet us but they were fifty or so individual ships not a squadron and their rowers were tired the wind was so strong that it was pushing us even with our turn even with our sails down i began to eye the beach and the rocks at the foot of the bay the east end with a professional eye then i ran amidships to the command platform diekplous i called to the helmsman oarrake and right through then turn upwind west miltiades and i were facing four or five of the fastest phoenician vessels but they were the very eastmost and if we oarraked them there was no point in lingering theyd never come back to the battle right understand lad because if we broke their oars they couldnt row and poseidon would take them to the bottom of the bay and wreck them got it my blushing beauty ill make a navarch of you yet my dear galas tapped his oars a little to the west and a little more to compensate for that wind our rowers were pulling perfectly my ship was half a length ahead of miltiades when we engaged the first phoenician i cant be certain but i think we were the first to engage that day galas overcompensated for the wind and we crossed the bow of our target fifty feet out a deadly error had we been moving at the same speed but we werent we were faster and he leaned hard having learned his lesson and mal called for extra effort from the portside oars and we heeled over again and slammed home into the phoenicians cathead shattering his rowgallery with the reinforced beam at the top of our ram the whole starboard side of his ship seemed to explode as our beak ripped down the benches and his seams opened and he was gone under the waves thats what speed does for you in a fight west i roared elated it was the cleanest sea kill id ever seen apollo was at my side and the liberation of greece was at hand miltiades men were cheering as they rammed the second phoenician and went straight at the third rolling him over two kills in the time it takes to tell the story stephanoss helmsman made the same error as galas overcompensating for the wind and he missed his diekplous and swept past but as luck would have it his bow caught the enemy ships oars at the end of a sweep and broke them killing as many oarsmen as our more spectacular strike some ships missed their attacks altogether and after our initial success the phoenicians rallied and struck back but their rowers were tired and the only ship they killed was one of nearchoss rammed amidships with its beak stuck in its prey as can happen when a ship strikes too hard at least ten of their ships died in that first strike we had lost our godsent speed now but i had led the turn west and other ships had fallen in with me miltiades was behind me gathering up our stragglers and the chians were just engaging to the south that is on my left the bulk of the phoenician squadron was ahead of me and they were in confusion because they couldnt choose whether to turn south and face the chians or east and face me i was back in the bow looking for their navarch somewhere in that huddle of ships was the command ship and there lay the most glory the most fame and a chance to kill the head of the hydra but i couldnt make him out in the time i had the ships closest to us had chosen to fight us as the most immediate threat and we obliged hurtling towards a wellmanned ship at full speed he had good rowers and the collision threw me flat to the deck we must have struck bow to bow but his bow gave way tenedos worm or dry rot and his ship settled like a rock even as his marines came over our bow like hungry wolves and died spitted on the massed spears of our marines i turned to black who stood behind my shield as if he was my hypaspist arrows had started to fly and he was a target as much as me if every greek kills two persians well win i said happily he shrugged the biggest fight i ever saw he said he rubbed his jaw but ive seen a few sir this luck cant last nor could it by then we were like an arrow in the guts of an animal wed wounded the phoenicians but we hadnt killed them my ship was scarcely moving and now my rowers were tiring the first flush was over and there was still a sea of phoenicians to fight boys need a rest lord mal shouted in my ear i caught idomeneuss eye we board i said i ran back along the catwalk well rowed i called down into the thranites as i went past overhead rest in two minutes down in the lower decks they have little idea what is passing overhead victory defeat death hard to tell when all you see is the arse of the man above you and the length of his oar i got to the helmsmans station with a shower of arrows from a long ship ahead i caught one on my shield lay me alongside that bastard i said well board him and give our boys a rest in fact i was aiming at the northernmost ship in the phoenician squadron a ship at the back of their now utterly confused pack i hoped that by coming up the north side of this vessel id get a few minutes respite from the arrows of the rest he was having none of it and he manoeuvred and we manoeuvred like two cats fighting in the dust and we swept past each other at close range there was a tall man in a greek helm on the deck and idomeneus shot him in the throat a wonderful shot and he fell straight over the side then we were past and there was another phoenician close behind a heavy ship like ours he was apparently taken by surprise that we were so close and our ram struck just aft of his bow but he had his oars in and our momentum was too little and the angle too steep for a kill that was fine with me and my rowers we coasted down his side with a keening screech marines i called deck crew black had an axe in each hand longhandled axes of the kind that horsemen carry axemen die like lambs in a seafight no shield no defence i feared for him and my investment but i neednt have worried as we slowed i stepped up on the rail and took an arrow on my shield i didnt wait for our grapples to go home i leaped i had done this twenty times yet i missed my footing and fell over the top bench an enemy oarsmen kicked me but his kick hit a lot of armour and i was getting up when the enemy marines came for me i should have died but an axe a fullweight axe flew right through the hide face of the first marines shield and into his arm blood blew out through the shield and i resolved on the spot never to go to war with the libyans before then i had never seen a man throw an axe black threw his second axe into the next man and it hit poll first not with the blade but the poll hit the man in the temple and down he went then i was up and killing i only remember black and his axes the rest is a blur and then i was on their command deck with idomeneus under my shield shooting their officers at the distance a man could spit while i covered him and killed anyone who came for me there were two persian noblemen and some mede guards and a noble phoenician in scale armour from head to knee he had a beard as long as his scale shirt and idomeneus shot him in his unarmoured face while the remnants of his marines tried to cover him ineptly with their shields the rowers were all phoenicians and they fought as if to disprove everything i said earlier but that was the navarchs ship honey and he had the best of everything and apollo had given him to my spear so my own rowers had to arm and come over the rail it was ugly and went on far too long if i had to guess id say that the only enemy rowers who lived through the slaughter were those who leaped the rail and swam maybe six out of two hundred men thats the hard way to take a ship and when the rowers fight poseidon thats ugly i have no idea how long it took but it didnt get my rowers the rest i had intended against a nice effeminate enemy at lade there were no easy enemies there was cheering from the west the haze over there was burning off but not enough to give me a clue what was happening i went back aboard the storm cutter and found galas in the bow with a handful of oarsmen water was coming in just forward of the first rowing bench it wasnt coming fast but it was coming in all along the seams to the north a smaller phoenician was angling out of their mob looking for a fight our rest was over he spotted us and started towards us from about a stade away i looked back at the leak it was a hard moment for me in a day that was full of them hes finished i said storm cutters bow must have been damaged when he crushed the lighter phoenician my first ship he was sinking under my feet on a calm day id have run him up a beach and saved him rebuilt the bow retimbered him anything to save him but in the middle of the greatest naval battle wed ever seen i had only one choice into the phoenician i said by then wed wiped out their rowers and men were hanging listlessly by the benches but galas and mal and black got the sailors and the oarsmen to their places bodies flung over the side oars coming out through the ports we were too slow the lighter phoenician was coming at us from the north already up to ramming speed and turning to get the best possible angle but he was lining up on an abandoned sinking ship he had no way of knowing that we were all in his own command ship or that it was already taken and the bodies gone it stank of blood and shit but we had some life in us yet we poled off with anything we could get our hands on broken oars spears boatpikes our first five strokes were so ragged that i was ready to despair and mal cracked his voice screaming but the new ship was a spearlength longer and half our oarsmen were in unfamiliar benches a few on the wrong side altogether we had just enough way on us to row clear of the abandoned storm cutter he served us one more time taking one more victim with him into the deep wounded as he was the phoenician was overeager and rammed home amidships at full speed his ram cracked timbers and the water poured in and storm cutter quickly filled and sank still stuck to the phoenicians ram his rowers backed water like heroes seeking to withdraw their ram but their bow went down and down as if poseidons mighty hand had them by the bronze they might yet have made it but nearchos of crete shot from under our stern and hulled them neatly amidships while they were utterly defenceless and they were dead men the cheering from the west was louder now we could feel it the phoenicians their best were shying off their navarch was dead and no one was giving them orders and the northernmost ships turned for the beach and ran we lay on our oars and panted and some men laughed and others wept we had been close to death i could feel the scythe on my cheek behind us while we did nothing the handful of chians under neoptolemus harried the last phoenicians to withdraw and we had eighteen ships when miltiades came past us and ordered us to form on his right ajax had a scar on her portside timbers where a phoenician ram had only just failed to get a kill but otherwise he still looked like the mightiest ship on the bay of lade just south of me a pair of chians carried the last phoenician ship in our part of the battle by boarding none of us to be honest could believe it i suppose we expected that wed get stuck in and the lesbians would have to come and rescue us after they broke the aegyptians but wed done it ourselves miltiades harried us into line the phoenicians were reforming on the mycale shore in front of their camp forty ships or more against eighteen and wed routed them i drank off a canteen of water and passed around another of wine as it came back to me black made a noise of disgust he was looking over the sea to the west he spat in the sea drank from the wine and handed the canteen to idomeneus were fucked he said i turned around i can remember that moment as if it was today this mornings breakfast beer until i turned i was a hero in a victorious fleet and we had just broken persias sea power and i was going to be a prince in boeotia with briseis at my side the rising sun had finally burned of the haze we were alone strictly speaking we werent alone and ill leap ahead and tell what happened because from my deck it was hideously confusing just accept my word children we spent the rest of the day in an exhausted rage of fear and betrayal and confusion the samians had changed sides not all of them of course some remained loyal to the rebellion and more fled the treachery although some men would say they were the worst cowards of all taking no side of a hundred ships eleven stayed with us and fought to the end those eleven tried to fight a hundred phoenicians and every man aboard died trying and the men of samos still have a stele to them and their captains in the agora of their city but aeaces the former tyrant of samos had bought the aristocrats among them and dionysius of samos not to be confused with our mad navarch dionysius of phocaea changed sides the bastard the treachery of the samians left the lesbians to the fates epaphroditos chose to die and he led his own men the men of methymna and eresus into the enemy and they took many of the cilicians down with them but the mytilenians chose another path hoisted their sails and ran for it twenty ships that we needed desperately in the centre the chians saw they were being deserted and did the noblest thing of all they stayed together and resolved to cut their way out they had no idea we had won on the right who would have expected it of us so they hurled themselves against the mass of levies and mercenaries in the centre that was the chaos that greeted us when the haze finally burned off so that we couldnt see any of our ships at first because we didnt think to look for them behind the line of aegyptians facing us now i also have to add that up to this point datis the persian commander thought that his own left the phoenicians wed beaten had been enveloped by a larger force friends like cyrus told me later that thats what datis had been told by the beaten remnants because beaten men count every foe two or three times so despite the defection of the samians and the destruction of the lesbians datis thought that the battle was still in the balance he was holding back his reserve of aegyptian triremes waiting to see the rest of our fleet thats battle on a giant scale when hundreds of ships face each other no one man can command them or even guess what occurs datis won the battle of lade in the first hour but the haze and the defeat of the eastern phoenician squadrons made him cautious otherwise he could have closed the gap and trapped us all in the sack miltiades would have died there and aristides and aeschylus and many other good men as it is i will cry when i tell who died just wait we rowed south avoiding contact with the aegyptian squadron they had smaller ships than ours and as i say we could see no reason for their caution all we could see was disaster we formed a circle with our sterns together a favourite ploy of the athenians like a phalanx formed in a box against cavalry in this case miltiades did it so that we might shout from stern to stern aristides spoke first we must attack into their centre he said the milesians are still fighting and many of the chians paramanos shouted over him foolish bravery my lord our few ships cant save one of them we can die with them aristides retorted to be honest that was my plan as well a defeat this great the destruction of the whole fleet of the greeks would be the end of greek independence for ever you who live now you cannot imagine a time when athens had fifteen ships on her best day and eight of them were ours sparta had none of course i cared nothing for the east greeks except my friends but the rebellion was all i had known and the men of that rebellion were the friends of my youth and besides first and foremost i knew that in that hour briseis was lost to me i think i moaned aloud no one heard me but the gods nearchos shook his head these are not my ships to squander but those of lord achilles my father he said with more maturity than i had i will accept the dishonour but i will withdraw on my head be it miltiades balanced on the curving stern boards of his ship he held up his hand for silence nearchos has the right of it he said it is our duty for the sake of all the hellenes to save what we can and live to fight again aristides cursed something i had never heard him do fight again he said with what our wits our ships and our swords miltiades said in that hour he rose to greatness from that moment he was no longer miltiades tyrant of the chersonese from that moment he made himself the leader of the resistance although many years would pass before men knew it we must save as many of the milesians and chians as we can he said nearchos go with honour we were victorious tell your men tell your sons had all men fought like you we would have had the victory then he turned to me arimnestos we need to cut a hole in the net around the chians i had nothing left to give but his words were like a summons and i stood straighter by the rail of my ship yes lord i said i think the persians have ordered their captains to let any fleeing ship run he said so we will flee to the centre turn north and attack the aegyptians he pointed at me you lead you have the heaviest ship when you see my signal turn north just as we did this morning line ahead to line abreast dont die like heroes gut a ship or two and make a hole and then run all i ask of every one of you is that you kill one more ship nearchos was weeping i cant leave he said ill fight until you run miltiades smiled the way he always did when he got the best of a deal you must do as is best for you son of achilles he said our rowers had rested for long enough for muscles to stiffen but we had all swallowed cheese and garlic sausage and we crept west under oars into the teeth of that west wind that had blown us to victory in the morning the chians were oar to oar and bow to bow with the aegyptians across the centre and the milesians were just a few stades from us but deeper in farther north and now the phoenicians wed beaten had come off the beach not to face us but to finish the poor milesians our rowing was poorer than dirt and i had no heart to curse my rowers they had given their best and for nothing but poseidon took pity on us poor greeks or else that days curses were all used up in as much time as it takes a fast man to run the stade the wind changed right around west to east and a warm damp wind hit us like the open hand of a beneficent god in heartbeats we had our boatsails up on deck black took longer and miltiades passed us and so did aristides they mocked us we were in a strange ship and everything was stowed by strangers as it happened i thought it was a miracle that black got the boatsail up at all then we were racing away west behind us a rain squall appeared at the bottom of the bay and hit the phoenicians it was as if the gods were seeking to do all in their power to remedy the perfidious foolery of men ill be honest it had none of the breakneck enthusiasm of morning we were tired to our sinews and we were no longer fighting for greatness but like wild dogs we were still dangerous and lest i make the aegyptians sound like an enemy to be trifled with many men fight badly late in a victory ive done it myself why risk yourself when the day is won eh the aegyptians were shocked when we turned on them and timid and why not they were vassals of persia not friends and their side was already victorious had we known the future had we been able to see the dark days at artemisium and thermopyle when the chians and the lesbians stood against us vassals of persia in those same ships we would have left them to die but who could calculate such a thing or abandon a friend and of course they repaid us in their turn on the beaches of mycale but that story is for another night eh where was i ahh so we turned on the aegyptians eighteen ships and our ships were bigger and our crews more dangerous even so late in a long fight they kept formation and many backed water and we swept on ignoring the timid determined to relieve the chians miltiades was first to sink a ship a small trireme that sank under his forefoot caught in a bad turn herakleides the aeolian was by then a master helmsman paramanos quickly got the ship that tried to rescue that one and then we were in among them like barracuda among baitfish nearchos was the first to die he was lost when the rain squall hit us and he didnt see the cilician who caught him aft with his ram i hope he died quickly his ship sank and we saw it all neoptolemus died driving his ship deeper and deeper into the aegyptians trying to save his uncle who was already dead mighty old pelagius who would never again hold games on the beaches of chios he died with an arrow in his eye another arrow killed herakleides at the helm of miltiades ajax too miltiades took the helm himself he killed men the way a man with a scythe reaps the ripe barley but when his marines were all wounded he chose to live turned out of the maelstrom and ran i saw him go and knew that it was time for me to go too idomeneus was in the bow killing with his bow and the aegyptians were hanging back pelting us with javelins and looking for easier prey while we tried to break their oars and in the distance perhaps a stade away i could see the chians and the milesians fighting their way to us to the hope of rescue two aegyptians bolder than the rest came at me and they knew their business i was too cocky and i thrust between them looking for the double oarrake but they folded their wings like diving birds and they grappled us as we passed between after a shower of javelins that all but cleared my deck of sailors they had marines aegyptian marines are firstrate troops as good as our greeks man for man with heavy linen armour twenty or thirty layers of it quilted up because linen is cheap in aegypt they wear bronze helmets not like ours at all and carry a heavy shield made of the hide of some river beast every man has a pair of wicked barbed javelins and a huge iron sword and they can use them ive heard men say that the aegyptians are all cowards but ive never heard a man whos fought them make such a foolish claim just before they boarded i saw stephanos bring his ship into action he was always one of the best helmsmen and he was at his own oars he caught the leeward aegyptian at a stand all her oars in and he punched into the enemys side like a shark closing its teeth on a corpse and the aegyptians keel snapped stephanos gave me a wave and i returned it the athletes salute aye i remember that moment because stephanos was like a god then but the other aegyptian boarded us undaunted by the death of their companion and again like sharks now that one had his teeth in us the rest of them got bolder and came forward and before wed repelled the first rush there were more ships coming in there was nothing we could do but fight at sea and on land there comes a moment in a fight when there are no longer either tactics or strategies all you can do is fight they grappled to our bow and to our stern and all down one side and they came at us maybe sixty marines against our eight or ten i cant remember who was still standing a vicious chaos of blood and swords philocrates stood in the bow with idomeneus and they stopped a ships worth of marines by themselves i only caught glimpses i didnt have the luxury of commanding any longer and had to fight but i saw philocrates kill and kill again until the ship on the bow cut its grapples but a chancethrown javelin caught him in the head stunned him and he died there under the great sword of an aegyptian marine phrynichus took an arrow in the arm leading a dozen armed oarsmen against the second ship but he got up on the rail his blood flowing like water in a rainstorm and he raised his poets voice as if he was competing against simonides or aeschylus in the games sing me muses the rage of achilles he sang even as his blood flowed and my sailors rose from their benches with glory in their hearts galas and mal unarmoured followed me with the remnants of the sailors from the deck crew and we didnt wait for the onslaught of the third aegyptian as soon as his grapples came home we were over the rails and into his benches killing we caught that ship by surprise they must have thought us easy pickings and fifteen men with axes made short work of the disorganized crew i cut their trierarch down with a single spear stroke where he stood at the foot of his mainmast amidships the mast was still stepped and poseidon alone knows why and i stood there breathing like a bellows gone mad for those of you who have never fought in armour children you can only go a few hundred heartbeats the best man in the world achilles himself could do no more before you have to rest i loosened my chin strap drank in sweet breaths of sea air and looked about me idomeneus stood alone for as long as a woman takes to birth a child and held the bow philocratess corpse between his widespread legs phrynichus was down and his singing stilled but his sailors had swamped the second aegyptian wed swept the third like a desert wind but while wed been fighting three more had come for stephanos and rather than abandon us and leave us to die to save himself he stood fast on our leeward side and they boarded him as i watched his spearmen cleared the fighting deck on the boldest of the three but the other two had extra marines and they poured men into the centre of trident stephanos went into them with half a dozen of his marines his spear flashing as if he was ares incarnate the red horsehair of his crest nodding high above the fight six of them were trying to stop thirty or forty professional fighters i roared my rallying cry and mal stood up from where hed been looting a corpse galas tapped my breastplate to tell me he was at my shoulder and together with a few more sailors and a hand of oarsmen we leaped back to our own ship sprinted the length of the deck and leaped again to rescue stephanos as my bare feet pounded along my own deck i could see nothing not even with my helmet cocked back on my head i must have slowed to take fresh spears because when i came on to stephanoss deck i had a pair in my hand i was first on to stephanoss deck coming in behind the enemy while they butchered stephanoss unarmoured oarsmen but as we arrived another aegyptian grappled stephanos at my back came black and galas and the deck crew we met the new aegyptians sword to sword and shield to shield mal died there along with most of my sailors unarmoured men facing the swords of aegyptian marines further down the deck it was even worse i saw stephanos fall run through the thigh and i saw his cousin harpagos stand over him with a sailors axe and blood flew like ocean spray when he hit a man i was tired and my cause was lost and it was tempting to die but stephanoss loss filled me with an awful rage and over that rage or under it i knew that godlike effort was required or all my friends all my men would die those are the moments that define you friends oh thugater you would have been proud of me that day for it is not the sands of the palaestra that show heroism nor the fields of the games nor the moment of a great victory any man worthy of his fathers name should be able to stand his ground on a dry day with food in his belly and armour on his back fresh and strong but at the tail end of defeat when the enemy close in like hyenas on the kill when all is lost but honour when you are covered in bruises and small wounds whose pain tears at you with every blow when all your muscles ache and your breath comes in gasps like a pair of broken bellows in a forge when your friends have fallen and no one will sing your praises who are you then those are the moments in which you show the gods what your father made galas went down when the marines of a fifth ship hit us to be honest friends i have no idea how many ships were around us by then eight ten my ships deck was almost clear but stephanoss ship must have looked easier and he had fifty enemy fighters crowding the deck i remember that his hull was low in the water from the sheer weight of men on the decks and the ship has wallowing unbalanced which made the fighting even harder at the moment when i gave myself over to ares an aegyptian officer had just stooped to take the gold amulet mal always wore who was i then this is who i was i went at them down the gangway amidships crowded with men and i remember with the clarity of youth i had two spears and my boeotian shield and i ran at them about three steps i remember because the first aegyptian had a raven on his oval shield leaning down to get the necklace his eyes appalled that one lone madman was charging him and mal dying grabbed the mans shield with both hands and pulled it down thats a hero i put my spear into the aegyptians neck just the tip as delicately as a cat and withdrew it leaped high in the air above the pitching deck and threw over the falling corpse into the second man their shields are heavy hide but my throw had zeus behind it and it penetrated his shield and his arm and i took my second spear and killed him landing on his armoured chest as he tried to seize a breath and feeling his ribs give under my toes even as i rammed my spear underhand into the next man stepped off the dying man set my legs on the wood of the deck and pushed my shield the next man tried to step back but his mates wouldnt let him i thrust my spear at his head and he ducked stumbled and i caught the rim of his heavy hide shield with my spearhead and pulled then thrust into his undefended chest and a flower of bright blood grew over his white linen cuirass and his soul flew out of his mouth his corpse folded at my feet and i crouched down almost kneeling on the deck and punched my spear into the inside of the next mans thigh the best stroke there is for a fighter because theres an artery there and a simple cut will kill a man his eyes widened at the fountain of blood and he fell fingers reaching for the wound and i rose to my full height braced against a sudden shift in the deck and threw my remaining spear over his reaching arms at the next man right over his shield into the skull over his nose i reached under my arm and plucked out my sword and a flying axe took the sixth man where he was frozen grey with fear as grim death reaped his comrades like ripe barley on an autumn day i could still see the crest on harpagoss helmet and i roared like a beast no war cry but the bellow of ares and my foes were sick with terror because i brought them death and they could not touch me the next aegyptian thrust at me with his spear but his blow was hesitant the fearful attack of the desperate man what did calchas say just this when you face the killer of men you lock shields and stand cautious to run and to attack are both sides of the same coin fear black reached under my shield caught the aegyptians shaft and pulled him off balance and my sword cut him down a simple chop to the neck where his linen armour did not meet the cheekpieces of his helmet the thranites began to gather their spears and their courage and come up like the warriors grown from dragons teeth in myth so that the rowing benches sprouted fighters and in ten heartbeats it was the aegyptians who were beset we took heart all of us and we plucked their lives like grapes at harvest time and the deck under my feet flowed with their blood thranites grabbed their ankles and knees and pulled them down or thrust javelins up into their groins and topside my sword was waiting for any undefended flesh and every time an aegyptian set his feet i would put my shield into his and push and i never met a man of aegypt with the power in his legs to stop my rush and they died the last man to face me was brave and he died like a hero covering the flight of his companions he went shield to shield with me and held me and twice his big sword bit into my shield the second blow cutting through the thick oak rim but while his sword was stuck in my shield i put my sword into his throat he was a man thanks to ares his companions were not of his measure or id have died there we had cleared the deck and as i came to the rail i cut a mans fingers off where he grasped it i was a horselength from the terrified men on one of the vessels grappled to trident and i leaped on to the rail if you come to me every one of you will die i roared the aegyptians cut their grapples and poled off that my thugater is who i was in the hour of defeat wine here by the will of the gods or the temerity of men the aegyptians let us go my decks were red with blood and empty my deck crew was dead almost to a man i had no officers but black and my marines both of them sat in the scuppers white with fatigue and watched their hands shake all my best men were dead all of my friends were dead too nearchos epaphroditos herakleides pelagius neoptolemus mal philocrates and two dozen others i had known for years phrynichus and galas lay in their own blood on my deck we crawled away like a wounded lion or a boar with the spear in him but for whatever reason the aegyptians just let us go and it was not for nothing as we crept oh for the rowing of the morning past the edge of the aegyptian line chian ships began to come up behind us first a few and then more a dozen two dozen one of them was towing a prize and i laughed and then i saw a lesbian ship i knew and i hailed him it was he who told me epaphroditos was dead but wed burst the bubble and now the trapped rebels boiled out of the trap as fast as they could i have no idea who survived only that there were enough of them that the aegyptians simply drew off and let us all go together we might have had eighty ships with a handful of milesians mixed in and dionysius of phocaea men tell me he had cut deepest into the enemy centre all the way through and put fire in an enemy ship on their beach before the battle collapsed around him he waved and rowed past and his men were raising their boatsail that wave was all the thanks we got but it said enough black crouched by my feet i had the steering oars in my trembling hands and he was the only officer left except idomeneus who had rallied my rowers behind me as i fought aboard trident he too was a hero he was covered in wounds as was i now that i stopped to assess i had a bloody gash inside my right thigh that should have killed me id never felt it it must have missed the vital artery by the thickness of a thread and i was able to see deep into my flesh what now boss black asked i looked across the bay ships turned turtle and ships afire the smell of smoke the ocean littered with dead men swimming men and sharks we should run for chios i said but miltiades had lit a fire in me to save something harpagos brought stephanoss ship trident alongside he told me that stephanos was dead i groaned aloud i had hoped he was merely wounded it was the hardest blow of the day i got up on the rail how my thighs hurt and called out to him miltiades is standing straight on for samos i said pointing to where cimon aristides and miltiades were raising their boatsails im your man not his harpagos said stephanos never left you lord nor will we i was still grappling with the notion that solid big reliable stephanos was dead my best man my first friend as a free man im making for the camp i said the decision came to me as if from athena greyeyed at my side i want my mainsail and my rowers are done in black nodded and idomeneus shrugged and harpagos fell away and took station under my stern my rowers were done in but ill note that they landed like champions we got our ship ashore despite the wind and harpagos landed trident next to us in a camp almost devoid of life black shook his head over a cup of wine boss well just die here i shrugged lets save something i said i dont remember saying anything else i fell on my sleeping rug and i didnt move until idomeneus awoke me fill my cup thugater and leave me the day after a battle is always horrible a sea battle hides the worst the stink and the visible horrors of the dead and the screams of the wounded not many wounded in a seafight by wounded i mean those with a spear in the guts or a cut so deep that only a physician can save them or not save them as the gods would have it because after a fight like lade every man has cuts skinned knuckles pulled muscles every man who has fought hand to hand on ships has small wounds a deep cut on the arm a burn an arrow through the bicep some men have two the fighters the hoplites the marines the heroes have all the little injuries that come with fighting in armour the abrasions the bruises where your armour turned a blow the punctures where a scale was driven in through the leather add to that the sheer fatigue no matter how high your conditioning and you can see why a camp is silent after a battle tempers flare men curse each other i had never experienced so total a defeat as lade after the battle at ephesus i was busy rescuing a corpse and such heroic stuff i missed the despair or perhaps i was too young despair is a killer children ive seen it in women whose childbirth goes on too long and ive seen it in sick men but it is worst in a beaten army men kill themselves the poets dont sing of it but it happens too often men cut themselves or walk into the sea men die from wounds that ought to have healed priests are busy saving what they can good doctors make a difference but on the day after a defeat the men who matter are the leaders anyone can lead men after a victory only the best can lead after a defeat i awoke the day after lade to the realization that stephanos was dead and philocrates and nearchos one by one the weight of them came to my mind so that it was as if their shades were gathering around me philocrates was on my ship wrapped in his chlamys and stephanos was wrapped in his himation on trident to a greek thats some consolation we would honour them in death but not today i got up poured myself a cup of wine and felt the pain of all my muscles and all my wounds new and old my head hurt i said a prayer to my ancestor heracles for strength and i began to clean my armour promising that if ever i came through this to my farm in boeotia i would build a shrine to heracles and put his lion on the inside of my shield do you sheltered children know what armour looks like after a fight sprayed with blood with all the fluids inside a man with ordure shit and the leather full of sweat and fear but i had no hypaspist to do it and i needed to look like a hero when my armour was clean and bright i began on my shield the rim was broken where the brave aegyptian had almost killed me and the raven of apollo seemed to me a mockery apollo had promised me victory apollo had allowed the samians to betray us apollo had allowed treachery to triumph over virtue fuck him let me say now before i go on with the story that we would have won lade if the samians hadnt cut and run i know thats not the popular view i know that today athenians suggest that the ionians were an effeminate bunch incapable of defeating persia without the spine of sparta and athens to hold them to the task but thats all crap the phoenicians came to that battle wary of us and the aegyptians wanted no part of it and in effect only fought to defend themselves if the samians had held their place in the line epaphroditos would have routed the aegyptians and we would have won why do i tell you this because my rage and bitterness were boundless the cupidity the foolishness the greed of a few men had killed my friends and robbed me of my love the day after lade i wanted revenge let me be clear honey bee i still do i washed in the sea that hurt believe me nothing like salt water on new wounds then i put on a clean wool chiton and boots and my newly cleaned shirt of persian scales i put my sword belt on my shoulder black came into my tent as i finished arming myself so he asked gather the men i said no more and he went idomeneus took his cue from me and he had a tyrian cloak on his shoulder and my good bronze breastplate on his back when he came to me harpagos looked like a fisherman in a wool cap i beckoned him to me walked him into my tent and bade him dress like a trierarch part of leading is playacting i said you must dress the part today we have to pull them up a hill the way an ox pulls a cart everything matters he shrugged yes lord he said i dressed him in a red wool himation and a plain linen chitoniskos with a leather stola idomeneus brought him a fine cretan helmet from a dead phoenician officer the helmet was covered in repousse a work of art ive never owned anything so fine harpagos said i shrugged enjoy it i said idomeneus grinned i frowned at him you are the only man in this camp smiling i said good fighting yesterday he said we lived no reason to cry that was idomeneus a man who lived at the edge of madness i suspect black wore a magnificent chiton when we emerged purple with red and blue edgestripes like waves as nice a piece of cloth as id ever seen and he had the sword id taken from the old persian not that i begrudged him it so we made a good show the men were surly and quiet but when they saw us they understood immediately and i saw men wipe their faces and look at the dirt on their hands good we lost i said there were about three hundred men on the beach where the day before fifteen times that many had eaten breakfast and offered sacrifice we lost but life goes on lord miltiades will not stop fighting neither will we as long as there are fat aegyptian merchants to take and gold to spend all that got was a grumble the persians wont stir today i said pointing across the bay we hurt them badly and theyll lick their wounds but tomorrow theyll come for us so well have to be gone away downwind to chios where well put philocrates and stephanos in the ground and say the rites for all those who went down that got a better reaction but first i said and every head came up every set of eyes locked on mine but first i mean to complete our crews in miletus and take off every man woman and child we can save before the persians storm it which will happen any hour i looked around and the only sound was the wind making the empty tents flap like untended sails we came here to save those people i said we can still save some anyone with me not bad thugater not bad at all they were all with me as it turned out we kept a good watch all day so we knew when the persians launched their assault on miletus just a few stades distant they didnt take it by surprise or anything like but they knew that the town was nearly empty and probably further lost to despair than we were on the beaches most of the fleet of miletus was lost in the fighting the handful of ships who survived ran for samos and chios not a single ship ran for their own port not even histiaeus himself who left istes in command of a city denuded of fighting men as i say we kept watch twice we saw patrols set off from the beaches opposite but neither came any closer than ten stades my two ships were hidden by the bulk of the island who would have expected us to hide in plain sight at sunset we launched most men had slept all day our muscles were stiff but we ate every animal we found on the beach cows goats all abandoned by the greeks and wed stowed carefully the best of the loot from the rest of the campaign our weapons and little else once afloat we lay on our oars in the channel between lade and miletus our oars muffled and every man silent the rocks hid us from the town and from the besiegers but we could hear the fighting the town was falling there was no question of it i was in a curious race with time i couldnt let my ships be seen against our shore when we moved or the phoenicians and the aegyptians and the cilicians would be on us like vultures but if i waited too long the town would fall black waited with apparent impassivity but harpagos walked up and down the command deck of his trireme and his bare feet were the loudest noise in the channel gulls moved and cried the wind blew through a camp devoid of greeks in the distance there was a murmur like summer thunder i remember the darkness of that hour and the despair i hid if i must remind you the disaster of lade lost me briseis for ever as it seemed the persians have a phrase they tell a condemned nobleman to go and hunt his death well i was on the edge of hunting my death or perhaps past it but i had my men in order and i had fired them for this task and i meant to do an honourable job before i hunted my death the sun was a line of crimson in the west and our shore was dark as new pitch lets go i whispered give way all black said every oar dipped and we ghosted down the channel followed by harpagos we made the turn and there was the town miletus was afire the palace on the acropolis was burning great gouts of fire leaping into the air like live daimons and the summer thunder sound wed heard was now the greatthroated roar of a city being destroyed by fire and sword miletus the richest city in the greek world we crept up the passage to the harbour our oars carefully handled our hulls tight against the mainland shore to avoid being seen i began to curse i could see soldiers in the streets of the lower town and people running and being killed but there was no resistance apollo render justice i said aloud you owe me better than this and just then i heard the horn from the windy tower of course that citadel on the harbour was the last to fall i should have guessed it from the first i could see men on the walls archers and my heart leaped lay me under the sea wall by the tower i said to black pointing aye lord he said we turned in the mouth of the harbour and i loved my men every oarsman of them as we raced for the tower i leaped to the jetty and idomeneus followed me pole off i called or well be swamped wait for my word black waved they were fighting hand to hand on the steps of the tower when i slipped in the postern with idomeneus the startled sentry took one look at us and at the two great dark hulls behind us on the towers jetty and he fell to his knees you we came for you i said take me to istes if he lives we ran along the walls all my wounds and all my fatigue forgotten where men were leaning and pointing at the ships it was worth it all the waiting and the strain on muscles to see those men who had thought that they were dead realize that they were going to live istes was in the arch of the courtyard steps with a dozen other hoplites holding the entrance i watched him fight for a minute in that time three souls went to hades on his blade and as many fell back wounded or simply too frightened to face him to fight that well when you have no hope is a great gift or a great curse in the pyrrhiche we practise replacing one another in combat it is practised in every town in every polis in every gymnasium no man can fight for ever you switch with him i said to idomeneus ill get this organized idomeneus flexed his shoulders and set his aspis and grinned aye lord dont go and get killed i said im low on friends i added his mad grin flashed and he kissed me ill do my best lord he said he stepped up behind istes none of the other men in the courtyard seemed to feel any need to give their lord a rest then in between kills he tapped twice hard on istes backplate istes flashed a backwards look idomeneus tapped a rhythm on his shield and one and two istes pivoted on his hips and slid diagonally to the right rear and idomeneus lunged forward right foot first with a sweeping overhead cut that forced the persian facing istes to back a step and then idomeneus filled the spot and killed the persian with a feint and a back cut and the line was as solid as it had been a moment before istes sank to a knee and breathed then his helmet came off and he raised his head and saw me for a long moment all he did was breathe and look at me you came to die with us he asked youre as mad as he is i said pointing at idomeneus i came to rescue you you softhanded asiatic then he embraced me oh gods i thought we were all dead and no man would even sing of our end theres no counting the fucking persians and theres greeks with them armoured men fighting for their slavemasters i need you to get your men off the walls and into the ships i said there are fifty women and children as well he said when the lower town fell the smart ones ran here i have two ships i said i will leave no one behind even if it means i have to swim then he embraced me again and ran off through the courtyard calling for his officers the hard part would be holding the stairs and the gate until the boats were loaded the men on the stairs would be unlikely to live and it is harder to get men to die when they know there is hope but istes men loved him he told off ten to take the places of those fighting at that moment who were the first to go to the boats still dazed from combat and from their turn of fortune the next trick was to get the archers off the citadel walls without letting the persians and lydians know they were leaving i saw teucer and waved he came down off the walls i heard you were here he said a grin covering his face its true youll take us all off i laughed despair had left me save a hundred lives and youll find it hard to despair every milesian going on board my ships gave heart to my rowers every woman with a babe in her arms was like new life for a wounded marine i tapped idomeneus when i saw him flag the persians were relentless they came in waves determined to finish us and they still didnt know we were leaving he hamstrung an archer with a thrust under his shield pivoted as the man screamed and i was in his place before the man had fallen to the ground the persian behind the falling man had a long spear with a heavy ball of silver on the end i stabbed at him three fast strokes the same attack every time the third time went past his defences and my spearhead went through his wrist into his neck the man to my left fell i have no idea what happened and suddenly our line was gone i powered forward into the press and my spear played on them like a stork taking frogs i felt faster and stronger than other men and i felt no fear i was the saviour of miletus that night and the flames of the dying city framed my victims i cleared the stairs what more can i say i put down eight or ten men and the rest fled i took blows on my armour and my opponents were not fully armed men but it was still one of my best moments and yet i remember little save that i stood alone at the head of the stairs and breathed like a horse after a race and behind me the line restored itself and the men began to call my name arimnestos arimnestos they called down at the base of the steps i heard officers calling and men were forming i picked up a heavy spear that lay discarded hefted it and then i stepped out into the arrows of the persians two thudded into my shield but i knew that the gods had made me immune i stepped up and threw that spear into one of the persian officers he took it under his arm and i stepped back and laughed i took advantage of the lull to look at the citadel doors but they were smashed and nothing could close the gate but a line of men come to me i yelled at the milesians and they shuffled forward warily i might be their saviour but i was a stranger stand here i beckoned to the men in the courtyard close up like a phalanx no spaces listen to me their arrows cant reach you here when we retreat the left files retreat up the left wall stairs and the right files up the right wall stairs understand we still had a minute i grabbed the rightmost and leftmost men follow me i called and i took them in the gate you go that way single file like forming or unforming the pyrrhiche he didnt understand but another man did and i pushed the first man into the third rank sorry lad i need a thinker you can you live long enough to get them up these stairs the new phylarch shrugged here they come the men at the gate called i got back there with my two appointed phylarchs we had time to take our places me in the centre of the line they at either end we were seven men to a rank three ranks deep listen up i said we take their charge and hold on my word we give ground to the edge of the courtyard and then charge can you do it no shirking all together and then they came at us it was the bodyguard cyrus led from in front and i knew him as soon as he came up the steps and he knew me as i heard it later from my shouted commands these were the best of artaphernes men picked swordsmen nobles all and men of discipline they came into us together and our line gave a step and then we were fighting cyrus didnt come against me by luck or the will of the gods he had a big wicker shield and he pushed it into the man next to me i didnt await the onset of my man i threw a spear low and took my man in the ankle and down he went and i went forward into the space right past cyrus i had my second spear and my shield was better than theirs my second spear like my old deerkiller had a wicked tapered point like a needle and i used it ruthlessly in the firelit dark ramming it through wicker shields into their shield arms i dont know how many men i wounded that way but it was more than three and then i stepped back into my place in the ranks leaving a hollow behind me break i called and we turned like a school of fish threatened by a dolphin and fled just ten steps in the tunnel and i turned stand i said and the milesians turned and stood like heroes charge i called and we went at the startled persians we had men down and so did they and the footing was treacherous and on balance it was foolish of me to charge like that but foolish things are unexpected things and we crashed into them and pushed them right off the platform of the steps so that one of my fileleaders took an arrow in the side wed overcharged and we were in the open back i called we shuffled back as a storm of arrows fell on the portico i tripped a man grabbed at my leg and i was looking into cyruss helmet my sword point stopped a fingers width from his eye doru he said he managed a smile although i was about to slay him i stepped over him can you walk i asked and he managed to get to one knee another wounded guardsman rose holding his left arm where id put a spear into it no doubt let them go i told my men apollo witless lying god witness my mercy six persians shuffled away they didnt meet our eyes but they lived and they had fought well as my hero eualcidas of eretria told me once everyone runs sometime i could hear argument in the darkness istes came up beside me were out he said all but ten archers up on the walls with all our remaining arrows no time like the present i said by files to the right and left retire istes laughed you dorians have orders for everything he said we backed up the tunnel and then they came at us greeks in armour they came fast hard and silent and the man who led them had a great scorpion on his shield he put my right fileleader down and sent his shade away screaming at the first contact and the line couldnt rally because the end men were retreating up the stairs suddenly our orderly flight was chaos istes went forward into the fight and all i could do was go with him for ten heartbeats maybe twice that the two of us held ten armoured men istes killed a man in that time he was that good i didnt i was facing three men and one of them was the man with the scorpion on his shield it was archilogos it was bound to happen sometime i had sworn to save him and his family before all the gods at the shrine of artemis and he was one of the best fighters in the greek world we had the same training wed been in the same battles the gods send us these challenges to see what were made of i think the last thing i wanted archilogos to know was that he was immune to my blade i rammed my shield into his and made him stumble and then i thrust at each of his two companions fast as a cat and then i jumped back istes as i said killed his man he felt me back away and he backed and then we backed together archilogos shouted for his men to get around me theyre abandoning the gate he roared as the leftmost man sprang forward i threw my second spear and caught him in the outstretched leg and down he went i was out of spears but i felt the righthand stairs to the wall under my right heel archilogos came for me again and i backed up a step and then another and then he cut at my feet remember i had boots on not greaves because of my wounds i got my shield in late too late and he got a piece of my leg his blade slicing through my boot through my bandages to lay a line of icy fire across my calf but my shield rim caught his helmet as he leaned into the blow and staggered him and he fell another man leaped into his place and i backed another step and my heart fell to see the amount of blood id already lost the step i abandoned glittered in the light of the doomed city i backed again and the new man cut at my legs i had no qualms about killing this ephesian and i parried his blow with my sword and turned my xiphos over his blade and cut his throat a nasty move learned in closequarter fighting not very sporting but i thought i was dying put yourself in my place i had lost everything friends lover ship the rescue of the milesians would make my name for ever i thought and if i died here what more could i want a sad end but a great song i could trust phrynichus if he survived his wound to write of it when i took that wound i thought i was done it was too damned far to the ships and i was losing blood like a dying man but nor am i a quitter i killed the man with my xiphos and i got up another step idomeneus leaned past me with a spear and put it through the next comers faceplate and i was up another step teucer shot the next man and he fell back an arrow in his upper thigh and he swept the steps clean for a hundred heartbeats then idomeneus got a hand under my arm and i was up on the wall it is good to have companions im finished friends i said idomeneus picked me up bodily like fuck you are he said our wall was empty teucer was the last man behind us he shot ran to us turned and shot again no man of the ephesians even wearing full armour wanted to be the first to put his head above the parapet can you stand idomeneus asked he could see something i couldnt no i responded the world was going dark on me he stood me up anyway i sank to one knee teucer cried no and shot right over my head the wall had a crenellated parapet on the city side but on the courtyard side just a low wall to keep foolish or drunken sentries from falling to their deaths on the flagstones benath the stairs were recessed into the wall we couldnt see the enemy on our steps but i could see even as the curtain came down over my eyes the line of armoured men racing up the far steps and istes alone on the wall taking them i have never seen anyone fight as well unless perhaps it was sophanes but that was later and sophanes wasnt fighting in the last moments of a losing battle doomed against overwhelming odds istes threw them from the wall he stabbed them he baffled with his shield his cloak his sword and they died but he was flagging i could see it and hed sent his men away they all said as much later in fact istes never intended to reach the ships i saw him there burning with godlike power on the wall fighting so well that he seemed to glow with his own light he had full bronze cuirass helmet greaves thigh guards arm guards shoulder cups shield face and his armour caught the fire of his city as it died and rendered it a golden sun atop its last defended wall teucer had three arrows left and he used them all for his lord three more ephesians sent to hades then idomeneus was there having put me down to run all the way around the wall to istes idomeneus threw his spear over istes shoulder and then tapped his shoulder but istes shook his head and went shield to shield with a big man behind that man was the scorpion archilogos had shaken off my blow i dragged myself one step at a time paralleling istes retreat helmeted heads began to peek above our stairs on the far wall the man behind archilogos fell with an arrow in his side teucer cursed that was my last arrow lord i managed a laugh might have been better if you hadnt told them i said there was a great black puddle under me i got to my feet anyway on the opposite wall archilogos my boyhood friend faced istes the best sword in the world istes glowed gold miletus he roared archilogos took his sword cut on his aspis and pushed forward with it and istes stumbled back and archi cut up under the shield with his sword once twice as fast as a hawk stooping and istes stumbled back and i could see his shield arm was wounded now istes had fought all day and he knew he would die but archilogos showed himself to be a master he gave the golden man no respite and cut again a heavy blow to the helmet he got istes shield in the face though and he went back and istes backed a step idomeneus tapped him again and he said something later he told me that he begged istes to live istes didnt reply except to charge archilogos he had his arms out and he ran like a man finishing a race and he swept my childhood friend and slavemaster off the wall in his arms and they fell together to the courtyard and as he fell he roared miletus one more time and then he was gone and his armour rang as he hit the flagstones teucer had got me to the ropes over the wall by then i must have been lighter by the weight of all my blood but i remember stepping on a spear that one of the men had dropped to slide more easily to the ships go i said to teucer he shook his head go you fool i said he let go of my shoulder grabbed the rope and slid off towards the deck of black raven i was the last man on the walls of miletus the last free greek i had no intention of leaving the spear came to me as a sign or so i thought and istes was dead and archilogos was dead so i had no reason not to be dead too i had the strength to raise the spear over my head and i set my shield and waited for the rush i could hear their feet on the walls and i couldnt see very well but i knew they were coming one ephesian came out of the dark and his aspis hit my boeotian shield to shield and mine broke like a childs toy the blows from the aegyptian must have weakened it but even blind with blood loss i got my spear into his face and he went down cursing i stepped back and caught a breath i was still alive i can only tell this as i saw it honey what i will say is what i saw helen came to me on the wall or aphrodite or perhaps briseis i like to think it was briseis her hair was unbound and her skin glowed like a goddess this is not your fate love she said and she was gone thats what i saw so i threw the spear as hard as i could right along the parapet i stumbled backwards my fingers reaching for the rope almost blind i found it even as a blow rang off the scale shirt on my back a spearthrust on the heavy yoke over the shoulders i fell my hands holding the rope and my feet dropped free of the wall and i slid down the rope my palms burned but i wouldnt let go im told i hit the mast quite hard i was already pretty far gone and i fell to the deck as if dead all my sinews cut but my armour did its job and the wool stuffed in my helmet i remember the men crowding around me i remember hands on my leg and fire i have never run the stade since the women wept and keened and men as well as the oarsmen pulled us away into the dark i lay cushioned in blood loss far away and yet able to think clearly enough and black raven unfolded his wings and swept us out to sea the phoenicians and the cilicians and the aegyptians never saw us or thought we werent worth their trouble or simply let us go we saved teucer and a hundred other soldiers five gentlemen of property and another hundred women and children four thousand died and forty thousand were sold into slavery and that was just the start we made chios in three days three desperate days when harpagos idomeneus and black did the work of keeping us alive while my body made the hard choices between life and death i missed the moment when idomeneus made a speech he ordered the treasure thrown over the side and he told them that the babes of the milesians would be their treasure and asked them to count the weight of the silver and tell him which was the most valuable and they cheered as they threw it over i missed that although it is all part of the story the milesians pitched in and rowed and we shared what food we had and everyone who had lived to flee the walls of miletus lived to see the beaches of chios the next thing i remember was melaina weeping there was a pyre for stephanos and another for philocrates and phrynichus wept as he said their elegies alcaeus of miletus one of the gentlemen wed rescued organized funeral games melaina cared for me cleaning my wounds bathing me cleaning away the wastes of my body my fever broke in the second week and by the third week i could walk summer was almost over the persians will come i said come with me i owe you and your brothers shade that much she shrugged ill stay anyway she said im a fishermans daughter i dont like the change and my father is here and my sisters and all the children can you move the whole of chios another week while my body healed black was restless eager to get to sea suddenly there were cilician pirates everywhere and down the coast a village burned finally i set a sailing date the evenings were brisk and the sun was lower in the sky we sat and drank wine until the sun set wine that went straight to my head and we ate a big tuna that melainas father caught he came and clapped me on the shoulder stephanos loved you he said youre a good man that made me cry i cried easily in those days it was harder to abandon chios than it had been to leave miletus because unlike these cheerful fisherfolk i knew what was coming to them the light hand of persia was about to be replaced by an iron fist i watched the sun set and i knew that it would be a long time before i saw it rise here in the east melaina came into my bed that last night while i lay looking at the rafters i didnt send her away although our lovemaking had more grief to it than lust but she left before dawn and she was a proper daughter again on the beach when she poured a libation and washed harpagoss shield in wine then my keel was in the water and i ceased to think of her because we went to sail an ocean full of enemies we ran north evading everything we saw until we entered the bosporus kallipolis was still free we beached and i embraced miltiades ill make this brief we wintered there in the spring histiaeus istes brother who left him to die came to us asking that we follow him to make a preemptive attack on the coast of phoenicia to show that the east greeks werent beaten it was a strategy that was a year too late ill stay and defend the chersonese miltiades said it is mine but i will lose no more men in asia histiaeus was captured in phrygia a month later trying to forage for food for his oarsmen datis executed him for treason it was a cheap death for a man who had led the ionian revolt he should have died on the walls with his brother less than a week later datis flooded the chersonese with scythian and thracian mercenaries he outspent miltiades ten to one and in a week we lost four of our towns we expected it though the east was lost we loaded our ships taking every greek man and woman the survivors of miletus and methymna and teos and all of miltiades men and their women we filled ten triremes and as many athenian grain ships and we sailed away the scythians burned kallipolis behind us but we left it empty datis landed an army on lesbos and he swept the island with a chain of men all the way across looking for rebels he crucified those he caught and he took the best of the boys and all of the unmarried girls and sold them as slaves or took them for the harem then he went to chios and did the same there was no force in the world that could stop him he harried the aeolians selling their children to brothels and then he harried the ionians and humiliated them island by island until there was no longer the sigh of a girl or the worship of aphrodite from sardis to delos he broke the world of my youth he destroyed it i grew to manhood in the world of alcaeus and sappho he destroyed sapphos school and sold the students to satisfy the lusts of his soldiers you children know the world athens made and you think it good i love athens but there was a fairer world once a brighter place with better poets and freer ways where greeks and persians could be friends with each other with aegyptians and lydians datis killed it to break the spirit of the greeks and reduce them to servitude truly it was the rape of the islands that taught us greeks what the persians were capable of and showed us why we would have to fight or see our culture die artaphernes resisted datis of course but datis was the great kings nephew and had won the great battle and artaphernes was considered soft on greeks datis raped the islands and we sailed away and left them i sailed black raven into corinth and unloaded the refugees while black took him back to sea as a paid ship for athens i brought them north to plataea idomeneus was a bastard for all i loved him and when the treasure had gone over the side none of it was mine or his so i still had riches and i spent them that summer i settled forty families in the vale of asopus and when i was finished the money of my piracy was gone washed clean in rescuing them from poverty or so i hoped and then i was just another farmer with a forge for my gold was gone while i was spending money like a drunken sailor i heard the rumours that i was a murderer that i was accursed of apollo all my fathers friends spoke up for me as well as all my own friends hermogenes and epictetus the younger and myron and his sons but my absences my riches and the constant murmurs of the sons of simon from thebes had their effect men pushed me away in the little ways that men use when they are afraid and to my shame i responded with arrogance and let the distance grow it was a dark winter with one beam of light for when i was settling my milesians i met antigonus of thespiae the young basileus of that town he took ten of my families and made them citizens and we became friends quickly and as quickly he courted my sister he was a wealthy man and he might have had any maiden in the valley of the asopus but he courted pen and in the spring he wed her and men came to that wedding who had whispered about me and my life was the better for it my mother stayed sober until the priest was gone and i kissed her and she cried then i folded my finery away and went back to the forge and she went back to drinking and men went back to whispering that the corvaxae were all accursed there were other fights that last year but the ionian revolt died with istes as he fell shouting miletus i suppose we thought that the long war was over and i had forgotten my slave girl i tried to forget briseis and melaina i tried to forget all of it i ignored my armour and my helmet and i worked on bronze kettles and drinking cups until the archon came and asked me to return to teaching the pyrrhiche my calf throbbed and burned and my hips hurt when we danced but they all admired my splendid persian scale shirt and my rich red cloak and myron came and embraced me your new citizens have made us richer by a thousand gold darics he said and fifty shields in the phalanx hermogenes said the men of plataea came to me and clasped my arm glad to have you back they said but now i sensed the hesitation in their grips and the tendency of their eyes to wander when they spoke plataeans didnt just take off to fight in other peoples wars or show up with a passel of foreigners but i was the devil they knew and by then thanks to the wordfame of my role at lade i was famous so famous that it was hard for my neighbours to accept me as a man who danced and sweated and had trouble with his grape vines fame makes you different ask any man who has won the laurel at olympia or nemea may none of you ever experience defeat and the death of all your friends idomeneus remained back at the tomb of the hero but he was as mad as a wild dog black was fighting against aegina for athens hermogenes was like another man a good man but a farmer and a husband all the rest of them were dead even archilogos was dead and i didnt dare allow my mind to think about briseis in some way i let her be dead as well but one of the saddest truths of men is that no grief lasts for ever my helmet was waiting just where i had left it on a leather bag on the great square bench that pater had built i had to hobble around the shop my calf never healed and as i said i never ran well again and i was angry all the time hermogenes forced me to work and tiraeus fired the forge and after mending a few pots my hands remembered their duty i think it was a month after the pyrrhiche and perhaps three months after pens wedding before i looked at the helmet i was surprised by what a good helmet it was how far along i had left it it seemed like ten years like a lifetime there was the ding where id misstruck when the boy came to me with news from idomeneus i blinked away tears then i took out the ding with careful methodical planishing which seemed more restful than dull when the bowl was as smooth as briseiss breasts i turned the helmet over and looked at the patterns id incised i had started the ravens on the cheekplates before i left i did not love lord apollo any more but the ravens seemed apt if i ever stood in the phalanx again i wanted to wear ravens instead of going to work on the helmet i took a piece of scrap pounded it out flat and tapped the ravens to life on a practice piece i made a dozen errors but i worked through patiently reheating as i went it was two days before i was satisfied and then i went back and put the ravens on the cheekplates in an afternoon i had time left to go and help my slaves prop the grape vines then i went back looked my work over carefully and polished it as the sun set behind the hills of home i filled the ravens with lead on the inside planished a little more tiraeus kept an eye on me while he put a new bail on an old bronze bucket for the temple and then he looked at my work youve grown up he said and then his voice rough he pointed at the back of the skullpiece little rough there i picked up the hammer tingting tingting part ii marathon beneath this stone lies aeschylus son of euphorion the athenian who perished in the wheatbearing land of gela of his noble prowess the grove of marathon can speak and the longhaired persian knows it well epitaph on the stele of aeschylus the playwright it was late autumn and the rains lashed the farm and my slaves stayed in by the fire and made baskets for the next years crop i was in the forge hammering out the face of a new aspis i needed a shield the world was moving i could feel it the last cities of lesbos were falling to the persians and in athens the stasis the conflict between the aristocrats and the demos was so bad that it had come to murder in the streets or so men said and persian gold flowed like water to buy the best men closer to home thebes had begun agitating to take our city or at least reduce our boundaries and one voice carried clear from their agora to ours simon son of simon loud in condemnation of our archon myron and eager for my blood small traders bought us this news empedocles the priest came out from thebes in the last golden light of autumn while the hillside of cithaeron was a glow of red oak leaves when he had given the blessing of hephaestus to my forge and relit our fires after we swept the shop he raised tiraeus to the rank of master as the man deserved then he looked at my helmet running his thumb over the eyebrows and using calipers to pick out the measurements of the ravens on the cheekpieces this is master work he said he handed it to tiraeus and tiraeus handed it to bion and you are the master in this shop so it is right that you too should be raised i think that the fires in my heart relit that day i had not expected it although in retrospect there were a thousand little signs that my friends had made plans for me to be raised to the rank of master other pieces were brought out by tiraeus things id forgotten like a set of bronze pins id made for my sisters wedding guests and empedocles laughed with joy to see them and that laughter went through me like lightning on a summers day i was you know for a time the master warrior of all hellas but it never gave me the joy that making gave me oh theres a lie killing can be a joy or merely a job or worse so because two of us had been raised we gave a special sacrifice at the temple of hera where my sister now a matron had just been anointed as a priestess she was two months pregnant just starting to show and she officiated with the dignity of her new status and antigonus of thespiae saw nothing wrong with having a master smith as a brotherinlaw so he came with a train of aristocrats to my sacrifice and myron arrived with the best men of plataea and i saw the wine of a whole crop drained in a few hours but i reckoned it wine well spent because my heart was beating again the next day i took ten more amphorae of wine up the hill to the tomb of the hero and i gave a smaller feast for idomeneus and his men and many of our milesians as well we drank and we danced idomeneus had built a great bonfire five trees worth of wood and we alternated between too hot and too cold drank the wine and sang it was late in the evening and the fire burned high and the younger men and women were piling my straw into a great bale the better to share other warmths i was twentyseven and i had never felt so old but i was happy pleasantly tired from dancing the first good dancing since my leg was wounded i was a master smith and men came to my forge to talk about the affairs of the city i might have been content idomeneus came and leaned against me in the warmchill of the fires edge what ever happened to that slave girl you took away to athens he asked did you sell her i had forgotten the gods sometimes work all together and the next day when my head rang like my forge from the wine hermes sent me a messenger from athens with payment for a load of finished bronze he brought news that miltiades had been arrested for wishing to restore the tyranny and he brought a letter from phrynichus and a copy of his play the famous fall of miletus when i read it i wept in the letter phrynichus explained that the play had been written to awaken the men of athens to what the persians were up to he said that he had written it so that men might recognize miltiades for his role in trying to save the east greeks and he asked me to come to the opening of the play in athens they have a different form of theatre to what we have in boeotia and i think i should explain once in my grandfathers time i suppose drama was about the same everywhere much like a rhapsode singing the iliad except that the poet or a professional musician performed works of praise to the gods or sometimes the story of a hero in athens there was always a set of plays at least three and the best of the three received a prize in honour of the god dionysus athens was certainly not the only city to give praise to the god of wine nor to offer a prize for the finest poems in his honour but athens has a tendency to take things to extremes the tyrant hippias was a great worshipper of dionysus and men say that he inaugurated the practice of using a chorus a group of singers to support the main line of the play so the dramas became more like a team sport the poet or singer and his team of chorus members competed it was demanding both physically and mentally and that competition fired men to make it better more complex more vivid while i was a slave in ephesus someone brought in the interaction between chorus and poet so that men spoke and answered each other as if in a simple conversation in the agora this may seem a small thing to you children but imagine a poor peasant from attica allowed to watch heracles debate with the gods over his fate agamemnon begging his son to avenge him strong stuff sophists decry it as the end of mens piety but ive always loved it phrynichus had long led the way winning prize after prize but when he wrote the fall of miletus he set drama on another course because instead of writing about the gods and heroes he wrote about an event that had just happened in the world of men his play had many actors not just a chorus but a dozen more men each taking a separate role there was istes fighting to the last on the wall and histiaeus and miltiades and me i was not a citizen of athens then so i was not permitted to appear in the play besides that might have seemed to some like hubris but phrynichus asked me to come to the judging of the play to stand with him as his guest and to stand by miltiades the crops were in and my slaves were for the most part decent men who could work for a month without me besides hermogenes would be there and tiraeus i didnt stop to think i took a horse borrowed idomeneuss young man styges as my servant and rode over the mountain to attica this time i was much more careful in my approach to mighty athens and i rode clear around the city and arrived at aristides gate as the autumn sun set and men pulled their chlamyses closer against the wind and dark cold his wife came to the gate summoned by servants she surprised me by granting me the flash of her smile and a quick kiss on the cheek arimnestos of plataea you are ever a friend of this house she said my husband is late coming in from the agora please come in i have always valued that woman despoina this is styges acting as my hypaspist he is no slave she nodded to him ill see to his bed then she said youll want to bathe not a question i was just clear of my bath towelling down and wishing i had not put quite so much warm water on her floor when aristides came in through the curtain and embraced me his wool cloak still carrying the cold of the outside arimnestos he said i had last seen him as his ship swept past mine out of the pocket of death at lade you lived i said with satisfaction and you as well my plataean hero by the gods you fought like heracles himself he embraced me again other men had said as much but other men were not the softspoken prig of justice aristides and i valued those words well up to this very hour i followed him to a table set beside his wifes loom and the three of us ate together later it became the fashion to exclude women from many things but not then there was meat from a sacrifice fresh tuna a magnificent fish good barley porridge and rich wheat bread in plataea it would have been a feast in athens it was merely dinner with a rich man how stands the case with miltiades i asked after i had eaten my fill among greeks it is bad manners to ask hard questions during a meal truth to tell it is bad manners in persia in aegypt in sicily and in rome too aristides wiped his fingers on a cloth my sister would have kicked him but customs differ from town to town and pursed his lips on the evidence the jury can do nothing but convict him he said i could hear something in his voice i raised an eyebrow but i asked he shrugged men are seldom convicted on evidence he said miltiades case has become a test of the reach of the great king into our city the case was brought with malice by the alcmaeonids and i have reason to believe that the great king paid for it to be done i laughed and the sad truth is that every one of us knows that miltiades had every intention of seizing the city aristides frowned i wish you would phrase things more accurately plataean we know nothing of the kind we know what he might have done had he defeated the persians and medes at lade he shrugged i confess that i laughed aristides i said as i understood you are his advocate you his enemy his wife laughed and i slapped the table and the athenians byword for justice and honour glared at us as if he was our pedagogue and we were errant children its not funny he snapped try stopping a man from laughing with those words besides he said i am hardly his enemy of course not i said i laughed again i couldnt help myself and his wife joined me why is it he asked when we began to breathe again that visitors here always mock me and you despoina always abet them i put a hand on his shoulder if you will be better than other men you must be patient with their mockery i said besides we only tease you because we love you why aristides asked like most righteous men he was impatient of teasing and had neither defence against it nor any idea why it was directed at him i shook my head and gave up forgive me lord i said imagine im but a poor witless foreigner and tell me how miltiades might survive this charge aristides ignored my tone and nodded very well he said taking me at my word the question before the jury ought to be whether miltiades sought to make himself tyrant or not but the question that is actually facing the jury is simpler and more complex whether athens ought to resist persia or not had we won lade this trial would never have come about i decided that i should not make the point that if we had won lade miltiades would have landed here with fifty triremes and five thousand hoplites and made himself master in short order better not to say every thought that comes to ones mind men know that the great king took miletus thanks to phrynichus starting tomorrow men will hear how close we came to defeating datis and how we were betrayed by the aristocrats of samos do you know that the trierarchs there were stoned by a mob or that the eleven captains who stood with us are to have statues someday i will find dionysius of samos in a dark alley i said too late aristides said his oarsmen killed him to erase the shame of their defection good for them i said it was truly the best news id heard all day his shade will never go to elysium we poured libations to zeus who watches over oaths and to the furies who avenge men who are wronged so aristides continued when the wine was pooling on the floor to summarize we seek to remind every juror and indeed every man that we fought with the men of miletus and that but for betrayal we would have been victorious and we seek to remind them that if the great king rules here our sons and daughters will service his soldiers like the virgins of lesbos and chios that was close to a blatant lie it was at least stretching the facts the rape of the islands had been a horror but it didnt represent the daily policy of the great king on the other hand it had been terrible i nodded and if the men of this city see persia as a threat and see that we can stand against the great king then they will silence the alcmaeonids and stand their ground and miltiades will be found innocent aristides had risen to his feet he was giving a speech i clapped so did his wife he sat down and hung his head but here in my own home ill say that i have very little hope he said they tried to kill sophanes today i grinned i didnt know that sophanes was yet alive ive seen that boy in action i said hired thugs will never get him yesterday themistocles was beaten he went on hes rising to be the head of the demos i have no time for him but hes with us against the alcmaeonids and their supporters he shrugged men are afraid to speak openly i rubbed my chin where is my suit against the alcmaeonids for my slave girl and my horse i asked aristides stopped as if hed been struck by zeus soter he said i had forgotten i must apologize miltiades is your proxenos and he should have reminded me a proxenos is the man usually a prominent man who represents the affairs of your city in his own miltiades was the proxenos of plataea in athens i took a sip of wine i mean to have that woman back i said ill turn to violence if i must i swore an oath which was recently brought to my attention it lowers me to admit this but i forgot her too more than a year since we swore the suit aristides said you must not turn to violence arimnestos this city is the symbol of the rule of law hmm i said thugs were beating my friends miltiades was in fear of his life from his own people and i felt alive for the first time in months by aristides shoulder jocasta raised an eyebrow and moved one long finger across her throat i got her message as clearly as if shed shouted it and i smiled at her what is there to grin at aristides asked i shrugged its good to be here with you i said with perfect honesty the next morning i went and visited miltiades who was being kept in one of the caves above the agora the men guarding him were mostly his friends im safe here he said with a smile after he hugged me unless aristides gets himself a bodyguard theyll kill him in the agora the rule of law is over the great king has bought the rich men and they have bought the thugs therell be little justice after this i could have said that there would have been little enough justice if he had made himself tyrant but to hades with that miltiades was my childhood hero and my friend i mean to take some action i said glancing around legal action miltiades asked you are a foreigner you are my proxenos i said and i have a lawsuit sworn against cleitus of the alcmaeonids so you do he said he shrugged and raised both eyebrows i fail to see why this is germane i looked around you trust all these men i asked of course miltiades said but his eyes said otherwise suffice it to say that if i move my case you will have to act for me i bowed miltiades was no aristides and he did not know the law the way the just man did and if there is no advantage to you lord i at least would reclaim the woman and the horse miltiades looked disgruntled but he was too good a man to be despondent ill do my best he promised i need to contact some witnesses i said paramanos and agios what have they to do with your damned horse he asked and then realization began to dawn he choked a moment coughed and called to a boy who stood by wearing the green and gold of miltiades father take lord arimnestos to piraeus he said and find the men he needs to see aye lord the boy said with a deep bow aristides was a good man the just man but it was civil war in the streets and by putting miltiades the fighter in irons the alcmaeonids had muzzled their opposition i meant to have my slave girl back and it seemed to me after looking around for a few hours that the fastest way through the tangle of athenian politics would be to break some heads i have great respect for democracy friends but democracy needs a little help sometimes the first man i met with was phrynichus he was easy to find in a good house high on the hill hard by the acropolis i asked my way there with one hand on my purse and a wary eye out for alcmaeonidpaid brutes he was happy to see me his fighting days were probably over his two wounds had both been almost mortal and he made it clear to me that he felt that the gods had sent him back to life to redress the balance of the loss at lade as he was the man who had sent the letter i stayed a night with him ate his food and tried to help out as much as possible as i could tell that he was living small his wife irene was kind careful with money and smitten with a sadness that often comes to those who cannot have children or perhaps poverty was wearing her down i had a cure for poverty and i took her aside while her husband napped she pulled a shawl over her head she was not used to talking to men without a chaperone present i put a purse on the table your husband never received his share from our last voyage i said carefully i dont like to speak of it i know he was there for the principle of the thing and not for filthy loot her eyes were carefully lowered but now they came up and locked on mine i understand she said steadily you are clearly more of a gentleman than some of our other friends i laughed dont believe it lady but that money is his and perhaps i could buy some wine for dinner she shook her head behind the shawl i for one would appreciate some decent wine she allowed when phrynichus was awake he sat with me at the farm table that dominated the main room irene is happier today he said what did you say to her i took the liberty of buying you some decent wine i said i put a hand on his shoulder as his face darkened dont give me any shit brother youre poor as a frog without a swamp and you need a decent amphora to get you through the play if it ever goes on he said fuck me arimnestos cleitus and the alcmaeonids paid to suppress it and now theyve threatened that if it goes on ill be beaten or irene will be they say theyll pay men to disrupt the performance the way they broke up miltiades festival of return i shook my head dont give an inch i said im working on the problem of the alcmaeonids what can you do he asked i mean no offence arimnestos but youre just a foreigner and you need a bodyguard i said i knew where to find one that night we ate good fish and drank good wine and irene lied like a good wife and said shed found a big silver piece in the floorboards and in the morning i made excuses and slipped away feeling bad for having done so phrynichus needed me but what he really needed was a success for his play my next stop was cleons he was more sober than when last id found him youre a thetes now i asked he shrugged i drank the money i made with aristides he said after they died i mean and spent some on whores he looked around the main room of his house it was clean because it was empty what trade do you work i asked he looked out of the door into the street i was a potengraver he said hard to explain really i cut the scenes into the surface of pots before the painter painted them on the most expensive items but theres a whole new style of painting now with no engraving and i dont get much work and what i do get well slaves earn as much as i do he shook his head before yani died i had a fishing boat my paters that kept us on the right side of the ledger but i sold it you dont have any land i asked not any more he allowed would you work for me here in athens he asked i watched him for a moment because i didnt need a drunk but i did need to know that the man whod stood at my shoulder in the fight at ephesus was still in there his hair was greying at the temples his chiton was dirty and he had the weathered skin of a man whod slept in alleys too many times no i said that is i need you here for a few days well break some heads and then youll have to leave because the alcmaeonids will eventually figure out who you are and kill you cleon looked blank and then and then you come with me to plataea and start again i walked over to him sell this house go to plataea and become a citizen stand at my shoulder be my friend on a farm he asked if thats what you can do yes i looked around the house anything to keep you here not a fucking thing cleon said who do we kill paramanos hugged me like a lost brother i had last seen him covered with wounds from lade and making a slow recovery when we fled kallipolis and we drank more wine than might have been wise its a funny thing paramanos and i could have been great friends all along i think but for the fact that i used fear to cow him in the first moments of his service under me and while he served me i think he hated me relationships between men can be as complicated as those between women but lade changed that as youll see after lade those of us who survived it we never forgot black joined us and herk my first tutor in the ways of the sea and he and cleon embraced and we drank too much cheap wine as i mentioned other men came around oarsmen sailors hoplites miltiades needs us i said agios once miltiades helmsman nodded and cleon shrugged but paramanos shook his head im not a citizen here he said and my status has been made abundantly clear when ive had my fees paid ill be taking my money and going back to cyrene black nodded i looked at him you too athens isnt my place he said herk youre a citizen i asked oh indeed he said born a thetes but in the last allotment i was a hippeis he shrugged the men of property treat me like shit for all that im a landowner now you think i lived in kallipolis as an exile i hate athens the city of aristocrats he looked around you know what for the commoners the tyranny was better cleon barked his strange laugh and i could see that the two of them got along very well i need to explain for me my loyalty to plataea was absolute to hear these three knock athens most especially herk who by all accounts had made his fortune in her service made me angry cleon i could understand his city had let him down but herk youre a thankless bunch i said miltiades made you rich in the service of athens and now he needs you and you are running off to cyrene paramanos stroked his beard yes he turned his head away ive been threatened my daughters have been threatened agios nodded clearly unhappy gentlemen sitting at this table are five bad men whose names make syrian merchants shit themselves and you are afraid of some threats from bumboys in piraeus i stood up im going to take action my actions are going to be carefully thought out but im not going to use the law except as bait when im done there wont be anyone to threaten your daughters join me we all owe miltiades paramanos made a curious face do we really owe miltiades friend he shrugged but his eyes met mine squarely be honest miltiades uses us and now that hes down he cant help us why should we help him listen if it was you or herk or black or cleon here id carve my way through the bastards but this is not my city and not my fight black shrugged im your helmsman he said you bought me free i do what you say he took a drink of wine i got married he added and moved as if he feared a reprisal you got married i asked whats she like like any athenian fishwife but louder paramanos said you can meet her later tell me why i should help i could marshal arguments heraclitus had taught me well but i shook my head no brother its up to you for all his little ways miltiades has been our friend i think we owe him i looked around yes he uses us and by the gods we know he wanted to be tyrant and hed have sold his own mother in a brothel to get it but how often have we followed him to riches eh paramanos shook his head you know we all know that well do it if only to find out what you have planned i need citizens i said i wasnt going to stop to consider his sudden change of heart id expected it how many oarsmen on your ships are citizens how many marines a dozen marines many of them are zeugitai members of the hoplite class and i can round up fifty oarsmen who are thetes he looked at me why the muscle have to be citizens i said and we have to have their families safe on salamis for instance my plan was simple far simpler than phrynichus and aristides and their plans with complex choruses and speeches by actors i explained what i had in mind and then we mustered the oarsmen it was winter most of them were delighted to have a few days work most of them were so poor when they were ashore that the prospect of moving their families to salamis the island off athens if you dont know it sounded like a festival i paid them enough to make it a festival being lowerclass men themselves they knew where i could find other men informants and the like that was likely to prove the breaking point of my plan and i had a simple solution to my need for information money twice i walked up the hills of athens to miltiades and asked him for more money ostensibly to plead my case as he was my proxenos it was his duty to help me and the first time he did so with a good grace the second time he was none too happy to loan me the value of a good farm in silver coin but he did what in the name of tartarus do you need all this silver for you plataean pirate buying jurors i said crime eats money the way vultures eat a dead beast bribing a jury is an old and honourable tradition in democratic athens one that blatantly favours the rich of course heh democracy all forms of government favour the rich honey i bought quite a few men i divided the sailors and marines into teams and i gave one to cleon and set them to watching phrynichus that was the most public team and i was going to make cleon vanish later he had an additional set of duties paying informers to look for my girl agios led the scout team they reconnoitred the alcmaeonid estates the problem with paying out so much money is that it is impossible to keep it quiet it was near dark every window had an oil lamp in it and the more civicminded brothelowners had a big lamp out front hanging from the exhedra as well i was climbing the hill in the alleys south of the panathenaic way to check on phrynichus when they came at me four men two of them filled the street ahead of me they had swords thats him the plataean one called out a friend sent us said the smaller of the two men ahead of us we think maybe we should reason with you he laughed i could hear movement behind me and i knew there were more of them but the two in front of me were right on the edge we were just shy of that moment when they would be keyed up enough to attack me ive watched the process often enough some men take for ever to be ready to fight and others can fight at any moment i put a hand on my own sword athens was none to keen on men carrying weapons in the streets but at dark with a heavy cloak no one would say anything about it the smaller man laughed again the odds were bad one against four is insanity unless you have no choice the street i was in an alley really was no wider than a man lying on his back full length and i was at an elbow where someones semilegal building crowded the street and made it bend one of the men behind me stubbed his toe on a cobblestone and cursed i heard the curse and felt the movement of his arms as he windmilled them to save himself and i turned on the ball of my foot and punched the point of my sword into his side i wasnt as clever as id wanted to be and my blade skidded over his arms and the point caught in his ribs and his fist connected with my face not hard enough to stun me but hard enough to rock me back worst of all as he fell away from me the point of my sword remained lodged in his ribs and the hilt was wrenched from my hand i pulled my cloak off by yanking it against the fine silver pin which popped open and tinkled as it landed in the street a nice find for the first child to look out of his door in the morning the cloak weights slammed the smaller of the two men in front of me in the face luck and training there and made him duck back when he could have gutted me theres no conscious thought in a fight like that there were no openings no holds no attacks that were going to get me free i had no weapon i kicked at the bigger of the men in front of me as i changed my stance and then i leaped through the unshuttered window to my left my back foot catching the oil lamp on the sill so that it landed behind me and exploded lamp oil on my cloak and on the floor and fire spreading up my cloak but i had a wall between me and my attackers i threw my burning cloak at them and turned to find three young men staring at me as if i was an apparition from the heavens perhaps i was with all the fire running along the floor behind me the fire not a very big fire i have to add kept my attackers back for the space of three or four heartbeats and by that time i was through the room curtain of wooden beads this was not a brothel or a wine shop it was a private house and i passed through a room with four looms against the four walls through another door as men shouted behind me and out into a courtyard there were two slaves standing by the gate and they looked as confused as men usually look in a crisis i went past them between them without slowing and i was in another street i ran up the hill i could see the pisistratids palace on the acropolis as a landmark i remember offering my prayers to heracles that i had so easily averted an ambush that should have killed me really if they hadnt stopped to talk to me id already have started to rot eh my prayers may have called the god to my aid but they were otherwise premature at the next corner i ran full tilt into the larger of the two men whod confronted me in the alley i bounced harder than he did and he landed most of a blow with something in his left hand a club i suspect it caught me on the outside of my left bicep hard and numbed my arm i stumbled back into a closed door and he recovered his balance grinned in the feeble light and came to finish me but he paused to yell ive got him to his mates and as he did that the door under my numb hand opened and i fell through it my legs pumping frantically to keep me upright so that i carried the young man whod opened the door right back into the room and knocked him flat he was quite small pretty and had makeup on his eyes which were wide with sudden terror id hurt him no doubt there was a cloak hanging on a wooden stand at the edge of the bed probably the boys own or forgotten by a client i snatched it as the big man came through the door i got it on my left arm which was numb but not useless and got my feet under me this was moving so fast that the pain of the blow from his cudgel was just hitting me the big man was coming in for the kill and i swirled the cloak which seemed to fill the tiny room and my right arm moved behind the cloak lost in it and my attacker flinched back it is a thing known to any trained man that men will flinch from a cloak or a stick when neither can do them any real harm even with a direct blow to the face but my cloak and my fist were both feints and my rightfoot kick caught him in the knee before he could shift his weight off it and i heard the joint pop he roared and went down the hand with the cudgel swept past me and it was as if hed decided to hand me his cudgel despite the dark and the confusion his left hand brushed against my right and the club was in my hand there were men in the alley outside by the sound of it there were quite a few of them not just the initial four my recent opponent was thrashing on the floor and roaring as he made no move to harm me i took a deep breath and hit him behind the ear with his own cudgel and he went out the painted boy squeaked and ran through a doorway id missed i followed him eager to avoid the men on the street we went straight into the buildings central courtyard which was full of men and boys on couches my hip caught a table of pitchers of water and wine and the whole thing fell with a crash then i was across the room through a door that seemed to me the biggest and into the buildings andron with painted wall panels and a garishly painted ceiling zeus and ganymede as you might expect then i ran out of the main door under a pair of kissing satyrs and into a street that was brilliantly lit by cressets in the building i had just left a prosperous brothel by the flickering light i could see men coming for me from the downhill end of the street a dozen at least so i turned and ran uphill there is no fighting a dozen men at the edge of darkness i went one street and turned into an alley i saw a big ceramic raincistern under a house gutter and leaped to it at full stride i got a leg over the roof edge and i was up i lay flat on the roof i was unable to breathe and my two wounds had burst into pain the way a flower opens with the dawn and it was all i could do not to cry out i heard men run by they were an arms reach away and meet with other men in the next street i looked around the roof it was a low building the sort of cheap private residence that filled the south slope of the hills before pericles rebuilt the city one storey mud brick on a stone foundation with beams holding a roof that was also a place to cook sleep in warm weather make love when privacy was required the couple wrapped in blankets and furs had various naked limbs sticking out and the man pulled the blankets closer as if blankets would protect him i ran to the centre of the roof and looked south was the high wall of the brothel and east was the wide panathenaic way but north uphill the next roof beckoned i had to keep moving the men below were not fools i ran leaped and my feet came down badly punching straight through the seagrass of the roof so that my groin landed on the beam and for a moment it was all i could do to curl my legs around the beam and moan in the building underneath me people screamed and their screams were answered by running feet sometimes the initial pain is worse than the resulting injury i got a knee up on the beam and the blow to my groin wasnt as debilitating as i had feared i sidestepped north as men gathered around the building and north again and this time i stepped over the roof barrier on to the next roof slate thank the gods and i ran across the firm surface i could smell a fire that burned charcoal and i could smell hot metal and i realized i was crossing the roof of a smithy a big one there was an alley at the northern edge of the smithy and i leaped it without pausing to reflect and my arms just caught the edge of the higher roof much higher because the alley was like a giant step up i hung there for long heartbeats trying to gain control of my legs over the pain and i swung my right leg over the roof edge and rolled my hips hurt and my groin hurt and my left shoulder screamed as if id been scalded with boiling water this roof had an outdoor kitchen and a small shed where the owner stored his brazier and spare pots i got myself into it a counsel of desperation let me tell you if they found me there i was dead no more retreat but i wasnt thinking well and my instinct was the instinct of the wounded animal i pulled the door closed and lay there panting i listened to the men in the street as they searched the houses broke in beat people or threatened them but actions have consequences and the fates were not blind to my predicament as they went from house to house causing mayhem men and women turned against them greeks dont take happily to the invasion of their homes however poor i heard the smith roar with rage as his dinner crashed to the floor when the thugs overturned his table he had weapons and the strength to use them and he hit a thug so hard that the blow had that telltale sound of a broken melon and then the wounded man started calling for his fellows the smith roared for the watch his voice carried and other voices housewives prostitutes and the patrons from the brothel joined in athens was a mighty city then but not so big that the uproar of throaty thugs and fifty citizens didnt carry quickly the scythian archers the city police since the time of the tyrants came just as a party of thugs were breaking into the house where i hid i could follow their progress on the street by the sudden change in sound the babble of citizens telling the scythians what had happened my breathing was better although the pain was still there i lay still my eye pressed to the door of the shed a mans head came up the ladder from the main room below i didnt know him but his ragged haircut and his expression told me he was one of my pursuers he looked around the roof quickly and then i heard him say that the roof was clear fucking scythians came a voice from below over the shouts of the householder an older man with a shrill voice villains out of my house you scum i heard the man take a blow a blow so sharp that his voice was cut off in midimprecation weve got to get out of here a man said fuck that this bastard is worth a hundred drachmas beat the scythians and make them clear out hes hiding right here somewhere i knew the voice my man from the alley you fight the cops you mad bugger the man whod checked the roof was not having any of it im off coward the leader hissed but by then there were scythians pounding on the door then both of them came up the ladder and on to my roof beneath our feet the scythians were breaking in the door my two wouldbe attackers slowed briefly at the roof edge then they dropped over the edge heading south i just lay there unable to do much to change my fortunes i saw the scythians check the roof they spoke in their barbaric tongue glanced around carefully one man by the ladder with an arrow on his bow while another man poked around with his sword but they didnt check the little shed i waited a long time after they vanished i waited until the whole quarter was silent then i limped down the ladder picked the householder up and put him on his bed and sneaked out of the door i made it to phrynichuss house under my own power his poor wife was terrified at my appearance phrynichus got me into bed his own bed as his apartment was too small for such luxuries as guest chambers i lay there trying to frame something polite to say and then finally my psyche released its hold on my body and i went away the next day i limped about escorted by half a dozen oarsmen i told all my people to lie low and i made myself look afraid and abashed when cleitus pushed past me in the agora done meddling he asked with a smile you dont look well foreigner perhaps you should stop playing with fire and go home yes lord i breathed exaggerating my injuries in fact my paid informants were bringing me titbits by the hour all my plans and preparations took time and i warned my people the oarsmen the informants and some paid thugs that i wanted no violence until i said the word and money some miltiades and some mine flowed like blood in a seafight some of my new friends disliked being made to lie low there were a few defections but i was careful with my plans and no one except cleon paramanos and herk knew what i had planned the informants were blind each of them had a particular task and given the scale of reward offered i expected results and got them let me interject here a man whos been free all his life might struggle at all this but a man whos been a slave knows all about how and where to get information how and where to buy violence and how to plan revenge remember that the world of athens ran on slaves and slaves at some level dislike being slaves a week after my arrival in athens i knew where my girl was she was working in a slave brothel by the agora i was tempted to grab her but to do so would have given the game away shortly after my informers found her the best pair thracians former slaves who ran an inquiry service brought me the names of the men cleitus had hired to beat sophanes and themistocles i paid them a small fortune and they left the city for a while they guessed what i had in mind smart lads another informer a woman a prostitute with a quick mind located my attacker the smaller man in the alley based only on my description he was a big man in the lowerclass neighbourhoods a wineshop owner and a moneylender i paid the woman well and sent her to salamis too my desire to send these people out of the city when they had served my needs was not altogether altruistic i trusted none of them and this way my prostitute could not counterinform to cleitus perhaps i wronged them many were happy to help just to strike a blow against the oppression of the aristocrats but talk is cheap and informing can become a habit so i sent them away and miltiades money paid and paid i didnt share my plan with aristides or miltiades or even phrynichus although he was beginning to catch on as was cleon many athenians are fine men and their brilliance is legendary trust an athenian to plead a court case or to write a play but what all those brilliant men like aristides and miltiades had missed was that the alcmaeonids werent playing by the rules they had taken persian gold and used it to pay the mob the same mob that should have been baying for their blue blood to beat better men i had grown up in ephesus where the persians intimidated the citizens and where the citizens used force to intimidate each other i had been a slave i knew how the world worked in a way that neither the alcmaeonids nor the just man ever would when i was ready i prompted aristides to bring my civil suit and he summoned cleitus to appear in my case just one day after the attic feast of heracles which seemed auspicious to me the civil court met briefly eager to be away to their feasts and holidays many men went to the countryside for the feast of heracles of course and some for the feasts of dionysus across the agora a party of shipwrights were raising the theatre a wooden stage and the big wooden building behind it called the skene and the wooden benches where the best men sat i was astounded at the speed with which they put it up between the opening and closing of the law court the workmen had the skene completed the law court was well briefed and cleitus was caught by surprise he turned bright red and shouted some foolishness a date was set and aristides explained to the sitting members of the boule that miltiades would have to be released from prison to plead for me because he was my proxenos that was the law cleitus began to protest and then thought better of it why wouldnt he he held all the knucklebones and all his foes were going to come to the same place on the same day the feast of dionysus i stood by the temporary theatre watching willing the thoughts into his head begging zeus soter to help me to recover my oath and punish this man and the king of the gods heard my prayer i saw cleitus lower his fist turn away and smile he was an intelligent man as i had cause to know later and he saw as well as i did that by bringing all his opponents together he could hurt us the more easily with his thugs and with the law then he agreed as if making a magnanimous gesture to allow my suit to be heard in the agora on the day following the feast of dionysus in just four days the notion that we would all be vulnerable then ought to lull my opponent i hoped because i planned to strike at the feast of dionysus itself even back then before we fought the medes the theatre of athens was a famous thing and much talked of throughout the greek world technically i wasnt welcome at the performances as i was a foreigner but again before the performances were moved out of the agora everyone went slaves and free men and citizens and even a few women bolder spirits or prostitutes athenian prostitutes arent like the poor tribal girls in this town thugater do i shock you blushing maiden what i mean is that in athens slave and free man and woman prostitutes have several protections before the law and in an odd way status a few are even citizens in those days they strolled around the agora openly made sacrifices at least barleycake sacrifices at the public altars and performed their services to the community behind the royal stoa not that i have any direct knowledge it is also important to remember that theatre performances went on all day not in the evening and that one play followed another in fairly short order interspersed with prayers and sacrifice at the public altars dont forget that in those days the drama was still a religious expression and a symbol of civic piety men went soberly as if to temple when the satyr plays were introduced to celebrate the gods love of revelry that was different although still pious an initiate of dionysus is still pious while puking we used to say and worse i stayed with aristides the night before he planned to make a tour of his farms before going to the agora so i rose early and walked through the deserted streets with styges by my side both of us were heavily armed and i had bandages on my left arm and all down my right leg where id cut it leaping from roof to roof we walked across the agora past the stillempty wooden theatre and the altars of the twelve gods right around behind the royal stoa there while girls and boys plied a brisk trade against the wall of the old building despite the early hour i found agios and paramanos and cleon ready i asked they all nodded cleon was sober have you got phrynichus he asked i have him styges goes straight from here to watch him you make sure we dont have a surprise during the performance we shook hands all around and they walked off down the hill i stood alone watching them go surrounded by the urgent noises of men having a quick tumble or getting their flutes played on the day of the festival many men thought it was good luck to couple on the wine gods day then i gathered my wits and headed back to aristides i made it in time to eat a crust of bread in his kitchen with his wife and two of his boarhounds and then i borrowed a horse and accompanied him around his farms with aeschylus the playwright at my left side and sophanes on my right aristides mocked us for nursemaiding him for my part i had come to enjoy his company as a philosopher and i was afraid that by the end of the day we would no longer be friends but i had no intention of letting him be attacked when my own plan was so close to fruition we had just completed a tour of grain barns aristides was a wealthy man for all his pretended humility and we were riding down a road with steep property walls on either side when i saw a group of men on foot coming the other way a dozen men and many with cudgels back my lord i said turning my horse nonsense aristides said thats themistocles no friend of mine but hardly an enemy which shows what a foreigner i was he was one of the bestknown orators in athens even then and id never seen him themistocles was another minor aristocrat but by dint of constant public speaking and a good deal of political strategy he had made himself the head of the demos party the popular party or the party of the lower classes in those days such a role was considered a threat by all the other aristocrats the path to tyranny usually lay through the control of the masses only the lowerclass voters could form armed mobs big enough to force the middle class into accepting a tyranny i think i should say at this point how i think athens worked then now to be sure nothing im going to say bears any resemblance to what solon wanted for athens or even what the pisistratid tyrants wanted this is merely my observation on what actually happened there was athens the richest city in mainland greece sparta may or may not be more powerful but no one on earth would willingly buy a spartan pot eh the poor bastards dont even make their own armour all athenians or at least all rich athenians of good birth seemed to be locked in a contest for power an athenian would put this differently and prate about arete and service to the state hmm listen children most of them would have sold their mothers to become tyrant so for those locked in the great games there were three roads to power although each road had some side turnings and branches a rich man might follow the path of arete spending his money wisely on monuments at home and at olympia or delphi competing in games and putting up teams of chariot horses paying for triremes for the state sponsoring religious festivals all as part of a slow rise to public esteem in this way and by using public honours to promote his own followers a man might build a gigantic faction that would allow him to leap to the tyranny the pisistratids had done it making themselves tyrants and the alcmaeonids were on the same path and cleitus in particular exemplified the path of arete that said i have to add that there was a deep division among the old aristocrats on the one hand there were the eupatridae or wellborn descended from the gods and heroes like the pisistratids and the philaids miltiades family on the other hand there were the new men the new families all still aristocrats but recently ennobled by wealth and political position the first of these families were the dreaded alcmaeonids whose famous ancestor alcmaeon was enriched in lydia by croesus there were other families of new men and while at times the new men and the old families acted together as aristocrats to protect wealth and privilege at other times they were at daggers drawn then again a man like themistocles could choose a different path he was born to comfort and his father neocles was reckoned rich enough but he was not wellborn by any means however by making himself the hero of the masses the voice of the oppressed the hand of justice to the lower classes themistocles harnessed the largely unvoiced power of the disenfranchised and the underenfranchised and turned them into a powerful force that could on occasion defeat the middle class and the upper class and demand power for their chosen orator for all that the pisistratids were wealthy aristocrats they had always held the love of the demos the people and remember odd as it sounds in a wellrun tyranny the poor men had the most power finally a man such as miltiades might find a third path miltiades and his father were members of one of the oldest and richest of the eupatridae families but they rose to power and wealth through overseas adventures piracy in fact through military action sometimes in the name of athens and sometimes in their own name they accrued wealth by something like theft and enriched other men who then became their followers and dependants allowing them to attract a following in all three classes and allowing them to build up a massive military force that neither of the other two systems ever created if we had won at lade miltiades might well have been tyrant of athens hed have had the money and the military power thats the real reason cleitus hated him let me add that however cynical i am and was about the striving of these men for power i will testify before the gods that aristides for all his priggishness never had any end in view other than the good of athens his party if you can call it that his faction existed only to support the rule of law and prevent any of the others from rising to tyranny so let us say that there was a fourth faction a faction of men who followed the path of arete with no end in view but the good of their city naturally that fourth party was the smallest so i had fallen into the middle of the competition and now i was sitting on my horse blocking the narrow lane as themistocles and a dozen clubarmed thugs surged towards us chairete aristides called themistocles was a handsome man tall wellbuilt with broad shoulders and long legs and a full beard like a fisherman he had a sort of bluff hailfellowwellmet humour that made men like him he stepped forward but id have known him anyway as he was a head taller than his followers and the best man among them he looked like a good man in a fight aristides a pleasure to meet an honest man even if he is mounted on a horse his horse comment was meant to remind his own people that he themistocles was walking not riding aristides nodded im doing the rounds of my farms are you to be at the festival today themistocles leaned on his stick love of the gods and love of the people go hand in hand aristides he raised an eyebrow i see we might make common cause as we all seem to be sporting some token from the alcmaeonids he pointed at the bump on his head and his black eye to aristides injuries and my bandages then he turned to me and with an exaggerated manner said you must be the foreigner from plataea sir clearly he knew exactly who i was i slid from my mount and took his hand in the athenian way arimnestos of plataea at your service i said he nodded glanced at aristides then back at me and i thought he might let go of my hand i have heard things about you he looked at one of his men recently i smiled nothing that might disconcert you i hope themistocles considered me and then looked up at aristides he was finding as men have found since the invention of the horse that it is much easier to stare a man down than to stare him up your foreign flunky is making trouble among my people he said to aristides aristides shrugged the plataean is no mans flunky themistocles and just as he is not my flunky so they are not your people dont be a stiffnecked prig themistocles said all the oil leaving his voice he leaned closer your man has tried to buy my mob we should be acting together these days not making separate efforts and the mob is mine sir aristides looked at me and i couldnt read what he was thinking is this true he asked i smiled no i said you lie themistocles spat aristides pushed his horse between us themistocles i have warned you before that utterances of this sort will not win you friends get your money out of town foreigner themistocles shot at me no one buys mobs without my sayso that last was directed at aristides not me i stepped towards him and his people began to close around me i am arimnestos of plataea i called out and if one of you lays a hand on me ill start killing you i looked around at them and they desisted the man closest to me was a big man but when his eyes met mine he stepped back and gave me a smile i was the arimnestos the mankiller aristides looked pleased which puzzled me i mean no disrespect i said to themistocles i wanted no trouble with the demagogue what i have paid for will only benefit you he raised an eyebrow really he asked aristides was watching me i shrugged i would not tell every man on this road i said nor have i bought a mob i have bought information and i paid well what kind of information themistocles demanded information regarding my court case of course i said this satisfied him immediately ah he said a certain slave in the brothels i gather he said looking knowing and yet deeply concerned the only sign of his hypocrisy was the speed of his direction changes exactly i proclaimed as if stunned by his perspicacity he dropped me as if our business was done then he and aristides exchanged a commonplace or two and we passed through his retinue when i glanced back themistocles was smiling at me aristides was not what are you up to he asked nothing i said i smiled at him nothing that would interest you sir he rubbed his beard youve got themistocles riled and thats never a good thing he reined his horse you know what you are doing youre sure i shrugged because i wasnt at all sure that i knew what i was doing im fighting back i said gods stand by us aristides said when the sun was high we left our horses at his stables and walked into the city together men were gathered everywhere and i was reminded of athenss power by seeing how many men she commanded there must have been twelve thousand men of fighting age in the agora for the performances and that is a fair number of decently trained men a greater total than thebes and sparta together and therein lies the secret of athenss strength manpower when athenians gather they talk it seems to be the lifeblood of the city and they talk of everything from the power of the gods to the roles of men the rights of men the place of taxes the weather the crops the fish and back to the gods standing with aristides in the agora trying to guard him i was dizzied by the power of the ideas expressed piety and impiety anger and logic farming advice military strategy all in a matter of a few minutes we were all crushed together when the magistrates went to the public altar of zeus near the royal stoa and made the opening sacrifices then the good men the athletes the olympic victors the poets the priests and high aristocrats processed to the wooden seats that had been arranged pray dont imagine anything elegant or splendid like modern athens honey were talking about wooden stands that creaked when too many fat men climbed the steps but after some time the crowd settled and the poor metics and foreigners and lowerclass citizens pushed in around the sides and in the space between the stage area and the stands early on i spotted cleitus he was wearing a magnificent embroidered himation over a long chiton of persian work and he was easy to pick out as he was sitting in the first row of the stand a set of priests and priestesses came forward purified the crowd and made sacrifices then we all sang a hymn to dionysus together and the plays began i dont remember much about the first play just that it was a typically reverent piece about the birth and nurture of the god at least according to an athenian we have our own ideas about great bacchus in boeotia but the second play was phrynichuss i saw him as soon as the chorus came out he was behind them wearing a long white chiton like the one that the archon in plataea wears and he looked more scared than he had been when the aegyptians were storming our deck at lade i began to push through the crowd towards him it was not easy everyone had heard that the fall of miletus was a different kind of play and men wanted to see the poet to watch him as they watched his play i had managed to get close to him when the chorus dressed as skeletons in armour linked arms and sang hear me muses what i tell is wrought with horror and yet heroes walked there too and where our fair maidens once walked fire has swept like the harrow breaking the clods of dirt and making the ground smooth hear me furies and men of athens we died on our walls in our streets in the breach where the great kings siege mound rose so that where once our maidens for their young swains sighed those same young men wore bronze and for the want of athens there we died ive heard aeschylus and ive heard young euripides but for power give me phrynichus and he was actually at the battle well aeschylus and his brother were there too aeschylus was also next to me as i came up to phrynichus pushing rudely through the crowd he took my shoulder not now he said pointing to phrynichus who was watching his chorus exactly as agios watched his oarsmen in a seafight so i stopped and listened i had been there of course and yet i was enraptured by his words he laid the blame for the fall of the east on athens that was the point of his play that the rape of ionia was caused by the greed of athens yes he made miltiades a hero and that must have sat ill with some but the greatest hero was istes and he towers over the play like heracles come to earth it was frightening to listen to a man speak words i had spoken in council and there was the man playing miltiades not that he was named for in those days that might have been considered impiety and he stood forth and said today we are not pirates today we fight for the freedom of the greeks although we are far from home and hearth and men cheered cleitus looked around he was angry doubly angry i think his men should have made a disturbance by then shouldnt they hah im keeping my plan from you children it helps build the story does it not but not many men can say that in one day they bested cleitus of the alcmaeonids and themistocles of athens in a contest of wits let me tell it my own way the play was only halfway through when the first man in the crowd gave way to tears and by the time istes died in the play he asks where is athens as he falls to his death men were weeping some were pouring dust on their heads and the whole row of alcmaeonids were looking uneasy under all that dignity and good breeding it was a mighty play and then there was my contribution not long after istes death when the angry crowd was to understand that the maidens of miletus were being ravished offstage by the persian archers i saw a man come to cleitus his face was broad and puffy or did i imagine that and when he whispered into his masters ear cleitus flushed red and stood up we were separated by ten horselengths but the gods meant him to know i caught his eye and i smiled whatever the news was it passed from man to man along the alcmaeonid family seats several of them pointed at me aeschylus watched them and then sophanes pushed up next to me what have you done he asked an act of piety and justice i said quietly i wasnt there to see it but cleon told the tale well this is what happened in a southside brothel owned by the alcmaeonids a group of oarsmen swaggered in demanding wine no uncommon thing during the feast of dionysus but when they had their wine they demanded to see all the girls and having chosen one they beat the owner and his bruisers to death with their fists four men died the girl they took away with them oh its a nasty business children out by the tanneries a small crowd descended on a taverna known to be owned by one of the gangs of toughs who organized things in the town they pulled four men out of the taverna and stabbed them to death the four men were literally cut to ribbons up on the hill by the acropolis another pair of bruisers were caught by a small mob and cudgelled to death sailors were blamed but the worst atrocity in the eyes of the good men was that someone or some group of men invaded one of the largest alcmaeonid farms in fact it was cleituss home farm his workers were badly beaten and every horse in his barns was killed throats cut with knives every horse not everything i planned came off i had wanted my own horse back but the men who were sent to the farm misunderstood and my nice mare died with all their stock i hadnt meant so many men to die ten is a big body count for a peaceable city but when you make soup the vegetables are best cut small i did what had to be done i wanted the alcmaeonids to be struck with terror i didnt want them to consider fighting back i couldnt be certain what the consequences of my little gambit would be and perhaps the consequences would have been less if not for phrynichuss play cleitus had meant for the play to be cancelled or if not cancelled hed planned a disturbance in the agora that would have forced the magistrates to take action thats what should have happened but his bruisers were cooling corpses by then their shades already far on the road to hades id paid another crowd of oarsmen and their friends to attend the play i packed the crowd to get it cheering but that was unnecessary and i regret that i thought so little of phrynichus i didnt pay them to attack the alcmaeonids that happened all by itself the end of the play set off a convulsion of sorrow and regret phrynichuss words brought home to the mass of men what the fall of miletus had meant and what role they had played or not played never once had he named the alcmaeonids or spoken harshly of the power of persian gold but when men dried their eyes after the last speech a demand by a persian general that all greeks submit or share the fate of miletus the crowd turned on the alcmaeonids like wild dogs they were pelted with filth and their retainers were beaten at first men were restrained both by the prestige of the aristocrats and by fear of their bruisers but there were no bruisers in evidence then some of the oarsmen grew bolder and pressed forward but the aristocrats werent cowards far from it these were the leaders of athens and swords appeared despite the law commoners were cut down the area behind the stands was now enveloped in the chaos of a formless fight i pushed my way there past men trying to join the fight and others attempting to flee it i wanted cleitus i wanted to see his face instead i saw themistocles he was grinning from ear to ear and yet he was struggling to restrain some thetes who had cudgels and were trying to finish off a fallen man themistocles shook his head at me you see what youve done he roared not that he was displeased i pushed past him looking for cleitus i took a blow on the shoulder and i wondered if the alcmaeonids would be finished off right here in a massacre by the royal stoa but the crowd wanted more and less than blood and already the older aristocrats were clear of the crowd and running a sight that the demos never forgot cleitus was holding the crowd back with a dozen armed men the thetes feared his sword and his ability to use it i didnt i pushed forward through the last edge of lowerclass men and i laughed at him as if by prompt on the stage paramanos appeared with my slave girl in tow her eyes widened when she saw me until then as i later heard shed assumed the worst if there can be worse than working in a brothel in athens i grabbed her hand and she came with me i have back what is mine i called to cleitus youre a dead man he roared at me and then he ran pursued by the sound of my laughter i gave her her freedom as i had promised it was a year or more late and i paid her the best damages i could hard silver for her lost year she was never again the openfaced friendly companion of our first weeks together the gods had used her and cast her away and i had forgotten her who had sworn to save her its not a pretty story how many men did she service in the agora because i was heartsick but we made the athenian aristocrats pay no alcmaeonid dared come into the streets for weeks thereafter and my court case was won by the absence of my opponent and the unanimity of the jury was a sign of the collapse of aristocratic power miltiades argued my case with a deep voice and an unworried countenance because he knew he was going to win both as my proxenos and in his own case no jury in athens would convict miltiades of anything after phrynichuss play and the alcmaeonid political machine died with their handlers im afraid i taught the athenians a terrible lesson and they still fear the demos but i smile to think that phrynichus and i saved athenian democracy from the alcmaeonids so that the man who wanted to be tyrant could save it from the medes the gods who is so foolish as to not believe in the gods work in the strangest ways aristides was distant for the next week until my case was resolved he was no fool and he knew where the muscle had come from and so did themistocles i went back to staying with phrynichus who was now deluged with money and offers of more from admirers as distant as hieron of syracuse phrynichus knew id done something but i never let on exactly what and yet by having agios and paramanos and black and cleon for dinner every night phrynichus became untouchable we kept fifty oarsmen in the streets around his house at all hours on miltiades money but on the day that miltiades was released the jury refused to hear the charges read which had precedent in athenian law and seemed to satisfy everyone i met him and aristides together with themistocles we met as if by chance in a wine shop at the edge of the agora where welltodo men used to cement business deals themistocles didnt meet my eye miltiades on the other hand rose to his feet and embraced me money well spent he said pardon my doubts of you friend i will always be in your debt he gave me a broad wink i dont think these other gentlemen liked their taste of your politics themistocles spat i do not want to live in a state powered by blood he said and yet you seek increased power for the lowest class miltiades answered what do you expect themistocles glared at me i expect them to learn to be men of honour and to stand in their places and vote not cudgel each other like thieves but aristides shocked me he took my hand and embraced me i thought to hate you he said i considered asking for a writ of banishment against you themistocles looked at him as if the gods had taken his wits but you did not aristides shook his head and sat drink wine with us arimnestos he said i invited cleitus to join us but he declined i wanted all the factions he almost smirked perhaps their faction isnt worth having today theyll be back i said so they will aristides agreed but no amount of persian gold will buy them the mob now and for that you forgive this foreigner who used violence to achieve his ends themistocles asked aristides shrugged in former times when a city had reached a point of stasis civil war the leading men would invite a foreigner a lawmaker to come and save them aristides smiled my wife told me that i was being a fool and that i should see the plataean as a man who came to athens and restored order i looked around at all of them you see me as a killer of men i said but i was trained by heraclitus of ephesus and i know a little of how cities work athens has too many poor and too few rich for the rich to control the poor with fear and silver too many of athenss poor are seamen and oarsmen theyre not cowards as all of us around this table have cause to know and they have no reason to love persia i shrugged i know all that themistocles said i dont need some easterntrained foreigner to tell me you know it all aristides said but despite that you did not act he turned to me and smiled i prefer the rule of law plataean i am a man of property too i said not as rich as you lot but i have a good farm a forge horses i too treasure the rule of law but when one side controls the laws the other side must appeal to another court aristides nodded we all wish to ask you to leave the city now i smiled you are going to run me out of town after all aristides nodded we have to you killed ten men and most citizens know how you will be welcomed back soon enough i rose to my feet gentlemen i have fought for athens bled for athens and now i have schemed for athens the depth of your thanks never ceases to amaze me aristides shook his head dont be like that arimnestos if you were one of us we would all now fear your power since you are an ally we can ask you to leave and trust you again in the future he said this as if it made sense and in a way it did but i was hurt too i had planned a brilliant campaign and the only person who thanked me was irene wife of phrynichus what can we do for you arimnestos miltiades asked i had the good grace to laugh nothing unless it is to make sure that phrynichus doesnt starve while you all plot the future of athens and then i had a thought perhaps i will have something after all i have in my hand a set of manumission papers for a slave girl theyve all been signed by a magistrate how about if you all sign them her name it appeared on the tablets was apollonasia quite a mouthful for a twistfoot slave girl from boeotia but apollos daughter she certainly was and all three of them the three most famous men of their generation put their stamps and their names across the magistrates mark on her tablets it was the best gift i could give her i went and fetched her and introduced her her eyes cast modestly down and each swore that they would remember her she walked with us out of the city i stopped on the acropolis hill to say farewell to phrynichus and i stopped in piraeus to say farewell to agios and paramanos and i stopped at eleusis to say farewell to eumenios who id barely seen because in attica eighty stades is reckoned a great distance cleon came with me of course and on our last night in attica at oinoe where my brother died she came into my blankets and kissed me im going in the morning she said ill be a farmers wife in attica and my sight tells me i will see you again i was a vessel to lead you and now i am free i murmured something because i was hard as rock and wanted to have her and i didnt need any of her moongazing female nonsense just then but she bit my shoulder hard to get my attention you owe me she said give me a child of yours or ill curse you again so i did in the morning she was gone i did hear of her again and i know who she married and who our child grew to be as youll hear eventually if you all keep sitting here but ill say this of her in eulogy she was a hero as much as eumeles of euboea or aristides she was a vessel for the gods and she stood her ground and when they treated her like shit she did not become shit eh i can never lose the notion that if i had gone back for her the greeks might have won at lade foolishness but i still carry the guilt for leaving her to bloody cleitus for a year and he didnt send her to a brothel because he was evil either thats what you do with a clubfooted chattel with good breasts if she has no skills right im an old man and i have few regrets but she is one and when she lay with me that night and took my seed i felt better i wont say otherwise much better when i awoke in the first light she was gone but sitting on my leather bag where her dark head had lain just hours before was a great black raven it cawed once and the beat of its wings frightened me and then it rose into the sky with a cry i lay still with my heart beating hard and my body felt lighter indeed when i rose from my blankets my hip and lower leg hurt less much less ive never run the stade since lade but from that moment i got something back something more than mere muscle and tissue my third return to plataea was the easiest perhaps my fellow townsmen were becoming accustomed to my travels or perhaps simon son of simon had just lost his supporters in thebes and had no money with which to blacken my name in any event i went back over cithaeron in winter froze my arse in the high pass and made a sacrifice on the family altar nonetheless and came down to green plataea in time for spring harvest the truth is that plataeans can be ignorant hicks and its possible that the winter was so cold that they never noticed i was gone either way i was there for the first harvest the barley harvest and my spirits were high whatever the raven gave me it was strong i settled cleon on a small farm in cithaerons shadow and he seemed happy enough i ploughed my fallow land with hermogenes and won his grudging praise for my unstinting work i made new props for grape vines and i pruned everything i could get a sickle to i gathered all my male slaves and on the spot freed the two thracians who had been with me since my first return and then told the rest exactly how they could work their way to freedom when the spring farm work was done i threw myself into the forge making pots and pitchers and cups and temple vases with tiraeus and bion for twenty days my forge was never silent even hermogenes worked the forge and that was rare because despite his skills hed become a farmer first and foremost at the feast of demeter we danced the pyrrhiche and i eyed the new crop of boysbecomemen with the wary amusement that men have for boys they preened and slunk away by turns and lost their heads whenever a pretty girl walked by despite which by the end of the festival i had a notion of who was worthy and who was worthless and where they might stand in the phalanx i had not taken naturally to being the strategos of the town or perhaps i had my father was briefly the polemarch before his death the war archon and no man had been formally appointed to either role since his death the plataeans had not stood in battle a single day since the week of battles indeed in all the town there were only six of us who had faced iron in the storm of ares since then there was me there was idomeneus who was accepted as a citizen despite his alienness because he was the priest of the hero there was ajax a plataean who had served with the medes against us in the chersonese and of whom we nonetheless thought highly there was styges who had followed us to lade hermogenes had served me for two years in the chersonese and had fine armour and a steady hand lysius of plataea was another local man hed served for four years under miltiades before buying a good farm along the asopus that was it in my generation the fifty milesian families brought us a wealth of war experience teucer was the best archer our town had ever seen and i used him to organize the men who carried bows in those days honey archers still walked with the phalanx and alcaeus who was the chief lord of the survivors was as good a man in spearfighting as idomeneus and owned full panoply with thigh guards and arm armour and even foot armour shaped like his own feet so that when he was fully kitted he looked like a bronze statue the milesians added real fighting power and that allowed them as ionians and foreigners to gain acceptance more rapidly than they might otherwise have done and finally there was cleon who took one of simons former farms a corvaxae property that i granted him just over the hill from mine running hard by epictetuss vineyards he was never fond of war but hed stood in the front ranks several times plataea was delighted to have him and myron got up a collection to buy him an aspis and a helmet as he had sold his in those days a small city like plataea knew that its warriors were its lifeblood and we danced together as often as the feast cycle allowed young men hunted together on cithaeron and some a few came to the forge and learned spearfighting or went up the hill to idomeneus or down the asopus to lysius we all taught the same things how to use your shield and your spearshaft to keep the enemys iron from your body and only later how to plunge the iron home yourself as the bronzesmith i had a fair idea who had armour and how good it was as a group plataeans were welltodo thanks to the money athens paid us for grain and those famous three victories in a week had put good helmets and greaves in almost every farm they might not fit every generation but they were there and when a new generation appeared there was some trading and some trips to the bronzesmith the men were as ready for war as dancing the war dance and wearing armour to exercise could make them that summer i started the custom of taking a large group of young men up on to cithaeron camping living hard and hunting we are not aristocrats in plataea but what the spartans say is true it is only through hunting that men grow accustomed to war well actually life as a slave can make an adequate substitute but i wouldnt recommend it as a training programme when the barley and the wheat were in the ground when id sent two wagons of finished bronze away to athens and another to corinth and before my grapes began to ripen i told the men young and old who had gathered on a pleasant summer evening in the yard of my forge that i would lead a hunt on the mountain there were only two dozen of us that first year we walked up the long road on cithaerons flank and i thought of my old tutor calchas and how much he had taught me i took the boys i cant call them anything else to idomeneus and he added in a dozen young men of his own boys who had been sent to him to learn the ways of war we stayed the night there and had a bonfire and the boys listened openmouthed as we told them war stories cleon came along he didnt say a word and he drank too much but he knew how to hold a spear and the next day we began to teach them to hunt deer some of those boys had never thrown a real javelin now boys are boys and no boy in plataea at least no citizens son was so poor that he hadnt made himself a straight stick with a sharp tip but we plataeans lack the organization of the spartans or the cretans or even the athenians where every citizen gets some training i wish i could tell you that i had the foresight to see what was coming but i didnt i felt instead that i owed something to my home city by training boys i could pay it back so i led them up cithaeron killed some deer and tried not to laugh as i watched them stumble about cut each other with axes misthrow their javelins and tell lies boys was i ever so young still it was all a great success although i had to keep idomeneus off some of the prettier boys with a stick and i truly wondered what kind of cretan vices he was teaching the boys who were sent to him but i was not his keeper together we led them up the mountain and two weeks later when we came back down they were leaner and faster and better men in every way or at least most were and not just the boys cleon was much more himself but in every herd there are a few animals doomed to die and man is no different after the first time men came and asked for their sons to be taken and even some of the older men such as peneleos son of epictetus who had no war training and wanted to catch up came to me and my life filled up i worked and in between bouts of work i trained the young in early autumn when the grapes began to ripen and i was watching the weather and all the farmers around me to see who would plough and plant barley my sister arrived with gifts and a new baby and we hugged her she went and saw mater who mostly lived alone in a wine haze with a couple of slaves who knew their business then she came back took a bite of dinner and shook her head you need a wife she said i all but spat out my food ive found you a fine one she went on you need someone to run this house and take care of mater whens the last time you ate a decent meal i looked at the food on my fine bronze plate whats wrong with this i asked any peasant in the vale of asopus eats better than this she said bread and cheese my own barley and my own cheese i said penelope looked at me steadily listen hesiod she said and giggled and i had to laugh with her hesiod was a fine farmer and a brutal misogynist and while i loved his words i didnt agree with all of them i knew what pen meant i dont need a wife i said which slave warms your bed she asked alete is it you alete was an old thracian woman who helped with mater she grinned toothlessly nah mistress she said she laughed pen looked around seriously who is it i shrugged you are embarrassing me sister i have no bedwarmer in this house it makes for bad feeling ill tell you what makes for bad feeling pen shot back surly men without wives in dirty houses with dull food she looked at me unless that cretan has trained you to like boys i could feel the telltale signs of defeat but i dont need a wife i said feebly my lords sister leda went to school a school for girls at corinth pen was remorseless like persian archery you get to choose her hair colour and ill take care of the rest black i said almost unbidden black like briseis i thought i cannot marry i love briseis but i knew briseis was lost to me for ever and i was lonely in the brief heartbeats where i allowed myself to think about anything but work and training later that autumn when atlass fair daughters the pleiades set when all the grapes were in and those that went for wine were trodden and we had a week while we waited to see how good the wheat might be i took almost a hundred men up the mountain the harvest was already looking to be fabulous perhaps legendary and we needed a break from labour besides deer meat kept many hearths fed that summer while we waited to see if the new year would do better than last years evil rains and the milesians were poor they had started with nothing and every deer we killed kept their eyes shining and in those days honey most greeks lived and died on barley and barley as hesiod says goes into the ground when the pleiades set and comes up when they rise a winter crop the milesians needed food to get them through the winter this time we swept the slopes of the mountain with something like efciency and idomeneus cursed and said wed ruin the hunting i promised that the next hunt would go up behind eleutherai a longer expedition and better training and a new stock of deer we killed seventy animals and carried the meat home and while we were up on the mountain the older men discussed politics and war the persians were coming closer the great king had sworn to burn athens or so men said and eretria in euboea too the rumour was that thebes was willing to swear fealty to the great king for aid against athens well have to fight peneleos said everyone looked at me and i was old and wise bullshit i said the persians are mighty and their armies are huge and they own more triremes than all of the greeks ever did but do you know how far sardis is from athens so much for my wisdom my only concern was closer to home if the thebans get involved i said then we could find ourselves in a fight my pater says one plataean is worth ten thebans said young diocles son of eumenides eumenides had stood his ground when my brother died at oinoe your pater should know better i said when the thebans come theyll have ten men for every one of ours and our knees will rattle together like dry leaves in a wind we can stand against them in battle or stay in our walls idomeneus said what i would fear is raids greedy men well led coming for cattle and slaves thats a scary thought peneleos said thats war the way bandits make war on honest men hermogenes was eating deer meat and he belched thats how war is made out there in the world he said aye cleon said we should have an alarm and a select group that could come out at a moments notice and run down thieves idomeneus said better yet four or five alarms all a little different for the quarters of the territory around us so that the moment we hear the alarm we know where to run we all agreed that the cretan had a fine idea and when next the assembly met after the feasts and contests of heracles i moved that we create a select militia and that the alarms be built and it was carried so those who took part in my deer hunts on the hillside became the plataeans epilektoi the picked men and we built the alarm fires and set signals after the wheat harvest which old men said was the richest in twenty years and some said the richest theyd ever seen at the feast of hera every one of us made sacrifice so that smoke rose without cease to the heavens and hera smiled on us the milesians filled their cottages and their new barns and sold the surplus over the mountains in attica as we did and their sons came up the mountain with me and some began to buy my armour cleon somehow managed to have a poor harvest in a year of plenty i went to visit him taking a wagon to fetch his surplus and he brought me just ten medimnoi of grain what in plutons name i swore did you sleep all day cleon looked at the ground im not cut out to be a farmer he said what will you eat this winter i asked he made a face your handouts he asked and his voice was bitter despite cleons failure it was a good year after my second ploughing and before the turning of the year when the days finally begin to get longer and the rains let up a little i travelled over the mountains into attica to meet my prospective bride a girl of fourteen years called euphoria whose father was a wealthy cavalryclass man from the hills north of athens she had been ledas schoolmate at corinth and she could read and sing and weave and when i arrived well shes worth a better story than that so perhaps i should tell you how i met euphoria she didnt have black hair she was as blonde as the sun and her hair was like a banner for mens attentions men crowded around euphoria like vultures on a battlefield like ravens on a new corn crop like seagulls on a fishing boat with a fine catch and she may have loved the attention she received but she appeared to be immune as some men are to the arrows of apollo she was showered in presents from the time she was old enough to walk and some men called her helen her father was aleitus a famous hunter and her mother atlanta had won every womans foot race in greece and was that rarest of creatures a female athlete euphoria had the body of a grown woman when she was fourteen with deep breasts and wide hips and she had hair of gold have i mentioned that my sister filled me in on these details as we sat at the big farm table in the main kitchen of our house at the edge of winter the hearth smoked and the smoke rose through the rafters in beams of sunshine like the arms of the gods reaching to earth still makes you cough though pen raised her hand and ordered more small beer with a crook of her finger life as the wife of an aristocrat agreed with her her husband antigonus was a good man he doted on her and yet made good company for me and several of his friends slept in the andron and would accompany us over the mountains pen told me that i needed some aristocratic friends but the very idea of marrying into the aristocracy of attica made my stomach roil and the thought of marrying a famous beauty put me off my food you are a famous man my sister said you need to marry well i am the bronzesmith of plataea i said what will her father say if i take tiraeus and hermogenes pen stuck her tongue out at me if hes as well bred as people say hell welcome them and you but why try his patience and why dont you have any presentable friends she rolled her eyes at her husbands sister leda who smiled knowingly and batted her eyelashes at all the male guests indiscriminately despite being married to some lordling at thebes miltiades aristides i laughed perhaps idomeneus have you met cleon mater made one of her rare appearances she dropped on to a stool by leda and barked her laugh idomeneus is very well bred she said for a wolf she looked around at all of us if you take idomeneus make sure he doesnt kill anyone penelope motherhood agrees with you more than it ever agreed with me she beamed a mixture of wine and affection at us i am so pleased to see both of my children returning to the class that your father abandoned she turned to me cleon is a stray dog not a wolf youd do better to put him down hell bite your hand in the end i went straight out to the forge and began to pound a lump of bronze with a hammer i pounded it into sheet a slaves job but one that allowed me to hit something very hard again and again until i was calm and mater was back in her rooms drunk and silent but the next morning she was back again why dont you ask miltiades to meet you she asked he can stand as your mentor hes a man of property and as i have cause to remember he has beautiful manners hes killed more men than idomeneus i spat why must you behave like a beast my love mater asked putting her hand on my face so that i could smell the wine on her breath i steeled myself and gave no reply except to go back to the forge and make sheet out of bronze stock again my aristocratic guests were surprisingly tolerant of my affection for my forge idomeneus took them hunting and on the third day of their visit i joined them and we flushed a boar up behind eleutherai in driving rain antigonus was there and alcaeus the leading man of the former milesians as well as teucer who had a farm hard by my own purchased from waste land that epictetus had been saving for his sons idomeneus of course and ajax and styges my guests were lykon a very young man with pale skin like a girl and longer lashes than was quite right and philip antigonuss guestfriend from thrace philip was an excellent hunter and in fact had been included by penelope because his skills might impress the prospective fatherinlaw lykon was recklessly brave the sort of courage that you have to show when you look like a pretty girl and have a highpitched voice i liked lykon immediately he was not afraid to wash our wooden bowls around the campfire and now faced with a boar he simply lowered his spearpoint and went at it lykon was between the boar and me we were in open woods high on cithaeron the ground was broken and rocky and rose steeply behind the boar and it was littered deeply with oak leaves that muffled sound and made movement treacherous it was cold enough to numb your hand on your spear and raining the hounds were as surprised as the rest of us wed been on the trail of a deer a deer that philip had wounded and we all wanted to bring home the boar was no part of our hunt but now our youngest man was facing it and it was not small the boar put its head down and charged teucer leaped up on a stump and shot no aiming no pause to think and his heavy war arrow punched the animal in the side and deflected it it skidded to a stop and teucer shot it again then lykon tried to get the point of his spear into it but from inexperience he didnt know that you never spear a pig in the face the spearpoint caught on the beasts snout which is full of muscle and gristle and glanced off its tusks and the creature barged under his point into his legs and down he went teucer put a third arrow into it as it tried to savage lykon philip and i reached it at the same instant it backed a step and i put my point deep in the chest under the chin a low thrust as good as any i made in battle and philip may the gods bless him leaped high and plunged his point right down between the animals shoulder blades then another arrow thudded home i was so close that i saw dust fly from the beasts hide as it hit despite the rain and antigonus and idomeneus were both there adding the weight of their spears and the thing was dead lykon lay still and for a long moment i thought his slim back was broken his right leg was ripped from knee to groin a long but thankfully shallow gash that missed his privates by the breadth of a finger and where hed curled up to cover himself the boars snout had broken his nose and its tusk had slashed across his face he looked up at me his face a mask of blood and tears sorry he said i fucked that up we laughed lykon was a man after that the facial scar was a gift from the gods no man would ever have taken him seriously without it as it was well youll hear in time lykon was the son of an important man from corinth a magistrate and shipowner and pen was very fond of him all of us were so we voted like greeks to wait for his leg to heal before setting out that meant two weeks of guesting three aristocrats and the consequent drain on my pantries and staff i tried to think of it that way the peasant way but the truth is they were fine men and i had a fine time we hunted some days and idomeneus and ajax came and stayed for the first time ill add and there was wine and talk in the andron every night in the second week cleon turned up he had been to the house before and hermogenes liked him so he came into the courtyard and styges brought him wine the first i knew of it was the sound of raised voices outside my forge i pushed out through the hide curtains and there was cleon red in the face and my brotherinlaw was being held by philip what are you doing i asked this is what you brought me to plataea to do cleon asked to be your servant lykon sprang forward despite his wound antigonus meant no offence the boy said how could we know you are a free man in truth cleon looked as if he had slept with dogs his wool chiton was badly soiled and had wine stains all around the hem and down the front he had no leg wraps under his sandals and no chlamys or himation he looked like a slave antigonus had treated him like one and cleon had punched him antigonus was a gentleman he apologized and admitted that he had committed hubris but cleons lips trembled and he walked out of my gate i came he said and then he spat never mind i wont come again he stalked off down the hill i called his name but then i let him go you can only do so much for a man mater was surprisingly sober im not dullwitted i know why for once pen and i were living the life mater had wanted and she stayed sober enough to be part of it although it might have been truer to the gruesome drunkards creed if shed managed to be roaring drunk and ruin the whole thing for everyone the element of selfloathing in the drunkard is the ugliest part of the whole thing but she didnt she and pen sang with leda and the better slaves joined in and she did loom work in the andron while the men argued mostly we talked about the persians antigonus and lykon and philip were equally awestruck that wed served in the east philip saw the great king as a force for good a great aristocrat who would make the world a better place but he liked a good war story lykon took the opposite tack his father owned ships and had no time for persia we debated when and if the great king would come for athens idomeneus and i insisted that we could have won lade and philip maintained that the great king could never be defeated we drank a great deal of wine pen mocked us from her loom and mater proclaimed that it was high time i stopped wandering the world like odysseus and got myself a wife and some sons and daughters what i didnt know was that mater had sent a messenger over the mountains to athens during his recovery lykon couldnt hunt so he hobbled around the farm asking hundreds of questions and i returned one evening cold through with a deer across my horse and philips laughter floating up the hill from the crossroads where he was drinking with peneleos ting ting ting ting i went into the forge expecting to find tiraeus and there he was sure enough guiding lykon through making a cup i laughed im not sure what your father would think i said he laughed pater worries that ill sleep with older men he said hed never object to a little work lykons time in my shop put the seal of aristocratic approval on my smithing i see that now by the time lykon was ready to go over the mountain i had shown all of them how to start a helmet and i had my brotherinlaws deepbowled corinthian roughed out so that the skull stood proud to the cheekplates and the elegance of the shape had begun to show at any rate we were fast friends by the time we rode up past the shrine two by two antigonus with pen idomeneus with lykon teucer with philip alcaeus with me and a passel of slaves behind us on donkeys with hampers of food and some gifts it was cold and our breath rose to the heavens with the breath of the animals as if we had fires burning inside us we had a snowstorm the second day and we chose to stay an extra night back at the shrine the two women who lived there asked me about apollonasia and when i told them that she was free and had a dowry of forty drachmas they laughed and offered to follow me over the mountain i didnt tell them the price the poor girl had had to pay for her dowry i dont brag of my failures but it served to remind me when i was feeling cocky of what failure was like i left the rest of them rode to the summit despite the snow and made sacrifice there surrounded by an endless field of white with a clear view over all of the earth as far as i could see out to sea to the south and over all boeotia to the north so that the smoke of hearths in thebes was a smudge that i could see far over the dance floor of ares and all i could see in the rim of the world was war and then we rode down into attica aleitus had a tower it was a fine building of carefully cut stone in the lesbian manner and i liked it immediately although the rooms smelled of smoke all the time i had money i thought that i might build myself a tower our house had had one once a small thing but the one euphorias father had was another thing entirely it was elegant and strong he met us in his courtyard and i liked him too although he wasnt sure of me he wasnt a big man but wellmuscled greyhaired but with plenty of life left in his face and he was surrounded by dogs big boarhounds of a kind we dont have in boeotia the dogs barked and barked at so many strangers the blonde womangirl who dashed into the courtyard and stood locked in an embrace with leda had to be my intended bride and i found that my tongue was stuck to the roof of my mouth she was beautiful the way briseis was beautiful i looked at her and i became aware that pen was laughing at me her father clapped me on the shoulder happens to all the suitors he said dont spend too much time with her shell eat your brain and leave you a drooling idiot ive seen it happen again and again he laughed the way a strong man laughs when he is wounded the young woman in question glanced at me smiled and went back to her friend so much for my vanity still thats why we have rules of hospitality and customs to pass the time when our brains are fuddled by sex i managed to get down from my horse and introduce my friends and my sister and then we were in his hall and my slaves were laying out a selection of my gifts one of the many rewards for a life of piracy was that i had some beautiful things to give as gifts aleitus received a gold and coral necklace from aegypt and a gold cup that had come off the captains table of some phoenician merchantman with a long body and a swans head that was for euphoria my tyrian dyed wool passed without comment and a pair of bronze water pitchers my own work let me add were virtually ignored but id made a pair of boar spears to match the ones id seen at aristides house with long staves and sharp bronze buttspikes and heavy heads and aleitus passed over some much richer gifts to pounce on them now these are a sight for sore eyes lad he pronounced no one had called me lad in quite some time it made me laugh still the company was good and euphoria sang and showed us her weaving which i have to admit was superb in fact id never seen such fine work from a girl her age i love to weave she said and it was the first serious grownup thing i heard her say do you know anything about weaving i thought about a number of answers i had after all watched my mother and sister weave all my life no i said is it true that you are a master smith she asked it is true i said her eyes went back to her loom are your hands always dirty she asked often i allowed she nodded then if we wed you must be careful not to touch my wool she said her eyes flitted across mine i should like to marry a man who could make something she added but pater says you are low so i shall not get my hopes up she wore an enigmatic halfsmile as she said this and i was too much a fool to realize that this girlwoman was playing me like a lyre low is it i thought but i wiped the rage from my face we hunted rabbits the first day and i knew from the start that i was being tested it was wonderful i felt as if i was living in the epics and here i was competing for atlanta or helen or penelope the wound on my leg didnt bother me as it had but i still had trouble keeping up with lykon and philip and it was all i could do to run the rabbits down philip killed four and lykon two but lykon without a word began to edge them my way in the last hours and i managed to kill two with my club before the sun set i would have expected a man as famous as you to be faster aleitus said it was not quite a sneer indeed by the standards of a rabbit hunt any man who killed was allowed to wear a garland but his barb went home fleetness of foot is one of the most important aspects of wartraining as the poet recognizes when he calls achilles swift footed i swallowed my anger and nodded i was swifter i said when i was younger aleitus laughed not yet old enough to know when an excuse is hollow he said i almost rode away that day but my friends calmed me the second day we got a dose of winter rains and we stayed indoors listened to the women sing and swapped stories i told some of the stories im telling now and my hosts doubts were plain on his face and some of his friends local gentlemen sneered let me pause here to say something about them they were hippeis and richer rich farmers aristocrats mostly of the eupatridae and most of them shunned athens the way other men shun impiety they never went into the city the city i had already come to love they had their own countryside temples and sometimes they went to the assembly to vote but they were the country party and they loathed the oarsmen and the metics and the tradesmen and wanted athens to be sparta a land of aristocratic farmers to them i was a combination of alien things a smith a foreigner but they were taken together good men when the weather cleared in the afternoon we went out into the fields below his tower to throw javelins i have my moments with the javelin but ive never practised as much as i ought and while apollo and zeus have sent me some good throws none came to me that day my first was so bad that men laughed one of the local gentlemen was heard to say that my reputation as a killer of men must be one of those provincial tales that would not stand up to scrutiny idomeneus grinned from ear to ear and came to stand by me we shared the same thought to kill the fool but my brotherinlaw antigonus who by that time i loved like a brother kicked me hard in the shin i whirled on him looking for blood he stood his ground they want to provoke you he hissed do you want the girl or not antigonus was the right man to be my brotherinlaw thats for certain i took a deep breath and walked away it was a close thing if one of them had laughed again there would have been blood the third day we hunted deer in the hills north of the city more of the local gentlemen came along and it turned out that we were hunting in teams in a competition i had all my travelling companions in my team we didnt know the ground and we didnt know the habits of the local deer and neither my prospective fatherinlaw nor any of his friends showed the slightest compunction in abandoning us to our ignorance we were left on a mountain road in the distance we could see the sea by the shrine of heracles over towards marathon the countryside was beautiful in the weak winter sun i waited until my competition was out of sight right i said philip you are the best hunter my guess is that we should go downhill to the water philip glowed with pride at being singled out among so many warriors water yes he said then he shrugged but i smell rotting apples and if theres one thing deer love in winter its an old apple orchard we broke up then going six different ways to locate the apple orchard like scouts for an army it was down the hill almost ten stades away philip had the nose of a hound but we found it philip came up to me i was still mounted there are deer lying in the orchard he said at least six and perhaps more you and idomeneus are the best spears yes i nodded and teucer i said philip grinned he valued the archer of course the rest of us will push the deer into you if youll make the crawl he got me to a tall rock that rose like a temple column and helped me climb it from the top we could see the apple trees hoary old things with all their leaves down and i could see the browngrey smears that were deer lying in the high dead grass then passed an anxious hour as idomeneus and teucer and i crawled around the orchard to get downwind of the beasts twice we heard the local party blowing horns in triumph and on one occasion we could see one of the bucks raise his head to look for the sound philip and the beaters started too early or perhaps we were too slow pushing our spears through the wet cold grass either way we were a hundred paces from where we wanted to be when philip blew his horn and the deer began to scramble to their feet i leaped up cursed and began to run teucer didnt he rose to one knee and started to shoot he saved us from failure we would never have reached those deer my best throw with my best spear fell short but teucer knocked six down with eight arrows incredible work at that range through scattered trees and high grass but then teamwork came into it because none of his arrows killed and we ran at the wounded animals me calling out orders the other men spreading out from two sides i was running hard cursing my leg and i saw my misthrown spear sticking in the ground and managed to grab the haft without slowing the biggest buck was vanishing from view into a thicket of dogwood and thorns i plunged after it and it turned a big stag as tall at the shoulder as a small horse i threw my good spear and the beast shied and took a blow meant for the head on the shoulder but he fell and i was on him with my other spear i thrust home twice and the animal shuddered and his eyes filmed over and he lay still i felt more for that stag than i do for many men i kill he was a magnificent animal trapped with no chance at all the dogs had been released by then and they were hard by us so i knelt closed the stags eyes and said a prayer to artemis then i pulled my throwing spear clear of his shoulder and followed the sound of the dogs by the time i caught the pack all six animals were dead we were a good group and every man followed the nearest target without much shouting and did his duty then came the work we had six dead deer and we treed them in the apple orchard split and gutted them then began to clean them we were far from water and despite the chill of the morning we stripped naked to save our clothes and we were pious men and lykon and philip who both revered artemis led us in a hymn we didnt know and we burned the first fruits of the beasts their hearts and livers on a rock that had certainly served as an altar before by the time the last carcass was ready to be moved we were covered in blood and ordure and we walked down the road like a dionysian revel gone hideously awry we bathed in a stream and laughed and threw icy water at each other but when we were dressed i arranged to put the carcasses on donkeys and i paid a pair of farm boys to bring them along by the high road and not the farm road and then my whole party returned to the tower apparently emptyhanded aleitus and his friends were drinking in the courtyard and they laughed at our discomfiture and made ribald comments about what we could have been doing in the woods ten men alone that we were wet and had no deer and were so clean euphoria came down the stone steps from the tower to the courtyard with a tray of wine cups and conversation stilled she had that effect with her slanting eyes and her long straight nose if you caught no deer she said to me quietly as she handed me a cup why do you have blood under your nails i smiled into her eyes you are observant i said you play dangerous games she answered and truly when our deer arrived the local men were silent and their eyes were not friendly we had killed six to their two now let me tell you children lest you wonder that in those days a kill of two deer for a party of ten men was a fine catch and six deer was a ridiculous bag almost an affront to artemis bordering on hubris i cared nothing for those men if men will seek to compete they must take the consequences i do not push myself on others but ever they will strive against me and the result is always the same i mean no boasting by the gods aleitus looked at the row of carcasses and he turned to me and his face was red do you not fear that you affront artemis with so many kills i shook my head no lord i made immediate sacrifice of the first fruits of every animal and i prayed as soon as my spear went home in the stag who is you must allow a magnificent animal i walked over to him am i mistaken lord or was it your intention that we should compete at hunting and i laughed in his face he was angry but he mastered his anger like a man of breeding and merely raised an eyebrow the slaves will eat well he said if id known of your prowess id have invited more guests there was a laugh from the gate a laugh i knew well did you set arimnestos a challenge miltiades said he slid off his horse magnificent in a clothofgold chlamys over a purple chiton worn doublebelted for riding his horse had a gold harness and there were four men with him each armed with a boar spear and riding matching black horses miltiades defied convention by embracing me before embracing the host then he turned to aleitus he used to drive me wild miltiades said any task hes set he excels or breaks the tools and when challenged he is a dangerous animal our plataean miltiades charisma filled the courtyard i was a famous man in those days but miltiades was the sort of man who bestrode the earth and other men crowded around to see him and he had come to be part of my hunting party let me see this girl ive heard so much about miltiades demanded where is she aleitus rubbed his eyes lord miltiades he said im sorry aleitus i was invited to join this young scapegraces hunting party and im late am i still welcome i think our grandfathers were guestfriends and i must say ive brought you some fair gifts he boomed with laughter aleitus looked as if the gods from olympus had just arrived lord it is an honour to have you to guest i had no idea our grandfathers were guestfriends but i would be delighted that is im very pleased come and drink this cup with me aleitus was just beginning to recover when miltiades slapped me on the back and laughed and that prig aristides is on his way as well he said i thought my prospective fatherinlaw might faint mater had invited them in my name and her instincts winesodden as they might have been were keen for a party of boeotians to ride roughshod over the local countryside slaughtering deer and making local men feel small would no doubt have ended badly for someone but it was hard for any bad feeling to survive when miltiades was in a hospitable mood and aristides was the exemplar of arete and between the two of them they created an atmosphere that the rest of us could only strive to emulate in fact they made me feel young that week was i think my reward for the rescue of miltiades great lords of athens dont usually have a week to waste hunting on the other hand i can imagine what mater wrote if you want to cement your alliance with plataea and my son go hunting with him and get him his attic bride say what you will about mater and i do believe me she understood how aristocrats think and work marriage is not pleasure it is alliance and bargain and great men use their daughters the way peasants use a prize foal as i will thugater bah ill find you a pretty one this fellow from halicarnassus to be honest when i arrived i had the feeling that my suit would be rejected at the first decent interval and after the young lady called me low i wanted no more part of the game save to humiliate my host but the arrival of my famous friends altered the balance what had appeared manly revenge the previous night now felt petty and meanspirited and over wine that night i rose and apologized to all the men mine and my hosts for playing such a foolish joke i suffer from pride i said to my host it is a fatal error in a man who is but a bronzesmith to seek always to compete in every game aleitus showed his mettle then he rose took my cup from my lips and drank from it you speak like a hero he said i sought to belittle you men told me you were lowborn and brought only dirty hands to my table he glanced at aristides who returned a hard smile i will be more careful who i listen to in future cleitus of course aristides said later that night anything you put your hand to in attica he will try to destroy he has sworn your death and your ruin i shrugged the rest of the week passed very pleasantly we ate a great deal of deer meat and we failed to find a boar to my hosts deep annoyance and i invited him to come and hunt with us on the flanks of cithaeron but it was the evenings that live in my memory hunting becomes a blur to be honest if it hadnt been for the killing of six deer i doubt id remember anything about that killing deer is seldom memorable the way killing men is memorable deer dont fight back at any rate it was during that week that i lay on a couch with miltiades and aristides and drank good wine and learned that datis had a fleet and was raising an army and that his target the target ordered by his king was athens it was bound to happen i may have been foolish enough to imagine that darius would forget athens or that his reach wasnt long enough to punish the one greek state powerful enough to contest with him but i was wrong darius never forgot athens and as the dead of lade rotted on the sea floor and the timbers of broken ships washed ashore to become firewood as a year passed and another and artaphernes sought to heal the wounds datis had caused and return his satrapy to peace and prosperity so datis ever eager for power and the praise of his uncle raised ships and soldiers for a new expedition his intention was to do to athens what he perceived athens had done to sardis to sack the acropolis and burn her temples for whatever reason datis bragged of his intentions so when ships docked at ephesus and tyre and on the blackened quay where men were rebuilding miletus they saw the evidence of the gathering of a mighty fleet and they heard tell of a regiment of sakai the bronzeclad heavy archers from the steppes of colchis and two regiments of medes marching all the way from persepolis to bolster the lydians and carians in datiss army i will digress here to say that i have always thought that datis planned to take sardis for himself and then to knock darius from his throne and make himself king of kings such has always been the persian way the war among the strong makes the winner stronger still not unlike the greek way come to think of it very like the competition to be first man in athens if you ask me miltiades told me of the sakai and the medes while lying at my side eating figs paramanos brought me that titbit he said from a messenger who came over the passes from our friend the jew of sardis i admit that even there in the safety of attica far from sardis i felt a frisson of fear so datis is really coming i asked and i thought of artaphernes and briseis as if my thought could be translated into concrete reality miltiades put a small ivory tube in my hand another friend sent me this he said datis really is coming i opened the tube and took out a scroll and my heart hammered in my chest for the first time in days i forgot euphoria her father my farm and my forge in my hand was a slip of paper in briseiss handwriting datis sails after the great feast of artemis ships men tell doru that i live and so does my brother tell him that our heraclitus took his life after lade i couldnt breathe i thought her brother was dead too miltiades said now he commands ships in the great kings fleet he is becoming a great man among the greeks who serve persia i barely paid him a thought heraclitus is dead i said i wept but in my head i rejoiced because briseis was not dead and she had written to me he is miltiades rolled on his back drank wine from the kylix that was circulating and flipped the lees across the room where they rang on the rim of one of my bronze water urns he cared little for heraclitus or any philosophy if they come he asked carefully can athens count on plataea suddenly his addition to my hunting party was put in perspective but he had at least waited two days to ask his question a hush fell over our part of the party and i could see aristides who lay with sophanes lean towards me the better to hear me i laughed grimly unlike athens i said plataea is a democracy we would have to vote to stand with you against the medes then seeing their faces i shook my head you know we will stand with you plataea exists because athens stands ready to march on thebes we are not ingrates aristides rolled off his couch and clapped my shoulder i told you he was a man of honour he said perhaps not his bestthoughtout compliment miltiades looked serious this wont be about honour he said this will be about survival he looked at me seriously forget briseis boy she is not for you marry this girl have strong sons and help me save greece that is your fate just for a moment i hated him then i caught sight of euphoria at her loom she was chatting with lykon but she flashed me a smile in telling of politics i threaten to forget euphoria which is unfair to her she adorned some dinners and played the kithara for us and she and pen and leda sang together i still remember them their heads together singing the paean of apollo in a way that haunted me their high voices like the muses themselves and i mean no hubris one voice brushing lightly on another in the heart of the music and there was a small feast i think it was a local peasant feast for pan who is a peasant god from the old days and almost unknown here in normal times i dont think the household would have been allowed a feast but with so many important guests and more came in including themistocles of all men he took my hand and embraced me well met plataean he said i considered a sharp reply but again the dignity of my elders restrained me so i returned his embrace and we were reconciled aleitus gathered his people and took us all on a cold picnic to the shrine of pan in the hills fifteen stades away the festival was a small thing and had never seen so many rich famous men but miltiades refused to allow the big men to wreck it this is where his touch was gold he threw himself into dances and drank harsh new red wine with shepherds and farmers and aristides and themistocles had no choice but to join him i think they were better for it we sacrificed a bull to pan the richest sacrifice any man there could remember and we added a hundred voices to the hymns as darkness fell we gathered wood for a bonfire that was the largest i think i ever saw because after a week of agon manly competition even gathering firewood was something at which every man sought to excel the farmers and peasants laughed to be waited on by euphoria and penelope and leda and half a dozen other gentlewomen when the dancing started it was clear that on this hilltop the women danced with the men and aleitus allowed it and so our maidens and matrons joined the ring of women and we saw them dance a rare sight in those days and rarer today i remember spinning euphoria in the middle of the circle when it was my turn and her face grinning up into mine and when the men and women went off into the dark i envied them i tried to kiss her at the edge of the fire and she laughed and slipped under my arm and vanished a few moments later she was with pen and leda giggling pen waved at me and i could not take offence aristocrats daughters do not lose their virginity on the cold grass briseis would have though while i was thinking on euphoria and briseis their similarities and differences miltiades came up and put a hand on my shoulder marry her quick before she sees how old and ugly you are he said i tried to smile but i couldnt she was talking to lykon who was i fear both younger and prettier than me but even as my heart began to grow warm lykon pointed at me across the fire and when his gaze met mine he smiled i smiled back hard to be jealous of a boy so openhearted as to plead your suit for you which i still think he might have been doing cleitus has gone into exile miltiades said that sounds good i said my thoughts were elsewhere not for you plataean he swore at the temple of athena to have your head i have witnesses he went into voluntary exile to have a freer hand in arranging his revenge and my downfall hes hiring mercenaries from all over greece masterless men and wandering warriors i laughed i could deal with cleitus much more easily than i could deal with euphoria the firelight played on her golden hair and turned it orange and now she and pen and leda were dancing together a womans dance that moved the hips and shoulders euphoria swayed her hips in a way that suggested there was fire in her and i had to look away my eyes met miltiades he shook his head in mock disbelief youve got it bad doru i shrugged i didnt see any point in denying it as my eyes had already gone back to her lykon was watching her too cleitus means to kill you miltiades said i shrugged again hes welcome to try your arrogance borders on hubris lad miltiades put an arm around my shoulder i think one of the reasons ive always loved you is that you remind me so much of me he said with a little selfmockery he held out a skin of resinated wine and i took a healthy pull he wont come at you for single combat hell come with a hundred men just then watching lykon devour euphoria with his eyes and watching her shy return of his attentions i would happily have fought all hundred as a demonstration sport as men sometimes fought duels at the olympics into plataea i asked thinking about it what from thebes or from the sea miltiades answered its only forty stades i nodded sobered and as i considered how to defend myself from that whoreson cleitus euphoria linked arms with the other girls and hands high they began to sway all their hips shot out together like married women in the dionysian dances and they dissolved into giggles and then across the fire her eyes locked with mine she didnt look away and i could have stared at her for ever just then one lock of her bright gold hair was loose and it trailed away on the wind of the fire and her face was the face of a goddess a goldenhaired goddess aristides and sophanes pushed forward through the throng to stand with miltiades and me now this is a party sophanes shouted he was just twenty i think and hed fought well on the lade campaign of course he was newly married and in love with all the world i wish my wife was here he added id carry her off into the dark like a satyr and shed tell you that she was too cold for love miltiades said not my wife sophanes said i keep her warm aristides put his hand on my arm and looked at miltiades you warned him he said i did the big man answered and he laughed it off love has obscured his fine sense of danger aristides shook his head if the medes come in the spring he said you and your plataeans will matter very much to us this is more than friendship watch yourself euphoria had disappeared into the darkness if cleitus comes at me in plataea ill make a drinking cup of his skull i said aristides choked on his wine thats my boy miltiasay that a spirit of cooperation sweptdes said euphoria never burned my heart like briseis but suddenly she was in it so on the last day i went to her father bowed and asked for her hand behind me stood miltiades and aristides alcaeus antigonus philip and themistocles and a dozen other gentlemen he looked around at them before he met my eye i suspect it would be political death for me to refuse you he said and he smiled and i thought that despite our first brushes we might grow to be friends but i swore to artemis when her mother was dying that i would allow her a choice in the matter of her husband shall i send for her suddenly i found myself nervous i who had cleared the deck of a phoenician trireme by myself my heart beat the way it does just before i enter a fight and i wanted to get away euphoria came down to the courtyard surrounded by the other girls pen led her down the steps and leda was hard at her heels but they werent giggling or playing they were solemn and pen wouldnt meet my eye it was the dirty hands that did it i realized she didnt want a lowborn smith who would soil her weaving she wanted someone like aristides who could stand in the front rank when required but otherwise kept his hands clean it was rather like a lost battle once i saw how doomed my case was my calm returned and i determined because i liked her very well to bear her refusal with a good grace she walked up to me eyes downcast her blonde hair piled artlessly on her head and neck her simple wool chiton was woven from wool that probably came from their own sheep and it showed off her figure her slim slightly rounded waist and her wide hips and straight back few women have dignity at fourteen euphoria had it she came up close to me and only then did i realize how much shorter than me she was by a head or more she gave the impression of height with her dignity and carriage i expected her eyes to flick to lykon but they did not they stayed firmly fixed on the ground in front of her lovely maiden i said i managed a smile you would make me the happiest of men if you would consent to be my bride yet i added to soften the blow i live in faroff boeotia on a farm and i hammer bronze for my bread and no one will understand better than me if you choose to stay closer to hearth and home then she raised her eyes a pale blue like good steel and she smiled a sort of halfsmile as if she was about to laugh at herself my loom will be as comfortable by your forge as it would be in any house in attica i expect she said pen was grinning i didnt understand and in my confusion i tried to think of something noble or witty to say to turn aside my disappointment ive been told twenty times by friends that i had never looked like such a fool in all my life and that what i said was huh she laughed aloud a real laugh such as maidens usually hide so that her belly moved and her breasts rose and fell under the bindings of her chiton yes pen said to me poking me in the side she said yes she said yes it took me a long time to understand not until i had digested her agreement did i understand how important it had become to me that she had said yes in the time it takes zeus to throw a bolt to earth at the whim of a maiden my life changed we set the wedding for late winter and i rode back over the mountains with my companions we celebrated the feast of artemis at plataea and they rode away to their homes it is one of the saddest comments on men honey that war and death make for a long story but a winter of contentment and happiness can pass in a single breath our barns were full our byres were full and all that winter we hunted on cithaeron we danced the pyrrhiche and we discussed strategies against persia women sat at their looms and wove and put in their own comments we stored food we worked on our leather my forge roared every day as i made helmets a few good ones and more of the newstyle openfaced bowls which men now call boeotians we called them dogcaps if not for cleon the winter would have been perfect and forgettable i spent my spare time learning to engrave tiraeus knew something of it and had a set of gravers among the tools hed brought with him from when he was a tinker i bought more tools fine steel from corinth but a few weeks before i was due to return to attica i found cleon lying out in the freezing rain drunk and asleep at first i thought he was dead i took him home cleaned him and sobered him and then he wept the next day he was drunk again i waited him out and sobered him up tiraeus was in the shop youre wasting your time he said hes a drunk let him go he saved my life once i went back to trying to scratch marks accurately on smooth bronze by now i was a better engraver than tiraeus and i began to put borders on everything i made acanthus leaves olive leaves laurels waves whatever i fancied i was planning to make a fine table setting for my new wife instead i kept having to sober cleon he cost me a days ploughing as i had to leave the turning of the wet cold earth to other men so that i could sit inside with him but after another day of it and with due apologies to hermogenes and tiraeus and styges who in effect lived with me i sent all the wine away to my warehouse in the town all of it we had nothing to drink on the hill but water cleon still managed to find wine however he was drunk again the next day drunk and desperately sorry so that he followed me around the farm begging me to forgive him and kill him im ashamed to say i punched him and left him where he fell on his fifth day in my house he tried to fall on one of my swords he wedged the sword into the cracks in a floorboard but he was drunk and botched it so that when he fell his weight mostly knocked the blade flat he ripped himself open over the ribs and all the slaves had to help move him and clean him that night mater came downstairs she came down to where i was sitting with him in the andron i had no thoughts in my head i was just going through the motions of friendship because in just five days i had come to loathe him and his weakness but mater came down and she sat by him leave him to me she said so i did i have no idea what she said as one drunk to another but the next week just a few days before i left for attica he came out to the forge sober and in a clean chiton he sat on the hearth for a while and watched me i was trying to engrave a pattern of animals i wanted to put my stag on the bowl i was finishing and i had botched it so badly that i was angrily polishing the lines off again may i show you how to draw a stag cleon asked he was so hesitant it would have broken your heart honey i was none too tender with him try i said be my guest i dont know what i expected when drunk men claim all sorts of skills and i still didnt know whether he had had a skinful or not although he looked pale enough he took the metal to the rawhide window for light and he took my black wax and began to draw in three lines i could see the stag before he had the antlers done he wiped the whole right off the bronze and started again but this time his hand was surer and the lines went down as if he were copying them from something he could see and perhaps he could inside his head i was delighted i was delighted in many different ways as a craftsman as a friend as a man trying to reclaim a drunk from hades and when i took the graver in my fist he snatched it from me i do clay mostly he said but i know how to grave metal i held up one of my borders as do i i said he frowned you are scratching he said you need to cut the metal he picked up my heaviest graver and began to push it across the surface of my bowl like this careful strokes deeper where you want a heavier line at first his hands were tentative and slow and he left tiny errors on the lines still deeper and better cut than mine but wavering but then he drank some warm milk and his hand steadied and before the afternoon was over tiraeus had slapped him on the back and the three of us polished the finished bowl together and set it in the glow of the fire to admire our shared work can you stay sober i asked him he looked at me i doubt it he said how much engraving do you have for me tiraeus laughed but i knew he was telling the truth i remember the ride over the mountains wed already started the first ploughing and as hesiod says the boneless one is gnawing on his foot it was the ugly time when the days grow longer but only so that more rain can fall and still nothing comes from the earth and men think winter may never break there was snow everywhere on the mountain and yet our horses made short work of the ride and we came down into the plains of attica without losing a toe from frostbite aristides was there first with jocasta an unexpected ally in this marriage business and she and pen were immediate friends miltiades came with his wife a vapid thracian princess id met often enough before even the alcmaeonids were represented in the person of kineas an elder a member of the areopagitica and a powerful man he was pleasant and dignified it was a very public wedding and the little temple of aphrodite where we were bound together was filled to the outer row of pillars with guests i remember little of the ceremony except my own sense of importance which makes me laugh now i was delighted that so many famous men had come and yet i was decent enough to be equally delighted to see paramanos and agios and harpagos whose ship was in piraeus and who had kept his cargo waiting to come up and kiss my bride with them were a dozen oarsmen and marines who had the wherewithal to travel into the hills above marathon to see me wed euphoria was so beautiful on her wedding day that i couldnt think of much else to tell the truth i remember the look in her eyes when i lifted the veil and i remember how she rested her hip against mine in the chariot as we rode from her fathers house to the house we had borrowed to be mine her women bathed her winter is an unkind time for weddings i have to tell you and men sang songs about the size of my member and the depth of her cunny oh you blush my dear youve never heard wedding songs and when i undressed her she devoured me who knew that under her humour and her nimble fingers and equally nimble head lurked a woman of flesh and blood we coupled well all night her body was like a feast and all i could do was eat but ill keep the rest of those memories for myself i will only brag like other bridegrooms i have known that i kept her warm and she craved my warmth often enough to make my sister blush like you blushing girl but not so often nor so red look friends shes gone off again you could heat a room with her warmth we rode back over the passes into boeotia and started our new lives and for the rest i remember little enough except that we were happy and healthy and in love it didnt last nothing worth having ever does but it was the happiest time of my young life spring in boeotia the feast of persephone the dancing maidens the birth of ewes and kids the rain the mud the first green and then the burst of flowers from the ground as if the earth is impatient for new life which she is and soon enough the barley harvest which was as rich and fecund as the autumn wheat harvest had been euphoria was pregnant she filled our old house with herself and as soon as the jasmine blossomed we had sprigs of it in every room there were flowerwreaths on every door and a dozen new women her women and her fathers gift to me with as many boarhounds and they wove and chattered and cooked and laughed and barked mater bloomed as well i heard her singing with euphoria on the second day she was in my house and i shook my head waiting for my new wife to discover what a horror my mother really was but mater did not fail was it cleon was cleon a mirror to her or was it having a daughterinlaw of her own class that brought her downstairs and into our lives i grumbled i wont lie i had little love for mater and when she was sitting at my table night after night she was like a blight on my crops euphoria was not afraid of me she never was a rarity in those days when men feared my wrath ah you still fear it do you young man very wise my hand is not yet a willow branch but in those days nonetheless when i was rude to my mother euphoria would look at me across the room may i have a word with you in private my dear she would ask and when we had a door between us and the rest of the world she would say i am mistress in this house and i insist that my husband have the manners of a gentleman rude to your mother how boorish is that i remember it well my honey her tongue was as sharp as my sword and she was seldom wrong and i was so besotted with her that i seldom troubled her with a reply indeed i felt that i was the luckiest man in the world that such a creature had agreed to be my wife i sometimes wondered if i was one of those monsters in our myths who keeps the maiden until slain by a hero was i the hero or the minotaur and we did fight it will sound odd when you consider her birth and mine but i found her stinginess offensive she disliked spending our winter stores on guests on cleon on idomeneus she would keep yesterdays barley in a pan by the hearth to feed to local men who appeared through the spring mud to talk about politics and she tasted all the wine in my cellar then divided the amphorae into those for guests and those for the house we are not poor i remember shouting at her and i will keep us that way she shouted back on another evening when idomeneus made a remark about the age of the lamb he was eating i winced there was some screaming i remember asking are you the daughter of some shepherd no attic shepherds are generous a slave perhaps slave she roared turning on me this from a man with his arms black to the elbows now this hurt as i washed and washed each night before i went into the house because i didnt want to seem like the blackened smith to my glorious aristocratic wife i cocked back my hand to hit her most men hit their wives and with various amounts of reason some because they are weak fools who have to be stronger than someone and others because their women hit them first but let us be honest men are by and large bigger than women and far stronger and my pater taught me that any man who uses force on a woman to get her into bed or merely win her agreement in argument is contemptible you heard me if you think otherwise lets hear it despite which married for a month i found myself with a hand in the air and i wasnt going to give her a swat i was going to knock her teeth out trust me i know what i intended rage consumed me black hands indeed you have to love someone to be that angry i think she didnt flinch i stormed out of the house rather than hit her i got a horse and rode over to see peneleos and had a cup of wine with him and his sister and his wife they told me in short that i was a fool and i needed to go back and apologize excellent advice and i rode back to find euphorias door shut and barred and i had to listen to the sound of her weeping i called and she shouted something peneleos had told me not to worry if we werent reconciled before bed but i couldnt sleep and it was a long long night i lacked the courage to go to her door again and when i went to the pantry to get a cup of beer in the night the two kitchen slaves both hers flattened themselves against the wall in terror of me when the sun rose i went out into the courtyard and sang a hymn to helios hoping that she would come down and then i went and lit the forge tiraeus came in munching a crust of stale bread he had no idea that there had been a quarrel you look like goat crap he said after we had worked for an hour bad night i said bah newlyweds he said shes pregnant you can stop fucking now his grin took the sting from the words no i said we had a fight he shrugged never been married he said but it does seem to me that most people fight you and me for instance that was true enough and tiraeus and i were in some ways closer than any other two men i knew except maybe me and hermogenes when we shared a project we were inseparable craft made us closer than brothers and still we could disagree on everything and anything and when a helmet or a cup was in that dangerous stage just short of completion it would all boil over into anger and disappointment and outrage we were so used to it that wed get the edges on a helmet trimmed and shake hands and say tomorrow we fight and wed laugh but the next day as we raised the last lines on the skull the fight would start all of which is by way of saying that as usual tiraeus had a point so what did she do he asked served idomeneus some threedayold stew put that way it just didnt sound as bad i see death sentence for that i agree and what did you say tiraeus punctuated his remarks with taps on the bowl he was planishing i called her a slave pretty much i cringed at the thought ahh tiraeus picked up his bowl stared at the area he was planishing and shook his head well that doesnt sound so bad he looked at me you call me the son of a whore all the time his smile told me differently and i understood both that he felt i had behaved badly and that he resented my epithets when i was angry and while i took this in the door opened and there was euphoria with a cup in her hands warm wine and spices husband she asked from the door she had never been in the forge before wife i asked in reply and i caught the handle of the cup and pulled her gently in welcome to the forge empedocles would have a fit tiraeus said he got up from his stool and came over ill just step outside for a piss eh i put a hand to stop him wife i have behaved badly and i used a phrase which no free person should ever use to another i wish to apologize in front of my fellow master smith and i understand that i am guilty of doing the same to him when in anger you do have a temper tiraeus said euphoria looked at me for a moment there were questions in her eyes and those questions were in some ways more painful than shouted arguments and closed doors apology accepted she said ive brought you wine and theres breakfast for both of you in the andron the breakfast was an apology of its own eggs and good bread and spiced wine for me and tiraeus and for hermogenes when he came in from the vines and that day i learned what was best about euphoria the thing that made me the luckiest of men when she accepted my apology why then the argument was over i have known women briseis i must confess who hold a grudge for ever but euphoria however angry she might have been dismissed her anger as the sun burns through a morning fog so that once the anger had passed it never needed to be recalled beautiful breasts and a lovely waist and a face like a statue are all very well but an even temper and a sense of fairness will last longer ask any married man or woman for that matter that was the spring of contentment we argued twice i think and ill tell the story of the second time in a moment but we also ate and danced and made love and went into plataea for market days together and because euphoria was such a lovely pleasant girl everyone wanted to meet her and suddenly i was a man with friends acquaintances invitations penelope visited twice it was only thirty stades from her home to mine and once the roads were dry she could come on a whim as the days grew longer and hotter and the season prepared to turn again she was pregnant too and delighted to be so and she told me with a giggle that she thought that the bonfire of pan had had a salutary effect and her husband rolled his eyes they were served our best food and drink i noticed and then dismissed because there are fights not worth having we hosted myron to dinner before midsummers eve he hadnt eaten in my house since my father was alive his wife had arranged it with euphoria although neither was present for the dinner instead most of the men who came were older men peneleos was there and he was my age as was his older brother epictetus and bion was there because he was my right hand and welcome any time but the other men were older draco seemed older than the hills and diocles was only a little younger than mater and hilarion once the life of the party and a poor farmer was now a cheerful and wealthy man they were my neighbours we also invited idomeneus down from cithaeron and alcaeus of miletus who had status in plataea by virtue of being the lord in effect if not in fact of fifty good spearmen who were now citizens we had a good sacrifice up the hill i remember that i watched the skies for a day praying for good weather and i remember that we still had to squelch our way across the best barley field because wed had rain but our little altar was high and dry on the hilltop myron made the sacrifice and he mentioned my father in his prayer and then we gave the fat and the bones to the god and squelched our way back down to the house with the slaves carrying the skin and all the meat and we had quite a dinner a whole sheep the slaves shared in it i had quite a few slaves by then with my wifes i had twenty too many and they were starting to breed more we had a proper symposium too with good talk about civic duty and the difference between mens laws and gods laws it was all very pleasant and then we began to talk of persia myron held up his hand and we all stopped talking i want to discuss a matter of business he said he had quite a presence by then i could remember him as a young farmer but by that time he was an orator and a man of immense dignity arimnestos i intend to put it to the vote after the first feast of heracles that you be the polemarch of the city polemarch and strategos both whats a strategos hilarion asked that was a fair question in those days many towns had a polemarch but only athens and sparta had strategoi they were officers real officers the way we had ofcers when we served miltiades every strategos had responsibility for a body of men when the phalanx formed and this made the phalanx more flexible in combat the old polemarchs were often politicians and sometimes soldiers but they formed the phalanx that is they knew where each man should stand in the array and they fought in the place of honour the right end of the front rank usually they died there but they didnt normally issue any orders beyond getting every man to the battlefield and into his place in the line on that evening plataea had perhaps two thousand hoplites armoured warriors wed grown in the last ten years and the milesians had brought us new fighters and we were richer bion and hermogenes for instance both men had been slaves and yet now they were prosperous farmers with full armour wealth individual wealth translated directly into fighting power in those days in my fathers time wed fielded fifteen hundred hoplites only by freeing slaves and putting them virtually unarmed into the rear ranks so our military power was greater and myron proposed formalizing my control of it i nodded of course i said this is no empty honour myron said there is a persian fleet on the seas news has reached me that the medes intend to sack naxos and then they will come to attica athens will expect us to stand with them it was still chilly in the evenings we had a brazier in the middle of the room but the men were still huddled in their himations and i remember that i could see my breath when i spoke this spring bion asked this summer at least myron answered are we ready arimnestos i rolled off my couch and cursed the cold floor we are as ready as a city at peace can be i answered we dance the pyrrhiche at least twice as often as we used to do i take the younger men up the mountain as often as i can and i will make it more often this spring short of war itself the hunt and the dance are our best methods of training hilarion shrugged and pulled his cloak over his feet why do we need to fight the persians he asked i know you all think me slowwitted but what has the great king ever done to me not a thing i answered he is a good ruler and a great man or so i hear but hilarion when is the last time you fought in the phalanx you know as well as me the fight at the bridge where we helped athens against the men of euboea he grinned i didnt really fight either i did some pushing from the fifth rank i think weve had fifteen years of peace because athens has stood between us and thebes i paused to spit and every man present joined me diocles nodded true enough he said were about to pay for those years of peace myron said the price will be high and if the rest of boeotia submits to the great king we will be alone our city will be wide open when we march away myrons words brought the reality home to every man in the room by ares peneleos said is it so bad is this certain myron looked at me as i was his principal source of information peneleos when there are dark clouds in the north do you expect rain i asked he nodded and raised an eyebrow i expect it but it does not always come sometimes the rain goes to thespiae or hisiae exactly i agreed the great king may never take naxos he may forget athens or the men of athens may make a peace with him a storm might come up and wreck his fleet its happened before but the dark clouds are right there friends and we would be foolish not to be prepared i plan to ask the assembly for money to repair the walls and raise two new bastions all stone to cover the gate myron said i will ask that every free man send a slave to work so that the repairs are done immediately as soon as the planting is in and i will be asking for the richest men to contribute to the towers i will pay for one of them myself he looked around bion gave me a slight nod of the head i will pay for one third of the second tower i said with the help of bion and alcaeus idomeneus surprised us i will pay for one third he said from my own funds he added diocles and hilarion and draco muttered among themselves and epictetus and peneleos sharing a couch leaned in and in the end the five of them agreed to share the cost of a third of the tower as the men gathered to walk home i found myself with peneleos and epictetus i have a hard time seeing myself as a leading man peneleos said im a second son i am not that old i laughed youre older than me i said and im about to be polemarch bion shook his head plataea lost a generation in the three battles he said and in the fights with thebes before that think of your fathers and brothers all dead that was a sobering thought but a true one myron had been my fathers friend my father should have been here to be polemarch and diocles father should have been here and epictetuss father and my brother and hilarions older brother on and on were a city of young men hilarion quipped if we have to fight the medes well be a city of widows bion answered him the assembly was dull enough and i remember none of it not even my formal elevation to polemarch and strategos after the feast of heracles thirty days after the summer solstice i was allowed as polemarch to choose the other two strategoi myself wed decided to have three one for each of the towns that made up plataea before the alliance with athens turned us into a real city right away my new rank plunged me into politics i wanted idomeneus and alcaeus or at least lysius as officers i wanted the strategoi to be men who had been under the hand of ares who knew the sound of spears and shields but all of us even lysius and ajax lived in one district over by hisiae so i wasted good workdays going to meetings to talk with the local men in the other two districts i knew them all there were only three thousand citizens back then and we all knew each other pretty well i kept hoping to find some retired mercenary some man who had served under miltiades or even with the medes now that i think of it in those districts closest to the river they had most of the good farmland and i suspect their sons didnt need to go to sea to win a few silver coins ours did over by the mountain there were good young men from those districts bellerophon son of epistocles who lived as close to thebes as a man could and not be a theban was a fine young man with full armour who had been to every deer hunt from the first got spearfighting lessons from lysius and also spent all his spare hours with idomeneus he was from the asopus district but he was seventeen years old and no bearded man would take an order from him try his pater myron said when i asked his advice hes a wealthy man and a decent one if the sons such a good warrior the pater wont be a sluggard he added hmm well youll see how that worked out the northern district was the hardest the men over there were almost thespian and they had their own ways and a few of them complained that in the event of a fight theyd march with thespiae and not plataea before the great wars came men were freer with their citizenship but that very freedom saved me in the end my brotherinlaw antigonus owned farms in plataea his free men were liable for service as psiloi or peltastai and it occurred to me that if myron would accept it he would make a firstrate strategos so he was granted citizenship in fact myron discovered that his family had always been allowed to be citizens a very convenient discovery let me tell you and i appointed him as strategos this proved to be a fortuitous choice antigonus brought us another fifty hoplites of his own all men of thespiae but people didnt care so much then as i say and he had riches which he used to improve the armour of his district and of course he had most of that armour made at my forge my forge grew that spring tiraeus and i shared the same shed of course and bion had since my paters time had his own anvils and his own fire just up the hill by his house but when the money came over the mountain that spring money from athens i mean for worked bronze wed sent in the autumn and when antigonus placed a huge order for armour and helmets then tiraeus wanted to build his own shed i need a pair of slaves he said so do you we do too much of the donkey work and we need some boys fee boys who want to grow to be smiths we could triple our output i already had styges who had gradually made himself into my apprentice but i found two more for me and hermogenes found a couple for his father and suddenly my forge was crowded we put up a shed for tiraeus and as soon as it was done empedocles came out from thebes and blessed his fire we had a sacrifice and empedocles initiated all of our new boys slaves and free together because the god cares nothing for such stuff you know the medes are coming eh he asked me it was easy to forget that he was a theban but sometimes it came back even in little plataea the news has come i answered dont get your back up the godless athenians are in for it thebes is safe were not fools he sat back and drank wine we are i handed him an altar plate id made as my sacrifice to the god on the face cleon and i had engraved a scene of the smith god returning to olympus after being cast forth led by dionysus when did you learn to do such fine work he asked the older man you raised to the first degree i said hes an engraver empedocles whistled you have quite an operation here he said why not put it all in one building like the potters in corinth you have water charcoal three mastersmiths and an engraver and a reputation at least as far away as thebes they may spit when they mention you but theyll all hurry to buy your bronze i have never sent a shipment of my bronze to thebes i said men sell it from athens he said you are quite well known in thebes my boy simon son of simon keeps your name in the ears of many men although not to your favour and he paused drank from his cup and looked up at me and there are men in thebes who plan to kill you i shrugged let them come then dont be a fool boy someone someone with a great deal of money has hired a whole band of cutthroats he shivered if they come from thebes to here it would be war i said i dont think thebes wants war with athens empedocles shook his head simon is loud in proclaiming that athens would not care if you were killed he said now it was my turn to shake my head old news priest i am the polemarch of plataea and my death would burn thebes the way a hot forge burns charcoal they made you polemarch the priest said you have come far my boy i have too i agreed if you find simon tell him to go away and never come back and i for my part will not hunt him down and kill him let the bad blood be over but tell your archon for me and for my archon that if men of thebes come here or even hired men coming from thebes then we will fight and athens will stand with us not if athens has been destroyed the old priest said im sorry lad but what they plan is to get you this summer while athens can do nothing to help you even now the athenians debate in their assembly they debate sending miltiades and aristides away as exiles and making submission perhaps you should join them in exile just for a while i told myron everything empedocles told me and he dismissed it all with a wave of his hand im sure simon would like to kill you he said but thebes is in an awkward place right now and they do not need a war with athens empedocles makes a good point though i allowed once the persians are at sea and by all accounts they are athens can hardly send their hoplites over the passes into boeotia to help us the thebans would be fools to trade shortterm advantage for the punishment athens will dish out later myron said not if they can count on the medes to defeat athens i said look they have a workable strategy or so it appears to me and i see other hands in this myron if were tied up here why then there are no hoplites to march to the aid of athens i think you have delusions of grandeur young man myron said i agree its more of a threat than i saw when first i heard of it but this is not the way cities behave we are not children in the agora i will send a messenger to athens and another to thebes but that will be the end of it i thought he might be right i only knew pirates and easterners here in sober steady boeotia even the thebans were probably better men perhaps i should muster all our men just so that the thebans can see how ready we are i was hesitant to ask this as a general muster cost our city a little money and the foundations of the new towers were just going down but the seed was in the ground and most farmers had a holiday or as much holiday as a man can get between ploughing his fallow ground shoring his grapes and watching the pests eat his olives that is a fine idea myron said one week from today the theban heralds will be here by then i dont remember a thing about that week apart from the glow of the forge and the rush to finish as many bits of harness and armour as i could manage i had thirty repairs sitting around my house helmets breastplates spearheads i worked night and day and so did tiraeus and bion and across the stream in the city my compatriot heron the smith worked iron and steel as fast as i worked bronze but the muster was glorious i could remember what our men looked like when we went off to oinoe to help athens dun cloaks no swords men without shields hiding in the rear ranks and only a dozen men in full bronze now we had a front rank of almost one hundred and twentyfive men and every one of them had a bronze panoply breast and backplate or scale armour or at least a leather spolas and an aspis a few old men with boeotian shields greaves on every man and good helmets most crested corinthians i was pleased to look down my front rank and see how many of those helmets were my own manufacture almost twenty and behind them were ranks of men with good shields and good helmets even if most of them were dogcaps of bronze every man in the front rank had a good spear and a sword and most of the secondrankers and some of the third and fourthrankers as well the milesians were the best equipped with armour all the way back to the fifth rank my brotherinlaws men were the next best and they would get better all autumn as i hammered out their bronze my neighbours looked almost as good bion was armoured like ares as was hermogenes and tiraeus idomeneus and styges all of us in full panoply with thigh guards and arm guards too fifteen years of peace may rob a town of the fine cutting edge of war practice but it does give a town the riches to spend on armour i had asked every man to have his wife make him a red cloak i didnt expect them to be dyed tyrian red like the spartans although a few rich men did most were brick red from madder and striped in white or black as is our way in plataea but most men had done it even those who had no armour and with those cloaks and our new dogcaps of bronze in every rank we made a fine show in the agora and many women stopped to watch and older men clapped to see us myron wore his armour but he watched i intended to put him in the fourth rank dead centre in the phalanx because he was too important to risk even though he was a decent fighter and a brave man and owned good armour he stood at the edge swapped jokes with men and finally came up and slapped me on my scaled back very good arimnestos he pointed at the three theban heralds who stood silently off to the side watching as our men laughed joked and shone then i called out the epilektoi most of them eighteen or nineteen years old although not all by any means and while the phalanx sang the paean of apollo we danced our pyrrhiche it is one thing to dance for the war god when musicians play and men sing it is another to dance in the full light of day when a thousand men beat the time with their spearbutts and sing from inside their helmets and the song rebounds from the bronze and rises like a pure offering to the war god and the lord of the silver bow idomeneus and i had changed our dance many times by then it had been a simple dance that allowed men to learn their place in the ranks and not much more our new dance exchanged ranks taught spearthrusts and parries and had men duck to the ground leap in the air over a thrust even fight to the rear my young men danced with unbated weapons and more than once a sharp spear ripped a furrow across a newpainted shield but the rhythm went on and as we sang of the deepbreasted nymphs who served apollo we stomped with our left feet and pivoted together ducked clashed our spears and exchanged ranks again when the hymn was finished we stood silently for some heartbeats and then all the women and old men and boys raised a howl of joy to the heavens myron went over to the heralds and handed them a scroll tell your masters that we seek no quarrel with mighty thebes he said but if thebes seeks a quarrel with us he did nothing grand or dramatic merely flicked his glance down our ranks and over the new towers one halfbuilt and the other with its foundations complete he looked back at the heralds if thebes seeks some quarrel she may find us a tougher vine to hack away than ever she imagined my wife loved that i was polemarch and when i donned my armour for the muster she embraced me sharp scales and all she had come to terms with her husband the smith but her husband the polemarch was perhaps the figure she had expected in her maiden dreams she wove me a new cloak with her own hands a fine red one dyed scarlet with some rare dye from the east and with her own hands she dyed a new crest for my new helmet so that mere days after i finished the helmet the horsehair and the cloak appeared on my worktable in my forge that chlamys was as thick as a fleece and as warm as a mothers embrace it hangs just there and moths have troubled it but any woman among you can see how well woven it is the day i found it i put it on and wore it for her and then i carried her up to her room and we made love on it i wore it proudly when i mustered the phalanx before the theban heralds and i wore it whenever i wore my armour for many years after i came straight back to the farm after the muster with all the epilektoi at my heels i kissed euphoria patted her belly which now had the smallest sweetest swelling and gathered a pair of my shop boys to carry my gear then in full armour my picked men and i ran and walked by turns all the way up the mountain to the shrine of the hero there idomeneus and ajax said the words and we sacrificed a couple of big steers and ate like kings and then we lay in our cloaks like real soldiers and woke with the first light to run along the flank of cithaeron to eleutherai by noon on the second day i had them all tired and surly with the cockiness of the muster sweated out of them and by the fourth day of the hunt even the milesians were flagging and my veterans were watching them with a certain callous satisfaction i was tired too try wearing armour for five days it chafes on your ribs rubs your hips weighs on your shoulders your helmet becomes a ring of fire on your head and greaves greaves become your enemy not your ally but the only way to become accustomed to armour is to wear it there is no other way i made my picked men run in it cut firewood in it gather brush in it skin deer in it my name was taken in vain often curse me now i said when you fight the medes youll praise me the sixth day i let them rest the complaining increased this is the way with men slave or free soldier or priest real carping requires breath and time the seventh day was supposed to be the last and we had games or rather we were supposed to have games the sun was up in the sky and we had made the sacrifices and idomeneus was staring at the guts of a rabbit he had sacrificed he had the oddest look on his face ive never seen a liver like this he said i looked not that id know one liver from another and past him i saw two things to give me unease over towards eleutherai i could see a pair of men on horses riding the hill road flat out and down in the valley in the direction of my farm i saw a column of smoke rising in boeotia fires happen woods catch fire in the dry of summer and men start fires to open up new farmland or simply to get a better view men burn off their fields houses catch fire when lamps are left unattended so i had no need to panic except that the juxtaposition of the riders and the fire worried me it was a big fire and idomeneus was not happy with the animal he had just sacrificed bion came up next to me thats our place he said and my stomach flipped how can you be sure i asked im sure he said did you bank your forge fire by hephaestus i said of course i did you are always a feckless young man to people older than you hmm he said idomeneus killed a lamb slit it open and cursed i dont really know much about divination he said from the growing pool of blood at our feet he was kneeling in the dead lambs entrails but something is wrong dead wrong so i ordered the epilektoi to muster instead of preparing for the games they cursed at being so early into their armour but by then they were cursing anything i ordered even the young feel pain or so we old men joked our muscles had had years to harden and theirs were still soft about the time the first files were falling in another column of smoke leaped to the heavens thats our beacon fire tiraeus shouted it was true it was lit in the right place and it let out smoke in a thick column and then stopped and then started again i watched two repeats it was the will of the gods that we were already assembled and that we had armour and that we were so high up that we could read the signal clearly and see too the very moment it burned into life but fear reached icy fingers down my throat if it was simon then he had struck at my home and i was not there but euphoria was lovely pregnant euphoria i didnt scream i was a good soldier and a man who had seen a few fights but i drank a cup of wine to steady my nerves and told myself the truth that if she was dead raped or stolen i was forty stades distant and there was nothing i could do for her this is what it is to be a veteran honey bee you see too clearly i counted her dead or brutalized and went on with my business because war is serious and i was the commander and my rage was not yet to be unleashed so i finished my wine ate an apple and didnt fret while the last ranks fell in outside i didnt fret in my gut i lost a year of my life we had started down the road to eleutherai by the time the riders came up the hill they knew where to find us my thracian freedmen lord the lead rider said men came a hundred or more your mater says we are to tell you that the farm is closed to them and safe but they came from thebes and they will go home the same way on the old road where is my wife i asked the older of the two shrugged your mater ordered us he said i know no more while we spoke another beacon sent its smoke to the heavens mater is right i said theyre running back down the old road to thebes i turned to my boys ares has sent us a serious contest i shouted are you ready they shouted a roar that echoed off the rock walls of the mountain later men said that they heard it out on the farms and thought that cithaeron had come awake i put myself at the head of the first file lets run i said and we were off i sent out the two thracians as scouts they had horses and they were good riders in my head i did my best to estimate what might happen the thebans if they were thebans had a thirtystade head start on the other hand they must have marched all night they must have been tired my boys had had a day of rest most of my boys had never seen a spear thrust in earnest i had a long run down the mountain to think about it and my thoughts were dark i wanted to run home first i wanted to know i wanted to know why it was mater who had sent these men and not my wife but my farm was in the wrong direction now from eleutherai i would lead my men north and east the farm was due west we passed through eleutherai like a summer storm eleutherai is technically in attica i told the basileus to send word to athens but that help if it came at all would be ten days away i led my boys out of eleutherai down the mountain down the pass and along the rocky road to thebes as we entered our own territory we met lysius and a dozen of his neighbours all armed and teucer coming across the fields with some lightarmed men and as soon as they met with me and my mounted scouts they ran off ahead of us teucer caused me to writhe with frustration and fear hed seen the fire at my farm and the beacon but he hadnt gone up the hill to investigate he knew nothing lysius and his men fell in with us theyd met the thracians on the road and a dozen stades further on we met another party small farmers and milesian settlers under alcaeus so that i had almost two hundred men behind me as we ran across asopus at midmorning i gave them all a break swift as i had to be these men had run almost forty stades most of them in armour if we were going to fight we needed a rest the two thracians were brilliant covering the ground in front of us and raising the farmers and i wished i had cavalry like the lydians and the medes had but i didnt i rested the men an hour and then we were off again cutting across the fields of the eastern township to try and gain a few stades on the men we were pursuing it was noon when we found the first body a man in a dogcap with a pair of spear wounds in his body his name was milos and he was a farmer from along the asopus we moved his body off the road and ran on after a stade there were three dead men all together all asopusside farmers the men of the asopus district must have made a stand here bion said as he panted listen boy im finished i cant run another step ill stay and bury these men and send on anyone who can follow bion wasnt the only man who was finished i told off ten men so that there would be no shame and told them to guard the bodies the rest of us went on at a slow jog my thracians found the next bodies all strangers two of them had arrows in them teucers arrows and at the road junction where the old road to thebes and the new crossed there were a dozen more strangers some wounded and some dead and two of our men to tell us that our plataeans were harrying the column as it retreated and that there were more than a hundred enemies and perhaps two hundred we were close but i knew we were not going to catch them we were just ten stades from theban territory every man in the column knew it too but we said our prayers to ares and ran on my slaves had dropped out by then and i had my shield on my arm and my helmet on top of my head and most of me hurt as much as if i had already fought my legs burned and my left arm felt like a bar of iron sagging from my shoulder and even my shield strap was an unbearable burden if i felt like that what were my boys feeling like but we were close at the top of the next hill i was jogging so slowly that walking might have been faster but when i came over the hill i could see them a dozen armoured stragglers in a dense shield wall trying to avoid a steady rain of arrows we were close my heels grew wings and i ran on behind me my boys began to shout i looked back and men were stripping their greaves off and casting them aside to run faster some stopped and threw up others stripped off their breastplates and then they ran on the dozen stragglers broke when they saw us coming and the fleetest two made it but the rest died in a shower of arrows and javelins and then teucer was next to me and other men i knew about twenty all lightarmed men that teucer had rallied i wanted to embrace him but i didnt have time we ran down the last hill and i could see the dark mass of them crossing the stream that made the border between my city and thebes there were quite a few of them and most were already in theban territory i knew immediately what i had to do what myron would say if he was here i ordered the boys to halt form up i shouted get in your ranks form up form at normal order the ground down to the stream was a single hayfield and on the far side another the same not for nothing do foreigners call boeotia the dance floor of ares flat ground perfect for war men and boys came down the road they were strung out over several stades and while my little phalanx formed the enemy scrambled up the banks of the stream to safety on theban territory in my heart i wanted to run down and kill them all myself if i had to there was more at stake though more even than my own revenge although the image of euphorias death rape torment horror came before me every time i paused or thought about anything but the task at hand my child she was carrying my child if this raid came from simon how he would enjoy slaying my unborn child the mind is a dark place friends i held the line in my head though i gathered my men formed them in ranks and then and only then did i take them down the hill the enemy now stood in neat ranks on the far side of the stream they werent even trying to make more ground they were good fighters i could see by how quiet they were how little shifting there was in their ranks of course they were tired and they had lost men and lost their bodies as well which humiliates any soldier when we were half a stade away they began to shout insults at us we halted i walked forward with teucer he already had his orders there he was simon son of simon he wore plain armour and a big crest and he came out of the ranks to meet me like a longlost brother look who it is he laughed the polemarch of plataea better stay on your own side of the river little cousin or big bad thebes will eat your pissant city the way a lion eats a foal nicely put i shouted at him you brand yourself a whoreson of thebes traitor i spat you are in fact your fathers son laugh while you can plataean he shouted back i left your wife dead in your dooryard and burned your fucking house and there is nothing you can do but cry like a boy and next time ill get you and all the men who stand between me and what is mine in that hour my fate dangled in the wind along with the battle we were about to fight and perhaps the fate of athens too with the words dead in your dooryard i think that most of my sense of reason left me not that i hadnt expected it after the sacrifices went foul and the riders appeared and the column of smoke i never promised you a happy story thugater simon taunted me again something about what hed done to her body and how ugly she was i started forward at him had i reached him he and his two hundred friends would have cut me down and then what might have happened teucer didnt flinch or ask permission he shot my cousin down right there in cold blood his arrow flew true and simon died with a look of complete disbelief on his hateful face and an arrow coming out of the top of his chest just above his breastplate and that changed everything suddenly the hired men knew that their paymaster was dead and i was alive my boys charged without a word from me we sang no paean and we were not in any proper formation but we went over that stream up the bank into trained men i remember none of it oh thats a lie i remember going up the bank almost losing my footing the jar of a spear on my aspis and another ringing off my beautiful new helmet and then i was into them killing after a while we pushed them off the stream bank and then they must have known that theyd had it i remember teucer at my back shooting men in the face or foot when they troubled me apollo guided his hand and he was like death they were hired men and their employer was already dead after a while they broke i suppose i killed my share of them but there were far more alive than down when they broke it is always the way men only die when they turn their backs to run our lightarmed men were not tired most of them hadnt got engaged except perhaps to lob a few javelins on the unshielded flank my rage communicated itself to them and they followed the hired men anyone can kill a man who turns his back i followed on wings of rage and revenge so that when i surfaced from my flood tide of blood i was far down the road to thebes i had no spear just a sword my shield was cast aside beside me was idomeneus and at my back was teucer and around us were thirty freedmen and slaves all busy stripping the corpses we were ten stades into theban territory my body would scarcely obey me i couldnt have raised my sword arm to defend my poor euphoria i looked down the road to thebes and it was empty idomeneus laughed aloud we fucking killed them all he said ive heard since that over two dozen survived so we didnt in fact kill them all but close enough i dont remember much after that except that i made my way back to the stream and men tried to talk to me and i ignored them i stripped my armour and left it on the ground with my helmet and my weapons and i ran naked back up the road i was exhausted but i ran anyway i remember nothing except that i made the run all the way perhaps i walked perhaps i lay down and slept but i doubt it the column of smoke from the burning barn rose over all of plataea mingling high up with the smoke of three signal fires i ran across fields ripping my legs on briar and my feet on the small hard spiky nuts that litter our fields at high summer not that i noticed i ran until i could not see until my breath came like fire into a bellows and sweat flew from me i had run thirty stades in armour fought a battle and now i was running another thirty stades my right arm was all blood to the elbow sticky and brown and there were wounds on my thighs and ankles and a deep cut on my left bicep no idea how it came there and still i ran did i think that i could save her if i ran far enough perhaps i wanted to burst my heart i remember seeing that i had run all the way to the fork at the foot of the hill and what i remember best was the strange temptation i had to keep going over the stream and up to the heros tomb and perhaps away over the mountain to attica and over the sea to aegypt to keep going and never go home and never know perhaps i lost my wits but i turned my feet lengthened my stride and ran up the dusty lane sharp gravel under my hard feet halfway up the hill the road turns just a little and you can see straight to the gate in the wall that surrounds my house the house itself was burning although it was stone and mortar and solidly built theyd fired the floorboards and the roof beams and the stone was cracking and falling and the whole thing had become a chimney carrying my riches to the skies in an intended sacrifice i didnt give it more than a glance my great wooden gate for which my father had forged the straps and hinges and cut the oak was broken and twisted on the ground was a heavy beam from one of the sheds tiraeuss shed as it later proved theyd used it to break the gate around the gateway women lamented they keened high wails like the cries of bloodyhanded furies tearing to the heavens demanding revenge well they had their revenge but as usual it brought no child born of woman back to life i pushed through them the gateway was packed with corpses some of them black with fire my farm had not fallen lightly and my people had not died alone bion lay across the threshold his spear broken in his hand his body ripped asunder cleon lay by him throat ripped and with ten great wounds in his body and a broken axe clutched in his hands they lay across the woman they had died defending and even she had a sword in her hand and the edge of the blade was bloody she had not gone down easily she had not been raped she was dead before such thoughts could occur to any man however evil she was not pregnant and as i stood there i realized that her hair was not blonde it was not euphoria it was mater mater had died in the gateway sword in hand my mind couldnt accept it couldnt take in the loss of the three of them in one blow in truth all my being had been aimed at euphoria and i had forgotten how many people i loved were in this farm mater i lifted bion off her legs and laid him down with dignity although his intestines trailed behind him as i dragged him across the yard i lifted cleon too and now i was weeping because he had died like a great man and there were dead enemies at his feet and mater how i had hated her for so many years yet here she was sword in hand like any hero you might name ares she died well and sober i rolled her corpse over and she had that smile on her face that smile she wore when she saw that i could say the verses of theognis or when i brought euphoria under the roof or when she met miltiades that she wore that look with a spear in her guts made her seem very great to me but when i went to lift her two other hands reached beneath her shoulders bloody hands but smaller euphorias hair was wild her chiton was unpinned at one shoulder so that one breast showed on the right and there was blood on her feet she took maters shoulders and lifted and we laid her down with the other heroes who fell defending the dooryard she locked me in the basement euphoria said she wasnt crying she said it was my duty to live tiraeus and styges had held the door to the forge the hired warriors had given up after they lost two men then went and fired the house and ran off so styges had let my wife out of the basement before the house collapsed into it and more mater had saved so much wall hangings gold and silver all thrown into the forge building bion and cleon held the gate while she did it and then she joined them and they all died together or thats how styges told it who had stood in the door of the forge and held it euphoria held me crooning she was strong and i was suddenly unmanned it was everything bions death cleons maters and euphoria being alive and fatigue i suppose styges asked me if we had fought i must have told them something because the women stopped screaming for vengeance and then euphoria brought me wine neat and i drank a cup and passed out like a drunkard when i came to it was night and i could scarcely move my thighs hurt so much that i had trouble rolling over i was lying on gravel in my forge yard and i had a blanket of my wifes weaving over me and she was snuggled to my side her head against my shoulder i thought you were dead i said she shook her head and her arm embraced me a good long squeeze in the morning my legs still ached as if i was an old man my shoulders and arms werent much better and one of the cuts on my thigh was deeper than i had thought and wept pus the bastards had raped any female slave they caught and killed three of my male slaves so my yard had the mourning of defeat along with the dreadful fear of my slave girls that they were pregnant i went to the stream and washed myself with a prayer to the stream itself for the filth i was putting in her and then i went back up the hill carrying water and euphoria began to wash the women clean which is the only kindness you can do for a raped woman i got styges and tiraeus who both had small wounds to bind mine and then i helped with theirs and then we began to take stock we hadnt lost an animal the byres were up the hill and the bastards never made it past the yard theyd burned the one barn they reached which was full of barley and hay it was a loss but it only held the ready stores for the house and the animals the house was gone though a house that my greatgrandfather built of stone and mortar the best house in all of south plataea the home of the corvaxae great and small simon burned it destroying the work of his own family and he killed his own stepmother in the courtyard may the furies rip his liver for ever may every shade in hades treat him with the contempt of a matricide and a traitor i was standing in the yard looking at the wreck of the house rubble and not much more when men came through the gate teucer and hermogenes idomeneus and alcaeus and all the men of the epilektoi i walked over to hermogenes and put my arms around him bion died in the yard i said i took him by the hand to where his father was laid out the women had already bathed his body with the water i brought them and anointed him with oil and put coins on his eyes hermogenes fell to his knees wept and poured sand over his head other smaller steadings had also been hit on the way back to thebes the hired men had lost their discipline if they ever had any and theyd killed and raped whatever they could catch so i was not alone in my mourning but teucer took me aside are you blind with rage he asked i shook my head euphoria is alive and the unborn baby i said i have my wits about me today teucer led me outside the old house wall this man was with them he said i took him alive he is my slave now fair enough a hired man was nobodys not a citizen anywhere capture meant enslavement i had played by those rules i knew the game i wont kill him i said the man met my eye for a moment as i approached him then he looked at the ground you fought for my cousin simon i asked simon the man spat cleitus paid us simon came along for the ride the incompetent fuck you think he should have held his tongue friends but why he was our slave and he knew what he had to do if he wanted to live we needed no threats nor would i have done any differently had i stood in his shoes i nodded i looked at teucer ask him why they came teucer prompted okay im game why did you come i asked we were fucking paid to kill you mate the man shrugged nothing personal teucer kicked him so hard he fell to the ground lord arimnestos is called lord the man got himself upright we were paid to kill you lord he managed could have just told me can i buy him from you i asked teucer you will kill him teucer said i shrugged perhaps buy me a good working man then this one will be a lazy fuck teucer put the mans rope in my hand all yours now ask him what signalled them to start i looked at the captive he was squatting in the dust but his eyes still had the glint of pride or resentment or just stubbornness i liked him a little for that he was beaten but not defeated he nodded we was told to wait until we saw fires at chalcis he said runner came in yesterday morning teucer nodded see he asked i did see if there was smoke rising over chalcis why then the persians must be in euboea if the persians were in euboea then the attack on attica was close two or three weeks away at most if the persians were about to attack attica then athens would be paralysed and it was safe for simon to attack plataea secrets inside secrets like the boxes which nest inside other boxes smaller and smaller until theres a tiny nut or a silver bell in the centre of seven or eight of them someone had plotted this very carefully as i had suspected want to be free i said you bet he said hmm well see that corpse is my mother that one is a man who saved my life fighting thats my best friends father those women my slaves i looked at him and he grew pale i he sputtered do as youre told i said i know youre a hoplite somewhere you are probably a gentleman i looked around right now youre a slave and if you fuck up someone will kill you now truth now did you rape he shook his head no he said and as i said it was obvious he had been a gentleman i believed him good then go and start helping i sent styges and one of my forge boys running for myron and i asked him to order the muster of the whole phalanx on my sayso myron arrived on a mule without ordering the muster why he asked as soon as he had his leg over the beasts back you slaughtered thebans on their own ground were in for it now i shook my head bold front archon i dont think that we did wrong ask any man here whose wife is lying with her throat slit thats my mother over there he spat fucking thebans very well what do you suggest polemarch i had the advantage that all the epilektoi were together so that my officers that is my real officers were there to advise me wed had two hours to plan and wed hammered it out while we waited for myron and cleared the rubble of the house a hundred men even a hundred tired men can accomplish a great deal in a short time my burned barn was now a dark smudge on the ground and my ruined house was a pile of fireblackened stone out beyond the house wall the burned beams had been stacked and three pyres of scrap wood from all the surrounding farms built on the hilltop all that in a few hours by now i was much calmer id had time to breathe and no one let me do any work nor did idomeneus do any as he was a lord now and a priest alcaeus was the same so the three of us watched other men lift stones while we debated the campaign and when myron asked we were ready how are the towers i asked the west tower is done and the east will be complete tomorrow or the next day if the wind continues to blow dry he shrugged theyll be done before thebes can march that confirmed what wed hoped then this is our plan i said first we free all the slaves who built the towers zeus soter the archon said thats the whole years profits gone i nodded not just for you lord but listen we lost ten men yesterday well lose ten times that in the next month and that is if we win we need those men as citizens yes he shook his head perhaps later i disagreed we need them now because we want to put them in the armour of the dead hired men install lysius as their officer and leave them with another fifty picked men to guard the walls in fact we dont want them to sit within the walls we want them to march down to the ford and camp with lightarmed men prowling around if you dare i looked around id send teucer tonight to burn some barns in thebes myron shook his head you are talking about kicking a hornets nest he said idomeneus raised a long plucked eyebrow ever faced down a bull in a meadow archon he asked myron nodded slowly i have too you think that as long as we look tough theyll back down alcaeus laughed not really lord the truth is they have twelve thousand hoplites and we do not but a show of aggression especially after the tanning we gave those hired men might slow them up for a week or two he shrugged lysius can always pull inside the walls later when he sees the dust cloud coming myron gave a grim smile all this planning suggests that you wont be here with the phalanx thats right i said according to our prisoners euboea was burning yesterday chalcis is being served up to the persians by the time we march euboea will have fallen alcaeus nodded and datis has the heart of the sailing season at his back he said hell move straight on to athens and athens will fall without my phalanx myron asked softly i laughed a thousand hoplites i made a face athens can find twelve thousand and perhaps fifteen they dont need the weight of our spears secretly i suspected that they did need the weight of our spears but athens has factions myron factions the like of which you cant imagine if we appear to honour our agreements and without being asked we will strengthen miltiades hand enormously he looked at me and i looked at him archon i said please if athens falls or medizes plataea is doomed thebes will eat us the way a gull eats a snail our only hope of preservation is to act aggressively for athens myron looked out from our hilltop men were still carrying brush for the pyres to burn the bodies and below other men my neighbours were breaking up the biggest chunks of rubble with iron tools when i was a much younger man he said after a while i stood in your forge yard with your father and a few other men and we agreed to make an alliance with athens to preserve our city from the yoke of thebes he turned and met my eye i think the decision for today was made that day i was wrong to slow the muster i will see to it and you will take my citizens over the mountain and do what you can he stood straight as if ten years had fallen from his shoulders may zeus and ares and greyeyed athena stand by you for if you lose the phalanx even in victory why then our city will fall when he went back to his mule alcaeus looked at me plataea is lucky to have so many great men in so small a city would that miletus had done as well we may yet fail i said he shrugged of course but not for the lack of trying lets go and kill some medes idomeneus said and he grinned we burned mater bion and cleon on the hilltop that afternoon with wine and sacrifices and a priestess of hera from the temple and when they were ash and the fires were great smoking columns not unlike the pillars of smoke that the raiders had left behind the priestess came to me and proposed that i pay for a statue of mater in the temple she was a great woman the priestess said she was a matron with iron at her temples and a vast reserve of dignity young women need examples of how to live and die i all but spat at her she was drunk every day of her wedded life i said the priestess stepped back speak no ill of the dead she commanded is that the way you will speak of her or as the hero who fell defending your home i gave her the money theres a new statue that bears no resemblance to her the persians broke the one a local man made smashing it to gravel with hammers but in plataea the new temple honours mater as an avatar of hera take from that what you will while i mourned the phalanx mustered a thousand men may not sound like many but every man needs a slave and a donkey or a mule to carry his kit to cook for him and keep him in fighting trim and a thousand mules with two thousand men is a long column to lead over mountain tracks it takes time for men to put their houses in order and time to gather enough food for thirty days and time for the slave to kiss his own wife time to make sure you have your secondbest cloak as well as your war cloak time to make sure that someone packed you some garlic sausage and some fresh onions from the garden my packing was done my mule was still picketed high above eleutherai and my friends had rescued my kit from where i left it by asopus my good persian shirt of scale was on lysiuss back and my old helmet with the raven crest was on his head to puzzle the thebans and he did it no dishonour euphoria fussed about finding me oil with lavender in it and retrieving as if by a miracle my fathers heavy walking stick from the collapsed cellar of the house charred a little but still strong as iron and when she had seen me cared for she took me by the hand and led me to our spring up by the vineyard and then she bathed with me in the deep hole by the spring there were men all about us on the hill but none came near and the olive grove hid us theres no modesty when you bathe in an open sink of rock and pregnancy or none we made love and then we washed again and she put on the robe mater had saved a beautiful thing of redpurple with gold embroidery and i helped her put up her hair in a net of linen in the dooryard where mater had fallen she poured the libations on my shield and wiped it with a new linen towel and then she did the same to my sword and my spear and finally defying convention to my helmet i longed to crush her to me but i did not we were greeks not barbarians our women send us to war with dry eyes and we left as if going to the fields and not to face death there was still smoke rising to the heavens from the funeral pyres when we marched as we climbed the hills towards cithaeron we were joined by the main body from the agora of the city itself in the distance as we climbed we could see smoke rising over theban territory and there were wolfish smiles as we went the epilektoi marched first up the same road theyd marched just ten days before on their way to the latesummer hunt they werent boys any more when they had torn into the hired men they took losses ten killed outright another dozen dying of wounds in a community as small as ours the loss of twenty young men was a knife wound in the gut everyone was the friend the lover the wife the sister or brother of one of the dead but they had killed and won and that changed them most of all when we walked up the trails to the tomb of the hero every man in my front rank knew that he was worthy of the blood of his fathers he knew that he had been proven in fire and like bronze hardened by the working i could make you an argument that the hired men did us a favour by attacking us but id be full of shit there is no good war we stopped at the shrine as plataeans have since the trojan war and we poured libations some men shouted for me to sacrifice my new slave on the tomb his name was gelon and he was a greek from sicily he heard them call for his blood and he stood there with my shield on his shoulder watching me i looked at idomeneus it was his choice really he shook his head no he said we have shed enough blood and the hero craves no more he sacrificed a ram wed brought for the purpose looked at its entrails and shook his head this isnt going to be good he said i spat i didnt need entrails to tell me that i said we slept in our cloaks and in the morning after teucer and the lightarmed men rejoined from their raid into thebes we marched away over the mountains it was hot on the plains of boeotia and cold in the passes above cithaeron but when we came down off the passes the sweltering seaheat nearly choked us and the humidity was such that a man could sweat through his chiton before he had it over his head i intended to keep to the high roads as long as possible i didnt want to give away my march this sounds odd in light of what transpired but i was very conscious of the passage of days and it seemed all too possible to me that we would arrive to find athens surrendered or beaten in which case i needed to get away unmolested by the persian cavalry i was very aware as myron wanted me to be that i held the future of plataea under my hand so we were wary and stayed to the north of attica as the shadows lengthened and the summer ended we turned east as we came down the main pass and marched for two days across uncultivated land skirting oinoe men saw us but they did not come forward to speak to us and i had a handful of my lightarmed mounted on horses to keep me informed of the terrain and we made good time a week into our march and we were in attica proper an attica bereft of citizen men doors were locked against us and there were only slaves and women and few enough of them too it was as if a dread disease had swept the land and killed them there was even wheat left in some fields one night when we camped my men reaped a whole field with their swords and left three silver coins on the doorstep of the empty house in payment and we baked bread the next night after grinding it in an empty grist mill and baking it in ovens we found cold a days march from athens and we could see the acropolis as clear as day on the horizon it was not on fire and i assumed that if athens had surrendered or made peace all these folk would have come flooding back down the roads to their farms so i left my brotherinlaw in charge took my new slave and rode hard for athens as the sun rose the gates were still open the streets were packed with people all the farmers from the farms id just marched past i expect most of them didnt pay me a glance as i rode by because the only men who would have been interested in me were in the agora voting any man still on the streets was a slave a freedman or a foreigner if i had thought that the agora was full for phrynichuss play i was shocked to see how packed it was that latesummer day i had to dismount and leave my horse with gelon then i shouldered my way forward im not a small man but neither am i a giant and no one wanted to make way for me it took me an hour five speeches to make my way from the tholos to the centre of the agora where the speakers stood for most of that time i could see miltiades he stood virtually alone the men who stood by him were unknown to me except aristides and sophanes both of whom stood so proudly that they looked like men fighting in a desperate last stand when i was close enough i could hear a man argue from the bema the speakers platform that there was no need for athens to march to the aid of eretria that euboea was an ancient enemy of athens true enough friends and the great king was welcome to lay them low and more such stuff in that hour as i bulled my away across the agora and felt every wound on my body i heard every cringing excuse to avoid war every noble sentiment against it speeches of cowardice and speeches of sublime nobility when i was almost close enough to touch miltiades a man ascended the bema who looked like one of themistocles men he stood with his head bowed for a moment and then he raised it what more can we do he asked miltiades asks that we form the phalanx and march to defend the coast even to save chalcis but i ask why must we fight alone we have walls and sparta is not coming thebes has made their own peace we are alone men of athens are we the protectors of greece sparta craves that title let them act the part he got quite a cheer too while men were cheering it is easy to cheer for other men to do the hard work while you sit home i find miltiades raised his head he was plainly dressed for him in a dark chlamys over a plain white chiton with one stripe the gold pin at his shoulder was his only concession to rank he raised his head and his eyes met mine and lit up the way my eyes lit when they crossed with euphorias he waited until he could clasp my hand and then he pulled me sharply so that he towed me as one ship will tow another after a storm he didnt bother to mount the bema he simply raised my hand the way a judge in games raises the hand of a victor you lie he roared plataea is here chaos men shouted one thing and then another i saw my fatherinlaw in the crowd and i saw aristides and i saw cleitus i had thought him an exile until then our eyes met and the hate flowed like wine i was still locked in that when the archon basileus pushed to my side do you have an army he asked a thousand hoplites i said which is every man we have he embraced me he an aristocrat who had no love for me or mine but he embraced me and then he pointed to the bema you have my permission to speak he said so although i was a foreigner i mounted the speakers platform the crowd was not quiet but i didnt care i raised my hand i have brought the full muster of plataea i shouted and left thebes afraid plataea stands with athens and by the time i came down from the platform they were already voting aristides and miltiades as strategoi and sending the phalanx out to fight as every schoolboy knows the assembly voted ten strategoi aristides and miltiades were but two of them and cleitus of the alcmaeonids a third and even when they began to muster the phalanx half of the generals were still dead set against war or at least offensive war the very next thing they did was to vote for a runner to be sent to sparta to beg for help thats how it sounded to me anyway and why not the spartans for all my sneers were the best soldiers in greece perhaps in the world i stood with miltiades as he hurried men to get their kit many men of the phalanx were already prepared had been so for days men of the other party were unprepared or at least most were so assured were they that the phalanx would not march the polemarch of athens was callimachus of aphidna he was an older man with a fine reputation both as a warrior and as a politician i have heard men say that he hesitated that he only marched when miltiades threatened to take his men and sail away miltiades after all had his own army from the chersonese almost a thousand hoplites with more military experience than the rest of athens put together not so let us be fair he was hesitant extremely hesitant to march remember this was before the persian fleet had even been sighted the persians were just a rumour of terror up the coast although on a clear day you could see the fires in euboea rising to the heavens he was hesitant for a reason i tasted this hesitancy myself it is one thing to march in the phalanx it is another to go in the front rank and yet another to be a killer of men a hero a man who can change a battle but all of them the killer the frontranker the rearranker have more in common than any of them share with the polemarch and the strategos on their shoulders rests the burden fight or dont fight march or dont march choose correctly and your name will live for ever for ever choose badly or get cursed by the gods and your city is lost your friends killed your elders butchered your women raped and sold as slaves understand if you arent hesitant about fighting then you are a fucking idiot and those men who voted against the fight they had to go and stand shoulder to shoulder with the men who voted for the fight and each had to depend on the other the city was divided about evenly id say half for glory half for caution callimachus was right to hesitate i watched the chaotic preparations the same mess as our plataean preparations but magnified ten times and shook my head why such a hurry i asked tomorrow morning will be as good as this evening and surely you wont march before dark miltiades pursed his lips if you hadnt come just when you did godsent i would not have carried this debate he said slaves came up with his kit and his hypaspist a thracian id seen with him before shouldered his shield and flashed me a blond smile miltiades smiled himself when he saw his panoply if i can get them clear of the city before night falls he said i have a chance if were here in the morning well never march he shrugged i could be wrong but i dont think so i have a feel for these things aristides came surrounded by men i knew sophanes of course but also agios and phrynichus and a dozen oarsmen i recognized all dressed as hoplites their kit was as good as our frontrankers athens has money and money buys armour i suggested that we free a thousand slaves and put them in the ranks aristides said and these fools declined saying that it would be too hard to choose what tribes they would go to he shook his head some of them even wanted to decline the service of the armed metics i stood there while the sun sank and i had nothing to do but think after a few minutes or even an hour i turned to aristides plataea will take your freedmen i said put them in my rear ranks then your proud citizens have nothing to complain about he gave me a thinlipped smile tomorrow aristides said today we march out of the city miltiades is right today or never the shadows were long enough to make a short man tall when miltiades took his tribe out of the gate it was a purely symbolic march miltiades was to athens as i was to little plataea and his men were ready many carried their own gear poor men who knew no other trade but fighting and they had been assembled and ready since the last vote aristides marched next with the men of the antiochis by the time miltiades men cleared the sacred gate aristides men were ready to march even though his tribe by illchance contained many of those most determinedly against the war the other strategoi were less ready but aristides had set the example by marching despite having a third of his taxis missing and so the other taxeis of the tribes marched away as soon as their turns came i stood and waited after all i had a horse and what i saw heartened me men continued to come to the square behind the sacred gate kiss their wives pour a quick libation and run down the road with a slave or a servant and a donkey hurrying after them so that there was a constant flow of stragglers and sluggards behind the march of the army the strategoi had left almost half the army behind it could have been a disaster but the men of athens even those against the war did their duty when i mounted my horse darkness was falling have we won do you think gelon asked me i laughed to hear him say we we havent won i said we havent lost weve marched and if miltiades is to be believed that means were still in the game you could free me now gelon said no one around to kill me i nodded i could but i wont you fight in the phalanx and fight well if you live ill free you free me first he said im fucked if im going to fight as a slave no one will want me anyway who ever heard of a slave hoplite that was true i tell you what gelon if the athenians free their slaves ill put you in with them as a slave he asked daring as a free man you whoreson now get your arse moving down the road gelon made me laugh in a dark way i was coming to like him he bore slavery with a kind of amused contempt that made it impossible for me to punish him while he showed his resistance every minute i respected that i also thought that another man idomeneus for instance would have beaten him to a pulp the sun was setting and although we didnt know it yet chalcis had just been stormed one of the richest cities in greece an ancient rival of athens at sea and on land the city that colonized sicily and southern italy and even the coast of asia had fallen by treachery to the great king datis ordered the warriors massacred and the women and children sold into slavery just as he had at miletus and lesbos his tame greeks turned away from the slaughter but the sakai and the medes and the persians butchered the men and the elderly and set fire to the city every house and every temple the column of smoke rose to the heavens like a sacrificial fire and could be seen from the acropolis as datis intended datis sent his cavalry across the bridge to sow terror the way a farmer sows barley the women were loaded into his troop ships weeping at their state women who had been wives who had known love who had sat at their looms proud of their family names and the ships crewed by phoenicians and ionian greeks got their sterns in the water unfolded the mighty wings of their oars and turned their ramprows south with a gentle wind at their backs and a protected sea it was too late for poseidon to intervene the great kings fleet was at sea the oars pulled to the lamentations of five thousand new slaves their rams were pointed at attica and even as we marched out of athens and made our first camp in the hills north of the city even as men groused or had second thoughts datiss scouts were riding through the long grass by the beach at marathon last night while we were drinking the young scribe from halicarnassus asked me why athens didnt meet datis at sea its a damn good question given the size of athenss fleet today the truth is in the time of marathon there was no athenian fleet i realize that this sounds impossible but the fact is that the tyrants and the oligarchs shared a healthy fear of the demos and the fleet gives the demos power because the power of the fleet is its rowers not its hoplites the thetes who pulled the oars so noblemen owned warships tartarus friends i owned a warship at the time of marathon aristides owned one sophanes family owned one and miltiades owned ten at the height of his power that was the athenian fleet the accumulation of the ships of the rich not unlike the way they formed a phalanx come to think of it and all the ships athens could muster might have made fifty hulls before lade fifty hulls had been accounted a mighty fleet but the world was changed by the great kings decision to spend greece into defeat his six hundred triremes give or take a hundred won him lade though it strained his empire to maintain them and they emptied the ocean of trained rowers but athens had nothing to offer against his six hundred our hulls were all on the beach at piraeus all those that werent ferrying refugees across to salamis or around the coast to the peloponnese the first night we camped in the precinct of a temple of heracles perched high on the ridge above athenas city my plataeans were still forty stades away to the north and i saw no reason to bring them along yet as we had no word of the enemy and the athenian camp was in enough disorder as it was greek armies are usually only as good as the time and distance they are from home the first night with the army close enough to home to sleep there if they wanted with none of the discipline or shared experience that an army builds with every camp and every smoky meal they are just a mob of men with little in common except their duty to the city many of them have no notion how to live rough or how to eat without their wives and slaves to cook the aristocrats have no problems the aristocrats life as a gentleman farmer and hunter is perfectly suited to training campaigners but the potters and the tanners and the small farmers all strong men may never have eaten a meal under the wheel of the heavens in their lives gelon and i bedded down with miltiades men who had none of these problems and little but contempt for their fellow athenians these were the men hed led at lade and a dozen other fights and they were confident in themselves and in their lord aristides men were a different matter let me just say that since cleisthenes reforms fairly recent when we marched to marathon all of the tribes of athens were artificial constructs cleisthenes had sought to break up the power bases of the great aristocrats like miltiades by ensuring that every tribe was composed in equal parts of men of the city the potters and tanners lets say men of the farms upcountry men small farmers and aristocrats too and men of the sea fishermen coastal men and oarsmen it was a brilliant law it gave every athenian a shared identity with men from the parts of attica that most individuals had never visited another thing that he did another brilliant thing was to heroize everyones ancestors in athens the principal difference between an aristocrat and a commoner was not money freedmen and merchants often had lots of money and no one thought of them as aristocrats believe me no the biggest difference was ancestors an aristocrat was a man descended from a god or from a hero miltiades was descended from ajax of salamis and through him back to zeus aristides was descended like me from heracles my friend agios was descended from parents who were citizens but they had no memory of anything before their own parents cleons father was a fisherman but his mother had been a whore but when cleisthenes passed his reforms this happened while i was a slave in ephesus he gave every tribe a heroic ancestor and declared by law that everyone in the tribe could count that ancestor in their descent ive heard men never athenians but other greeks say that cleisthenes brought democracy to athens crap cleisthenes was a far far more brilliant man than that i never met him but like most middleclass men i revere his memory as the man who built the athens we loved what he did was to make every man an aristocrat in one stroke of law every oarsman and every whores son had as much reason to serve his city as aristides and miltiades and cleitus to live well with arete and to die with honour im not saying that it worked any better than any other political idea but to me it is a glorious idea and it made the athens that stood against the great king the main consequence was that the precinct of heracles was filled with men who would never ever have been in a phalanx fifteen years before when my father died serving alongside athens in euboea their phalanx had about six thousand men and while the front ranks were superb the rear ranks were poor men with spears no shields no armour and no hope of standing for even a heartbeat against a real warrior that was the way but the new athens had a phalanx with twice as many spears almost twelve thousand and from what i could see almost all of them had the white leather spolades for which athens was famous the city owned the tanning trade back then and their white leather was prized from naucratis to the troad they all seemed to have helmets too see what cleisthenes did was to create a city where a man who made pots and worked a plot of land just big enough to yield two hundred medimnoi of grain about a tenth of what my farm yielded in a good year would spend his surplus cash a very small amount friends on armour and weapons like an aristocrat thugater you are laughing at me am i too passionate listen honey i may be tyrant here but in my heart im a boeotian farmer i dont want the aristocrats to rule i want every man to stand up for himself take his place in the line farm his plot eat his own figs and his own cheese raise his hand in the assembly and curse when he wants when im honest i realize that i joined the ranks of the aristos pretty early it may be that as my mother said our family was always with them but i never wanted power over other men except in war now youre all laughing at me i think i should keep my story for another day perhaps ill go and sulk in my tent perhaps ill take blushing girl here for company hah more wine that was worth the interruption look at that colour now where was i in the morning i mounted my horse and gelon got on my mule and we rode away north to find my brotherinlaw and the plataeans the athenians turned east after they passed the great ridge and headed for the sea i reached my men before noon and found that they were fed well slept and ready to march antigonus shrugged i enjoyed being polemarch he said go back to the athenians ill take it from here he grinned and slapped my back but when we had the army moving he came up beside me in the dust dont ever do that to me again he said quietly when you didnt come back last night all i could see was panic and horror the persians had you the fucking athenians had arrested you what was i to do just as you did i said and slapped him on the back in turn i had brought a pair of guides from miltiades both local men from the athenian phalanx who knew all the trails and small roads that led east from our position so we made good time although the way was never straight and at one point we actually crossed some poor farmers wheat field two thousand men and as many animals crushing his precious crop but it was the only way to join two paths attica had some of the worst roads in the world then i rode ahead with gelon and lykon and philip the thracian both serving as volunteers as their cities had no part in this war and we found a camp three hayfields all fallow or recently cut with stone walls all around on a low ridge with a stream at the bottom its one of the best positions ive ever found and i went back to it on another occasion we slept secure i had sentries every night already a lesson learned from my first campaigns we rose with dawn all that hunting on cithaeron had good effect ate hard bread and drank a little wine then moved before noon we were up with the tail of the athenian force which was moving down through the olive groves that crowned the ridges around aleituss farm and tower i knew the trails here again from hunting and my guides were off their own ground so i took us a little north over the same ridge where aleituss party had killed two deer and down through the old orchards where mine had killed six aristides was first that day the tribes have a strict rotation in everything from order of march to place in the battle line and he was the strategos in charge because the athenians rotated the command he was choosing his camp when i rode up with my little party he smiled when he saw me i didnt smile any pleasure was wiped from my heart when i saw that he was with cleitus aristides raised a hand stop he said i had my hunting spear in my fist we are here to fight the medes not each other aristides said look i said you found a horse i snorted i thought i heard that something had happened to them cleitus had his sword in his hand hows your mother he asked aristides hit him hard in the temple with his fist aristides was a good athlete and a fine boxer and cleitus fell from his horse but when i rode over to him aristides caught my spear hand in a grip of iron in this army he said there are other men who hate each other political foes personal enemies men with lawsuits we have tribes with rivalries and men with conflicting interests in money men who have absconded with wives and daughters men who committed crimes and worst of all as both of you know we have men who have taken money from the great king and who will use their power to break us the way they broke the east greeks at lade through defection and treachery cleitus got to his feet and put a hand to his head you have a heavy hand sir aristides nodded we are in the precinct of heracles ancestor to all three of us you will both come with me to the altar and swear to the gods to keep the peace and fight together like brothers you are leaders if you fight each other we are finished he killed my mother i said and his actions served the great king hes taking the great kings money he planned to kill me to keep the plataeans out of this cleitus looked at me with the kind of contempt i hadnt seen in a mans eyes since i was a slave you live in a world of delusion peasant i would never do anything to serve the great king i am an athenian i will crush you like the insect that you are for hubris for treating my family as if we were at your level killed your mother he laughed it should have been you and it is no care of mine if some raddled boeotian whore got in the way he turned to aristides i swore to kill him and all his family he has insulted me and mine aristides crossed his arms cleitus most men in this army think your family are traitors cleitus whirled around in angry denunciation but aristides cut him off with a raised hand if you refuse to swear my oath cleitus i will send you from the army and i will cease defending you to the demos more quietly he said this is not the agora nor the palaestra he insulted your family you insulted his by all the gods we are talking about the existence of our city are you a playground bully or a man of honour i had lowered my spearpoint aristides always had that effect on me his moral advantage was almost as great as heraclituss he lived the words he spoke but i was still angry aristides i said i honour you more than most men but he killed my friends and fellow townsmen and my mother he killed them for vanity his socalled revenge he brought it on himself by trying to treat me the way he treats the demos as lesser men you killed his horses fifty horses the value of ten farms you killed them aristides stood in front of me imperturbable you killed them to humiliate the alcmaeonids not to save miltiades but for your sense of your own honour deny it if you can he murdered my people cleitus said family retainers thugs i said aristides this is foolishness you of all men know why i did what i did i do aristides said you did what you did to achieve what you perceived as justice as did cleitus he killed my mother i yelled my family is in exile cleitus said my uncle died he died far from our city thanks to you the dogs of this city bay for our blood and the little men tradesmen men whose grandfathers were slaves treat us with contempt for that i would kill you and every man and every woman with a drop of your blood in his veins so both of you can wallow in selfishness pride selfdeceit and athens can be burned by the medes aristides raised an eyebrow come with me both of you such was his authority that we followed him he led us over the brow of the hill on which the precinct of the shrine of heracles stood suddenly in the blaze of the latesummer son we were looking down the hill to the plain the fields and olive groves of one of atticas richest areas all the way to the beach at marathon and from the curve of the beach as far north as the eye could see were ships hundreds of ships ships as thick on the sea as ants around an anthill when the plough rips it asunder many of them were already sternin to the beach over by the marsh at the north end of the bay they were unloading men and tents or so i guessed closer to us in the open ground at the foot of the hill there were a dozen sakai cavalrymen they were looking up the hill at us they had gold on their arms in their hats on their saddles and every one of them had a heavy bow at his waist and a pair of long spears in his fist there they are the persians the medes the sakai the armoured fist of the great king here to chastise athens for her sins now choose stand here in the sight of the enemy and fight each other to the death and on your heads be the future that you squander or both of you can swear my oath fight side by side show the army every man of whom knows your story and your hate believe me that war with persia is bigger than family bigger than revenge and when the persians are gone you may kill each other for all i care silence and the wind sighing over the golden wheat fields down by the sea i nodded i will swear i said what else could i say aristides was the just man what he asked was just nor was cleitus for all that i still burn with hate for him less a man than i i will swear he said because you are right i will go farther because i am a better man than this boeotian pig i paid men to fight against you plataean but i am sorry that your mother died for that alone you have my apology i might have muttered an apology for the death of his uncle even if i did his was the nobler gesture but then his was the greater crime this is so often the way with men the gesture is the thing that we remember the grand apology the noble death did my mothers noble death wipe clean a lifetime of woe did cleons is a great apology the equal of a great crime i dont know and heraclitus was no longer alive to tell me we stood on either side of the lowsaddled altar of heracles clasped arms like comrades and swore to stand together against the persians to support each other and be brothers and comrades we followed aristides word for word until he finished until the persians are defeated cleitus added until the persians are defeated i repeated meeting his eyes you are both idiots aristides said id like to say that a spirit of cooperation swept the army after i swore not to kill cleitus but im not sure anyone noticed this is the problem with acts of moral courage and ethical purity had i struck him down with my hunting spear im sure there might have been consequences but having stayed my hand there was no observable change heraclitus and aristides both told me that the only reward for a correct action is the knowledge of having acted well fair enough but i suspect that you have to be aristides or heraclitus to feel that such knowledge is enough reward for the sacrifice of something so deeply satisfying as revenge at any rate we made camp in the precinct of heracles from the summit we could see the persians unloading their ships i brought the plataeans to the north of the athenians the left end of our line of camp and the spot closest to the enemy we took the rocky end of the temple precinct almost like a small acropolis it wasnt much ground but it would be easy to defend and it had a big stand of cypress trees in the centre good shade as i considered it i saw a man turn aside to relieve himself in the woods and i caught him no man relieves himself inside the camp i said even with the hunting theyd never been on campaign most of my men had no idea how fast disease can stalk a camp so as soon as wed stopped i gathered the warriors in a great circle and stood on a pile of shields so that they could all hear me all men will sleep here on the rock i said the cypress trees will give us shade and some shelter but no man is to cut one or build a fire under them for fear of offence to the god nor is any man to relieve himself inside the precinct i will mark a boundary for such things below nor will any man use the stream to wash himself his animal or his clothes except where i mark it so that the stream herself will not feel defiled and so no mans shit will float down into our cook pots i said and they laughed and my point was made the plataean strategoi chose their ground and then we went down the ancient ramp behind the high ground and chose a low bog for men to use and had slaves dig trenches across it and lay logs and we chose a place for the slaves to draw water and wash clothes water is going to be a problem antigonus said i dont understand why we have to have all these rules epistocles said he shook his head if i have to go in the night do you really think im going to walk all this way yes i said well you can guess again he said with a foolish little laugh epistocles you are an officer and men will take their lead from you if men start pissing in our camp it will soon become unliveable this is the most defensible terrain for ten stades dont piss on it i grinned at him but only in the way i grin when im prepared to use my fists to make a man see sense and he backed away you seem to think you can give orders like a king he said this is war i said some men it makes kings and others it makes slaves whats that he said never mind i said and we went off to find space for two thousand men to sleep we spent two days making camp and watching the persians make theirs they had to land all those men and some of us wondered why we didnt just rush them when they had about a third of their men ashore it was discussed but we did nothing in fact there was something aweinspiring about the size of the persian force and their fleet they also had almost a thousand cavalry deadly horsearchers persians and sakai who had been further north filtering down from eretria in pursuit of the last force in the field there an army of athenian settlers and euboeans who had retreated in good order from the initial defeats but gradually died under the arrows of the sakai we had had no idea that they still existed until a runner came in on the third morning a man with an arrow in his bicep who collapsed as soon as he entered the armys agora when athens had defeated euboea in my fathers time they had determined to hold the place thereafter and they sent four thousand settlers lowerclass athenians to become colonists and to hold the best farms there was no love lost between the settlers and the locals but when the persians came they made a good force they fought three small actions with the persians trying to break out and finally they got fishing boats and shuttled across the straits right under the noses of the enemy but then the cavalry fell on them those men had been fighting and running for two weeks it was miltiades day to command and he summoned us all as soon as he heard what the messenger had to say one days march north there are two thousand men good men and theyre dying under the arrows of the sakai he looked around i propose we take our archers and our picked men and go and relieve them callimachus shook his head you cannot split the army he said and you cannot defeat their cavalry thats why we camped here remember firebreather so that their arrows could not easily reach us miltiades shook his head with picked men if we move fast and take archers of our own we can beat them or at least scatter them the way dogs can drive lions off their prey aristides nodded we have to try to leave those men to their deaths no one would ever speak well of us again miltiades looked around well i have a hundred plataeans who can run the whole distance i said and twenty archers to run with them miltiades smiled but before he could speak the polemarch shook his head if we must do this then every man should go in the dark we can feel our way with guides and be across the ridge before the medes know weve gone well catch their cavalry napping he looked around the weight of the responsibility heavy on him i think he would rather that the euboeans had died at home but he was right miltiades wanted a heroic raid but if we were all together and we moved fast wed accomplish the mission with much less risk everyone chose callimachuss method over miltiades we rose in the dark hours before the morning star would rise and we slipped away behind our temple precinct hill leaving three thousand chosen men to hold the camp behind us by the time the sun was up our leading men my plataeans were less than ten stades from the hilltop where our euboeanathenians were making their stand i wanted to run down the road with my epilektoi but i knew that the only way to do this was with massed bodies of impenetrable spears i hadnt fought cavalry since the fight on the plains by ephesus but what i had learned there seemed pertinent stay together and wait for the horsemen to flinch by midmorning we were spotting sakai scouts and teucer brought one down with a wellaimed arrow the next time we saw a party of them form teucer had a dozen of his lightarmed men together and they lofted arrows with a little breeze behind them the sakai rode out from under their little arrow shower but their countershots fell well short and after that it was like a deadly game of rovers our archers could outrange theirs and that meant that they couldnt come in on us and twice teucers little band took one of the sakai off his horse or left the horse dead and they gave us room the athenians had a city archer corps all dressed like scythians they were mostly poor men but very proud and they shot well enough there were two hundred of them and they were all together just behind my plataeans so that the one time an enterprising mede worked around my flank in some hedgerows he emerged into a veritable hail of arrows and ran off leaving two of his men in the wheat casualties like that ones and twos dont seem important when i tell a story as big as marathon but in skirmishes in harassment a dozen dead men can be as important as a lost battle our arrows were hitting them and they werent reaching us so just before noon their captain whoever he was decided that enough was enough and sent his best men to stop me i wish i could say that i saw what was coming but it was more luck than anything that we werent caught naked as usual i have to digress hoplites heavy warriors dont wander the countryside all dressed up for war it is hot in greece and the aspis is heavy as is your thorax and your helmet and your spear once a man has the aspis on his shoulder and a spear in his hand his speed is cut on the march perhaps it is just that greeks are lazy i have in fact spent all day marching with an aspis on my shoulder but in the old days we seldom did it instead we carried our weapons and our servants sometimes free hypaspists sometimes slaves carried our helmets and shields after the cavalry tried to work around our rear i halted the column and ordered the plataeans to arm that actually increased my vulnerability for a while imagine two thousand men on the road just two or three abreast in no particular order then imagine that every second man is busy finding his shieldbearer and getting his aspis on his arm his helmet on his head some men had their bodyarmour on and others did not some men had additional pieces of armour thigh armour and arm guards such as i wore all of these were carried by servants in my case i wore my scale cuirass all day but the rest of my gear was in a wicker basket on gelons back i even considered changing my shoes i had spartan shoes on my feet and i considered given the difficult fields on either side of the road changing to boots some men were sitting in the road changing sandals others were stripping naked to change into a heavier chiton to wear under armour got the picture chaos i hate to think how long we were on that road without a single spear pointing at the enemy i aged it is different at sea at sea you do not engage until you are ready but on land especially facing cavalry or light troops they can hit you whenever they desire it i was the leader and i had fucked up i could feel it and now too late i was trying to retrieve my error it was a lesson if you like as soon as i had a party of men armed i filled the road with them regardless of their place in the phalanx and as soon as the bulk of my men were armed i started them filing off the road to the left where i could see the shields of our euboean refugees flashing among the rocks on the hillside our guide the wounded runner pointed and gestured and my eyes were on him when the persian cavalry came for us we had about a third of our men formed when they galloped around the corner of the field from behind a grove of olives they already had arrows on their bows their leader was out in front on a big bay horse and as he came around the corner he gave a whoop leaned over and shot that arrow went into my shield and the head emerged on my side a fingers width just over my wrist where my hand entered the antilabe form close i called and i was scared shocked silly i had just enough nerve to tip my helmet from the back of my head over my face every man pressed into the centre of the front rank as the shields overlapped where had they come from i cursed my failing in not forming up earlier and i wondered how the rest of my column was doing and i nearly shat myself in fear these were not lydians with spears these were noble persians well led with discipline and murderous bowfire and my men were unprepared the first hail of arrows hit our shields a man screamed as an arrow went into his knee above the greave his scream might have been my scream they came past us close enough for us to see the markings on their horses and the embroidery on their barbarian trousers and to feel the earth moved by four hundred hooves the next storm of arrows broke over us like a big wave on a beach i felt my shield lifted moved rocked as if hail was falling on me and something screamed of my helmet and i blinked away the pain my vision was limited to the eye slit in my corinthian and sweat was pouring down my body but i saw it now the persian commander had sprung an ambush from behind the olive grove and i was lucky that id paused to form my men or wed already be dead luck tyche and he had made two mistakes he sprang his trap a little early before my left flank was out in the field away from the rocky wall that his horses didnt want to cross and he went for us the formed men when he could have fallen like a smiths hammer on my unformed men on the road instead we were trapped against the field edge with a rubble pile from an old barn on one flank and the road full of slaves and athenians on the other but wed stood our ground it sounds easy enough you try it even as his first arrows rattled against us and men fell he learned his third error although i was as surprised as i imagine he was we had archers in our ranks as the persians swept past us teucer and his archers rose from within our ranks or knelt under the rims of our shields and shot indeed teucer was leaning his weight against my hips as he shot arrow after arrow he had no horse between his thighs no reins to manage and his quiver hung comfortably under his left arm where i carry my sword in battle and he drew and shot and drew and shot three arrows for every one by the persians and his had apollos hand behind them when an arrow hits a man in the phalanx he screams and falls and his armour makes a mournful clatter as he goes down but his mates close over him alive or dead it is but one step to the front to fill the hole when a horseman takes an arrow better yet when a horse takes an arrow it can be a disaster for a dozen other men one horse can fall over another and a few casualties by illluck or the will of the war god can stop a charge dead or cause the animals to flow around their target the way small boys divert a stream on a summers day we had fewer than three hundred men formed but all of teucers archers were in our ranks perhaps thirty men and some javelins and they shot at least one persian for every one of us who fell i suspect that man for man the persians were the finer archers but the best archer on a horse shooting at armoured men behind big shields is going to lose the contest to the poorer man with his feet firm on the ground shooting at the enormous target of a man on a horse and teucer was the best archer ive ever known he was safe under my shield rim and his arrows did not miss he made chaos of their files and they broke and rode away and their redbearded officer lay redder now with one of teucers blackfletched arrows in his throat we spearmen played no role except to stand and not run and to be a living wall of wood and bronze for teucers archers we didnt bloody our spears that day the archers won that engagement for us and gained status with us as a consequence the persian commander watched his best cavalry break around us leaving a dozen of his noblemen face down in the hayfields and he gathered the rest of his cavalry and rode away no doubt reckoning like a professional that the terrain was against him and he had no reason to take a risk he was wrong theres more to battle than counting the odds and chances and watching the ranges of the enemy weapons the athenians and plataeans were greeks men of the phalanx where fights are decided not by spearfighting but by the will of the mass to every plataean and to every athenian coming late to the fight it appeared that we were the better men and the persians were afraid not true of course but on such foolishness is victory made we watched their dust cloud go and a few fools shouted that we should follow them but the persians wanted us out in the open and we were happy in among the olive groves and low ridges where they couldnt easily ride around our flanks we let them go in half an hour miltiades passed through my position i chose to stay formed and watch the persians lest they fall on the rest of the column or at least that was my decision on the spot miltiades went up the hill and fetched out the euboeans ill be honest i was shaken to my mind teucer and his archers had just saved me from a string of foolish errors command is different it is not the same as serving in the front rank i had been thinking of the wrong things at the wrong time and i knew how close my whole force every plataean had come to dying at the hands of a hundred persians the rescued euboeans were in poor shape they had no archers few greeks did in those days except oldfashioned cities like plataea and we wouldnt have had half as many without the milesians and the persian cavalry had been able to get close every day whenever they wanted a few of the euboeans had the spirit to abuse the corpses of the dead persians as they came down one man told me that this was the closest hed come to hitting one since the first day but the rest simply stumbled off the steep rocks of their hill and begged us for water in the croaking of frogs for they were parched and weary and had given up hope then we all turned on our heels and marched back to our camp and the persian cavalry rode away i lost three men dead all young epilektoi in the front rank lykon took an arrow in the greave it held but he couldnt walk for a day from the pain my wounded were mostly gashes to the head and neck sometimes arrows went deep in the phalanx and got in among the men with no helmets skidding from head to head two men with arrows in their thighs had to be carried and that was hot miserable work as soon as our scouts said that the persian cavalry was gone most men peeled off their armour and gave it to slaves to carry but i wouldnt allow my epilektoi out of theirs i was deeply shaken by the speed with which the persian cavalry had appeared from behind the olive grove no one grumbled this time but it was a long walk back to camp looking over our shoulders all the way and blessing every hill every stream every rocky field that covered us greece is treacherous ground for horses praise the gods the rescue of the euboeans may have been full of arete and it may have pleased the gods but it cost us in several ways and it had disastrous consequences first the euboeans were spent of almost two thousand men who came down off that hill fewer than two hundred stayed with the army the rest simply went home this is another part of being greek that needs explaining even the athenianeuboeans felt that they had done their duty and more they had faced weeks of danger and survived and they went to athens or returned to their farms without anyones permission and no one suggested otherwise the actual euboeans about a hundred of them remained mostly because their city was gone and their wives were enslaved and they had no further reason to live they were a silent lot second the euboeans saw the persians as invincible it is no fault of their own but when men have been harried and driven for weeks beaten and beaten again they magnify the danger and the power of the foe to increase their own sense of worth i am an old man of war and i have seen it many times when they sat in our camp and told their story to crowds of athenians many of whom had been against this fight from the first they spread fear like a palpable thing they didnt mean to do it but they did the day after we rescued them our army was ready to fall apart third all the persian cavalry had been sent to dog the euboeans datis like any good commander had sent his best troops to prevent the euboeans from linking up with us now that wed gained them the persian cavalry mostly sakai to be honest were no longer distracted the morning after we rescued the euboeans i combed my hair on the summit of the precinct of heracles sitting on a rock when i had combed it out gelon braided it quickly two thick braids which he wrapped around the crown of my head as padding for my helmet he did it better than any of my other servants or hypaspist had done tighter and faster too i remember that we had just seen a raven off in the left of the sky a poor omen and we were wondering aloud why the gods bothered to send a bad omen down at the base of the hill a big group of athenians mostly poor men with no armour were cutting brush for bedding they were in a long field and at the far end was a stand of brush and ferns and twenty or so men were cutting the brush and gathering bags of fern they sang as they worked and i remember being content even happy as i listened to them the sakai fell on them like the eagle of zeus falling from the heavens on a rabbit they came on horses and they leaped the stone walls at either end of the field cutting the men off from the camp as easily as if they were children caught stealing apples in an orchard one brave man tried to run and three of them chased him down laughing they were so close that we could see them laugh the leader took a rope off his quiver whirled it around his head like a performer and tossed it neatly over the runner then he turned his horse and dragged the man screaming over the rough ground at my side teucer drew his bow it was a long shot even for my master archer but he drew the feathers all the way to his mouth and loosed and the arrow seemed to linger in the air for ever flying and falling the sakai man was riding parallel to our hill and he didnt see the arrow and it fell into him as if apollo guided it he tumbled from his horse and screamed i hoped the man caught in the rope would rise and run but he didnt move i think he was already dead the other sakai let up a thin cry and as one they turned and butchered the greeks they had caught they killed them all twenty men lost in a few heartbeats they ripped skin from their victims heads and their backs the way men skin a rabbit and they rode across our front flourishing their ghastly prizes and screaming their thin war cries then they rode away a day later our servants were afraid even to get water from the stream the meetings of the strategoi were demoralizing too we met every morning and every evening and some days more often if two strategoi began to talk and a third saw them together he would wander over and before you knew it all eleven would be there they seemed to love to talk and they would discuss the most trivial things as seriously as they discussed endlessly the strategic options of the campaign firewood worth an hour of discussion a general pool of sentries worth an hour of discussion a new type of sandal for fighting an hour by the fourth day i was ready to scream because what we needed to discuss was the war the persians the enemy but like the proverbial corpse at a symposium we never seemed to discuss the options fully i had come to the conclusion that the polemarch liked all the talk because each day of talk made him feel useful while postponing the moment of decision for yet another day it was on the fourth day that aristides exploded if the medes could be destroyed with talk we would certainly triumph he shouted it came from nowhere and his orators voice carried across the summit of the camp and all the strategoi fell silent gods half the camp fell silent the athenian polemarch glared at him it is not your turn to speak he said aristides the just man stood his ground this is all drivel he said if no one else will say it i will the persians are peeling our army apart there is dissension and fear our numbers are even they have a few more men perhaps we must attack them and defeat them before our men follow the euboeans home cleitus the unlikeliest ally agreed we must do something about their cavalry he said our men fear the horses like nothing else why dont we simply return to athens and show them the strength of our walls leontus asked he was the most brazen of the antiwar strategoi a handsome man who had the reputation of being a servant of the alcmaeonids i hear so much about how we should fight a battle are you fools he grinned datis has a few thousand men more than we have and a force of cavalry we can never hope to match if we pack and march away in the night hell burn some olive groves and go home he hasnt the time to lay siege to athens he looked around many of the strategoi agreed with him i had to admit that he had a point and i loathed him politically miltiades brought us here to save the euboeans he went on and look what we saved a few beaten men the assembly never meant for us to fight persia lets gather the army and have a vote ill wager gold against silver that they vote to go home and defend the walls and who can blame them but arrogant men often overreach ive done it a few times myself and i know he carried on when he ought to have been silent you think you have an army we have nothing there arent enough gentlemen to fight any one of their regiments and the rest of these men are chaff useless mouths the plataeans will vanish at the first onset bumpkins a political stunt by miltiades to make the rest of you credulous fools feel as if we have allies the best men of euboea didnt stop the medes for ten days and their own lower orders sold the town to the enemy leontus might have carried the hour if hed shut up before he offended every man standing there aristides gave me the slightest of smiles and nodded his head he was encouraging me to speak in fact he was egging me on are you bought and paid for i asked leontus whirled face red you lie i added i wasnt angry but i put on a good angry face i knew what politics required if i humiliated leontus immediately and publicly his suggestions would wither and die on the vine my men stood and faced the persian cavalry you lie when you say we will run but since the persians have bought you you are paid to say such things i walked over to him deadly arimnestos killer of men leontus was not in fact a coward this is insane he said i only say what how much gold have the medes paid you i roared he flinched he only flinched from my bellow but the men in the circle thought that he looked guilty and there was a murmur we are going to be massacred he shouted and left the meeting in a swirl of his cloak that helped morale i can tell you the next day the fifth day since the persians landed i sent my servants down to the stream in the morning to draw water with all of teucers men concealed in the rough ground at the foot of the hill but the sakai had not been the eyes and ears of the persian empire for nothing a dozen horsemen came up looked at the plataean servants in the stream and rode away they smelled a rat such is war at the other end of the line miltiades tried a similar stunt sending a forage party far out into the fields near the beach to gather hay and cut standing wheat and laying an ambush with his old soldiers but the mede cavalry looked it over and rode away in the centre emboldened by our success the city men of two tribes went down the hill with sickles to gather wheat most men had eaten all the food they had brought and fear of the persian cavalry was keeping supplies from reaching us the sakai fell on them in full view of the army killed or wounded fifty and dragged twenty of them off into slavery in an athenian tribe of a thousand men the loss of fifty was considerable at the next meeting miltiades finally spoke many men disliked him and feared his pretensions he made little secret of his intention to make himself tyrant generally he did best for the cause of the war by saying little but that evening he had had enough war is not a game for children he said bitterly he had their attention right enough demostocles your men went down the hill like fools we only did what you did demostocles shouted aristides shook his head you dont have a clue do you you dont understand because youve never made war he crossed his arms this is not a day of battle with aegina this is not a war of greeks with greeks the plataeans and miltiades men laid ambushes and had reinforcements ready we call this covering our foragers and the sakai and the medes and the persians they have made war too they saw little things a broken bush a line of footprints in tall grass and they knew that the men were covered and let them be but in the centre you took no precautions leontus is right demostocles said they are better men than us and we will all be killed i am not afraid of your plataean thug miltiades no one can accuse me of taking persian gold they are better at this skulking manner of war than we are i want to demand a vote right now to go back to the city aristides voice was calm and strong you are afraid and like a schoolboy caught in a lie you dont wish to admit that you made an error so better that we abandon the campaign and retreat to the city than face the medes eh or is it that youd rather abandon the campaign than admit that you need to ask the rest of us how to make war vote demostocles demanded and fuck you you pompous prig i was killing men with my spear when you were shitting green too bad i said if youd learned anything about war youd be a better strategos i held up my hand to silence him listen im not pissing on you when we went after the euboeans i almost lost my whole phalanx why because i had no idea how fast the cavalry could come at me our servants still had our shields ares it could have been a disaster i shrugged and ive been at war since i was seventeen fighting the persians is not like any other war we have to roll with the punches and learn from mistakes the way a good pankrationist does when he fights a bigger man eh it was always rewarding to say something sensible and have men like aristides give me that look the look that indicated that in the main they thought me a mindless brute demostocles looked stunned that id admitted to failing it took the wind out of his sails and left him speechless concession and apology can be like that we need a concerted foraging strategy i said every taxis cannot go on its own and i think we need to contest the plain with them even if it costs us we need to go down there and show them who owns those fields man to man if we let their cavalry ride where they please eventually they will beat us or thats how it seems to me the polemarch gave me a long look as if up until then hed thought me a fool perhaps he had i was after all arimnestos the killer of men not arimnestos the tactician miltiades came forward again i have a plan he said i think we need to attack their cavalry and put it out of the war many voices spoke up then and not all of them were strategoi the problem of the greeks is that we all like to talk and all the famous men came to the meetings of the strategoi whether they held rank or not themistocles was a strategos but sophanes was not and he attended anyway cimon miltiades eldest held no rank and he was always there and seemed to feel freer to speak than his father on and on so we had closer to a hundred men than eleven the many voices shouted miltiades down leontus began urging a vote on returning to athens of the hundred men standing there by the altar the vast majority were with leontus what i couldnt tell was how many of the strategoi were with leontus and demostocles but the voices calling for the vote were loudest callimachus stepped forward and blew the horn at his hip and the athenians grew quieter we will vote on the idea of returning to the city he said uproar we will vote in the morning he said this meeting is adjourned miltiades followed him as he walked away to his tent a dozen other men went to follow them and aristides and i tried to stop them by forcing them to face us and debate the whole issue we kept them there several minutes and miltiades was gone somewhere in there i caught aristides eye he gave a small shake of his head he thought wed had it so did i i went straight back to my camp and found my brotherinlaw and idomeneus and i took them off into our little stand of cypress trees if the army breaks up we need to plan our own retreat i said ares dick idomeneus said you must be joking lord or is it lade again i shook my head aristides thinks theyll vote to retreat to athens in the morning and there will be immediate desertions he paints a bleak picture lads i shrugged were a long way from home and if there is a traitor idomeneus shook his head were all right he said keep the archers safe head for the hills and walk the high ground all the way home could take a while but well live what do we eat drink i asked his strategy was the one i liked too but it was fraught with danger steal what we can hunt when we can idomeneus shook his head it will suck thats for sure lord but the boys will get it done antigonus looked at the speakers bema in the middle of the encampment if what you say is really true he said we should be gone in the morning then men will say we deserted i said antigonus shrugged will we care if these bastards run for athens the persians will eat them and someone in the city will sell it out just the way the euboeans were sold and the ionians and it wont be a thetes idomeneus added i heard that bastard at your little meeting lord chalcis was betrayed by an aristocrat i nodded i heard that too doesnt matter though antigonus whats your point he frowned and looked at the ground its not a very glorious thought he admitted but if athens is going down we dont need to give a shit about what they think of us our duty is to get our people home alive it made sense he was a good man my brotherinlaw if we cut and run before the athenians break up idomeneus said with his terrible callous practicality their cavalry will waste a day or two killing athenians and well never see them lord it could save many men then he reverted to form seems a horrible waste though he grinned waste i asked this should be the most glorious battle of our time idomeneus said if these fuckheads waste it ill go and fight for persia ill never forgive them get the boys ready to march without getting them ready to march tell them we might try a raid on their foragers tomorrow and theyll be a day in the field i was keeping my options open i went and walked through the camp the whole camp it was like the camps of the east greeks before lade worse in a way because at every fire men urged others to go home to cut and run i thought they were cowards and then i realized that in effect id just done the same why cant greeks get along why cant they maintain a common goal we lost lade when the samians sailed away and abandoned us for the greed of a few men i saw marathon going the same way and i wanted to weep it was almost dark when paramanos found me you move too fast he said miltiades wants you that was like the old days i knew what he would want hed want the plataeans to join with his men the professionals in covering the retreat of the army id already thought it through i was about to tell my own lord a man to whom i owed a great deal to sod off i wasnt losing any plataeans to save athens thats how bad things were that night miltiades had a tent few men did in those days greece is kind to soldiers and it seldom rains but miltiades had fought everywhere and he had a magnifcent tent another reason for men to hate him if they needed a reason of course i went in and a slave handed me a big cup of wine miltiades was wearing a simple dark chiton and had boots on i need you and twenty of your best men he said that caught me by surprise what for i asked were going to raid the persian camp he said its the only hope we have i convinced callimachus to put of the vote until tomorrow night he fears treason in the city just as much as i do hes not a fool hes just cautious miltiades drank some wine listen phidippides the herald just came in from the mountains the spartans havent marched yet itll be five days at least before we can expect them but they are coming aristides came in through the beaded door he was wearing plain leather armour they want us to die he said miltiades shrugged theyre pious men our lacedaemonian friends they have a festival he shrugged to be honest i doubt id hurry to save sparta from the medes either but when phidippides news is known the last heart will go out of the army five days is too long we have to strike im ready aristides said arimnestos hasnt heard the plan miltiades said he glanced at me will you do it do what i asked we need a demonstration in front of the persians by men who can fight or run in the dark he shrugged i can give you all the athenian archers to go with you i wouldnt sacrifice you he said as if reading my mind where will you be i asked but i was already smiling because by all the gods i saw the whole plan as neatly as if it was stitched into leather the horses told you he was smarter than he looked miltiades said if we pull this off the army will stay aristides said and if we fuck it up well be dead miltiades said he shrugged i cant take any more officers meetings ill drink to that i said i can get a hundred men then take a hundred miltiades said the more you take the more noise youll make what can you do though i remember making a face i remember laughing have you noted that while we sit here doing nothing the persians sit there doing nothing i said they both nodded i raised my cup and poured a libation ares zeuss least favoured child if they fear us at all and they must then they have to fear a night attack i grinned so lets feed them one ill go for their ships ever been out for a walk at night ever been out for a walk outside the city as joyously as we prepared to make our raid the truth was that none of us had ever been in a night attack theres a reason why men dont make night attacks on land at sea its different at sea theres always a little light and not much to bump into if you steer badly but on land i roused my epilektoi as soon as i got back but just preparing them to march took me too much time by the time id led them to the base of the hill and out into the fields the moon was high and we were late the athenian archers were supposed to meet us opposite their camp which turned out to be far too vague a direction on a dark night i looked for them for as long as my heart could take it miltiades was long gone heading up into the hills to get around the marsh and the persian camp and i needed to make noise to keep the enemy focused on me i was taking too long everything was taking too long i gave up on the athenian archers when i saw how far the moon had moved across the sky where the fuck are they i hissed at teucer when i got back to my own men the archer shrugged so we set off across the fields in the middle watch of the night an hour late for our plan and moving too fast we made a great deal of noise the hedgerows which seemed to run straight by day were like the maze of the minotaur by night id follow one for a distance and then realize that i had gone close to the sea rather than closer to the enemy and time was passing i could all but hear clothos shears trimming the wick of miltiades life when the pleiades were high in the sky i took my bearings like a sailor found the north star and realized that again i was leading the long file of my men away from our camp and towards the sea and not closer to the enemy encampment resolutely i put my right shoulder to the sound of the sea close now and searched the next wall for a gate i crossed the rest of the men stumbling behind me and making enough noise for an army which i guess was the idea and found myself walking across a hayfield in the full light of the moon towards the sea of course the beach curves radically in come places and id simply missed my mark again my heart was pounding my anxiety had reached a lethal intensity my helmet burned my head and i was sweating through my armour and we still werent within long bowshot of the enemy idomeneus came up beside me you thinking we should go on the beach he asked no i said because there was no cover at all on the beach wed be seen two stades away even at night of course even as i thought that i realized that being seen two stades away might be a fine thing actually yes i said were going along the beach idomeneus laughed good i was worried you were lost i chuckled i remember the falsity of my laugh how it caught in my throat when you are the fearless leader it is important to appear fearless and knowledgeable i thought of all the stupid things id seen other leaders do now i knew why they did it somehow command on land was not like command at sea too many choices perhaps maybe its just that your men can simply walk away if they lose trust in you down to the beach as soon as we reached the beach i could see the enemy camp the ships drawn up as thickly as fleas on a dog and the fires inland from the beach all the way past the marsh to the hills we seemed incredibly close although in reality we were five long stades from the ships but because of the curve of the beach we were looking at the ships across the water and they were close as soon as we were down the dune i hissed the order to form front by files we were strung out but the boys were fast and probably as eager to get formed up to feel the comfort of the next mans shield as i was to get them formed still no alarm so we moved forward sand filled my sandals and i had to remind myself that the beach was despite the labour easier on me and easier on the lads than tying to cross the farms of the marathon plain after two stades we seemed to be level with the first persian ships and still there was no alarm i tried to reassure myself that if miltiades were attacking id hear something from him the hills were visible as a loom of dark against the paler darkness of the sky to the north and west another stade and the ships were so close that it seemed we could swim to them we were just two stades less i think from the ships that were beached when a man on one of the anchored ships a greek called out asking who we were men i responded but in persian what he asked his voice echoing over the water men i called back again this time in greek and that satisfied him by such threads do empires hang now we were running stumbling more like through the dark i had a new notion that id put fire into some of their ships id done it before at lade and it had done the trick and there were plenty of fires near the ships less than a stade no alarm how the gods must have laughed we came to the first fires a line of blazes long since burned down to coals and my men broke ranks and began to slaughter the oarsmen at the fires without my orders the whole situation slipped away from me in those moments one second i had a column of trained warriors running through the dark and the next there were screams and all my men had gone or thats how it seemed to me to my mind killing the oarsmen was a complete waste of time but as a diversion it did well enough the problem was that there were about a hundred of us and almost sixty thousand oarsmen with the best will in the world my men couldnt make a dent in them and then they began to fight back it was chaos on the beach and tartarus too arrows falling from the sky as the medes who had camped just to the north shot into the confusion and the thousands of oarsmen unable to believe there were so few of us fell on each other phoenicians against cilicians greeks against aegyptians i pulled idomeneus out of the fighting and dragged him clear the way you pull a dog out of a fight order the rally i remember shouting at him he had a horn and i did not he looked at me with dull lustfilled eyes i was fighting he said reproachfully order the rally i said again he lifted the horn and sounded three long blasts all along the beach men heard it some understood and some were lost in the fog of combat i put my spear in the gut of a man with no shield i had to assume in the dark that anyone without a shield was one of theirs and ran back a few paces plataea on me i roared again and again men came to me in dribs and drabs some bringing their little swirl of combat with them some alone it took for ever everything takes for ever in the dark idomeneus sounded the horn again and again later and still i had fewer than half of my men my picked best armoured men i could not afford to leave them on the beach the trouble my fault was that i had not set a rally point or explained to them what i wanted after we hit the enemy i had to trust that they would know the signal from the hunting expeditions in the end most did but men died because i didnt know enough to plan the recall as part of the attack another lesson learned at bloody marathon every time we blew the rally we ran back down the beach a little farther from the ships by the time i had eighty men perhaps a few more we were a stade from the enemy we should have been clear we werent we had taken too long far too long and the sun was coming up in the east still only a line of greypink out over the ocean towards euboea but it was going to rise like the hand of doom we were just eighty men caught a long way from our camp i cursed and killed a man by then we were fighting medes real soldiers they werent swarming us but their braver souls started to come in close while others shot at us from a distance the light was still bad their bowstrings were damp and teucer and his lads were shooting back so we were relatively unscathed but i could see better with every passing minute and that meant that they could too i was in the centre of my own line nothing for it we needed a miracle ready to charge i called out there was that reassuring sound as every man closed a little to the centre and the shields tapped together perhaps youve heard it in drill it is a sound that always gives you heart that rattle it means your friends are still together still in good order still with enough heart to fight i took a deep breath we were fighting medes they couldnt understand me when i say charge i bellowed as loud as my throat and lungs could manage you go fifty paces forward turn and run as if the hound cerberus was at your heels hear me plataeans there was a cry something like a war cry something like a sigh charge i called and we went at them the medes were ready for it they broke as soon as they saw us come and only our boldest and fastest caught any of them i certainly didnt the mede i had my eye on vanished into the neardark of the bushes up the beach idomeneus bless him sounded a single blast as i hit my fortyseventh stride and we turned together like a figure in the pyrrhiche which it is and ran we were off down that beach like frightened boys chased by an angry parent and every man understood that we had to break contact now or die when the sun rose but persians have good soldiers too somewhere in the scrub was an officer who knew his business and within seconds of us running they were chasing us and arrows began to fall then it was every man for himself some of my boys cut inland across country a few ditched their shields most didnt when archers are shooting you the last thing you want to give up is your shield i stuck to the beach and most of the medes followed worse luck had they stayed a little longer run away from our false charge a little further we might have made a clean exit but we were not so lucky after a few minutes of running i looked back and they were gaining after all they had light body armour which most of them were not wearing anyway as theyd been awakened by our attack they had neither helmets nor greaves they were cautious but they were getting the measure of us an arrow hit the middle of the back of the yoke of my armour thanks to ares hand it turned on the two layers of bronze but the power knocked me flat as i rose another arrow hit the same place then another glanced off my shield heavy arrows and another rang on my helmet and i thought fuck this is it i got my feet under me and turned one of the medes fell to the beach his life leaking out between his fingers as he grabbed at the shaft embedded in his guts teucer was right at my shoulder shooting calmly one two and men fell turn a little left he said i did and two arrows hit the face of my shield and he shot back zip pause zip with every shot a mede fell another arrow into my shield but now the medes were scrambling for cover teucer dropped four right there coughing their lungs out in the sand run i said i gave him three steps while i stayed another arrow off the top of my helmet and then i turned and ran my breath was coming like a horses after a gallop i sucked in air the way a drunkard sucks wine and my legs burned as if i had run ten stades the wound archilogos had given me in the fall of miletus had a curious numbness to it against the pain of all my other muscles and sweat rolled down my forehead and into my eyes the light was growing i was running down a beach that was well enough lit for target practice and i was going more and more slowly ares it makes me want to spit sand to remember it fleeing like a coward and knowing knowing that in a few moments i would be dead anyway when it is your last when all is lost it doesnt matter whether you were a demonstration or a deception or a last stand friends no one worth a shit wants to die with his back to the foe so i turned an arrow meant for my back screamed off the face of my shield i meant to take one with me but i was out of everything the daimon had no more to give me and i the great fighter of the plataeans slumped down behind my shield i got smaller and smaller as the arrows thudded in but i could breathe and i did i panted like a dog and i couldnt think of anything and arrows fell on my shield like hail on a good crop twice arrowheads blew right through the face of my aspis oh children that hour was dark when i had my breath back i knew it was just a matter of how i chose to die i could make it last down under the rim of my aspis until they got a man into the brush to my left who could shoot me in the hip or the arse no laughing matter i could try to turn again but to hades with that my legs were gone it seemed to me that the best course was to attack them it would get the whole thing over with the quickest and if anyone watched me if there was a single bard left in greece to sing after this debacle at least men would say that arimnestos died with his face to the foe i took a dozen more breaths rationing them taking the air in deep then i allowed myself five more the margin of life and death five breaths arrows continued to slam into the face of my shield on the edge of the fifth i rose to my feet i sneaked a last glance down the beach behind me and my heart leaped with joy it was empty my men had got away in some situations nothing would be grimmer than to die alone but in this one it filled me with power being alone made me feel less a failure more a hero i leaned forward into the arrow storm summoned up power in my legs i didnt think i had and charged anyone asleep hah you flinched thugater you think perhaps i died there eh pour me a little more wine lad yes i charged as soon as i got my face over the rim of my aspis i could see that they were well bunched up about fifty strides away thats why so few arrows missed i can tell you i remembered running with eualcidas at the fight in the pass here like there my feet crunched on gravel i kept my shield up and the arrows fell on it like snow on a mountain and then they stopped there were screams screams of pain and screams of terror i lowered my aspis a fingers breadth and peered forward though the predawn murk the sweat the slits of my helmet the medes were falling a dozen of them were down and the rest were scattering when i reached them alive of course you daft woman not a man was alive and they looked like porcupines for the arrows in them i turned away from rosyfingered dawn and the pale sea there were men coming out of the bush a hundred men with bows the athenian archers had found me i laughed i mean what in hades can you do but laugh when you write this i suppose youll leave out all the little men the archers and peltastai and when i say little i mean small in the eyes of the great but they were good men as youll see the psiloi the stripped men who wear no armour this is the story of the little men and you can ignore what happened next if you wish but it had more effect on the battle than most of the heavily armed men and the gentry would ever want to admit the archers were elated theyd saved a famous hero and laid waste to the medes and i knew that as long as those men lived in their little houses and their shacks on the flank of the acropolis theyd tell and retell that story in their wine shops at the edge of the agora in the bread stalls several of them the boldest sprinted down the beach and tore a souvenir loose from the huddle of corpses the first man to pass me shot me a grin you alive boss he asked as he ran by i had fallen to one knee i gave him a smile got to my feet and wandered after him in the distance the medes began to rally did i mention that they were firstrate soldiers just lost half their numbers in an ambush and they were coming back i hate any man who says the medes and persians were cowards the medes on the sand were wearing gold and silver professional soldiers wearing their pay the athenian archers were poor men and my friend the first who passed me whooped when he reached the bodies but he was a publicspirited man and he held something aloft that flashed in the new sun and he shouted gold and the rest of the archers came pouring out of the scrub at the edge of the beach some men jumping down the bluffs and sand dunes they stripped those corpses like men who knew their way around a corpse i cast no aspersions but by the time i caught up with them there was nothing left but skin gristle and bone better look to your bows lads i said pointing down the beach i stepped forward and fielded an arrow that might have hit a man scooping it on the face of my shield and the muscles in my shield arm protested hard lad my arse an older man said but he grinned he had thick arms and heavy shoulders an oarsman i suspected youre that plataean then eh i am i said then i put some iron in my voice bows i shouted most men jump when i say jump the archers did whos the master archer then i asked after most of them had loosed a couple of arrows with no effect beyond driving the medes back up the beach the older man turned to me again with the other half of the boys they went for the centre of the camp we couldnt find you and i kept getting lost so i made for the beach he gave a lopsided grin im a sailor or was beaches make sense to me i had to laugh we need to get out of here i said thats sense too weve had our lick at the persians he looked around and weve got whatever they brought he called to the men by the bodies got all the bows all their quivers arrows to me he said all their kit is better than ours better bows by far i know i said give me a persian bow anytime he said flourishing his own these arent persians i said i pointed at the low felt hats and boots theyre medes a subject people of the persians similar but not the same they wear less armour sakai are different again bigger beards more leather and better bows aint you the sophist though the former sailor held out his arm leonestes of piraeus arrows began to drop all around us lets run i said we did after a few hundred strides they had to carry me i was mortified to say the least one young sprig took my aspis and another peeled off my helmet we left the beach when it began to angle away from our camp and we ran inland it was easier in daylight i could see the line of hills and mountains at the far edge of the plain and the rising ground that marked the shrine and sanctuary of heracles as soon as we left the beach we lost the medes i think theyd finally reached the end of their enthusiasm my plataeans must have put down twenty of them perhaps as many as fifty its never good when armoured men face unarmoured and then the ambush by the archers probably dropped at least another thirty fifty dead is more like a bad days battle than a couple of skirmishes before breakfast the medes retired to lick their wounds we carried on across the hayfields and wheat fields and fallow barley fields jumping stone walls and avoiding hedgerows we were about halfway to the sanctuary of heracles when i felt the ground moving i needed to stop my lungs were whitehot with pain other men must have felt the same as soon as my group stopped all of them did the feeling that the earth was trembling increased i looked around and saw the dust cavalry i panted into the brush to our right was a fallow field with low stone walls and patches of jasmine and other low bushes it was also full of rocks we piled in in no particular order get to the wall this one you stand there bows up that was me the orders flowed out of me as if i was channelling the power of ares leonestes joined me form a line get your arse to that wall boy bows up you heard the man get a shaft on the string you whoreson the cavalry was almost on us but as is so often the case on a real battlefield they hadnt seen us they had other prey the first volley will win or lose this i said my voice was calm i remember how all the fear of the night raid had been replaced by my usual steady confidence why because in the dark i had no idea what i was doing did i out here it was just a shipfight on land men on the flank of the galloping cavalry saw us of course but far too late to make any change of direction for the mass but if miltiades had raided the horses he hadnt had much effect i remember thinking to myself i glanced at leonestes because he was taking so long to give the order that i wondered if he was waiting for me to give it he winked turned his head to the enemy raised his bow loose he roared fast as you can boys the next shafts rose while the first flight were in the air rose and fell and a third volley came up far more ragged than the first two some of the athenian archers were little more than guttersnipes with bows while others had fine weapons and plenty of training probably archers from ships so among a hundred archers there were maybe twenty real killers another fifty halfway decent archers and thirty kids and makeweights same in the phalanx really the arrows fell on the cavalry and they evaporated i remember that when i was a child snow fell on the farm and then the weather changed and the sun came out hot as hot and the snow went straight to the heavens without melting the cavalry went like that a brief interval of thrashing horse terror all hooves and blood and some arrows coming back at me a man took one and died just an arms length from me and then they were gone out of our range and rallying that fast they slipped from their horses adjusted their quivers and came at us a couple of dozen began riding for our right flank the flank closest to the sea they did this so fast that i think they must have practised it for the first time i understood the fear the men of euboea had for the persians these were real persians high caps scale shirts beautiful enamelled bows i ran across the ground to the men wed just killed the horses were still screaming six our brilliant little improvised ambush had put down only six men i picked up two bows scooped the big persian quivers off their horses while arrows decorated the ground around me and ran back towards the thin line of athenians i got a fine bow wood so brown that it seemed purple or perhaps that was dye and horn on the inside face of the bow with sinew in between there was goldwork on the mans quiver and a line of gold at the nocks on the bow anyone who doesnt have a persian bow get back leonestes shouted way the fuck back boys a hundred paces the dismounted persians in front of us about fifty of them walked confidently forward even as i watched they stopped most of them planted arrows in the ground for easy shooting the cavalry reaching around our right flank was making heavy going of it theyd found the tangle of walls and hedgerows some of the younger athenians began to drop shafts on them as if it was sport its always easier to be a hero when the enemy cant shoot back i find the persians to our front werent in any hurry the cavalry gave up on our right flank a poor hasty decision and just the kind of thing that happens in war they got low on their horses necks and rode across our front and one of our archers with a persian bow emptied a saddle as they crossed us heading for our left flank closer to the hills and the camp in war people make mistakes just as they do in peace a few minutes ago these selfsame persians had been chasing someone across our right flank wed put a stop to that and in the to and fro of combat our persian adversaries had forgotten their original foes the cavalry rode hard to get around our left and then suddenly they were fleeing and they had empty saddles and there were men behind them throwing spears and other men with armour running at them this transformed our fight one moment the persians were exchanging slow careful shafts with our best archers and the next they were running to get their mounts before our friends on the left captured the lot it was close but the persians won the race and rode away they rode about a stade pulled up and were hit by an invisible hand that plucked a couple of them from their saddles and made all the horses scream slingers only a dozen of them as i later learned but that was the final straw for the persians and they raced for their camp thats the part of the fighting that i saw i stayed out there with the archers for an hour or more and men came past us little men as i say dozens of them with javelins and bows and slings and a few with nothing but a sack of rocks no one will ever fully explain that morning word went out that miltiades was in trouble i guess or themistocles asked them to go out and support the archers who knows it wasnt part of any master plan that much i know however it came about a couple of thousand greek freedmen and lightarmed men men too poor to have a panoply and fight in the phalanx but citizens too proud to abandon greece flooded the fields and hedgerows and stone walls i estimate that with the athenian archers added in they might have killed three hundred of the enemy nothing you might say nor was there any glory to it when you are naked and have no weapon but a bag of rocks you dont go walking out in the open no you crawl along hedgerows and share the stone walls with the foxes and the tortoises too but the persians and their allies simply didnt have a horde of lightarmed men to keep our lightarmed men at bay and they couldnt afford the steady casualties it would have taken to clear the field and our little men made those fields a nightmare as the morning wore on our lightarmed began to take losses if they were too bold in their little groups the enemy would cut them off and slaughter them all told i would bet that if the gods made a count then the barbarians actually killed more greeks than we killed barbarians that day but again as i keep saying war is not about numbers war is about feelings emotions fatigue joy terror i got up the hill to our camp and was thronged by men who had to clasp my hand or slap my back we lost you idomeneus was weeping oh lord i am ashamed i shook my head who would not be delighted by this display of loyalty teucer had it the worst i was right at your shoulder lord he said clearly unhappy and then i found that i was by another scaled shirt and it was idomeneus i had lost you in the dark all dirt comes out in a good wash i said how many did we lose idomeneus shook his head too many lord almost twenty and your brotherinlaw and ajax and epistocles and peneleos ares that hurt not epistocles his loss was plataeas gain but the rest pen would kill me for losing her husband and peneleos maybe theyll come in teucer said you did i lay down my spirits low it always happens after a fight but this was worse i hadnt done anything except get my men lost i had scarcely bloodied my spear but id lost twenty of my best irreplaceable men with heavy armour and fighting skills ajax was as good a spearman as i was or he had been i was lying in the shade feeling bad when miltiades came youre alive then he said praise the gods that made me smile because miltiades so seldom invoked the gods not in that voice im alive i said and unwounded but i lost a lot of men he still had his shield on his shoulder you can reach a point of exhaustion where you simply forget to strip kit off in fact i was lying in my scale corslet i clambered to my feet to embrace him he was looking beyond me back towards my camp i never got near their horses he said in disgust we waited for your diversion and when it came we struck whatever was nearest he gave me a grim smile i missed their horse lines in the dark and we were in among the sakai we killed a few i suppose i had never seen miltiades so down and aristides i asked i was suddenly struck with fear what if aristides was dead he made it to the horse lines miltiades said bitterly but accomplished nothing and lost twenty hoplites getting away he may have killed twenty of their horses but he lives miltiades nodded heavily he lives he shrugged it is chaos out in that field half the hoplites will have lost their shieldbearers before this debacle is over better if wed fought a field battle he stared at the ground how did it go so wrong i had my canteen and i poured him a cup of water and he dropped his shield and sat heavily he had a gash on his leg he wasnt wearing greaves i washed his leg myself and when gelon came up i sent him for an old chiton i could rip to shreds for wrapping i didnt want him to see that miltiades was weeping you can see from the hindsight of forty years that all was not lost but trust me thugater while miltiades sat on his aspis and wept i felt like joining him we had lost many good men and to our minds schooled in the war of the phalanx we had accomplished nothing we had not robbed the persians of their cavalry and we had not put heart into the phalanx with a bloodless victory but while miltiades wept the lightarmed started coming in from the fields and the barbarians did nothing to stop them indeed had i gone to the edge of the field id have seen something that five thousand other greeks saw a stupid act of bravado that changed everything one of the groups of psiloi had crawled quite close to the persian camp and found no one to fight so they grew bored before they could crawl back one boy leaped up on a stone wall in full view of both armies and bared his behind at the persians sitting on their horses by their camp he made lewd gestures and waved and fanned his buttocks the persian cavalry sat tight everyone saw this exchange everyone but miltiades and me of course and in those moments our lightarmed felt their power the barbarians felt their power every thrown rock made our boys bolder and every empty saddle made the persians more afraid before i limped back to camp with my aspis on my shoulder and my helmet on the back of my head we owned the fields of marathon from the mountains to the sea although i didnt know it yet and not because of our gentry and our hoplites it is funny is it not we went to rescue the euboeans and in succeeding we almost wrecked our army and then to retrieve that error we mounted the raid on the persian camp we all got lost in the dark and accomplished nothing but as a consequence of our intention the little men came to our rescue and flooded the plain with stones and arrows and the barbarians felt defeated best of all the elated little men came up the hill to the camp and bragged of their stonethrowing victories to their masters the hoplites shame is a powerful tonic with greeks so is competition and emulation and no gentleman wants to face the idea that his servant may be the better man eh that was the day of the little men before it dawned we were on the edge of defeat after it we had enough votes to stand our ground and that in many cases was the margin listen then this is the part you came for the battle of marathon but remember that we only stood our ground because the little men won it for us wine for all of them boys the first sign of change came while miltiades was drying his eyes and restoring his demeanour i had bound his leg and he was using a scrap of my old chiton to wash his face my brotherinlaw walked up as if his appearance were nothing extraordinary i wrapped him in an embrace that he still remembers id wager he looked sheepish we got lost he said that made me laugh and laughter helps too i think that was the turning point antigonus came in with seven of our missing men not a wound on them theyd gone to ground at the break of day but as our psiloi gradually drove the barbarians off the fields his little party got bolder and managed to move from field to field theyd even kept their shields ajax came in without his aspis and with a serious wound in his thigh carried by a trio of athenian freedmen who asked for payment stands to reason donit lord we gave up lootin to carry your frien eh i could barely understand the man but i gave him a silver owl and another to each of his friends and then i got miltiades to send his doctor the arrowhead was still lodged deep in ajaxs thigh the doctor brought a selection of what appeared to be arrowhead moulds long hollow shafts with a hollow for the head of an arrow at the end they split in half he used them with ruthless efficiency rammed the tool into the wound got the little mould around the arrowhead so that the barb of the arrow was neatly surrounded with smooth safe metal and pulled the shaft free there was a great deal of blood but ajax stopped screaming as soon as the shaft came clear and he managed a watery smile ares cock he grunted i think im fucked his eyes rolled and he panted shaking with the exhaustion that only the panic of pain can cause dont be a whiner the doctor quipped and shook his head dont try and run the stade for a few days he added and smiled then he poured raw honey a lot of it straight on the wound and wrapped it so tight i saw his arms bulge with the effort miltiades watched fascinated all forms of making and craft fascinated him by then more and more of the psiloi were coming up the hill and the camp had started to buzz i heard laughter and the unmistakable sound of a man bragging and then more laughter i looked at miltiades they dont sound beaten i said perhaps it was the rest and the wine but miltiades a man fifteen years older than me leaped to his feet he looked alive he went out from the stand of trees and the next i looked he was standing in the middle of a group of the athenian archers with themistocles and they were laughing leonestes saw me and beckoned and i went over just telling our tale leonestes said how we rescued you how you charged the persians medes barbarians all by yourself like a loon he grinned miltiades raised an eyebrow then he stepped up on the dry stone of the sanctuary wall and peered out over the plain towards the persian camp they arent stirring he said i can see a line of mounted men right close to their camp nothing else i think thats when the light dawned on all of us i think theyre scared i said theyre a long way from home antigonus added with a nod at their ships miltiades agreed its hard to put yourself in the enemys place isnt it he said themistocles fingered his beard have we won do you think he asked won miltiades asked dont be silly but weve pushed them off the ground and our supplies can reach us and maybe weve made them feel what we feel but won he looked at the cavalry far across the plain we wont win until we put a spear into every one of them themistocles these are persians themistocles was looking at their fleet we should never have let them land he said but thats for another day whats the plan now miltiades laughed he seemed ten years younger than he had a few minutes before first we win the vote he said then we fight by midafternoon the vote was a foregone conclusion the hoplites were shamed by their servants theres no other way to put it every gentleman needed to wet his spear and that was that there were more than three thousand men by my reckoning around the altar that evening as we gathered for the vote of the strategoi they shouted for the vote and they demanded that the army make a stand leontus tried his best first he demanded that i be excluded from the vote as i was a foreigner the polemarch allowed that i thought that miltiades would explode but then the massed hoplites and not a few of their servants started to chant fight fight fight miltiades relaxed but when it came to the vote the result was a shock five strategoi for fighting and five for marching back to athens the massed hoplites began to chant again fight fight fight someone threw a rock that hit leontus athenians can be bastards other men threw rotten figs and eggs too callimachus raised his arms and even the loudest hoplites fell silent dont be children he said in his powerful voice they didnt make him polemarch for nothing grown men spearfighters flinched at the admonition in his voice this is the life of athens we discuss here these are the men you appointed as strategoi act like citizens so they did and i was afraid that callimachus so calm and so in command was going to carry us right back to the city callimachus ordered the strategoi to vote again but the result was another tie war and politics make for strange alliances cleitus of the alcmaeonids voted with aristides the just and themistocles the democrat and miltiades the wouldbe tyrant the fifth vote for battle was sosigenes a wellknown orator the dissenters were just as disparate and the split belied any notion that men had been bought by barbarian gold despite all the muttering after the battle men were voting from actual conviction and that is when politics grows most heated and most dangerous i happened to be next to callimachus after the second vote by zeus lord of judges he said i should never have allowed that smoothtongued bastard to exclude you plataean no i said id have fixed this he gave me a hard smile and then miltiades came across the circle of strategoi and stepped up on his aspis of course he said the polemarch is also a strategos he must have the deciding vote miltiades comment brought new silence callimachus muttered one word i heard him say it he said bastard quite clearly callimachus looked around the circle and the silence of the army was thick enough to make cloth should i ask for another vote he asked the strategoi all of them shook their heads miltiades opened his mouth to speak but callimachus glared him into silence callimachus had a pebble in his hand he tossed it back and forth for as long as it takes a man to eat a slice of bread we do not just stand here for athens he said looking around and men in the front rows repeated what he said he spoke slowly like the orator he was nor do we stand only for athens and plataea he added with a nod to me what we say here what we do here win or lose is for all the hellenes if we return to athens and submit earth and water to the great king he looked around again the silence after his words were repeated was absolute he tossed the pebble at miltiades feet fight he said the hoplites erupted in cheers like men watching a race at a games the cheers were audible everywhere even in the barbarian camp immediately after the vote the dissenters gathered around miltiades and leontus took his hand well be there in the line he said we want to win not the way we wanted it said another euphones of oinoe but well stand our ground then the dissenters walked off i think they were wrong but by the gods they did their part on the day and thats how a vote is supposed to work thats what made athens great not just the men who voted for the fight but those who voted against and fought anyway then all the men who had backed him gathered around and you would think theyd just voted a new festival they were beaming with happiness and hundreds of men came from the surrounding dark to pump their hands and clap their backs so aristides said when the mass of wellwishers had gone to their rest fight tomorrow too many frontrankers fought today miltiades said or ran i said with a wink and the other strategoi laughed miltiades agreed took exercise at any rate he quipped i thought he looked a foot taller tomorrow themistocles i want the little men back in the fields sniping at the barbarians but tomorrow ill have five hundred athenians fifty men of every tribe at the base of the hill formed close to give the psiloi cover if they have to run to show were still warriors more like i added that got me a look aristides nodded tomorrows my command day you have a plan you should be in command themistocles agreed i have the next day he said and i the next the polemarch added you may have my day as well miltiades grunted watch yourselves he said too many days and i could be addicted like a drunkard to wine or a lotuseater he looked out over the darkening plain but i will fight on my own day so men may not say that i acted from hubris let the barbarians stew they may march i said he shrugged if they march we fight whatever day it is he said but the more i look at this now that my eyes are opened the better it appears for us look they have a fine camp and good protection from wind and weather but where can they go from marathon all roads go through us if our little men bleed them every day and i speak frankly gentlemen what care we if we lose psiloi but every dead mede is one less for the day no one disagreed it was true the next day the psiloi went down the hill in a wave they were better organized than on the first day and themistocles played a role in that and he led the hoplites out on to the plain more than five hundred or so i thought the barbarians countered with oarsmen turned hastily into lightarmed men of their own but it was a poor decision as every dead man was that much less motive power for their ships the second day our lightarmed were tired only a few went out and the enemy cavalry killed some of them the balance was returning and men shouted for miltiades to lead us to battle muttering began that the army had voted for battle and now miltiades was hesitating men are childish fools miltiades muttered as he watched the beaten psiloi trudge up the hill dont they see weve won all we have to do is sit here and fill the plain with psiloi and watch them eat their horses will be out of forage in a day but the hoplites didnt see and the pressure to fight mounted the third day the lightarmed men went out together and the barbarians stayed in their camp they had to be feeling the same fatigue as our men by then but in our camp the hoplites boiled over sophanes aristides friend and mine led the protest he came up to miltiades with fifty spearmen behind him and demanded that miltiades lead us to the plain there and then are we cowards that we are letting our servants do the fighting sophanes asked what kind of city will we have if my shieldbearer can tell me that he not i drove the medes from holy attica he had a point as you all can see if we are honest with ourselves we hold citizen rights from our cities because we fight true eh so if we the armoured men the heroes were in camp and the little men were fighting then who was a citizen really but miltiades also knew he had a winning strategy men like aristides worried about the consequences but miltiades was a fighter and as we had put him in charge his only concern was winning he took sophanes aside talked to him the way a man talks to his son and sent him back to his friends hed convinced the young men to give him another day or two not that it mattered the barbarians had had enough on the evening of the third day the barbarians came out of their camp and their army was unbelievably big it was carefully planned and they flowed out of their camp like water from a pot and every contingent had its place and then having filled the plain from flank to flank they came forward at a fast walk the psiloi ran for their lives what else could they do more than a few of them died caught in the plain by the cavalry on the flanks or the bows of the sakai and the medes and the persians in the centre aristides had the hoplites on the plain that day and he held his ground until the last of the little men ran past and then in good order his hoplites walked back up the hill to us but the barbarians didnt pursue they turned about and walked back across the plain fifteen stades back to their camp the whole attack had taken less than the time it took for a speaker in a law case to give his argument i was getting into my corslet by that time afraid that we were about to be attacked right up the hill my eyes glued to the manoeuvres of the enemy miltiades came up next to me jumped up on the wall and watched them as they retreated he had phrynichus with him i remember and phrynichus had a stylus and a wax tablet persians on the right cavalry and then infantry their best just like us mounted sakai on the left then east greeks they look like the marines of all the ships some phoenicians there and then the dismounted sakai persians again in the centre dismounted maybe medes more medes on the right he watched them carefully they fill the plain arimnestos phrynichus wrote the persian battle order carefully i was looking at the fact that the persian right would have all their best troops it would be opposite our left that would be the plataeans like the day my father faced the spartans at oinoe we would bear the brunt of their best men of course i was afraid young man we were not the invincible hoplites of greece we were men who had lost every battle wed tried with the damned persians but i swallowed my fears like a man should i nodded and my voice barely caught when i spoke about twelve thousand give or take not as deep as we fight deep enough though miltiades gave half a grin we need to fill the plain too hah i said i could see it if our hoplites brushed against the hills and the sea the cavalry had no way to slip around us and no hoplite feared a horseman in front of him actually thats bravado all men on foot fear cavalry but a mass of spearmen who keep their nerve are not really at risk however loud the thunder of hooves plataeans on the left then the tribes in order or precedence miltiades said that puts your men on the far left and mine on the far right you ready for five hundred new citizens what tonight i quipped but in my heart i was afraid my plataeans against the persians it was not just a matter of whether we could win it was that i was taking my friends my brotherinlaw by the gods i was taking my city into action with the most dreaded foe in all the bowl of earth im about to free every slave in the camp miltiades said and his eyes sparkled then ill send them to you the free men and the psiloi ill arm them and fill the back of my tribes with them half of them wont have spears i pointed out theyll take up space he said they can get up in the rough ground on your flank if you have to spread out or help thicken your charge if you need and if the cavalry gets around you he shrugged well theyll buy you time while they die i nodded are we going to run at the barbarians or walk miltiades chewed on his moustache i thought we might tell off the picked men to go at a run starting at long bowshot the way eualcidas did it i shrugged why dont we all run at them i said im not saying anyone will shirk but if were all charging forward its hard for anyone to take a step back wed end up with holes in the shield wall he said wed scare the shit out of them i countered he sighed this is a big risk and you want to do something new he said he nodded ill think on it im going to free the slaves ill get a feast together i said and grinned the sun was still up when a crowd of poor men recently freed slaves appeared in our camp themistocles led them plataeans themistocles said athens has freed these men and asks your aid in enfranchising them i had myron right there i had warned him and he rose to it like well like the archon of plataea freedmen he said and they were quiet probably still delighted to hear that they were freed many of you are in your hearts men of athens perhaps you will always feel that way but plataea is honoured to have you and if you will let us we will make you feel honoured to be plataeans welcome come to our fires and let us feed you your first meal as free men and citizens we had bread and olives pork and wine all prepared and we fed the poor bastards a feast our own men joined in i went over to gelon and tapped him youre free too i said he grinned youre all right he said and went to stand with the freedmen they ate the way starving men eat and drank like men who never saw enough wine our citizens joined them and moved among them speaking to one learning the name of another and serving them like slaves makes me weep sorry honey bee i need a moment when they were done with libations and being blessed by our priests and eating i stood on my aspis i was once a slave i said that shut them up i was once a slave and war made me free now i am the polemarch of plataea i know how well a freed slave fights so i wont give you a long speech i pointed out of the firelight towards the barbarians right now not one of you has the value of a medimnos of grain but over there in that camp are your farms and your ploughs and your oxen your house and your barns for some of you your brides every sakai wears the value of a plataean farm on his back some persians are worth three or four i pointed at the men who had marched here with me tomorrow night we will pool everything we take every item we win with our spears and men who fight will each take away a share everyone will share now i said and i hopped off my aspis to stride among them who has a spear stand over here a helmet anyone it took for ever the sun slipped below the western rim and i was still trying to build my phalanx my plataeans were generous men whod picked up a good helmet offered their old one to the new men and men with a spare leather hat traded it round and so on it went on and on men with two spears shared one men gave slaves a pair of sandals a chlamys anything that would help the poor bastards to live a minute longer i received four hundred new citizens give or take a few and we managed to arm almost two hundred of them as spearmen if not hoplites most had to roll up a cloak and use it as a shield many had neither helmet nor hat and behind them stood men with a bag of rocks or a pair of javelins or a sling but when i had them all placed and as well armed as i could i sent them to bed sleep well i said dream of a rich farm in plataea i hoped that they would because i knew that it was as close as most of them would ever get i slept badly i hope you wont think the worse of me if i admit that the night before marathon despite my head telling me that we had the men and the will to win i lay awake and worried not about death i never worry about death it was failure that troubled me and i lay on my bearskin with the sound of snoring around me and nervous whispers and probably the occasional fart and wondered what i could do better the night raid haunted me id been lost and i hadnt told my men what i needed and id made a dozen other errors so i lay awake thinking through my actions in the morning when youre in command you worry about the damnedest things i worried about getting my armour on and needing to take a shit i worried about what i should say a polemarch is expected to give a speech i worried about sleeping too late about what my armour looked like gelon was free now and my helmet hadnt been polished since i left plataea a hero should look the part i worried about how to deal with the rough ground that would be on my left all day and i worried about the effect of four hundred untrained men at the back of my phalanx hades friends i cant even remember all the things i worried about the night before marathon and when i thought of my wife my glorious wife all i could think was that if she were there we could make love and that would cheer me up except that she was well along in pregnancy by then and they say making love when the belly is round is bad for the baby i dont believe that making love is ever bad for anyone myself but people say these things i think thats when i fell asleep thinking of her no thats a lie my mind was its own traitor and im here to tell the truth my last thoughts were of briseis if we won if we won would i be closer to her and where was she i said sapphos poem to aphrodite in the dark for briseis and then i went to sleep i awoke in the dark and i could hear the snores but as soon as my eyes opened it all came in the way animals come in an open gate when theres food in the mangers and they havent been fed all my worries i got up the dog star was going down and morning wasnt far off and besides i was cold idomeneus had snuggled close in the night and as i rose he rolled over ares he said morning already i tossed my heavy himation over him sleep another hour i said aphrodites blessing on you he smiled and went straight back to sleep the cretan bastard odd that he mentioned aphrodite i stirred our fire my mess group had a fire of course and added an armload of wood that someone had left ready like a proper soldier the fire sprang up and i was warm my kit was neatly stowed under the leather cover of my aspis gelon had done it he must have after the muster of the freedmen my corslet had been buffed until the scales shone and the helmet was like a womans mirror and the reflected gleam of the fire danced on the curved brow and the ravens on the cheekplates gelon came and knelt by my side i hadnt seen him get up good enough he asked as he had on other mornings when hed done a halfarsed job this wasnt halfarsed splendid i said hed even mounted my fancy plume the one euphoria had made me and laid out the cloak too might as well look the part polemarch he gave my arm a squeeze i gather from styges that you brought my armour i did i said but i havent polished it for you he laughed soundlessly youre all right he said in the baggage with styges mule i didnt want you to find it i waved down the hill in the east the blackblue sky was moving towards grey a thousand of us had only a few hours to live i ate alone a bowl of hot soup and a big chunk of pork from the feast the night before i dunked bread in the soup and drank two big cups of water and another of wine then clad only in my arming chiton a stained thing of linen that had once been white i crossed the camp to where the strategoi met the day was warm already and promised to be as hot as my forge i was the first strategos there miltiades was second which says much about the state of his mind and aristides was third then the rest came in a clump and this time we stood together with no regard to who voted for battle and who voted against in fact i helped leontus tie his thorax while miltiades spoke leontus had a beautiful white tawedleather cuirass with a heavy black leather yoke and scales on the sides and his armour tied with scarlet cords so miltiades said he looked around in the halflight todays my day and today well fight as soon as the boys have food in them well go down the hill i want the plataeans down first they get their leftmost mans shield up against the hills and then well all form on them so theres no gap and friends he said and he looked around all we need to do to win is keep the line solid from end to end no gaps no spaces nothing shield to shield all the way from the hills to the sea everyone got it we all nodded you all know the order left to right yes so each contingent goes down in order and no rushing and no pushing forming the line is the key to victory once were formed were halfway to it fuck this up and were all dead men aristides raised an eyebrow we get it miltiades didnt crack a smile see that you do next thing when we reach the bowshot of the enemy the range where they shoot we charge understand dead run and to hades with the man who slows or falls that got them talking well fall apart leontus protested miltiades shook his head it works in the east young arimnestos there once charged a hundred persians all by himself with ten other men i said and the rest of the phalanx came in behind it wrecked them right miltiades said i got the last of leontuss ties done and faced the others it hurries their archers i said they lose time and space to shoot i looked around were the best athletes in the world and we can cover that ground in no time with the gods at our backs youre in command leontus said to miltiades he shrugged then he smiled all right im fast ill run just make sure the rest of your tribe goes forward too sophanes said that was it perhaps our shortest command meeting to date callimachus asked miltiades where he should stand and miltiades nodded gravely you are the polemarch he said you take the right of the line callimachus bowed i am honoured but the place is yours if you wish it miltiades shook his head when im polemarch ill take the place of honour he said and that was that then many of us embraced and if my voice chokes to tell this i embraced many men i loved for ever and we all knew it we all knew that win or lose the price would be high that is what a battle is a culling except this time instead of standing with strangers and allies i was standing in an army with my friends in every rank and every dead man would be the loss of someone i knew it was all very personal more wine girl and this for the shades of the heroes who fell there so my friend hermogenes phylarch of the leftmost file of plataea was the first man down the hill the first to form and the lynchpin of our line and callimachus was the last fileleader down the hill and formed the farthest to the right in the front rank hermogenes shield brushed against the trees and callimachuss right sandal was in the water or so we used to tell the story our plataeans were twelve men deep and one hundred and twenty men wide we took up a little more than a stade of the plains width and our rear rank was just twentyfour paces at normal order from our front rank the three tribes next to us had been bolstered with lightarmed men and they too had twelve ranks many of the athenian archers had also been put in the phalanx on the left so they were deep and they stretched three more stades we couldnt even see the middle as it started to form aristides was in the centre with his antiochae and they formed twice as wide as we did and only half as deep just six deep to cover more frontage thats where the richest bestarmoured men were and miltiades felt confident that they could take the brunt of the archery at least i hope thats what he thought because otherwise what he thought was that the cream of the enemys archers the sakai would rid him of a world of political opponents there were three tribes in the centre and they covered almost five stades and on the right there were three more tribes double depth as we were and they covered three more stades so our line was twelve or more stades from end to end no one could keep a line that long from buckling and flowing and bending but we formed it well and even as we formed the barbarians came they did what they had done the day before but it all went mad like a sudden thunderstorm first the forming of the persians was terrifying from ground level yesterday id watched it from a hundred feet above the plain it had been majestic and professional at eye level it was like a lion pouncing they flooded out of their camp in silence twelve thousand professional soldiers all running to their posts in about as much time as it takes to tell the story and then they came forward at us my end of the line had settled in position men were kneeling to tie a sandal wiping the dew from their shields laughing resting their heavy shields on the ground or on the instep of their left feet the onset of the barbarians blasted the laughter from us they flowed over the plain like a sudden flood and the horsemen on their flanks looked like gods in a blaze of sunlit gold they came on without a sound except the ring and jingle of harness of metal on metal the hollow knocking of wooden shields on armoured legs just as yesterday they put their phoenicians and greeks on our right so that i was opposite persians the front ranks armed just as we were armed big men with heavy armour and shields mostly oval shields almost like our old boeotians with short heavy spears but with six ranks of archers behind them opposite hermogenes was a troop of persian noble cavalry directly opposite me was a man in a helmet that seemed to be made of gold as he came forward in the new sunlight he called out a war cry and his men answered all together a single shout that carried to us like a challenge i remember my breath stopping in my throat to his right from my perspective were the medes the dismounted medes were the second largest contingent after the sakai and they had armour the best bows sharp swords and axes beyond them i assumed were the sakai the best of the enemys archers in the centre and then the enemy greeks and phoenicians on our right facing miltiades they were formed exactly the way theyd formed the day before my plataeans faced the cream of their army it steadied me being the underdog has its advantages and in that moment i knew what id say they came closer moving swiftly across the plain like hunting hounds or wolves hungry wolves i had leontus on my right i left my shield with teucer and ran to leontus a stade each way thanks im going to charge them as soon as they reach bowshot i said pointing down the field he was taken aback is that what miltiades wants he asked i dont know what miltiades wants i said hes five more stades that way if you want to ask i shrugged no easy thing in twenty pounds of scale armour but as soon as they stop to shoot im going at them he was eyeing the persians his men would be in the arrow storm not mine im with you plataean he said i tapped his aspis by way of a handshake and ran back to my place and his tribe cheered me as i ran by they were getting their shields off the ground pulling their helmets down and when i reached my own men idomeneus had already given the orders the enemy was still three or four stades away so i walked forcing myself to take my time all along my front rank i met the eyes of every man there some said a few words some nodded their heads so that their plumes rippled the horsehair catching the sea breeze i walked all the way to hermogenes fight well brother i said lead us to glory polemarch he said i could see his grin inside the tau of his face slit by the gods those words went to my heart then i walked back making myself walk even while the persians and medes were slowing closer than id expected faster than i thought possible their mounted persians the best of the best seemed close enough to touch close enough to ride over and gut me before i could take shelter in our ranks i stopped in the middle of my line turned my back to the enemy and raised my arms then with the kind of gesture that heraclitus taught us a broad orators sweep of my right arm i indicated that i would speak i could talk to you of duty i shouted and they were silent of courage and arete and of the defence of hellas and all you hold dear i paused and forced myself to look at my own men and not to turn my head and look at the enemy who came closer and closer to my back but you are plataeans and you know what is excellent and who is brave so i will say two things first yesterday many of you were slaves and for the rest no one here expects us to beat the persians we are the left of the line and all athens asks is that we take our time dying i paused and then i pointed my spear at the enemy horse shit brothers we are plataeans every man here is a plataean over there is all the wealth of asia the gods have given us the persians themselves every one of them wearing a fortune in gold you were a slave yesterday tomorrow you can be an aristocrat or be dead and go to hades with the heroes whatever you were whatever you are at this moment however much you want to piss or creep away tomorrow is yours if you win today all of that gold is yours if you are men enough to take it my plataeans responded with a roar a sharp bark only then did i sneak a glance at our enemies they were a stade away or more i returned to my place in the ranks i put my aspis on my shoulder and grasped my spears my fine light deer spear in my right hand and my heavy mankiller in my left sharing the hand with the antilabe of my shield i turned to idomeneus how was that i asked he nodded he wore a cretan helm that showed his face and his smile was broad everyone understands gold he said arete is more complicated see the mounted bastard in the gold helmet i said ill take him but hes got to go and if i fall or i miss you take him understand i tapped my spearhead against his and saw his grin good as dead now idomeneus said yes i answered he smiled his mad fighting smile sure he said i turned to teucer who was tight to my back hear me friend do not take that mans life i want his men to see him go down to my spear in a fight like this everything depends on the first few seconds aye lord he said he was doubtful opposite me the whole enemy line every bit as long as ours and at least as deep was slowing it didnt stop all at once it takes time for a line fifteen stades long to stop and straighten ready i roared spears up idomeneus hissed close our order at me i know what im doing i said the athenians obeyed me as fast as my own men and three thousand men raised their spears over their heads spearpoint just clear of the rim of your shield spearbutt well up in the air so that it doesnt foul the man behind you or worse catch him in the teeth we were one stade from the enemy the persians were settling down planting shafts in the ground the cavalry were actually lagging behind their main line with a few men trying to pick a way through the scrub to our flank and struggling but giving me heartburn nonetheless i nodded to idomeneus and he blew the horn two long hard blasts and the pause between them was thin enough for a sword blade to fit and not much more and then we were off ever run a foot race ever run the hoplitodromos ever run the hoplitodromos with fifty men imagine fifty men imagine a hundred five hundred three thousand men all starting together at the sound of a horn we were off and by the will of the gods no one stumbled in all our line one poor fool sprawling on his face might have been the difference between victory and defeat but no man fell at the start on my right the athenians moved as soon as i did and the persians and the medes raised their bows and shot too fast and too far men in the rear ranks died but not a shaft went into the front its a tactic honey bee they halt at a given distance a distance at which they practise and pound the crap out of you if you stand and take it but if you move forward every step was a step towards victory we were on the edge of a wheat field tramped flat by psiloi over the last few days and the hobnails on my spartan shoes bit into the ground as i ran full strides just like the hoplitodromos thats why i didnt close our order of course because men need room to run i was neither first nor last idomeneus was ahead of me by a horselength just heartbeats after he blew the horn my old wound kept me from being first but i was not last i looked over the rim of my shield we were facing persians medes and a handful of sakai and every man had a bow ten more paces and the persians were loosing again a rippling volley and an arrow skipped off the gravel in front of me and ripped across my greave at my ankle and vanished into the ranks behind me theyd shot low this time men fell a few plataeans and more athenians and other men fell over the wounded a man can break his jaw falling with an aspis at a dead run or break his collarbone or shield arm just opposite me and a little to my left golden helm was bringing his persian nobles forward i saw him raise his hand saw him order them forward saw his hesitation we were charging them the persian polemarch had spearfighters dismounted nobles for his front two ranks but he had sent them to the rear for the archery phase his archers would shoot better and flatter if they didnt have to lift their shots clear of the front rank the problem was we werent waiting to be pounded with arrows and now his best fighters killers every one like cyrus and pharnakes were in the eleventh and twelfth rank if he rotated them again now his men would have to stop shooting i read this at a glance because there were no shields facing me only round persian hats and bright scale armour like mine a third volley flew at us it is a fearful thing when the arrows come straight at you when the flicker of their motion seems to end in your eye when the shafts darken the sky when the sound is like the first whisper of rain growing swiftly into a storm and then they hit and my shield took the impacts like a hail of stones thrown by strong boys or young men two hit my helmet and there was pain then i was free of them and still running more men were down and the rest were right with me golden helm had made his decision he ordered his cavalry to charge us slanting across our front horses take up three or four times the frontage of a man with a shield unless they move very slowly so suddenly the whole of the plataean front was filled with persian cavalry i altered my stride and ran for golden helm my plataeans didnt know any better so they followed me the received wisdom of the ages is that infantry should not charge cavalry in fact its about the best thing the infantry can do charging keeps men from flinching cavalry is only dangerous to infantry who break i wanted their unarmoured horses in among our rear ranks where theyd be swarmed and killed i didnt want to fight them later in our flanks or our rear but to be honest it was too late to change plan i ran at golden helm and he became my world he saw me too and he rode at me he had a long axe in his hand and his beard was saffron and hennastreaked brilliant and barbarous he was someone important and the way he whirled the axe was beautiful magnificent i could say the battlefield hushed but that would be pig shit but it did for me these moments come once or twice in a lifetime even when you are a hero as far as i know we were the first to clash on the field that day i saw no one else in those last moments i saw the fine ripples in the muscles of his horse the way the sun glinted like a newlit fire from the peak of his helmet the way his axe curved up from his strap reaching for my throat i was perhaps five paces from him one lunge of his horse three strides of my legs when i cast my spear the point went into the breast of his mount and sank the length of my forearm and the horses front legs went out from under it as if it had tripped he cut at me anyway but the gods put him on the ground at my feet and my second spear rang on his helmet snapping his head back he tried to rise and quick as a cat i stabbed twice more eye slit and throat the first rang on his helmet and the second sank slickly and came out red and then i was past him and the world seemed to burst into motion as the rest of his cavalry slammed into us or slackened their reins confusion everywhere but the plataeans ran in among them the persians had balked or most of them had it happens to horses and to cavalry especially men who are riding strange horses many of them were just greek farm horses and they balked at the line of shields and the eleueleueleu shrieks from every throat and then they broke they wanted a shooting contest not a toeto toe brawl with men in better armour the noble persians broke away from us leaving their dead having accomplished nothing but we had we were like gods now we went after them at their infantry at the archers who had stopped shooting for fear of hitting their own the gods were with us i ran with a host of dead men eualcidas was there i know and neoptolemus and all the men who had died for nothing at lade i could feel their shades at my back giving wings to my feet but persians are men too those archers were not slaves nor hirelings nor raw levies they were dariuss veterans and when we were ten short paces from their lines they did not flinch they raised their bows and aimed the barbed shafts straight at our faces too close to miss and then they loosed i remember hearing the shout of the master archer and the grunts of men as they let the heavy bows release i was that close i was in front men say that our front rank fell like wheat to a scythe i know that the next day i saw men i loved with eight or nine arrows in them men shot right through the faces of their aspides through leather caps or even bronze but not a shaft touched me perhaps the shades kept them from me or heracles my ancestor nine paces from their line i knew i would outrun their next volley eight paces out and men in the front rank were as plain as day tanned faces handsome men with long black beards drawing swords six paces out and they were flinching this was not the fight at the pass i didnt need to risk hitting them at full speed i slowed shortening stride bringing my second spear up gripping it short just a little forward of halfway three paces out and my prayers went to my ancestors there is no paean at the dead run but to our right the athenians were singing and i could hear it i remember thinking this is how i want to die one pace out the man in front of me wouldnt meet my eye and my spear took him while he cringed but the man to his left was made of better stuff and he slammed his short sword into me i blocked it on my aspis and then i put my shield into him he had no shield and i probably broke his jaw my strong right leg pushed me through their front rank left foot planted shield into the secondranker and i knocked him back ares hand on my shoulder the secondranker was a veteran and he knew his business he and the man to his right got their swords up into my face points levelled and they pushed back at me together then a rain of blows fell on my aspis as they tried to force me out of their ranks i took a blow to my helmet and i went back a step and then teucer already at my shoulder by then shot one a clean kill i pushed forward against the other man chest to chest and he stood his ground and our spears were too long to reach each other close enough to embrace to kiss to smell the cardamom and onion on his breath i thrust over his shoulder at the man behind him he pushed me back he was strong and i remember my shock as he moved me back another full pace but he was so dedicated to pushing me by main strength that i had time to throw my light spear into another secondranker my sword floated into my hand and i cut once twice three times at his shield rim no art no science just strength and terror and the last shreds of force from my desperate run and he raised his cloakwrapped arm and ducked his head as men will and pushed my fourth blow came as fast as the first three stooped like a hawk on a rabbit bit through his cloak and into the naked meat of his arm so hard that it cut to the bone and my sword snapped as i wrenched it loose falling because even as i cut him his push overcame my balance i fell and the melee closed over me imagine i had killed him or wounded him so badly he couldnt fight yet still he knocked me down at my shoulder was teucer who had no shield at my victims shoulder was a smaller man who hadnt quite kept up in a fight like that a rearranker needs to be pressed tight to his frontranker to help him at all or his spearthrusts are too far back teucer shot the next man but the arrow skittered off his shield suddenly we were fighting their killers their frontrank men who were pushing as hard as they could to get to their correct places by all the gods the persians were brave even disordered they fought and their best men werent finished i saw it all from where id fallen backwards my back against teucers knees and my shield still covering me i had never gone down in a phalanx fight before and i was terrified once you are down you are meat for any mans spear in falling my chin had caught on my shield rim and id bitten my tongue it may sound like a silly wound to you thugater but my head was full of the pain and i didnt know if id taken a worse wound arimnestos is down teucer called he meant to rally aid but his words sucked the heart out of our phalanx the whole line gave a step to the persians and medes i couldnt get an arm under me my left arm beneath my shield was wrapped in my chlamys and i couldnt get the rim of the shield under me my right arm slipped on the bloodsoaked wheat stubble and one of the enemy thrust at me i caught a flash of his spearhead and turned my head and his blow landed hard his point must have caught in the repousse of my olive wreath and i fell back again this time on my elbows my aspis bore two heavy blows and my shoulder felt the impact as my left arm was rotated against my will i screamed at the pain then bellerophon and styges saved my life they passed over teucer their shields flowing around him in the movements we had taught in the pyrrhiche they stood over me their spears flashing the tall crests on their helmets nodding in time to their thrusts and for a moment i could see straight up under their helmets mouths set chins down to cover the vulnerable throat and then styges pushed forward with his right leg and bellerophon roared his war cry and they were past me i got a breath in me teucer stepped over me close at their shoulders and shot and there were hands under my armpits and i was dragged back i breathed again and again and the pain was less and then i was on my back and my shield was off my arm let me up i spat they were all new men the rearrankers and they scarcely knew me on the other hand theyd been bold enough to push into the scrum and get my body i finally got my feet under me and i rose covered in blood and straw from being dragged you live one of the new men said i live i said i pulled my helmet back and one of them handed me a canteen i looked at the front of the fighting just a couple of horselengths away i could see styges red plume and bellerophons white side by side and idomeneuss red and black just an arms length to the right of styges they were fighting well the line wasnt moving either way i looked to the right the athenians under leontus were into the medes but the fighting was heavy and the sakai in the rear ranks were lofting arrows high to drop on the phalanx where they fell on unarmoured men many of whom had no shields to my left the persian cavalry were pressed hard against the front of our shields stabbing down with their spears and screaming strange cries a new man little more than a boy handed me a gourd more water lord i drank greedily pressed the gourd back into his hands and pulled my helmet down shield i said and two of them put it on my arm my left arm muscles protested something bad had happened in my shoulder spear i growled and one of them gave up his spear his only weapon behind me the sound of battle changed tone i had to turn around to look once i had my helmet on my field of vision was that limited beyond the athenians fighting the medes something was already wrong i could see the backs of athenians i could see men running but they were two or three stades away slightly downhill it looked to me as if our centre was bulging back remember that we had been fighting for only two minutes maybe less i remember sucking in a deep breath and then plunging forward into the phalanx the way a man dives into deep water i pushed past the rearrankers easily they were anxious to let me past when i came to armoured men our fifth or sixth rank i suppose i had to tap the men on the backplate exchange i called rank by rank i exchanged forward this is something we practise in the pyrrhiche over and over again men need to be able to move forward and back i went forward sixth to fifth fifth to fourth fourth to third finally after what seemed like an hour i was behind teucer and i could see idomeneus locked in his fight with a persian captain they were well matched and both of them were failing their blows slowing ive said it before men can only fight so long even brave noble men in the height of training i stepped to the right cutting in ahead of idomeneuss secondranker gelon he knew me immediately i tapped idomeneus on the shoulder he looked back the merest flash of a glance shield high to deflect a blow but in that heartbeat he knew who was behind him he set his feet and i put my right foot forward across my left and allowed my knee to touch the back of his leg he pivoted on the balls of his feet and stepped to the rear i pushed forward and launched a heavy blow into the persians shield with my new spear rocking him back he was tired i could tell he was fading from that first exchange and he crouched behind his shield and thrust low at my shins but i was having none of it i had caught my breath and i was as fresh as a man can be in a phalanx fight i powered forward on my spear foot and gelon came at my shoulder pounding away at the noble persian with high blows to his shield and his helmet he gave ground plataeans i roared take them i remember that moment the best children because it was like the dance and it was glorious it was perhaps a taste of godhood enough men heard me enough men in every rank heard the call i was arimnestos the killer of men but in that kind of fight i was only one man but i was one plataean and together we were that thing i planted my right foot and around me every plataean did the same and though we had no pipes to call the time every man crouched screamed their war cry and pushed forward apollos ravens the persian officer was gone knocked flat or exchanged out of the front rank i lost him in the moments when we pushed and my new opponents eyes were wide with terror i swept my shield forward and caught the rim of his oval shield and flicked it aside and gelons spear robbed the man of life as easily as if he was a dummy of straw then we went forward i had styges at my left shoulder and idomeneus was pressing up on my right gelon was at my back and teucer shot and shot from behind my left ear we went forward ten paces and then another ten the enemy stumbling away before us they didnt break but suddenly there was less pressure on our front leontus and his athenians were keeping pace and the medes were backing away almost as fast as we pressed forward but they were not yet beaten men in truth it was the hardest fighting i had ever seen by this time we had been spear to spear for as long as a man gives a speech in the agora or more long enough that the sun was suddenly high in the sky i was covered in sweat my face burned from the pressure of my helmet and the blood and salt against the leather of my helmet pad my shoulder was lacerated by the damaged scales on my thorax and my legs ached the persians flinched back again and their front solidified men were calling to each other to hold their ground and the medes on our right got their spearfighters into the front rank and locked shields and we came to a stop just a pace or two clear of their line i looked around wed pushed them back a stade or more and as they recoiled they were pivoting on their centre so that we were facing their ships in the distance far away by their camp all along the line men breathed and stood straight they switched grips on their spears or dropped a broken weapon many exchanged giving their place to fresher men you live styges said he raised my shield arm wrenching my shoulder as he did so that the black raven on my red shield rose over the battlefield men cheered that is a great feeling daughter and worth all the pain in the world when men cheer you you are with the gods opposite us an officer called for the persians to cheer and got a rumble and no more plataeans i called and heracles or hermes gave my throat power sons of the daidala now is the time the spear came up again and our cheer had the force of a crack of thunder and we charged not far two paces but the persians were yielding before we reached them their shields moving so that every veteran in our line knew that we had beaten them and with a long crash like the sound two boats make as they collide the enemy gave way the firstrank man opposite me was brave or foolish and stood his ground i knocked him flat i threw my borrowed spear at the next man and it stuck in his shield dragging it down gelon put a speartip into the top of his thigh and i stepped on his chest and pressed forward reaching for a sword that wasnt there a moment of fear and i was into the third rank this part i remember as if it was yesterday thugater i had no weapon and the next man should have killed me but he cowered and my right arm shot out as if it had its own life in combat grabbed the rim of his scalloped shield and spun it to the left his shield arm snapped he went down he screamed and his scream was the surrender of the persians to panic and the rest were running the screaming man with the broken arm had a perfectly good spear and the gods gifted it to me as he let go and it seemed to leap into my hand i looked left hermogenes was coming into the flank of the medes no idea where the beaten persian cavalry had got to but the persians were wrecked men in front and the flank and they ran and the medes started to run with them all in as long as it takes to tell the tale after an hour of endless pushing we were winning to my right the medes were backing fast but they were not beaten and their rear ranks continued trying to lob arrows high to drop them on our phalanx and it was working my men were still dying but the sakai had no shields and our spears were hurting them i was no longer in command we were no longer a phalanx plataeans and athenians were intermixed along two stades and men were plunging into the front of the sakai in groups or alone i remember that i stooped and picked up a sakai axe and put it in my shield hand better than no weapon i thought if my short persian spear broke i could hear a mede demanding that his men rally and they did the persians tried to form on them they had lost many men and the persian cavalry came forward with a shout and a hail of arrows hermogenes men were still milling around in no sort of order but remember he had twelve ranks of men behind him the cavalry hit his front ranks and they locked up spear and aspis against horse and sword and bow our line moved back a pace and then the men on my left ran at the flanks of the horses and started pulling the persians from their saddles the medes like lions came forward to take advantage of our confusion or simply to save the persians i have no idea on me i roared charge the medes were shocked as we ran at them again some stopped dead and others kept coming and they had no more order than we did thats when the fighting was the worst the fiercest they were shamed from their brief rout and meant to have our heads while we already thought that we were the better men and meant to have theirs both sides lost their cohesion and men died fast blows came out of everywhere and nowhere and the only hope was to be fully armoured as i was i must have taken ten blows that should have been wounds on my arm and shoulder plates on my scale shirt on my helmet some must have been from my own men in the confusion then somehow i was in among the persian cavalry not the medes though i have no memory of running at them and that made my fighting easier anyone on a horse was a target mounted men seldom have shields i was like nemesis idomeneus must have decided to stay at my shoulder and i had gelon at my back and we killed them ahh i remember marathon children that day i was a god of war my armour flashed and shone and men fell under every blow of my spear i ripped men from their horses mounted men have to fight to the front they cannot face to the flanks or rear not against two rapid blows anyway idomeneus and gelon were not much worse than me though and as the fight became looser and ranks dissolved we were more dangerous not less i had a simple goal my usual goal in a melee to burst out of the back of the enemy formation so i killed and wounded i knocked men off their mounts and stepped on them and i kept going forward and my little group stuck to me it is possible to get lost in a big fight the way a man may get lost in the woods confined in the eye slits of your helmet it is possible to take a wound or die simply because some bastard turned you around it is essential to have men at your back whom you trust men who will turn you back round or kill the opponent who is circling outside the realm of your helmet but with such men anything is possible and it is incredible how a man can move inside a melee if he has purpose and companions i went at a rider in a rich purple cloak and he turned and jammed his heels in and when i followed him we burst free and then we were running in a hayfield and the fight was behind us the fleeing man took an arrow and fell back over the rump of his horse and he rode away like that a surprising distance as i remember then teucer at my elbow grunted and released another arrow high and it fell on him and he crashed to earth he tried to rise and a third arrow finished him teucer came out from the cover of idomeneuss shield nocking an arrow and the persian cavalry folded up and ran again and this time they left half their men or more dead on the ground because wed burst through them then the medes broke and ran shooting as they went there were horses down in the brush and men screaming and horses bellowing ares it was grim blood on the ground enough of it to splash over your sandals when the man next to you made a kill or died so much blood that the copperbronze smell fills your nostrils more even than the stink of sweat the smell that men have when they are afraid the smell of mens guts like newbutchered deer only when you stop do you notice it the stench of ares and then it makes you gag especially if some unarmoured boy has been cut to death at your feet his lips already bluewhite and bled out his eyes bulging from the horror and pain war but as i say the medes ran the persian cavalry ran or died and the sakai despite their leaders calls had not been keen for the second engagement and the whole mass went back this time they went back to the east down towards the beach trying to hide themselves among the sakai of the centre i think teucer started shooting into them and then he was out of shafts it seems odd to tell it but the only arrows i remember at that point were his although im told that the sakai kept shooting until the very end i had other concerns the athenians were pushing the sakai and the sakai whether by intention or by chance where backing only at our end of the line so that they swung like a gate still linked to their centre two stades away at our end wed won the persians cavalry and infantry were dead or broken fleeing throwing away their shields once a man discards his shield hes done the medes ran and the sakai nearest us were well mostly they were dead idomeneus was at my shoulder sound the rally i panted i could see it by ares and by aphrodite thats what i remember best of that whole glorious day i could see what i needed to do as if athena stood at my shoulder or perhaps heracles and whispered it in my ear i pivoted my body to face the beach twelve stades away and spear my arms wide rally here i called on me idomeneus went into his place and gelon and teucer in seconds fifty more men were fitting in and then a hundred a long minute and an arrow slew one of my plataeans almost at the end of my spear but by now the whole mass of them was forming up fifteen hundred men even the former slaves even when the old plataeans had to show them where to stand the sakai werent stupid they were shooting at us as fast as they could the far end of the line had hermogenes and antigonus i ran down the front rank and counted off twenty files from the left end and pulled antigonus out of the ranks take them wheel left and pursue the beaten men stay close enough to keep them running and stay far enough that they dont turn and kill you if you reach their camp stop antigonus nodded pursue he gave me a tired smile have we won thats right i slapped his shield go if you think i was a good strategos a just man im no aristides i sent my brotherinlaw and my closest friend away to a nice safe pursuit theyd done their part and pen would not become a widow this day i didnt think that the remnants of the enemy had any fight left in them nor was i wrong then back to my own now formed facing the empty air that hung off the new flank of the sakai slow and steady keep together i shouted these things i wanted the sakai to see us coming sing the paean i yelled and men took it up all along the line there had been no time to sing the paean or give much of a war cry before our first charge now now we had all the time in the world we sang and our lines stiffened bent righted themselves it is hard to keep the line on rough ground and the plains of marathon in early autumn are like farm fields the world over we had to flow around clumps of trees bushes rocks it was not like the painting in the stoa children there were no straight lines at marathon but the sakai saw us and gave more ground they tried to run and reform to face us but the athenians stayed on them and they died those sakai were gallant and they tried again and again to make a stand and hold the line as we passed the edge of their formation we saw why our own centre was shattered as if a herd of cattle had passed through where aristides had stood there were only victorious persians datiss bodyguard and dead greeks i cursed under my breath trying to see had we lost i faltered and my voice roared forward without my volition some god took my throat i swear i went forward then as we turned the flanks of the sakai they folded as fast as a man can lose a boxing match one moment they were outmatched but still game their line backing away but their men fighting hard and the next they were finished flying for their lives they started to run in earnest because we were behind them i didnt want to fight the sakai anyway i wanted to come to grips with datis the day was neither lost nor won and with everything in the balance my men were not going to stop and fight men in flight paean again i roared and they obeyed although as long as i have been a soldier i have never heard the paean sung twice in the same action now i could see the greek centre well back almost where we had started our charge and only clumps of men i could see horsehair crests there and persian felt hats and men looking towards us it all happened in moments heartbeats of time too little for me to give an order or change our front the persian centre was killing the antiochae and then they were running racing over the stubble of the hay for their camp the sight of us behind them however illformed our phalanx really was terrified them the way our charge apparently had not the sakai had held the flanks for datis and his picked men to wreck the athenian centre and the dead were everywhere or so it seemed but by the gods when they saw us coming behind threatening to cut them off from the ships i saw men grab the satrap hard to miss in his scarlet and gold and run him to a horse his picked killers ran at his heels like dogs on a hunt they were too far away for my formed men to reach they ran through the hole in our lines and down towards the beach some of their men ran west away from the beach following an officer more i didnt see this ran west and north around behind our lines the right wing our right miltiades men had fought as hard as we had and been just as victorious and even as we came up to the persians miltiades men began to form a new phalanx facing us one of the strangest sights ive seen on a battlefield two victorious phalanxes from the same side facing each other over three stades of ground with persians streaming away between us there was no holding my men then it started with the rearrankers the freedmen they saw their fortunes running by hundreds and hundreds of goldlaced persians running for their camp and they left their ranks and started in pursuit i called for them to halt and more men joined them all my men streamed away after them i stopped popped my helmet on the back of my head took a swig of water and spat it out and bandaged my knee by my side idomeneus was panting bent double staring fixedly at the stubble and teucer was humming to himself scouring the grass for spent shafts when i raised my head i could see all the way to the ships there was haze in the distance but i could see that the barbarians had formed again well down the field and there was fighting there and over in the olive grove west of the swamp too most of my oikia my own men stood around me styges had a cut on his sword arm gelon looked as fit as a statue and a dozen of my new freedmen had chosen to loot the corpses in the area so i had maybe twenty men and there were knots of fighting all over the field men were leaving the field too dribs and drabs of greeks wounded or just too tired too continue not everyone lived the life of the palaestra and the gymnasium and there was no real discipline man who felt hed done enough could just turn and walk away but i was the polemarch of plataea and there was still fighting the greeks around me were saying nike nike maybe but to me the sound from the north was an ominous one it suggested that the battle wasnt over yet i tested my wounded leg and it was solid enough pain is pain fatigue is fatigue zeus soter one of the new men said he had a wound on his hand with blood flowing out of it despite the rag hed put on it i feel like shit he said i need to sit i grabbed his shoulder you feel bad i asked think how they feel i pointed to the row of dead sakai naked now and their white bodies lying in a row where our rearrankers had stripped them idomeneus barked his battle laugh more fighting he said we all drank our canteens dry and then greeks came up from the wreck of the athenian centre some ashamed and others proud many had run and others fought on until the persians were forced back and you can guess which group included aristides by the gods plataean i think we have won he shouted as he ran up he had the cheekplates of his helmet cocked back to give him a better view there was blood flowing down his leg and idomeneus and i insisted he be bandaged before we went forward again aristides brought a hundred men with him they were weary but they wanted to be in at the kill we moved down to the beach the fighting seemed heaviest by the ships and we could see black hulls launching all along the bay it seemed too good to be true but one after another ships pushed their sterns off the sand and their oars came out some stayed in close rescuing men from the water others simply fled that was when we knew wed won the barbarians had formed a line by the ships whether by intention or merely in desperation and miltiades men were fighting there most of my men and many of miltiades went up into the camp and started to loot the fighting by the ships was deadly aeschyluss brother fell there and callimachus the polemarch of athens cimon miltiades eldest son took a wound there and agios was wounded when he leaped aboard an enemy ship and started to clear it we were walking i can hardly call it a march along the beach passing over the wreckage of the persians corpses of men and horses as thick as seaweed after a storm dead medes cut down by miltiades men and as clear as an actor on the stage of the agora i heard agios calling then i saw him on the stern of an enemy ship half a stade away i wasnt going to let him die while i had breath in my body i started to run at my back all my oikia followed me aristides and miltiades heard him too and like a flood the best spears of the army converged on the stern of that ship we werent far a hundred paces how long does it take to cut your way through a hundred paces of panicked medes and desperate persians too long i went through the remnants of the medes with my trusted men at my shoulders but then we hit the persians and we slowed there were a dozen of them not men i knew thank the gods but the same sort of men as cyrus and his friends and they fought like demons and we slowed agios probably died then while i was face to face with an armoured persian the persian fought well we must have exchanged four or five cuts before my spear ripped his forearm and my next thrust sent his shade down to hades as i stepped past him the persians backed away grabbing at a man with a hennaed beard his helmet was gold and set with lapis and id seen him before datis i thrust at him and saw my spear drive home under the skirts of his armour and then his men were all around him i was an arms length from the ship where agios lay dying pierced fifty times shot with arrows and continuing to call the battle cry of athens so that the whole army heard him and men pressed forward possessed with the rage of ares the barbarians could have rallied they certainly should never have lost a ship but we cut into them the way the sickle cuts into the weeds at the edge of a garden agioss shouts grew weaker and my blows fell faster and i got a mede against the stern of the ship and punched my spear at him so hard that my spearhead stuck in the tarcoated wood then i dropped my shield and jumped as i got my leg over the thwart a sakai archer cut at me his short knife caught in my chlamys and turned against my scale armour with that axe in my right hand i cut into him and he fell away and i got my feet under me i could see the faces of the panicked oarsmen and agios collapsed across the helm a spearman stood over him having just stabbed him and my axe licked out and cut the back of his knee so that his leg gave way and he fell spraying blood but i hit him again and again and again until the side of his helmet caved in now the blows of five men fell on my armour and i had no shield i took a wound in the thigh just a pinprick but enough to snap me out of the blood rage suddenly aristides was beside me using his spear twohanded and then miltiades came over the other gunwale then styges gelon sophanes bellerophon teucer aeschylus and we stormed that ship the living wrath of athena six more ships were taken and cleared before they could get to sea the athenians and the plataeans were no longer an army nor were the barbarians they were a fleeing mob and we were in the red rage of nike and ares when men die because they care about nothing but more blood our fire burned hot and many were consumed indeed ive heard it said that more athenians died by the ships than when the centre broke but ive heard a great many things said by athenians about the battle and a few of them are true but most are pig shit we lost a lot of men and so did athens although cimon will tell you otherwise we burned like a bonfire in a high wind and then their last ship was away and we burned to ash we were spent we came to a stop so that a hush fell over the field i suppose that wounded men screamed and gulls screeched and horses trumpeted their pain but i remember none of that what i remember is the hush as if the gods had decided that all of us deserved a rest i leaned on the haft of my looted axe and breathed i dont know how long i was out of it but ask any man whos been in the battle haze and hell tell you that when you are done you dont cheer you just stop when i came back to myself i was sitting on the bloodsoaked planks of the marine box my thigh wound was open and bleeding again and miltiades was beside me wed cut our way from the stern by agioss corpse to the bow i was covered in blood sticky stinking blood i think weve won miltiades said he didnt sound proud or arrogant or in any way like the hero of the hour he sounded awestruck we all were children i dont think that we really believed we could win or perhaps the issue was so much in doubt that we couldnt separate what we dreaded from what we hoped for but as we watched the last shreds of the persian cavalry swimming their horses out and the ships closing round them to save them we knew that these persians were not coming back especially when they abandoned their horses in the water i remember then watching the ships creep past us from the north many had lost oarsmen as well as hoplites and they didnt move fast behind me the victorious athenians had started to sing some hymn to athena i didnt know out across the water a ships length away or less i saw the scorpion shield standing on the stern of a light trireme the enemy ship was going past us picking men out of the water bold as brass teucer had an arrow and he drew it to his chin but i put my axe head in front of his arrowhead just when he went to loose and he cursed archilogos saw it all his mouth formed an o and his head tracked me as my eyes must have followed him he raised his shield tell briseis i send my greetings i called across the water his men rowed him away and he didnt reply it was harder to leap down from that hull than it had been to climb aboard my muscles were seizing and i remember aeschylus catching me as i stumbled we were much of an age he and i he was a good man despite his jealousy of phrynichuss success idomeneus had my shield you alive boss he asked youve got a cut so we bandaged my thigh again and then we looked after the dozen cuts he had one in his bicep so deep i couldnt see how he could use his sword arm aeschylus helped i didnt realize then that he was standing a few paces from the corpse of his brother miltiades came up to me i need the best men he said quietly were not done just north of the plain was an extensive stand of olive trees surrounded by a stone boundary wall the persians who had run north and west when their line gave way ran all the way around our army but were cut off from the beach by the ruin of their camp being true persians they refused to surrender they went into the walled olive grove and determined to die like men half of our army must already have started back across the fields to our camp by the time miltiades became aware of what was happening and good men had died some of them plataeans trying to storm the olive grove the rumour spread that datis was there and the persian command staff i gathered my oikia and miltiades gathered his and aristides his best men from the wreck of the centre and we walked north along the beach and then through the persian camp we passed beautiful carpets and bronze urns and i saw silk and finely woven wool but we had no time to loot i did pause to pick up a silverstudded sword that one honey bee look at that steel too light for me but so well crafted hephaestuss blessing on the hand that made the blade that i would use it in preference to a betterhefted blade i found hermogenes at the edge of the camp with antigonus who had a wound in the foot peneleos and diocles were there although other men who should have been with them like epictetus were missing those are some tough bastards hermogenes said he had four arrows in his shield he looked sheepish the athenians tried to storm them and got in trouble we just went in to help them out he looked as if he would cry i lost a lot of the boys he said quietly they beat us antigonus said miltiades took a deep breath theyre desperate men he said surround the grove and get them tomorrow themistocles suggested he had a dozen hoplites with him and they looked as tired as the rest of us or burn it theyll break out in the dark aeschylus said his voice was thick he knew by then that his brother was dead and he wanted revenge theyll break out and every cottage they burn every petty farmer they kill will be on our heads it was true tired men have no discipline and the athenians were tired indeed every man looked twenty years older miltiades looked sixty aristides looked well like an old man and hermogenes looked like a corpse ever been exhausted children no you are soft we were hard like old oaks but there was little flame left in us i remember how i walked forcing each step because i hurt and because my knees were shaking slightly my sword wrist burned miltiades looked around the sun was setting where had the day gone and we had perhaps two hundred men of all the army standing there at the north edge of the enemy camp others were looting but most were sitting on the ground or on their aspides some singing some tending wounds but most simply staring at the ground thats how it was how it always is when you are done you are done miltiades watched the ships behind us where are they going he asked suddenly the barbarian fleet was forming up out in the bay and starting not east towards naxos or lemnos or an island safely owned by the great king but south towards athens theyre making a stab for the city cleitus said softly i hadnt seen him since the fighting started and there he was covered in dirt as if hed rolled in the fields perhaps he had i had his right arm was caked in crusted blood to the elbow his spearhead dripped blood and flies buzzed thickly around his head miltiades took a deep breath he was the eldest of us over forty in fact and his face beneath the cheekplates of his attic helmet was grey with fatigue and below his eyes he had black lines and pouches like a rich mans wallet but as i say none of us looked much better apart from sophanes who looked as fresh as an athlete in a morning race and bellerophon who was grinning we have to clear the olive grove as quickly as we can miltiades said we cant leave them behind us well have to march for athens there was a groan i think we all groaned at the thought of walking a hundred stades to athens miltiades stood straighter we are not done he said if the old men and boys we left behind surrender the city to their fleet and there are people in the town who might do it then all this would be for nothing he sighed phidippides the athenian herald pushed forward give me leave lord he said and ill run to athens and tell them of the battle miltiades nodded his face full of respect go and the gods run with you phidippides was not a rich man and had only his leather cuirass a helmet and his aspis he dropped the aspis and helmet on the ground and eager hands helped him out of his cuirass he stripped his chiton off and put his sword belt on his naked shoulder someone handed him a chlamys and he gave us a grin better than mine in camp he said ill be there before the sun sets friends hed fought the whole day but he ran off the field heading south his legs pumping hard not a sprint but a steady pace that would eat the stades miltiades turned to me or perhaps to aristides i have to get the army ready to march he said i need one of you to lead the assault on the grove ill give miltiades this much he sounded genuinely regretful ill do it i said then we do it together aristides said he looked at his men the frontrankers of his tribe we need to do this he said quietly we broke we must find our honour in the grove miltiades nodded curtly go with the gods get it done and follow me he took his hyperetes and began to walk across the fields the boy at his side blew his trumpet and all across the field athenians and plataeans looked up from their fatigue summoned back to the phalanx many of my plataeans were right there perhaps a hundred men they were a mix of front and rearrankers the best and the worst and the athenians were in the same state although there were more of them and they had more armour and better weapons mind you the plataeans were working hard to remedy that stripping the persians at our feet they cant have many arrows left i said why not cleitus asked theyd be shooting us teucer answered aristides smiled a little sheepishly then he frowned you have a plan plataean i shrugged and the weight of my scale corslet seemed like the weight of the world even cleitus bloody cleitus who i hated looked at me waiting the truth is i didnt have enough energy to hate cleitus he was one more spear and a strong spear too so i raised my eyes and looked at the grove the precinct wall was about half a man tall of loose stones but well built and beyond the wall the grove climbed a low hill completely inside the wall of course it was a virtually impregnable position seems to me theyre as tired as we are and their side lost nothing for them now but death or slavery i was buying time waiting for athena or heracles to put something in my head besides the black despair that comes after a long fight i remember i walked a little apart not really to think but because the weight of their expectations was greater than the weight of my scale thorax and my aspis combined and i wanted to be free of it for a moment and it was as if a goddess came and whispered in my ear except that i still fancy it was aphrodite whose hymn had been on my lips when i fell asleep because i turned my head and there it was i put my helmet back on my head and my shield on my arm i was only a few steps from the others i see a way to distract them and save some fighting i think you athenians should go for them right over the wall at the low point by the gate the rest of us you see the little dip in the ground there i nodded my head dont point if fifty of us go there up that little gully i doubt theyll see us coming the rest of you form up twenty shields wide and ten deep when we hit the grove well you come at the gate and its every man for himself aristides nodded if they see you coming youll be shot to pieces he said then wed best hope theyre low on arrows i said no time for anything fancy someone shouted can we fire the grove no time i said in truth it was the best solution let me tell you something young man i believe in the gods one of them had just shown me the gully and that olive grove was sacred to artemis and the gods had stood by me all day to me this was the test it is always the test of battle how good are you when you are wounded and tired thats when you find out who is truly a hero my children anyone can stand their ground with a full belly and clean muscles but at the end of day when the rim of the sun touches the hills and you havent had water for hours and flies are laying eggs in your wounds think on it because hundreds of us were measured and by heracles we were worthy of our fathers you man enough for this plataean cleitus asked but his voice was merely chiding almost friendly fuck off i said equally friendly lets get to it aeschylus said he put the edge of his aspis between cleitus and me this isnt about you cleitus i remember that i smiled cleitus i said softly and he met my eye today is for the medes i said i offered my hand he took it and clasped it hard aeschylus nodded i ask to be the first into the grove he said for my brother athenians and aristocrats not a scrap of sense so the athenians formed a deep block the width of the low wall behind the screen they provided i took my plataeans household first in a pair of long files and ran off to the south around the edge of the low hill i pushed my legs to do their duty i think run may be a poor description of the shambling jog we managed but we did it we ran around the edge of the hill and there was the entry to the gully as id expected that gully wasnt as deep as a man is tall but it was shaped oddly with a small bend just before the west wall of the grove and i trusted my guess and led my men forward still in a file the persians had formed a line not to be honest a very thick line facing aristides small phalanx we could see them and by a miracle they still hadnt seen us it was well miraculous but on the battlefield men die because they see what they expect to see then aristides and aeschylus led their men forward they were so tired that they didnt cheer or sing the paean but simply trotted forward and all the persians shot into them the clatter of the arrows on their shields and the solid impacts drowned the sound of our movement form your front i called softly but my men needed no order the men behind me started to sprint forward i didnt slow the neatness of our line was immaterial and by the gods aphrodite was there or some other goddess lifting us to one more fight raising us above ourselves two or three times in my life ive felt this and it is beyond the human and at marathon every one of us at the grove felt it i was at the edge of the gully and it sloped steeply up head height to the base of the stone wall the persians had assumed this part was too tricky for us to storm i was first i ran up the gully lip and at the top a persian shot me his arrow smacked into my aspis at pointblank range and then i was past him over the wall in a single leap and a flood of plataeans poured in behind me i have no idea who killed that man or to be honest how i got over the wall but we were in past the wall among the trees i crashed into the end of the persian line most of them never saw us coming so focused were they on aristides and his men to their front they died hard when they stood we slew them and when they ran some in panic more just to find a better place to die we chased them tree to tree those with arrows shot us and those without protected the archers some had spears and a few had aspides theyd picked up from our dead and many had axes and they fought like heroes no man who survived the fight in the olive grove ever forgot it desperate cornered men are no longer human they are animals and they will grasp the sword in their guts and hold on to it if it will help a mate kill you the fight eventually filled the whole grove and some of them must have climbed the trees certainly the arrow that killed teucer came from above straight down into the top of his shoulder by his neck and alcaeus of miletus who had come all this way to die for athens went down fighting his aspis against two axemen and i was just too far away to save him a persian broke my spear dying on it and another clambered over his body and his short sword rang off my scales but didnt go through or id have died there myself i put my arms around him and threw him to the ground rolled on top of him to crush him got my hands on his throat and choked the life out of him thats the last moment in the battle i remember i must have got back on my feet but i dont remember how and then i was back to back with idomeneus but the fighting was over the fighting was over all the persians were dead idomeneus sank to the ground im done he said i had never heard those words from him and never did again that was marathon equally to be honest i remember nothing of the march over the mountains to athens in the dark save that there was a storm brewing out over the ocean and the breeze of that storm blew over us like the touch of a womans cool hand when you are sick i must have given some orders because there were nighon eight hundred plataeans when we came down the hills above athens to the sanctuary of heracles and as each contingent came up miltiades met them in person that part i remember he was still in full armour and he glowed perhaps that night he was divine certainly it was his will that got us safely over the mountains and back to the plains of attica the plataeans were the last to leave marathon apart from aristides tribe who stayed to guard the loot and the last to arrive at the shrine of heracles and as we came in not marching but shuffling along in a state of exhaustion the sun began to rise over the sea and the first glow caught the temples on the acropolis in the distance weve made it friends miltiades said to each contingent men littered the ground shields were dropped like olives in an autumn wind as if our army had been beaten rather than victorious my men were no different without a word men fell to the ground later hermogenes told me that he fell asleep before he got his aspis off his arm i didnt like miltiades i was too tired to sleep and i stood with him as the sun rose revealing the persian fleet still well off to the east even if they came now he said phidippides made it see the beacon on the acropolis i could see a smudge of smoke in the dawn light i nodded heavily by athena miltiades said he stood as straight as a spearshaft despite his fatigue he laughed and looked out into the morning we won you should rest i said miltiades laughed again he slapped my back grinned ear to ear and for a moment he was not ancient and used up he was the pirate king i had known as a boy i wont waste this moment in the arms of sleep arimnestos he said he embraced me i remember grinning because few things were ever as precious to me as the love of miltiades despite the bastards way with money power and fame sleep would not be a waste i said he shook his head arimnestos right now this moment i am with the gods he said it plain no rhetoric and he wasnt talking to a thousand men feeding on their adulation i honestly think every man in our army was asleep but us no he was telling the plain truth to one man and that man was me i remember that i didnt understand i do now but i was too young and for all my scars and the blood on my sword arm too inexperienced he laughed again and it was a fell sound i have beaten the persians at the gates of my city i have won a victory such a victory he shrugged since troy he said and burst into tears we stood together i cried too thugater i cried and the sun rose on the persian fleet turning away in defeat many men were dead and many more would die but we had beaten the great kings army and the world would never be the same again truly in that hour we were with the gods epilogue a day later the spartans marched in on the road from corinth their armour was magnificent and their scarlet cloaks billowed in the west wind and the head of their column was just in time to see the last of the barbarian fleet as it turned away from the channel by salamis and started back for naxos they marched over the mountains to marathon and saw the barbarian dead and then they marched back to athens to shower us with praise i think most of the bastards were jealous many men died at marathon my friends and men who had followed me and worse awaited me at home although i didnt know it as soon as our lightly wounded could walk i took our men back over the mountains to plataea we still feared that thebes might move against us indeed athens sent us a thousand hoplites to accompany us home to show thebes that they had backed the wrong horse athens could not do enough for us to this day thugater the priestess of athena blesses plataea every morning in her first prayer and within the year we were made citizens of athens with the same citizen rights as aristides and miltiades so that all those freed slaves were able if they wished to go back to athens as free men we came down the long flank of cithaeron three thousand men new citizens and old and the valley of the asopus was laid out before us the fields like the finest tapestry a woman could weave in soft colours of gold and pale green at the shrine of the hero idomeneus halted his men those who had survived and we embraced good fight he said with his mad grin we poured libations for the hero probably hundreds it is odd but one of my memories of that autumn day is the wine lying in pools before the heros tomb i had never seen so many libations poured there and the image of wine filling the wagon ruts is to me one of the strongest i associate with marathon we did not commit hubris we gave thanks then we went down into the lengthening shadows of the valley and we halted under our own walls and formed the phalanx one more time thousands of citizens came out to see us indeed theyd known we were coming when the first glint of bronze was seen on the passes and runners had long since brought them the tale of the battle and the number and names of the dead we formed one last time and myron came out of the phalanx i took off my helmet and handed him my spear we are no longer at war i said i was the archon of war and i return my spear he took it plataeans he said i return you to your city at peace and they cheered the hoplites and the new citizens and the women and children and even the slaves it would be good if i could leave it there pour me a little more wine i looked around for euphoria i hadnt really expected her as she would have been in her ninth month but i saw neither hermogenes wife nor my sister i remember that antigonus and i stood together and i had a joke at the edge of my tongue about how for the first time we were timely and our wives were late before i could make that cruel jibe one of my thracians the men id freed came on to the field of ares he told us his news tears running down his cheeks to be honest i dont remember anything after that until i stood by her bedside i had missed her by perhaps three hours there was blood enough blood that she might have died at marathon she had fought her own fight a long one and she had not surrendered or given way she stood her ground until the very end and pushed our child out and died for it i told her you were coming pen told me she held me tightly against her and i felt nothing but the fatigue and the crushing lack of emotion that had dogged me since we stormed the olive grove i told her and she held my hand oh pen wept antigonus wept i felt as if i had been wrapped in thick wool i drank some wine and later i lay on some blankets my eyes open then my choices made i got to my feet i lifted her she weighed nothing and carried her outside to the stable i took a horse no great crime with a brotherinlaw and i carried her body across my lap as i had carried her over the mountains when first she was my bride i carried her home of course there was nothing left of my home but the forge cleitus and simon had burned my house i laid her on the work table in my forge and i put everything on her every jewel mater had saved from the house every piece of loot i had taken from marathon or been given by thankful athenians until she glittered like a goddess then i lit my forge i prayed to hephaestus and i lit my torch from my forge fire then i set my forge ablaze and i left it to burn as her pyre it burned behind me bright as a new sun i rode down the hill away from the farm and the fire i rode steadily until i heard the crash as the rooftree gave and the whoosh as the rest of the building leaped into new flame and then i pressed my horse to a gallop and rode away i never promised you a happy story if i tell you more if i tell you more thugater it will be another night and then ill tell you how i broke the mould of my life and cast it away how i went with miltiades and then to sicily and left greece behind me for now though leave an old man to weep old tears so many dead and only me to sing of them now i am the last but remember when you pray to the gods that men stood like the heroes of old at marathon and were better and that they are still no better than the women who bear them wine historical afterword as closely as possible this novel follows the road of history but history especially archaic greek history can be more like a track in the forest than a road with a kerb i have attempted to make sense of herodotus and his curiously modern tale of nation states betrayal terrorism and heroism i have read most of the secondary sources and i have found most of them wanting the persians were not bad the greeks were not good and since both cultures grew from the same roots western civilization would probably have been much the same had the persians remained the world empire or so i believe and yet and yet the complex web of decisions betrayals and conspiracies in herodotus somehow gave birth to the first real attempt at democracy at least the first of which we know i have done my best to make this element of the story as essential as the fighting to try and show how the small men gained political power despite the overwhelming power of landowners and an ancient aristocracy it is nothing but facile error to see athenian democracy as bearing any resemblance to the united states great britain or any other modern democracy except in the most general way there were no middleclass hoplites in the front ranks aristocrats led the demos in every walk of life and at war they served in front in their superior armour with their superior training and the evidence for this is on every page of the literature and only the most pigheaded mythmaking can ignore it in the period of which i write the phalanx as we now imagine it was just being born indeed one possible reading of herodotus would suggest that the phalanx was born at marathon archers and lightarmed men still served in the front lines and heroic aristocrats still fought duels or so the art and literature suggest however the idea is disliked by current historians especially military historians in fact there were few middleclass hoplites because our modern notions of class didnt exist a poor man like socrates might still be an aristocrat to his finger ends a rich man like the former slave who gave a thousand aspides to support the rearming of athens in the fourth century remained a former slave unless the term middle class has no other meaning than to stand as a group between the poor and the rich it cant be made to apply and finally or perhaps first it may be that only the veterans among my readers will know the truth that military historians often cannot stomach that all races and breeds are equally brave or cowardly regardless of government loyalty race creed or sexual preference that all men lose combat effectiveness with fatigue and confusion that only a few men are killers and they are supremely dangerous really friends it is all in the iliad and when my inspiration failed i always went back to the iliad like a man returning to the source of pure water i have enormous respect for the modern works of many historians classical and modern but they werent there i have seen war never the war of the spear and shield but war and when i read the iliad it comes to me as being true not perhaps true about troy but true about war homer did not love war achilles is not the best man in the iliad war is ugly arimnestos of plataea was a real man i hope that ive done him justice
