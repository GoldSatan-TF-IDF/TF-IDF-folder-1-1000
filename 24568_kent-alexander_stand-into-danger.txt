alexander kent stand into danger bolitho far away where sky met sea a majestic figure grew pushed along by royal decree her aggressive pennants flew blazing red dark plumes of grey destruction overall as shot and grape found its way into a human wall from a mariners tale by daniel byrne welcome aboard richard bolitho thrust some coins into the hand of the man who had carried his seachest to the jetty and shivered in the damp air it was halfway through the forenoon and yet much of the land and the sprawling houses of plymouth were hidden in drifting mist no wind at all to speak of so that the mist made everything look eerie and dismal bolitho squared his shoulders and stared across the swirling water of the hamoaze as he did so he felt the unfamiliar touch of his lieutenants uniform which like everything in his seachest was new the white lapels of his coat the cocked hat set squarely across his black hair even his breeches and shoes had come from the same shop in falmouth in his own county just across the river from the tailor whose family had been making clothing for sea officers since anyone could remember it should be his proudest moment all he had worked and hoped for that first seemingly impossible step from midshipmans berth to wardroom to become a kings officer he tugged his hat more firmly across his forehead as if to make himself believe it it was his proudest moment be you joinin th destiny zur bolitho saw that the man who had carried the chest was still beside him in the dull light he looked poor and ragged but there was no mistaking what he had once been a seaman bolitho said yes shes lying out there somewhere the man followed his glance across the water his eyes faraway fine frigate zur only three years old she be he nodded sadly shes bin fittin out for months some say for a long voyage bolitho thought of this man and all the hundreds like him who roamed the shorelines and harbours looking for work yearning for the sea which theyd once cursed and damned with the best of them but this was february and to all accounts england had been at peace for years wars still erupted around the world of course but always in the name of trade or selfpreservation only the old enemies remained the same content to bide their time to seek out the weakness which might one day be exploited ships and men once worth their weight in gold were cast aside the vessels to rot the seamen like this ragged figure with all the fingers missing from one hand and a scar on his cheek as deep as a knife left without the means to live bolitho asked what were you in astonishingly the man seemed to expand and straighten his back as he answered th torbay zur capn keppel just as quickly he slumped down again any chance of a berth in your ship zur bolitho shook his head im new i dont know the state aboard destiny as yet the man sighed ill call e a boat then zur he put his good hand in his mouth and gave a piercing whistle there was an answering clatter of oars in the mist and very slowly a watermans boat nudged towards the jetty bolitho called destiny if you please then he turned to give some more coins to his ragged companion but he had vanished into the mist like a ghost gone perhaps to join all the others bolitho clambered into the boat and drew his new cloak around him his sword gripped between his legs the waiting was done it was no longer the day after tomorrow and then tomorrow it was now the boat dipped and gurgled in a crosscurrent the oarsman watching bolitho with little enthusiasm another young luff going to make some poor jacks life hell he thought he wondered if the young officer with the grave features and black hair tied to the nape of his neck was so new he would not know the proper watermans fare but then again this one had a west country touch in his voice and even if he was a foreigner from across the border in cornwall he would not be fooled bolitho went over all that he had discovered about his new ship three years old the ragged man had said he would know all plymouth probably pondered over the care which was being taken to equip and man a frigate in these hard times twentyeight guns fast and agile destiny was what most young officers dreamed of in time of war free of the fleets apron strings swifter than any larger vessel and more heavily armed than anything smaller a frigate was a force to be reckoned with better hopes of promotion too and if you were lucky enough ever to reach the lofty peak of command so too would a frigate offer the chance of action and prizemoney bolitho thought of his last ship the seventyfourgun gorgon huge slowmoving a teeming world of people miles of rigging vast spans of canvas and the spars to carry it it was also a schoolroom where the young midshipmen learned how to control and sustain their unwieldy charge and they learned the hard way bolitho looked up as the waterman said should be seeing her about now sir bolitho peered ahead glad of the interruption to his thoughts as his mother had said when he had left her in the big grey house at falmouth put it behind you dick you cannot bring him back so take care of yourself now the sea is no place for the unwary the mist darkened and edged aside as the anchored ship loomed into view the boat was approaching her starboard bow and past the long tapering jibboom like bolithos new uniform on the wet jetty the destiny seemed to shine through the drifting murk from her lithe black and buff hull to her three mastheads she was a thoroughbred all her shrouds and standing rigging were freshly blacked down her yards crossed and each sail neatly furled to match its neighbour bolitho raised his eyes to the figurehead as it reached out as if to greet him it was the most beautiful one he had ever seen a barebreasted girl with her outthrust arm pointing to the next horizon in her hand she held the victors crown of laurels only the laurels and her unwavering blue stare had been inserted to break her white purity the waterman said between pulls they say that the woodcarver used his young bride to copy for that sir he showed his teeth in what might have been a grin i reckon he had to fight a few away from her bolitho watched the frigate slipping past the boat the occasional activity on her nearest gangway and high above the deck she was a beautiful ship he was lucky boat ahoy the waterman bawled in reply aye aye bolitho saw some movement at the entry port but not enough to excite much attention the watermans answer to the challenge had said it all an officer was joining the ship but nobody senior enough to bother about let alone her captain bolitho stood up as two seamen leapt into the boat to help make fast and to collect his chest bolitho glanced at them quickly he was not fully eighteen years old but he had been at sea since he was twelve and had learned to assess and measure the skills of sailormen they looked tough and hardy but the hull of a ship could hide a lot the sweepings of jails and assize courts being sent to sea to serve the king rather than face deportation or a hangmans halter the seamen stood aside in the pitching boat as bolitho handed the oarsman some money the man pushed it into his jerkin and grinned thankee sir good luck bolitho climbed up the frigates tumblehome and stepped through the entry port he was astonished at the difference even though hed been expecting it after a ship of the line the destiny seemed crowded to a point of confusion from the twenty pounders on her gun deck to the smaller weapons further aft every inch of space seemed to have a purpose and to be in use neatly flaked lines halliards and braces tiered boats and racks of pikes at the foot of each mast while in and around every item were men he must soon know by name a lieutenant stepped through the side party and asked mr bolitho bolitho replaced his hat aye sir come aboard to join the lieutenant nodded curtly follow me ill have your gear taken aft he said something to a seaman and then shouted mr timbrell put some more hands in the foretop it was like bedlam up there when i last inspected it bolitho just remembered in time to duck his head as they walked aft beneath the quarterdeck again the ship appeared to be crowding in on him more guns firmly tethered behind each sealed port the aromas of tar and cordage fresh paint and crowded humanity the smells of a living vessel he tried to assess the lieutenant who was leading him aft to the wardroom slim and roundfaced with that harassed look of a man left in charge here we are the lieutenant opened a screen door and bolitho stepped into his new home even with the black muzzled twelvepounders along one side a reminder if one was needed that there was no place in a shipofwar which was safe when the iron began to fly it looked surprisingly comfortable a long table with highbacked chairs instead of benches like those endured by lowly midshipmen there were racks for drinking glasses others for swords and pistols and on the deck there was a covering of painted canvas the lieutenant turned and studied bolitho thoughtfully im stephen rhodes second lieutenant he smiled the change making him more youthful than bolitho had realized as this is your first ship as lieutenant ill try to make the way as easy as i can call me stephen if you wish but sir in front of the hands rhodes threw back his head and yelled poad a scrawny little man in a blue jacket bustled through a screen door some wine poad this is the new third lieutenant poad bobbed pleasure sir im sure as he hurried away rhodes remarked good servant but lightfingered so dont leave anything too valuable lying about he became serious again the first lieutenant is in plymouth doing something or other his name is charles palliser and might seem a bit stiff at first meeting hes been in destiny with the captain from her first commissioning he changed tack suddenly you were lucky to get this appointment it sounded like an accusation youre so young im twentythree and was only promoted to second lieutenant when my predecessor was killed killed rhodes grimaced hell it was nothing heroic he was thrown off a horse and broke his neck good fellow in many ways but there it is bolitho watched the wardroom servant putting goblets and a bottle within rhodes reach he said i was surprised to get this appointment myself rhodes eyed him searchingly you dont sound too sure dont you want to join us god man there are a hundred who would jump at the chance bolitho looked away a bad beginning its not that my best friend was killed a month back it was out in the open i just cant believe it rhodes eyes softened and he pushed a glass towards him drink this richard i didnt understand sometimes i wonder why we do this work when others live easily ashore bolitho smiled at him except for his mothers benefit he had not smiled much lately what are our orders er stephen rhodes relaxed nobody really knows except the lord and master a long haul to the southrd is all i do know the caribbean maybe further still he shivered and glared at the nearest gunport god ill be glad to see the back of this wet misery here he took a quick swallow weve a good company for the most part but with the usual seasoning of gallowsbirds the sailing master mr gulliver is newly promoted from masters mate but hes a fine navigator even if he is a bit awkward amongst his betters by tonight we shall have a full complement of midshipmen two of whom are twelve and thirteen respectively he grinned but dont be slack with em richard just because you were one yourself a dogwatch ago your head will be on the block not theirs rhodes tugged a watch from his breeches first lieutenant will be coming off shortly i had better chase up the hands he likes a smart display when he steps aboard he pointed to a small screened cabin that one is yours richard tell poad what you need and he will get the other servants to deal with it impulsively he thrust out his hand good to have you with us welcome aboard bolitho sat in the empty wardroom listening to the clatter of blocks and rigging the unending slap of feet above his head hoarse voices the occasional trill of a boatswains call as a piece of gear was piped up from a boat alongside to be stored and checked into its own special place in the hull soon bolitho would know their faces their strengths and weaknesses and in this lowbeamed wardroom he would share his hopes and daily life with his fellows the two other lieutenants the marine officer the newly appointed sailing master the surgeon and the purser the select few in a company which was listed as being souls he had wanted to ask the second lieutenant about the lord and master as he had described him bolitho was very young for his rank but not so much that he did not know it would have been wrong to share a confidence and to give a personal opinion of destinys captain would be little short of madness from rhodes point of view when he had only just met the new arrival bolitho opened the door of his tiny cabin about the length of the swinging cot and enough room to sit down a place for privacy or as near to it as one could get in a small bustling manofwar after the midshipmans berth on the orlop deck it was a palace his advancement had been very swift as rhodes had remarked but for all that if the unknown lieutenant had not been killed by a fall from his horse the vacancy for third lieutenant would not have been posted bolitho unlocked the top half of his seachest and then hung a mirror on one of the massive timbers beside his cot he looked at himself seeing the small lines of strain around his mouth and grey eyes he was leaner too honed down to a youthful toughness which only shipboard food and hard work could produce poad peered at him i could pay a waterman to go into town and purchase some extra victuals for you sir bolitho smiled poad was like a stallholder at a cornish fair i have some coming aboard directly thank you he saw the disappointment and added but if you see that its stowed properly ill be obliged poad nodded quickly and scuttled away he had made his play bolithos reaction had been the right one there would be payment somewhere along the way if poad looked after the new lieutenants personal stores a door crashed open and a tall lieutenant strode into the wardroom hurling his hat on one of the guns and yelling for poad in one breath he examined bolitho very slowly his eyes taking in everything from his hair to his new buckled shoes he said im palliser the senior he had a crisp way of speaking he glanced away as poad ran through the door with a jug of wine bolitho watched the first lieutenant curiously he was very tall so that he had to stoop between the deckhead beams in his late twenties but with the experience of a man far older he and bolitho wore the same uniform but they were so far apart they could have been standing on either side of an abyss soyoure bolitho the eyes swivelled back towards him above the rim of the goblet you have a fair report in words that is well this is a frigate mr bolitho not some overmanned thirdrate i need every officer and man working until this ship my ship is ready to weigh another fierce swallow so report on deck if you please take the launch and get yourself ashore you must know the lie of the land around here eh he gave a fleeting smile lead a recruiting party to the west bank and examine those villages little gunners mate will assist he understands the game there are some posters you can put up at the inns as you go we need about twenty sound hands no rubbish we are up to full complement but at the end of a long passage thats another matter we shall lose a few have no doubt of it anyway the captain wants it done bolitho had been thinking of unpacking of meeting his companions of having a meal after the long coach journey from falmouth to settle things quite firmly palliser said offhandedly this is tuesday be back aboard noon on friday dont lose any of your party and dont let them pull the wool over your eyes he banged out of the wardroom calling for somebody else rhodes appeared in the open door and smiled sympathetically hard luck richard but his manner is rougher than his thoughts he has picked a good shoreparty for you ive known some first lieutenants who would give a new junior a collection of moonstruck felons for company just to give him hell when he returned he winked mr palliser intends to have a command of his own soon bear that in mind at all times as i do it helps considerably bolitho smiled id better go at once in that case he hesitated and thank you for making me welcome rhodes sank down in a chair and thought about the noon meal he heard the clatter of oars alongside and the shout of the launchs coxswain what he had seen of bolitho he liked young certainly but with the restless quality of one who would do well in a tight corner or in a screaming hurricane it was strange how you never considered the worries and problems of your betters when you were a midshipman a lieutenant junior or not was a kind of superior being one who berated and was quick to find fault with the youthful beginners now he knew better even palliser was frightened of the captain probably the lord and master was terrified of upsetting his admiral or someone higher still rhodes smiled but for a few more precious moments there was peace little the gunners mate stood back his broad hands on where his hips should have been and watched as one of his men tacked up another recruiting poster bolitho pulled out his watch and looked across the village green as a church clock chimed midday little said gruffly mebbee time for a wet sir bolitho sighed another day after a sleepless night in a tiny none too clean inn where he worried that his small recruiting party might desert in spite of what rhodes had said about their selection but little had made sure that part had gone well he was totally at odds with his name squat overweight even gross so that his belly sagged heavily over his cutlass belt like a sack how he managed it on pursers rations was a marvel but he was a good hand seasoned and experienced and would stand no nonsense bolitho said one more stop little then he gave a rueful smile ill buy you all a drink they brightened up immediately six seamen a marine corporal and two drummer boys who looked like toy soldiers freshly out of a box they did not care about the miserable results of their trek from one village to the next usually the sight of bolithos party aroused little interest except amongst the children and a few snapping dogs old habits died hard so near to the sea many still recalled the dreaded pressgangs when men could be torn from their families and put in a kings ship to suffer the harsh conditions of a war which few understood even now and a goodly number had never come back at all bolitho had managed to obtain four volunteers so far four and palliser was expecting twenty he had sent them back with an escort to the boat in case they should have a change of heart two of them were seamen but the others were labourers from a farm who had lost their jobs unfairly they both said bolitho suspected they were willing to volunteer for a more pressing reason but it was no time to ask questions they tramped across the deserted green the muddy grass splashing up from bolithos shoes and on to his new stockings little had already quickened his pace and bolitho wondered if he had done the right thing to offer them all a drink he shrugged inwardly so far nothing had gone right matters could hardly get much worse little hissed there be some men sir he rubbed his big hands together and said to the corporal now dipper get your little lads to strike up a tune eh the two minute marines waited for their corporal to relay the order then while one beat a lively tap on his drum the other drew a fife from his crossbelt and broke into what sounded like a jig the corporals name was dyer bolitho asked why do you call him dipper little grinned baring several broken teeth the true mark of a fighter bless you sir cause he were a pickpocket afore he saw the light and joined the bullocks the little group of men by the inn seemed to melt away as the seamen and marines drew near two figures remained and a more incongruous pair it was hard to imagine one was small and darting with a sharp voice which carried easily above the fife and drum the other was big and powerful stripped to the waist his arms and fists hanging at his sides like weapons waiting to be used the small man a barker enraged earlier by the sudden departure of his audience saw the sailors and beckoned excitedly well well well wot ave we ere then sons of the sea the british jack tar he doffed his hat to bolitho an a real gentleman in command no doubt of that bolitho said wearily fall the men out little ill have the landlord send some ale and cheese the barker was shouting which one of you brave lads will stand up to this fighter of mine his eyes darted amongst them a guinea for the man who can stand two minutes against im the coin flashed between his fingers you dont ave to win my brave boys just stand and fight for two minutes he had their full attention now and bolitho heard the corporal murmur to little wot about it josh a ole bleedin guinea bolitho paused by the inn door and glanced at the prizefighter for the first time he looked as strong as ten and yet there was something despairing and pathetic about him he was not looking at any of the seamen but apparently staring into space his nose had been broken and his face showed the punishment of many fights country fairs for the farming gentry for anyone who would wager on seeing men fight for a bloody victory bolitho was not certain which one he despised more the man who lived off the fighter or the one who laid bets on his pain he said shortly i shall be inside little all at once the thought of a glass of ale or cider beckoned him like a wilful spirit little was already thinking of other things aye sir it was a friendly little inn and the landlord hurried to greet bolitho his head almost brushing the ceiling a fire burned brightly in its box and there was a smell of freshly baked bread and smoked hams you sit down there lieutenant ill see to your men presently he saw bolithos expression begging your pardon sir but youre wasting your time hereabouts the war took too many away to follow the drum an those what came back went elsewhere to the big towns like truro an exeter to get work he shook his head me now if i was twenty years younger i might have signed on he grinned then again some while later richard bolitho sat in a highbacked chair beside the fire the mud drying on his stockings his coat unbuttoned to allow for the excellent pie the landlords wife had brought for him a big elderly dog lay by his feet pulsating gently as it enjoyed the heat and dreamed of some past exploit the landlord whispered to his wife did you see him a kings officer no less lord he looks more like a boy bolitho stirred from his drowsiness and yawned then his arms froze in mid air as he heard loud shouts of anger interposed with laughter he jumped to his feet groping for his sword and hat and trying to button his coat at the same time he almost ran to the door and when he stumbled into the keen air he saw the seamen and marines falling against each other convulsed with laughter while the little barker screamed you cheated you must ave cheated little spun the gold guinea and caught it deftly in his palm not me matey fair an square thats josh little bolitho snapped whats going on corporal dyer said between gasps of laughter e put the big prizefighter on is back sir never seen the like bolitho glared at little ill speak to you later now fall the men in weve miles to go to the next village he swung round and stared with astonishment as the barker turned on the fighter the latter was standing as before as if he had never moved let alone been knocked down the barker picked up a length of chain and screamed this is for yer bloody stupidity the chain slashed across the mans naked back this is for losin my money crack little glanced at bolitho uneasily ere sir ill give the bugger is money ill not see that poor devil beaten like a cur bolitho swallowed hard the big fighter could have killed his tormentor with one blow perhaps he had been on the way down for so long he no longer felt pain or anything else but it was more than enough for bolitho his bad beginning aboard destiny his failure to find the required volunteers were all he could take this degrading sight tipped the balance completely you there belay that bolitho strode forward watched with both awe and amusement by his men put down that chain at once the barker quailed and then quickly regained his earlier confidence he had nothing to fear from a young lieutenant especially in a district where he was often paid for his services ive me rights little snarled let me andle the bugger sir ill give im bloody rights it was all getting out of hand some villagers had appeared too and bolitho had a mental picture of his men having a pitched battle with half the countryside before they could get to the launch he turned his back on the defiant barker and faced up to the fighter near to he was even bigger but in spite of his size and strength bolitho saw only his eyes each of which was partly hidden by lids battered shapeless over the years you know who i am the man nodded slowly his gaze fixed on bolithos mouth as if he was reading every word gently bolitho asked will you volunteer for the kings service join the frigate destiny at plymouth he hesitated seeing the painful understanding in the mans eyes with me then just as slowly as before he nodded and without a glance at the gaping barker he picked up his shirt and a small bag bolitho turned to the barker his anger matched only by his feeling of petty triumph once clear of the village he would release the fighter anyway the barker yelled you cant do that little stepped forward threateningly stow the noise matey an show respect for a kings officer or he left the rest in little doubt bolitho licked his lips fall in men corporal take charge there he saw the big fighter watching the seamen and called your name what is it stockdale sir even the name was dragged out his chords must have been mangled in so many fights that even his voice was broken bolitho smiled at him stockdale i shall not forget you you will be free to leave us whenever you wish he glanced meaningly at little before we reach the boat stockdale looked calmly at the little barker who was sitting on a bench the chain still dangling from his hand then he wheezed very carefully no sir ill not leave you not now not never bolitho watched him join up with the others the mans obvious sincerity was strangely moving little said quietly youve no need to worry thisll be all round the ship in no time he leaned forward so that bolitho could smell the ale and cheese im in your division sir an ill beat the block off any bugger who tries to make trouble a shaft of watery sunlight played across the church clock and as the recruiting party marched stoically towards the next village bolitho was glad of what he had just done then it began to rain and he heard little say not much further dipper then back to the ship for a wet bolitho looked at stockdales broad shoulders another volunteer that made five in all he lowered his head against the rain fifteen to go the next village was even worse especially as there was no inn and the local farmer only allowed them to sleep for the night in an unused barn and that was with obvious reluctance he claimed his house was full of visitors and anyway that word anyway spoke volumes the barn leaked in a dozen places and stank like a sewer and the sailors like most of their kind used to the enforced cleanliness of living in close quarters were loud voiced in their discontent bolitho could not blame them and when corporal dyer came to tell him that the volunteer stockdale had vanished he replied im not surprised corporal but keep an eye on the rest of the party he thought about the missing stockdale for a long time and wondered at his own sense of loss perhaps stockdales simple words had touched him more deeply than he had realized that he had represented a change of luck like a talisman little exclaimed god almighty look at this stockdale dripping with rain stepped into the lantern light and placed a sack at bolithos feet the men crowded round as the treasures were revealed in the yellow glow some chickens fresh bread and crocks of butter half a meat pie and more to the point two big jars of cider little gasped you two men start plucking the chickens you thomas watch out for unwanted visitors he faced stockdale and thrust out the guinea ere matey you take it youve bloody earned it stockdale barely heard as he bent over his sack he wheezed no twere is money you keep it to bolitho he said this is for you sir he held out a bottle which looked like brandy it made sense the farmer was probably mixed up with the smuggling trade hereabouts stockdale watched bolithos face searchingly then he added ill make you comfortable you see bolitho saw him moving about amongst the busy seamen as if he had been doing it all his life little said quietly reckon you can stop frettin now sir old stockdale will be worth fifteen men all on his bloody own by my reckonin bolitho drank some of the brandy the grease from a chicken leg running unheeded across the cuff of his new shirt he had learned a lot today not least about himself his head lolled and he did not feel stockdale remove the cup from his fingers and there was always tomorrow leave the past behind bolitho pulled himself up the destinys side and raised his hat to the quarterdeck gone was the mist and dull cloud and the houses of plymouth beyond the hamoaze seemed to be preening themselves in hard sunshine he felt stiff and tired from tramping from village to village dirty from sleeping in barn and inn alike and the sight of his six recruits being mustered and then led forward by the masteratarms did little to raise his spirits the sixth volunteer had come up to the recruiting party less than an hour before they had reached the longboat a neat unseamanlike figure aged about thirty who said he was an apothecarys assistant but needed to gain experience on a long voyage so that he might better himself it was as unlikely a story as that of the two farm labourers but bolitho was too weary to care ah i see you are back mr bolitho the first lieutenant was standing at the quarterdeck rail his tall figure framed against the washedout sky his arms were folded and he had obviously been watching the new arrivals from the moment the returning launch had been challenged in his crisp voice he added lay aft if you please bolitho climbed to the larboard gangway and made his way to the quarterdeck his companion of three days the gunners mate little was already bustling down a ladder going to take a wet with his mates no doubt he was lost amongst his own world below decks leaving bolitho once more a stranger little different from the moment he had first stepped aboard he confronted the first lieutenant and touched his hat palliser looked composed and extremely neat which made bolitho feel even more like a vagrant bolitho said six hands sir the big man was a fighter and should be a welcome addition the last one worked for an apothecary in plymouth his words seemed to be falling like stones palliser had not moved and the quarterdeck was unnaturally quiet bolitho ended it was the best i could do sir palliser pulled out his watch good well the captain has come aboard in your absence he asked to see you the moment you returned bolitho stared at him he had been expecting the heavens to fall six men instead of twenty and one of those would never make a sailor palliser snapped down the guard of his watch and regarded bolitho coolly has the long sojourn ashore rendered you hard of hearing the captain wishes to see you that does not mean now aboard this ship it means the moment that the captain thought of it bolitho looked ruefully at his muddy shoes and stockings i im sorry sir i thought you said palliser was already looking elsewhere his eyes busy on some men working on the forecastle i told you to obtain twenty men had i ordered you to bring six how many would you have found two none at all surprisingly he smiled six will do very well now be off to the captain pork pie today so be sharp about your business or therell be none left he turned on his heel yelling mr slade what are those idlers doing damn your eyes bolitho ran dazedly down the companion ladder and made his way aft faces loomed past him in the shadows between the decks voices fell silent as they watched him pass the new lieutenant going to see the captain what is he like too easy or too hard a marine stood with his musket by his side swaying slightly as the ship tugged at her anchor his eyes glittered in the lantern which spiralled from the deckhead as it did night and day when the captain was in his quarters bolitho made an effort to straighten his neckcloth and push the rebellious hair from his forehead the marine gave him exactly five seconds and then rapped smartly on the deck with his musket third lieutenant sir the screen door opened and a wispyhaired man in a black coat probably the captains clerk gave bolitho an impatient beckoning gesture rather like a schoolmaster with a wayward pupil bolitho tucked his hat more firmly beneath his arm and entered the cabin after the rest of the ship it was spacious with a second screen separating the stern cabin from the dining space and what bolitho took to be the sleeping quarters the slanting stern windows which crossed the complete rear of the cabin shone in the sunlight giving an impression of warmth while the overhead beams and the various pieces of furniture rippled cheerfully in the seas reflections captain henry vere dumaresq had been leaning against the sill apparently peering down at the water but he turned with unusual lightness as bolitho entered through the dining space bolitho tried to appear calm and at ease but it was impossible the captain was like nobody he had ever seen his body was broad and thickset and his head stood straight on his shoulders as if he had no neck at all it was like the rest of the man powerful and giving an impression of immense strength little had said that dumaresq was only twentyeight years old but he looked ageless as if he had never changed and never would he walked to meet bolitho putting each foot down with forceful precision bolitho saw his legs made more prominent by his expensive white stockings the calves looked as thick as a mans thigh you appear somewhat knocked about mr bolitho dumaresq had a throaty resonant voice one which would carry easily in a full gale yet bolitho suspected it might also convey quiet sympathy he said awkwardly aye sir ii mean i was ashore with the recruiting party dumaresq pointed to a chair sit he raised his voice very slightly some claret it had the desired effect and almost immediately his servant was busily pouring wine into two beautifully cut glasses then just as discreetly he withdrew dumaresq sat down opposite bolitho barely a yard away his power and presence were unnerving bolitho recalled his last captain in the big seventyfour he had always been remote aloof from the happenings of wardroom and gunroom alike only at moments of crisis or ceremony had he made his presence felt and then as before always at a distance dumaresq said my father had the honour of serving with yours some years back how is he bolitho thought of his mother and sister in the house at falmouth waiting for captain james bolitho to return home his mother would be counting the days perhaps dreading how he might have changed he had lost an arm in india and when his ship had been paid off he had been told he was to be placed on the retired list indefinitely bolitho said he is due home sir but with an arm gone and no chance to remain in the kings service im not certain what will become of him he broke off startled that he had spoken his thoughts aloud but dumaresq gestured to the glass drink mr bolitho and speak as you will its more important that i should know you than you should care for my views it seemed to amuse him it comes to all of us we must consider ourselves fortunate indeed to have her his head swivelled round as he looked at the cabin he was speaking of the ship his ship as if he loved her more than anything bolitho said she is a fine vessel sir i am honoured to join her yes dumaresq leaned over to refill the glasses again he moved with catlike ease but used his strength like his voice sparingly he said i learned of your recent grief he raised one hand no not from anyone in this ship i have my own means and i like to know my officers just as i know my command we shall be sailing shortly on what may prove a rewarding voyage then again it may be fruitless either way it will not be easy we must put old memories behind us reserve not forget them this is a small ship and each man in her has a part to play you have served under some distinguished captains and you obviously learned well from your service but in a frigate there are few passengers and a lieutenant is not one of them you will make mistakes and i will allow for that but misuse your authority and i will fall upon you like a wall of rock you must avoid making favourites for they will end up using you if you are not careful he chuckled as he studied bolithos grave features there is more to being a lieutenant than growing up the people will look to you when they are in trouble and you will have to act as you think best those other days ended when you quit the midshipmans berth in a small ship there is no room for friction you have to become a part of her dyou see bolitho found himself sitting on the edge of his chair this strange man gripped his attention like a vice his eyes set wide apart equally compelling insistent bolitho nodded yes sir i do dumaresq looked up as two bells chimed out from forward go and have your meal ive no doubt youre hungry mr pallisers crafty schemes for recruiting new hands usually bring an appetite if nothing more as bolitho rose to his feet dumaresq added quietly this voyage will be important to a lot of people our midshipmen are mostly from influential parents who are eager to see they get a chance to distinguish themselves when most of the fleet is rotting or laid up inordinary our professional warrant officers are excellent and there is a strong backbone of prime seamen the rest will learn one last thing mr bolitho and i trust i will not have to repeat it in destiny loyalty is paramount to me to this ship and to his britannic majesty in that order bolitho found himself outside the screen door his senses still reeling from the brief interview poad was hovering nearby bobbing excitedly all done sir ive ad yer gear stowed where itll be safe just like you ordered he led the way to the wardroom i managed to old up the meal til you was ready sir bolitho stepped into the wardroom and unlike the last time the place was noisy with chatter and seemingly full of people palliser stood up and said abruptly our new member gentlemen bolitho saw rhodes grinning at him and was glad of his friendly face he shook hands and murmured what he hoped was the right thing the sailing master julius gulliver was exactly as rhodes had described him ill at ease almost furtive john colpoys the lieutenant who commanded the ships marine contingent made a splash of scarlet as he shook bolithos hand and drawled charmed mdear fellah the surgeon was round and jollylooking like an untidy owl with a rich aroma of brandy and tobacco there was samuel codd the purser unusually cheerful for one of his trade bolitho thought and certainly no subject for a portrait he had very large upper teeth and a tiny receding chin so that it looked as if half of his face was successfully devouring the other colpoys said i hope you can play cards rhodes smiled give him a chance to bolitho he said hell have the shirt off your back if you let him bolitho sat down at the table next to the surgeon the latter placed some goldrimmed glasses on his nose they looked completely lost above his red cheeks he said pork pie a sure sign we are soon to leave here after thathe glanced at the purserwe will be back to meat from samuels stores most of it condemned some twenty years ago i daresay glasses clinked and the air became heady with steam and the smell of food bolitho looked along the table so this was what wardroom officers were like when out of sight of their subordinates rhodes whispered what did you make of him the captain bolitho thought about it trying to keep his memories in their proper order i was impressed he is so so rhodes beckoned poad to bring the wine jug ugly bolitho smiled different a bit frightening pallisers voice cut through the conversation you will inspect the ship when you have eaten richard truck to keel focsle to taffrail what you cannot understand ask me meet as many of the junior warrant officers as you can and memorize your own divisional list he dropped one eyelid to the marine but not quickly enough for bolitho to miss it i am certain he will wish to see that his men measure up to those he so skilfully brought us today bolitho looked down as a plate was thrust before him there was little of the actual plate left visible around the pile of food palliser had called him by his first name had even made a casual joke about the volunteers so these were the real men behind the stiff attitudes and the chain of command on the upper deck he raised his eyes and glanced along the table given a chance he would be happy amongst them he thought rhodes said between mouthfuls ive heard were sailing on mondays tide a fellow from the port admirals office was aboard yesterday he is usually right bolitho tried to remember what the captain had said loyalty shelve all else until there was time for it when it could do no damage dumaresq had almost echoed his mothers last words to him the sea is no place for the unwary feet clattered overhead and bolitho heard more heavy nets of stores being swayed inboard to the twitter of a call away from the land again from the hurt the sense of loss yes it would be good to go true to lieutenant rhodes information his britannic majestys ship destiny of twentyeight guns made ready to weigh anchor on the following monday morning the past few days had gone so swiftly for bolitho he thought life might be quieter at sea than it had been in harbour palliser had kept him working watchon watchoff with hardly a break the first lieutenant took nothing at face value and made a point of questioning bolitho on his daily work his opinions and suggestions for changing some of the men around on the watch and quarter bills if he was swift with his sarcasm palliser was equally quick to put his subordinates ideas to good use bolitho often thought of rhodes words about the first lieutenant after a command of his own he would certainly do his best for the ship and her captain and be doubly quick to stamp on any incompetence which might eventually be laid at his door and bolitho had worked hard to know the men he would deal with directly unlike the great ships of the line a frigates survival depended on her agility and not the thickness of her timbers likewise her company was divided into divisions where they could work with the best results for the ships benefit the foremast with all its spread of canvas course and topsails topgallants and royals with the additional foresails jib and flying jib provided the means to turn with haste through the winds eye if need be or to luff and cut across an enemys vulnerable stern at the opposite end of the ship the helmsmen and sailing master would use each mast each scrap of canvas to lay the vessel on the course required with the least need for manoeuvre bolitho was in charge of the mainmast the tallest in the ship it too was graded like the men who would soon be swarming aloft when ordered no matter how they felt or what the weather threw against them the nimble topmen were the cream of the company while on the deck itself working at braces and halliards and manning the capstan bars were the landmen the newly recruited or old sailors who could no longer be expected to fight salthardened canvas a hundred feet and more above the hull rhodes had the fore while a masters mate took charge of the mizzenmast supposedly the easiest one in any ship with its limited sail plan and where bodily strength was the first requirement the afterguard marines and a handful of seamen were sufficient to attend the mizzen bolitho made a point of meeting the boatswain a formidablelooking man named timbrell tall weatherbeaten and scarred like an ancient warrior he was the king of the vessels seamen once clear of the land timbrell would work under the first lieutenant to rectify storm damage repair spars and rigging maintain the paintwork ensure all the seams were free of leaks and generally keep an eye on the professionals who would carry out those needs the carpenter and his crew the cooper and the sailmaker the ropemaker and all the rest a seaman to his fingertips he was a good friend to a new officer but could be a bad enemy if provoked this particular monday morning had begun early before daybreak with the cook providing a hasty meal as if he too was conscious of the need to get under way lists were checked yet again names to match voices faces to put into jobs where they belonged to a landsman it would have looked like chaos with lines snaking across the decks men working aloft astride the great yards as they loosened the sails hardened overnight by an unexpected frost bolitho had seen the captain come on deck several times speaking with palliser or discussing something with gulliver the master if he was anxious he did not show it but strode around the quarterdeck with his surefooted tread like a man thinking of something else beyond the ship the officers and warrant officers had changed into their faded seagoing uniforms so that only bolitho and most of the young midshipmen looked alien in their new coats and shining buttons bolitho had received two letters from his mother both together from the falmouth mail he could picture her as he had last seen her so frail and so lovely the lady who had never grown up some local people said the scottish girl who had captivated captain james bolitho from their first meeting she was really too frail to carry the weight of the house and the estate with his elder brother hugh at sea somewhere back aboard his frigate after a short period in command of the revenue cutter avenger at falmouth and their father not yet home the burden would seem doubly hard his grownup sister felicity had already left home to marry an army officer while the youngest in the family nancy should have been thinking of a coming marriage of her own bolitho crossed to the gangway where the hands were stowing the hammocks brought up from below poor nancy she would be missing bolithos dead friend more than anyone and with nothing to keep her mind free of her loss someone stood beside him and he turned to see the surgeon peering at the shore the time he had found to speak with the rotund surgeon had been well spent another strange member in their company ships surgeons in bolithos experience had been of the poorest quality butchers for the most part and their bloody work with knife and saw was as feared by sailors as any enemy broadside but henry bulkley was a world apart he had been in a comfortable living in london at a prestigious address where his clients had been wealthy but demanding bulkley had explained to bolitho during the quiet of a dogwatch i got to hate the tyranny of the sick the selfishness of people who are only content if they are ill i came to sea to escape now i repair and do not have to waste my time on those too rich to know their own bodies i am as much a specialist as mr vallance our gunner or the carpenter and i share their work in my own way or poor codd the purser who frets over each mile logged and sets it against his stores of cheese and salt beef candles and slop clothing he had smiled contentedly and i enjoy the pleasure of seeing other lands i have sailed with captain dumaresq for three years he of course is never sick he would not permit it to happen bolitho said it is a strange feeling to leave like this to an unknown destination a landfall which only the captain and two or three others may know no war yet we sail ready to fight he saw the big man called stockdale mustering in line with the other seamen around the trunk of the mainmast the surgeon followed his glance and observed i heard something of what happened ashore you have made a firm convert in that one my god he looks like an oak i say that little must have tripped him to win his money he shot a glance at bolithos profile unless he wanted to come with you to escape from something like most of us eh bolitho smiled bulkley did not know the half of it stockdale had been allotted to the mizzenmast for sail drill and the quarterdeck sixpounders when the ship cleared for action it was all in writing and signed with pallisers slashing signature but somehow stockdale had managed to alter things here he was in bolithos division and would be stationed on the starboard battery of twelvepounders which were in bolithos charge a quarterboat pulled strongly from the shoreline all the others having been hoisted inboard on their tier before the first cock had even considered crowing the last link with the land dumaresqs final letters and despatches for the courier eventually they would end up on somebodys desk at the admiralty a note would be passed to the first sea lord a mark might be made on one of the great charts there a small ship leaving under sealed orders it was nothing new only the times had changed palliser strode to the quarterdeck rail his speakingtrumpet beneath his arm his head darting around like a bird of prey seeking the next victim bolitho looked up at the mainmast truck and was just able to discern the long red masthead pendant as it snapped out towards the quarter a northwesterly wind dumaresq would need at least that to work clear of the anchorage never easy at the best of times and after three months without seagoing activity it would only require some forgetful seaman or petty officer to relay the wrong order and a proud exit might become a shambles in minutes palliser called all officers lay aft if you please he sounded irritable and was obviously conscious of the importance of the moment bolitho joined rhodes and colpoys on the quarterdeck while the master and the surgeon hovered slightly in the background like intruders palliser said we shall weigh in half an hour take up your stations and watch every man tell the boatswains mates to start anyone shirking his work and take the name of each malingerer for punishment he glanced at bolitho curiously i have put that stockdale man with you i am uncertain as to why but he seemed to feel it was his place you must have some special gift mr bolitho though for the life of me i cannot see it they touched their hats and walked away to their various stations pallisers voice followed them hollow and insistent through the speakingtrumpet mr timbrell ten more hands on the capstan where is that damn shantyman the trumpet swivelled round like a coachmans blunderbuss hells teeth mr rhodes i want the anchor hove short this morning not next week clink clink clink the pawls on the capstan moved reluctantly as the men threw themselves on the bars whippings and lashings had been cast off from the various coils of halliards and other running rigging and while the officers and midshipmen were placed at intervals along the decks like blue and white islets amongst a moving tide of seamen the ship seemed to come alive as if she too was aware of the time bolitho darted a glance at the land no more sun and a light drizzle had begun to patter across the water touching the ship and making the waiting men shiver and stamp their bare feet little was whispering fiercely to two of the new seamen his big hands stabbing out like spades as he made some point or other he saw bolitho and sighed gawd sir theyre like blocks o wood bolitho watched his two midshipmen and wondered how he should break the barrier which had sprung up as he had appeared on deck he had spoken only briefly to them the previous day destiny was the first ship to both of them as she was to all but two of the young gentlemen peter merrett was so small he seemed unable to find a place amidst the straining ropes and panting thrusting seamen he was twelve years old the son of a prominent exeter lawyer who in turn was the brother of an admiral a formidable combination much later on if he lived little merrett might use such influence to his own advantage and at the cost of others but now shivering and not a little frightened he looked the picture of misery the other one was ian jury a fourteenyearold youth from weymouth jurys father had been a distinguished sea officer but had died in a shipwreck when ian had still been a child to the dead captains relatives the navy must have seemed the obvious place for jury it would also save them a great deal of trouble bolitho nodded to them jury was tall for his age a pleasantfaced youth with fair hair and a barely controlled excitement jury was the first to speak do we know where we are bound sir bolitho studied him gravely under four years between them jury was not really like his dead friend but the hair was similar he cursed himself for his brooding and replied we shall know soon enough his voice came out more sharply than he had intended and he said it is a wellkept secret as far as i am concerned jury watched him his eyes curious bolitho knew what he was thinking all the things he wanted to ask to know to discover in his new demanding world as he had once been himself bolitho said i shall want you to go aloft to the maintop mr jury and watch over the hands as they work you mr merrett will remain with me to pass messages forrard or aft as need be he smiled as their eyes explored the towering crisscross of shrouds and rigging the great mainyard and those above it reaching out on either beam like huge longbows the two senior midshipmen henderson and cowdroy were aft by the mizzen while the remaining pair were assisting rhodes by the foremast stockdale happened to be nearby and wheezed good mornin for it sir bolitho smiled at his haltered features no regrets stockdale the big man shook his head nah i needs a change this will do me little grinned from across a long twelvepounder reckon you could take the mainbrace all on yer own some of the seamen were chattering or pointing out landmarks on the shore as the light began to strengthen from the quarterdeck came the instant reprimand mr bolitho sir keep those hands in order it is more like a cattlefair than a manowar bolitho grimaced aye aye sir he added for littles benefit take the name of anyone who he got no chance to finish as captain dumaresqs cocked hat appeared through the after companion and then with apparent indifference his bulky figure moved to one side of the quarterdeck bolitho whispered fiercely to the midshipmen now listen you two speed is important but not more so than getting things done correctly dont badger the men unnecessarily most of them have been at sea for years anyway watch and learn be ready to assist if one of the new hands gets in a tangle they both nodded grimly as if they had just heard words of great wisdom standing by forrard sir that was timbrell the boatswain he seemed to be everywhere pausing to put a new mans fingers properly around a brace or away from a block so that when his companions threw their weight on it he would not lose half of his hand he was equally ready to bring his rattan cane down with a crack on somebodys shoulders if he thought he was acting stupidly it brought a yelp of pain and unsympathetic grins from the others bolitho heard the captain say something and seconds later the red ensign ran smartly up to the peak and blew out in the wind like painted metal timbrell again anchors hove short sir he was leaning over the beakhead peering intently at the current as it swirled beneath the bowsprit stand by on the capstan bolitho darted another glance aft the place of command gulliver with his helmsmen three today at the big double wheel taking no chances colpoys with his marines at the mizzen braces the midshipman of the watch and the signals midshipman henderson still staring up at the wildly flapping ensign to make sure the halliards had not fouled with the ship about to leave port it would be more than his life was worth at the quarterdeck rail palliser with a masters mate and slightly apart from them all the captain stout legs well braced hands beneath his coattails as he stared the full length of his command to his astonishment bolitho saw that dumaresq was wearing a scarlet waistcoat beneath his coat loose headsls the men up forward stirred into life an unwary landmen almost getting trampled underfoot as the great areas of canvas flapped and writhed in their sudden freedom palliser glanced at the captain there was the merest nod then the first lieutenant lifted his speakingtrumpet and yelled hands aloft there loose topsls the ratlines above either gangway were filled with seamen as they rushed up like monkeys towards the yards while other fleetfooted topmen dashed on higher still ready to play their part when the ship was under way bolitho smiled to hide his anxiety as jury sped after the clawing hurrying seamen by his side merrett said hoarsely i feel sick sir slade the senior masters mate paused and snarled then contain it spew up ere my lad an ill stretch you across a gun an give you six strokes to sharpen your wits he hurried on snapping orders pushing men to their proper stations the small midshipman already forgotten merrett sniffed well i do feel sick bolitho said stand over there he peered towards the speakingtrumpet and then aloft at his men strung out along the yards the great billowing mass of the maintopsail already catching pockets of wind and trying to wrench itself free man the braces stand by anchors aweigh sir like a released animal the destiny paid off into the wind her sails thundering out from her yards banging and puffing in a frenzy until with the men straining at the braces to haul the yards round and the helm hard over she came under command bolitho swallowed bile as a man slipped on the mainyard but was hauled to safety by one of his mates round and further still so that the land seemed to be whirling past the bows and the graceful figurehead in a wild dance more hands to the weather forebrace take that mans name mr slade see to the anchor and lively now pallisers voice was never still as the anchor rose dripping to the cathead and was swiftly made fast to prevent it battering at the ships hull more men were rushed elsewhere by his demanding trumpet get the fore and maincourses set the biggest sails boomed out from their yards and hardened like iron in the driving wind bolitho paused to straighten his hat and draw breath the land where he had searched for volunteers was safely on the opposite beam now and with her masts lining up to the wind and rudder destiny was already pointing towards the narrows beyond which the open sea waited like a field of grey men fought with snaking lines while overhead blocks screamed as braces and halliards took on the strain of muscle against the wind and a growing pyramid of canvas dumaresq had not apparently moved he was watching the land sliding abeam his chin tightly jammed into his neckcloth bolitho dashed some rain or spray from his eyes feeling his own excitement suddenly grateful he had not lost it through the narrows and into the sound where drake had waited to match the armada where a hundred admirals had pondered and considered their immediate futures and where after that leadsman in the chains mr slade bolitho knew he was in a frigate now no careful portly manoeuvre here dumaresq knew there would be many eyes watching from the land even at this early hour he would cut past the headland as close as he dared with just a fathom between the keel and disaster he had the wind he had the ship to do it behind him he heard merrett retching helplessly and hoped palliser would not see him stockdale was bending a line round his palm and elbow in a manner born on his thick arm it looked like a thread he and the captain made a good pair stockdale said huskily free thats what i am bolitho made to reply but realized the battered fighter was speaking for his own benefit pallisers tone stung like a lash mr bolitho i shall tell youfirst as i need the tgansls set as soon as we are through the narrows it may give you time to complete your dream and attend to your duties sir bolitho touched his hat and beckoned to his petty officers palliser was all right in the wardroom on deck he was a tyrant he saw merrett bending over a gun and vomiting into the scuppers damn your eyes mr merrett clean up that mess before you dismiss and control yourself he turned away confused and embarrassed palliser was not the only one it seemed sudden death the week which followed destinys departure from plymouth was the busiest and the most demanding in richard bolithos young life once free of the lands protection dumaresq endeavoured to set as much canvas as his ship could safely carry in a rising wind the world was confined to a nightmare of stinging icecold spray violent swooping thrusts as the frigate smashed her way through troughs and rearing crests alike it seemed as if it would never end with no time to find dry clothing and what food the cook had been able to prepare and have carried through the pitching hull had to be gulped down in minutes once as rhodes relieved bolitho on watch he shouted above the din of cracking canvas and the sea surging inboard along the lee side its the lord and masters way dick push the ship to the limit find the strength of every man aboard he ducked as a phantom of freezing spray doused them both officers too for that matter tempers became frayed and once or twice small incidents of insubordination flared openly only to be quenched by some heavyfisted petty officer or the threat of formal punishment at the gratings the captain was often on deck moving without effort between compass and chartroom discussing progress with gulliver the master or the first lieutenant and at night it was always worse bolitho never seemed to get his head buried in a musty pillow for his watch below before the hoarse cry was carried between deck like a call to arms all hands all hands aloft an reef topsls and it was then that bolitho really noticed the difference in a ship of the line he had been forced to claw his way aloft with the rest of them fighting his loathing of heights and conscious only of the need not to show that fear to others but when it was done it was done now as a lieutenant it was all happening just as dumaresq had prophesied in the middle of one fierce gale as destiny had tacked and battered her way through the bay of biscay the call had come to take in yet another reef there had been no moon or stars just a rearing wall of broken water white against the outer darkness to show just how small their ship really was men dazed by constant work and half blinded by salt spray had staggered to their stations and then reluctantly had begun to drag themselves up the vibrating ratlines then out along the topsail yards the destiny had been leaning so steeply to leeward that her mainyard had seemed to be brushing the broken crests alongside forster the captain of the maintop and bolithos key petty officer had yelled this man says e wont go aloft sir no matter what bolitho had seized a stay to prevent himself from being flung on his face go yourself forster without you up there god knows what might happen he had peered up at the remainder of his men while all the time the wind had moaned and shrieked like a demented being enjoying their torment jury had been up there his body pressed against the shrouds by the force of the wind on the foremast they had been having the same trouble with men and cordage sails and spars all pounded together while the ship had done her best to hurl them into the sea below bolitho had then remembered what forster had told him the man in question had been staring at him a thin defiant figure in a torn checkered shirt and seamans trousers whats the matter with you bolitho had had to yell above the din i cant go sir the man had shaken his head violently cant little had come lurching past cursing and blaspheming as he helped to haul some new cordage to the mainmast in readiness for use he had bellowed ill drag im aloft sir bolitho had shouted to the seaman go below and help relieve the pumps two days later the same man had been reported missing a search of the ship by poynter the masteratarms and the ships corporal had revealed nothing little had tried to explain as best as he knew how it were like this sir you should ave made im go aloft even if e fell and broke is back or you could ave taken im aft for punishment ed ave got three dozen lashes but ed ave been a man bolitho had reluctantly understood he had taken away the seamans pride his messmates would have sympathized with a man seized up at the gratings and flogged their contempt had been more than that lonely defiant seaman had been able to stand on the sixth day the storm passed on and left them breathless and dazed by its intensity sails were reset and the business of clearing up and repairing put aside any thought of rest now everyone aboard knew where the ship was first headed to the portuguese island of madeira although what for was a mystery still except to rhodes who had confided that it was merely to lay in a great store of wine for the surgeons personal use dumaresq had obviously read the report of the seamans death in the log but had said nothing of it to bolitho at sea more men died by accident than ever from ball or cutlass but bolitho blamed himself the others little and forster years ahead of him in age and experience had turned to him because he was their lieutenant forster had remarked indifferently well e werent much bloody good anyway sir all little had offered had been could ave been worse sir it was amazing to see the difference the weather made the ship came alive again and men moved about their work without glancing fearfully across their shoulders or clinging to the shrouds with both arms whenever they went aloft to splice or reeve new blocks on the morning of the seventh day while the smell of cooking started the wagers going as to what the dish would eventually be the masthead lookout yelled deck there land on the lee bow bolitho had the watch and beckoned merrett to bring him a telescope the midshipman looked like a little old man after the storm and a week of backbreaking work but he was still alive and was never late on watch let me see bolitho levelled the glass through the black shrouds and past the figureheads curved shoulder dumaresqs voice made him start madeira mr bolitho an attractive island bolitho touched his hat for so heavy a man the captain could move without making a sound iim sorry sir dumaresq smiled and took the telescope from bolithos hands as he trained it on the distant island he added when i was a lieutenant i always made sure that somebody in my watch was ready to warn me of my captains approach he glanced at bolitho the wide compelling eyes seeking something but not you i suspect not yet anyway he tossed the glass to merrett and added walk with me exercise is good for the soul so up and down along the weather side of the quarterdeck the destinys captain and her most junior lieutenant took their stroll their feet bypassing ringbolts and guntackles without conscious effort dumaresq spoke briefly of his home in norfolk but only as a place he did not sketch in the people there his friends or whether he was married or not bolitho tried to put himself in dumaresqs place able to walk and speak of other unimportant things while his ship leaned to a steady wind her sails set one above the other in ordered array her officers her seamen and marines the means to sail and fight under any given condition were all his concern at this moment they were heading for an island and afterwards they would sail much further the responsibility seemed endless as bolithos father had once wryly remarked only one law remains unchanged for any captain if he is successful others will reap the credit if he fails he will take the blame dumaresq asked suddenly are you settled in now i think so sir good if you are still mulling over that seamans death i must ask you to desist life is gods greatest gift to risk it is one thing to throw it away is to cheat he had no right best forgotten he turned away as palliser appeared on deck the masteratarms bringing up the rear palliser touched his hat to the captain but his eyes were on bolitho two hands for punishment sir he held out his book you know them both dumaresq tilted forward on his toes so that it appeared as if his heavy body would lose its balance see to it at two bells mr palliser get it over and done with no sense in putting the people off their food he strode away nodding to the masters mate of the watch like a squire to his gamekeeper palliser closed his book with a snap my compliments to mr timbrell and ask him to have a grating rigged he crossed to bolithos side well now bolitho said the captain told me of his home in norfolk sir palliser seemed vaguely disappointed i see why does the captain wear a red waistcoat sir palliser watched the masteratarms returning with the boatswain really i am surprised your confidences did not extend that far bolitho hid a smile as palliser strode away he did not know either after three years together that was something bolitho stood beside rhodes at the taffrail and watched the colourful activity of funchal harbour and its busy waterfront destiny lay at her anchor with only the quarterboat and the captains gig in the water alongside it did not look as if anyone would be allowed ashore bolitho thought local boats with quaint curling stems and sternposts milled around the frigate their occupants holding up fruit and bright shawls big jars of wine and many other items to tempt the sailors who thronged the gangways or waved from the shrouds and tops destiny had anchored in midafternoon and all hands had stayed on deck to watch the final approach drinking in the beauty of what dumaresq had rightly described as an attractive island the hills beyond the white buildings were filled with beautiful flowers and shrubs a sight indeed after the wild passage through the bay that and the two floggings which had been carried out even as the ship had changed tack for their final approach were forgotten rhodes smiled and pointed at one boat it contained three darkhaired girls who lay back on their cushions and stared boldly up at the young officers it was obvious what they hoped to sell captain dumaresq had gone ashore almost as soon as the smoke of the gun salute to the portuguese governor had dispersed he had told palliser he was going to meet the governor and pay his respects but rhodes said later hes too excited for a mere social visit dick i smell intrigue in the air the gig had returned with instructions that lockyer the captains clerk was to go ashore with some papers from the cabin strongbox he was down there now fussing about with his bag of documents while the sideparty arranged for a boatswains chair to sway him out and down into the gig palliser joined them and said disdainfully look at the old fool never goes ashore but when he does they have to rig a chair in case he falls and drowns rhodes grinned as the clerk was finally lowered into the boat must be the oldest man aboard bolitho thought about it that was something else he had discovered it was a young company with very few senior hands like those he had known in the big seventyfour the sailing master of a manofwar was usually getting on in years by the time he was appointed but gulliver was under thirty most of the hands lounging at the nettings or employed about the decks looked in good health it was mostly due to the surgeon rhodes had said that was the value of a medical man who cared and who had the knowledge to fight the dreaded scurvy and other diseases which could cripple a whole ship bulkley was one of the few privileged ones he had gone ashore with orders from the captain to purchase all the fresh fruit and juices he thought necessary while codd the purser had similar instructions on the matter of vegetables bolitho removed his hat and let the sun warm his face it would be good to explore that town sit in a shady tavern like those bulkley and some of the others had described the gig had reached the jetty now and some of destinys marines were making a passage through a watching crowd for old lockyer to get through palliser said i see that your shadow is nearby bolitho turned his head and saw stockdale kneeling beside a twelvepounder on the gundeck he was listening to vallance the ships gunner and then making gestures with his hand beneath the carriage bolitho saw vallance nod and then clap stockdale on the shoulder that was unusual he already knew that vallance was not the easiest warrant officer to get along with he was jealous about everything in his domain from magazine to gun crews from maintenance to the wear and tear of tackle he came aft and touched his hat to palliser that new man stockdale sir hes solved a problem with a gun ive been bothered with for months it was a replacement ysee ive not been happy about it he gave a rare smile stockdale thinks we could get the carriage reset by palliser spread his hands you amaze me mr vallance but do what you must he glanced at bolitho your man may not say much but he is certainly finding his place bolitho saw stockdale looking up at him from the gundeck he nodded and saw the man smile his battered face screwed up in the sunlight jury who was the midshipman of the watch called gigs shoved off sir that was quick rhodes snatched a telescope if its the captain coming back already id better he gasped and added quickly sir theyre bringing lockyer with them palliser took a second glass and levelled it on the greenpainted gig then he said quietly the clerks dead sergeant barmouth is holding him bolitho took the telescope from rhodes for the moment he could see nothing unusual the smart gig was pulling strongly towards the ship the white oars rising and falling in perfect unison the crew in their red checkered shirts and tarred hats a credit to their coxswain then as the gig swung silently to avoid a drifting log bolitho saw the marine sergeant barmouth holding the wispyhaired clerk so that he would not fall into the sternsheets there was a terrible wound across his throat which in the sunlight was the same colour as the marines tunic rhodes murmured and the surgeons ashore with most of his assistants god therell be hell to pay for this palliser snapped his fingers that man you brought aboard with the other new hands the apothecarys assistant where is he mr bolitho rhodes said quickly ill fetch him sir he was doing some jobs in the sickbay just to test him out the surgeon said palliser looked at jury tell the boatswains mate to rig another tackle he rubbed his chin this was no accident the local boats parted to allow the gig to glide to the main chains there was something like a great sigh as the small untidy boat was hauled up the side and swung carefully above the gangway some blood ran down on to the deck and bolitho saw the man who had joined his recruiting party hurrying with rhodes to take charge of the corpse the apothecarys assistants name was spillane a neat selfcontained man not the sort who would leave security to seek adventure or even experience bolitho would have thought but he seemed competent and as he watched him telling the seamen what to do bolitho was glad he was aboard sergeant barmouth was saying yessir id just made sure that the clerk was safely through the crowd an was about to take my stand on the jetty again when i eard a cry then everyone started yellin an carryin on you know sir like they does in these parts palliser nodded abruptly quite so sergeant what then i found im in an alley sir is throat was slit he paled as he saw his own officer striding angrily across the quarterdeck he would have to repeat everything for colpoys sake the marine lieutenant like most of his corps disliked interference by the sea officers no matter how pressing the reason palliser said distantly and his bag was missing yessir palliser made up his mind mr bolitho take the quarterboat a midshipman and six extra hands ill give you an address where you will find the captain tell him what has happened no dramatics just the facts as you know them bolitho touched his hat excited even though he was still shocked by the suddenness of lockyers brutal death so palliser did know more of what the captain was doing than he proclaimed when he looked at the scrap of paper which palliser thrust into his hand he knew it was not the governors residence or any other official place for that matter take mr jury and select six men yourself i want them smartly turned out bolitho beckoned to jury and heard palliser say to rhodes i might have sent you but mr bolitho and jury have newer uniforms and may bring less discredit on my ship in next to no time they were being pulled across the water towards the shore bolitho had been at sea for a week but it seemed longer so great was the change in his surroundings jury said thank you for taking me sir bolitho thought of pallisers parting shot he could not resist a sarcastic jibe and yet he had been the one to think of spillane the one to see what stockdale was doing with the gun a man of many faces bolitho thought he replied dont let the men wander about he broke off as he saw stockdale half hidden by the boats oarsmen somehow he had found time to change into his checked shirt and white trousers and equip himself with a cutlass stockdale pretended not to see his surprise bolitho shook his head forget what i said i do not think you will have any trouble after all what had the big man said ill not leave you not now not never the boats coxswain watched narrowly and then thrust the tiller bar hard over toss yer oars the boat came to a halt by some stone stairs and the bowman hooked on to a rusty chain bolitho adjusted his swordbelt and looked up at the watching townspeople they appeared very friendly yet a man had just been murdered a few yards away he said fall in on the jetty he climbed up the stairs and touched his hat to colpoys pickets the marines looked extremely cheerful and despite their rigid attitudes in front of a ships officer they smelled strongly of drink and one of them had a flower protruding from his collar bolitho took his bearings and strode towards the nearest street with as much confidence as he could muster the sailors tramped behind him exchanging winks and grins with women on balconies and in windows above the street jury asked who would want to kill poor lockyer sir who indeed bolitho hesitated and then turned down a narrow alley where the roofs nodded towards each other as if to blot out the sky there was a heady scent of flowers and he heard someone playing a stringed instrument in one of the houses bolitho checked his piece of paper and looked at an iron gate which opened on to a courtyard with a fountain in its centre they had arrived he saw jury staring round at the strangeness of everything and remembered himself in similar circumstances he said quietly you come with me he raised his voice stockdale take charge out here nobody is to leave until i give the word understood stockdale nodded grimly he would probably batter any wouldbe troublemaker senseless a servant led them to a cool room above the courtyard where dumaresq was drinking wine with an elderly man who had a pointed white beard and skin like finely tooled leather dumaresq did not stand yes mr bolitho if he was startled by their unheralded arrival he hid it very well trouble bolitho glanced at the old man but dumaresq said curtly you are with friends here bolitho explained what had happened from the moment the clerk had left the ship with his bag dumaresq said sergeant barmouth is nobodys fool if the bag had been there he would have found it he turned and said something to the courtly gentleman with the beard and the latter showed a brief flash of alarm before regaining his original composure bolitho pricked up his ears dumaresqs host might live in madeira but the captain was speaking in spanish unless he was much mistaken dumaresq said return to the ship mr bolitho my compliments to the first lieutenant and ask him to recall the surgeon and any other shore party immediately i intend to weigh before nightfall bolitho closed his mind to the obvious difficulties to say nothing of the risk of leaving harbour in the dark he sensed the sudden urgency the apprehension which lockyers murder had brought amongst them he nodded to the elderly man and then said to dumaresq a lovely house sir the old man smiled and bowed his head bolitho strode down the stairs with jury in his shadow sharing every moment without knowing what was happening bolitho wondered if the captain had noticed that his host had understood exactly what he had said about his fine house so if dumaresq had spoken to him in spanish it was so that neither he nor jury should understand he decided it was one part of the mystery he would hold to himself that night as promised dumaresq took his ship to sea in light airs and with all but her topsails and jib brailed up destiny steered slowly between other anchored vessels guided by the ships cutter with a lantern close to the water like a firefly to show her the way by dawn madeira was just a purple hump on the horizon far astern and bolitho was not certain if the mystery still remained there in the alley where lockyer had drawn his last breath spanish gold lieutenant charles palliser closed the two outer screen doors of dumaresqs cabin and said all present sir in their various attitudes the destinys lieutenants and senior warrant officers sat and watched dumaresq expectantly it was late afternoon two days out of madeira the ship had a feeling of leisurely routine about her as with a light northeasterly wind laying her on a starboard tack she cruised steadily into the atlantic dumaresq glanced up at the skylight as a shadow moved past it most likely the masters mate of the watch shut that too bolitho glanced at his companions wondering if they were sharing his growing sense of curiosity this meeting had been inevitable but dumaresq had taken great pains to ensure it would come well after his ship had cleared the land dumaresq waited for palliser to sit down then he looked at each man in turn from the marine officer past the surgeon the master and the purser finally to his three lieutenants he said you all know about the death of my clerk a reliable man even if given to certain eccentricities he will be hard to replace however his murder by some persons unknown means more than the loss of a companion i have been under sealed orders but the time is come to reveal some of the task we shall soon be facing when two people know something it is no longer a secret an even greater enemy in a small ship is rumour and what it can do to idle minds bolitho flinched as the wide compelling eyes paused on him momentarily before passing to some other part of the cabin dumaresq said thirty years ago before most of this ships company had drawn breath one commodore anson took an expedition south around cape horn and into the great south sea his purpose was to harry spanish settlements for as you should know we were then at war with the dons he nodded grimly again bolitho thought of the courtly spaniard in the house behind the harbour at funchal the secrecy the missing bag for which a man had died dumaresq continued one thing is certain commodore anson may have been courageous but his ideas of health and caring for his people were limited he looked at the rotund surgeon and allowed his features to soften unlike us maybe he had no proper doctors to advise him there were several chuckles and bolitho guessed the remark had been made to put them more at their ease dumaresq said be that as it may within three years anson had lost all of his squadron but his own centurion and had left thirteen hundred of his people buried at sea with his various escapades most of them died from disease scurvy and bad food it is likely that if anson had returned home without further incident he would have faced a court martial and worse rhodes shifted in his chair his eyes shining as he whispered i thought as much dick dumaresqs glance silenced whatever it was rhodes had been about to impart the captain brushed some invisible dust from his red waistcoat and said anson fell in with a spanish treasure ship homeward bound with bullion in her holds valued at more than a million guineas bolitho vaguely remembered reading of the incident anson had seized the ship after a swift fight had even broken off the action in order that the spaniards could douse a fire which had broken out in their rigging he had been that eager and desperate to take the treasure ship nuestra senora de covadonga intact prize courts and the powers of admiralty had long looked on such captures as of greater value than the lives lost to obtain them dumaresq cocked his head his calm attitude momentarily lost bolitho heard the hail from the masthead to report a sail far off to the north they had already sighted it twice during the day for it seemed unlikely there would be more than one vessel using this same lonely route the captain shrugged we shall see he did not elaborate but continued it was not known until recently that there was another treasure ship on passage to spain she was the asturias a larger vessel than ansons prize and therefore more heavily laden he darted a glance at the surgeon i can see you have heard of her bulkley sat back and interlaced his fingers across his ample stomach indeed i have sir she was attacked by an english privateer under the command of a young dorset man captain piers garrick his letter of marque saved him many times from the gallows as a common pirate but today he is sir piers garrick well respected and the past holder of several government posts in the caribbean dumaresq smiled grimly true but i suggest you confine your other suspicions to the limits of the wardroom the asturias was never found and the privateer was so damaged by the engagement that she too had to be abandoned he looked round irritated as the sentry called through the door midshipman of the watch sir bolitho could picture the anxiety on the quarterdeck should they disturb the meeting below their feet and risk dumaresqs displeasure or should they just note the strange sail in the log and hope for the best dumaresq said enter he did not seem to raise his voice and yet it carried to the outer cabin without effort it was midshipman cowdroy a sixteenyearold youth who dumaresq had already punished for using unnecessary severity on members of his watch he said mr slades respects sir and that sail has been reported to the northrd again he swallowed hard and seemed to shrink under the captains stare dumaresq said eventually i see we shall take no action as the door closed he added although i fear that stranger is not astern of us by coincidence a bell chimed from the forecastle and dumaresq said recent information has been found and sworn to that most of the treasure is intact a million and a half in bullion they stared at him as if he had uttered some terrible obscenity then rhodes exclaimed and we are to discover it sir dumaresq smiled at him you make it sound very simple mr rhodes perhaps we shall find it so but such a vast amount of treasure will and has already aroused interest the dons will want it back as their rightful property a prize court will argue that as the ship had already been seized by garricks privateer before she managed to escape and hide the bullion is the property of his brittanic majesty he lowered his voice and there are some who would seize it to further a cause which would do us nothing but harm so gentlemen now you know our outward purpose is to complete the kings business but if the news of this treasure is allowed to run riot elsewhere i will want to know who is responsible palliser rose to his feet his head bowed uncomfortably between the deckhead beams the rest followed suit dumaresq turned his back and stared at the glittering water which stretched to the horizon astern first we go to rio de janeiro then i shall know more bolitho caught his breath the south americas and rio was all of miles from his home at falmouth it would be the furthest he had yet sailed as they made to leave dumaresq said mr palliser and mr gulliver remain if you please palliser called mr bolitho take over my watch until i relieve you they left the cabin each immersed in his own thoughts the faroff destination would mean little to the ordinary sailor the sea was always there wherever he was and the ship went with him sails had to be trimmed and reset at all hours no matter what and a seamans life was hard whether the final landfall was in england or the arctic but let the rumour of treasure run through the ship and things might be very different as he climbed to the quarterdeck bolitho saw the men assembling for the firstwatch looking at him curiously then turning away as he met their eyes as if they already knew mr slade touched his hat the watch is aft sir he was a hard masters mate and unpopular with many of the people especially those who did not rise to his impressive standards of seamanship bolitho waited for the helmsmen to be relieved the usual handing over from one watch to the next a glance aloft at the set of the yards and sails examine the compass and the chalked notes on the slate made by the midshipman on duty gulliver came on deck banging his palms together as he did when he was worried slade asked trouble sir gulliver eyed him warily he had been in slades position too recently to take any comment as casual seeking favours perhaps or a way of suggesting that he was out of his depth with the wardroom officers aft he snapped at the next turn of the glass we will alter course he peered at the tilting compass souwest by west the captain intends to see the tgansls though with these light winds under our coattails i doubt if we can coax another knot out of her slade squinted up at the masthead lookout so the strange sail means something pallisers voice preceded him up the companion ladder it means mr slade that if that sail is still there tomorrow morning she is indeed following us bolitho saw the worry in gullivers eyes and guessed what dumaresq must have said to him and palliser surely there is nothing we can do about that sir we are not at war palliser regarded him calmly there is quite a lot we can do about it he nodded to emphasize the point so be ready as bolitho made to leave the quarterdeck in his care palliser called after him and i shall be timing those laggards of yours when all hands are piped to make more sail bolitho touched his hat i am honoured sir rhodes was waiting for him on the gundeck well done dick hell respect you if you stand up to him they walked aft to the wardroom and rhodes said the lord and master is going to take that other vessel you know that dont you dick bolitho threw his hat on to one of the guns and sat down at the wardroom table i suppose so his mind drifted back again to the coves and cliffs of cornwall last year stephen i was doing temporary duty aboard a revenue cutter rhodes was about to make a joke of it but saw the sudden pain in bolithos eyes bolitho said there was a man then a big and respected landowner he died trying to flee the country it was proved he had been smuggling arms for an uprising in america maybe the captain thinks this is similar and all this time that gold has been waiting for the right use he grimaced surprised at his own gravity but lets talk about rio i am looking forward to that colpoys strolled into the wardroom and arranged himself carefully in a chair to rhodes he said the first lieutenant says you are to select a midshipman to assist with the clerical duties in the cabin he crossed his legs and remarked didnt know the young fellas could write their laughter died as the surgeon unusually grimfaced entered and after a quick glance around to make certain they were undisturbed said the gunners just told me something interesting he was asked by one of his mates if they would need to move some of the twelvepounder shot forward to make room for the bullion he let his words sink in how long has it been fifteen minutes ten it must be the shortest secret of any day bolitho listened to the regular creak and clatter of rigging and spars the movement of the watch on deck overhead so be ready palliser had said it had suddenly adopted another meaning altogether the morning after dumaresqs disclosures about the treasure ship found the strange sail still lying far astern bolitho had the morningwatch and had sensed the growing tension as the light hardened across the horizon and faces around him took on shape and personality then came the cry deck there sail to th noreast dumaresq must have been ready for it expecting it he came on deck within minutes and after a cursory glance at the compass and the flapping sails observed winds dropping off he looked at bolitho this is a damnable business he recovered himself instantly i shall have breakfast now send mr slade aloft when he comes on watch he has an eye for most craft tell him to study that stranger though god knows she is cunning enough to keep her distance and still not lose us bolitho watched him until he had disappeared below and then looked along destinys full length it was the ships busiest time with seamen at work with holystones on the deck planking others cleaning guns and checking running and standing rigging under mr timbrells critical eye the marines were going through one of their many seemingly complicated drills with muskets and fixed bayonets while colpoys kept at a distance leaving the work to his sergeant beckett the carpenter was already directing some of his crew to begin repairs on the larboard gangway which had been damaged when a purchase had collapsed under the weight of some incoming stores the upper deck with its double line of twelvepounders was like a busy street and a marketplace all in one a place for hard work and gossip for avoiding authority or seeking favour later with the decks cleaned up the hands were piped to sail drill with palliser at his place on the quarterdeck to watch their frantic efforts to knock seconds off the time it took to reef or make more sail and all the while as they lived through the daily routine of a manofwar that other sail never left them like a tiny moth on the horizon it was always there when destiny shortened sail and the way fell from beneath her beakhead the stranger too would follow suit spread more canvas and the lookout would immediately report a responding action by the stranger dumaresq came on deck as gulliver was just completing his supervision of the midshipmans efforts as they took the noon sights to fix the ships position bolitho was close enough to hear him ask well mr gulliver how will the weather favour us tonight he sounded impatient even angry that gulliver should be doing his normal duties the sailing master glanced at the sky and the red masthead pendant winds backed a piece sir but the strength is the same be no stars tonight too much cloud in the offing dumaresq bit his lip good so be it he swung round and called pass the word for mr palliser he saw bolitho and said you have the dogwatches today make certain you gather plenty of lanterns near the mizzen i want our friend to see our lights later on they will give him confidence bolitho watched the change in the man the power running through him like a rising wave a need to crush this impudent follower palliser came striding aft his eyes questioning again as he saw dumaresq speaking with his junior lieutenant ah mr palliser i have work for you dumaresq smiled but bolitho could see from the way a nerve was jumping at the corner of his jaw the stiffness in his back and broad shoulders that his mind was less relaxed dumaresq made a sweeping gesture i shall require the launch ready for lowering at dusk earlier if the light is poor a good man in charge if you please and extra hands to get her mast stepped and sails set as soon as they are cast off he watched pallisers inscrutable face and added lightly i want them to carry several of the large lanterns too we shall douse ours and darken ship completely as soon as the launch is clear then i intend to beat hard to windrd come about and wait bolitho turned to look at palliser to tackle another vessel in the dark was not to be taken flippantly dumaresq added i shall flog any man aboard who shows so much as a glowworm palliser touched his hat ill attend to it sir mr slade can take charge of the boat hes so keen on promotion itll do him good bolitho was astounded to see dumaresq and the first lieutenant laughing together like a pair of schoolboys as if this was an everyday occurrence dumaresq looked at the sky and then turned to stare astern only from the masthead could you see the other vessel but it was as if he was able to reach beyond the horizon itself he was calm again in control of his feelings he said something to tell your father about mr bolitho it would appeal to him a seaman tramped past carrying a great coil of rope across his shoulder like a bundle of dead snakes it was stockdale as the captain vanished below he wheezed we goin to fight that one sir bolitho shrugged ii think so stockdale nodded heavily ill grind an edge on my blade then that was all it apparently meant to him left alone to his thoughts bolitho crossed to the rail and looked down at the men already working to free the launch from the other boats on the tier did slade he wondered yet realize what might become of him if the wind rose after they had dropped the launch slade could be driven miles off course it would be harder than finding a pin in a haystack jury came on deck and after some hesitation joined him by the rail bolitho stared at him i thought you were sent aft to do poor lockyers work jury met his gaze i asked the first lieutenant if he would send mr midshipman ingrave instead some of his composure collapsed under bolithos gaze id prefer to stay in your watch sir bolitho clapped him on the shoulder on your head be it but he felt pleased all the same the boatswains mates hurried from hatchway to hatchway their silver calls trilling in between their hoarse cries for the watch below to assist in swaying out the launch jury listened to the shrill whistles and said the spithead nightingales are in full cry this evening sir bolitho hid a smile jury spoke like an old sailor a real seadog he faced him gravely youd better go and see what is being done about the lanterns otherwise mr palliser will have the both of us in full cry im thinking as dusk came down to conceal their preparations the masthead lookout reported that the other sail was still in sight palliser touched his hat as the captain came on deck all ready sir very well dumaresqs eyes shone in the reflected glare from the array of lanterns shorten sail and stand by to lower the boat he looked up as the maintopsail filled and boomed sullenly from its yard after that every stitch she can carry if that ferret back there is a friend and merely seeking our protection on the high seas we shall know it if not mr palliser he shall know that i promise you an anonymous voice whispered capns comin up sir palliser turned and waited for dumaresq to join him by the quarterdeck rail gullivers shadow moved through the gloom south by east sir full and bye dumaresq gave a grunt you were right about the clouds mr gulliver though the winds fresher than i expected bolitho stood with rhodes and three midshipmen at the lee side of the quarterdeck ready to execute any sudden order more to the point they were able to share the drama and the tension dumaresqs comment had sounded as if he blamed the master for the wind he looked up and shivered destiny after thrashing and beating her way to windward for what had seemed like an eternity had come about as dumaresq had planned with a stiff wind sweeping over the larboard quarter she was plunging across a procession of breaking whitehorses the spray rising above the weather rigging and sweeping on to the crouching seamen like tropical rain destiny had been stripped down to her topsails and jib with her big forecourse holding two reefs in readiness for a swift change of tack rhodes murmured that other vessel is out there somewhere dick bolitho nodded and tried not to think of the launch as it had vanished into a deepening darkness the lanterns making a lively show on the water it was an eerie feeling with the ship so quiet around him nobody spoke and the heavily greased gear was without its usual din and clatter just the sweeping sea alongside the occasional rush of water through the lee scuppers as destiny dropped her bows into a deep trough bolitho wanted to forget what was happening around him and to concentrate on what he had to do palliser had selected the best seamen in the ship for a boarding party if it came to that but the sudden upsurge of wind might have changed dumaresqs ideas he thought he heard jury moving restlessly by the nettings and rhodes midshipman mr cowdroy who had been in the ship for two years he was a haughty badtempered youth of sixteen who would be impossible as a lieutenant rhodes had had cause to report him to the captain more than once and the last time he had been ignominiously caned across a sixpounder by the boatswain it did not seem to have changed him little merrett made up the trio trying to keep out of sight as usual rhodes said softly soon now dick he loosened the hanger in his belt might be a slaver who knows yeames masters mate of the watch said cheerfully not likely sir youd smell a blackbirder by now palliser snapped be silent there bolitho watched the sea curling above the dipping side in a frothing white bank beyond it there was nothing but an occasional jagged crest as black as a boot as colpoys had remarked his marksmen were already aloft in the tops trying to keep their muskets dry and watching for the first sight of the stranger if the captain and gulliver had timed it correctly the stranger should appear on destinys starboard bow the frigate would hold the windgage and the other vessel would have no chance of slipping away the men at the starboard battery were ready the gun captains on their knees as they prepared to run out as soon as the word came from aft to a civilian sitting by his hearth in england it might all seem like a kind of madness but to captain dumaresq it was something else entirely and it mattered the other vessel whatever she was was interfering with the kings affairs that made it personal not to be taken lightly bolitho gave another shiver as he recalled his first meeting with the captain to me to this ship and to his brittanic majesty in that order destiny raised her quivering jibboom like a lance and seemed to hang motionless on the edge of another trough before she plunged forward and down her bows smashing through solid water and flinging spray high above the forecastle from one corner of his eye bolitho saw something fall from overhead it hit the deck and exploded with a loud bang rhodes ducked as a ball whined dangerously past his face and gasped a damned bullock has dropped his musket startled voices and harsh accusations erupted from the gundeck and lieutenant colpoys ran to the quarterdeck ladder in his haste to deal with the culprit it all happened in a swift sequence of events the sudden explosion as destiny ploughed her way towards the next array of crests the attention of officers and seamen distracted for just a few moments palliser said angrily stop that noise damn your eyes bolitho turned and then froze as out of the darkness running with the wind came the other vessel not safely downwind to starboard but right here rising above the larboard side like a phantom put up your helm dumaresqs powerful voice stopped some of the startled men in their tracks man the braces there stand by on the quarterdeck rearing and plunging her sails booming and thundering in wild confusion destiny began to swing away from the oncoming vessel gun crews who minutes earlier had been nursing their weapons in readiness for a fight were caught totally unawares and even now were tumbling across to help the men on the opposite side where the twelvepounders still pointed at their sealed ports more spray burst over the quarterdeck as another sea surged jubilantly across the nettings and drenched the men nearby order was being restored and bolitho saw seamen straining back on the braces until they seemed to be touching the deck itself he shouted stand to men he was groping for his hanger even as he realized that rhodes and his midshipman had already gone running to the bows shell be into us directly a shot echoed above the din of sea and wind but whether fired by accident or by whom bolitho did not know or care he felt jury by his side whatll we do sir he sounded frightened as well he might bolitho thought merrett was clinging to the nettings as if nothing would ever shift him bolitho used something like physical strength to control his stampeding thoughts he was in charge nobody else was here to lead to advise everyone on the upper deck was too occupied with his own role he managed to shout stay with me he pointed at a running figure you clear the starboard battery and prepare to repel boarders as men floundered cursing and shouting in all directions bolitho heard dumaresqs voice he was on the opposite side of the deck yet seemed to be speaking into bolithos ear board mr bolitho he swung round as palliser sent more men to shorten sail in a last attempt to delay the impact of collision she must not escape bolitho stared at him his eyes wild aye sir he was about to draw his hanger when with a thundering crash the other vessel drove hard alongside but for dumaresqs quick action she would have rammed into the destinys broadside like a giant axe page stand into danger yells changed to screams as a rumbling mass of cordage and broken spars crashed on and between the two hulls men were knocked from their feet as the sea lifted the vessels together yet again bringing down another tangle of rigging and blocks some men had fallen too and bolitho had to drag jury by the arm as he shouted follow me he waved his hanger keeping his eyes away from the sea which appeared to be boiling between the two snared hulls one slip and it would all be over he saw little brandishing a boarding axe and of course stockdale holding his cutlass like a dirk against his massive frame bolitho gritted his teeth and leapt for the other vessels shrouds his legs kicking in space as he struck out seeking a foothold his hanger had gone from his hand and swung dangerously from his wrist as he gasped and struggled to hold on more men were on either side of him and he retched as someone fell between the two vessels the mans scream cut off abruptly like a great door being slammed shut as he dropped to the unfamiliar deck he heard other voices and saw vague shapes rushing across the fallen wreckage some with blades in their fists while from aft came the sharp crack of a pistol he groped for his hanger and shouted drop your weapons in the kings name the roar of voices which greeted his puny demand was almost worse than the danger perhaps he had been expecting frenchmen or spaniards but the voices which yelled derision at his upraised hanger were as english as his own a spar plunged straight down into the deck momentarily separating the two opposing groups and smashing one of the figures to pulp with a final quiver the two vessels wrenched themselves apart and even as a swordblade darted from the shadows towards him bolitho realized that destiny had left him to fend for himself page stand into danger blade to blade calling to each other by name and matching curses with their unknown adversaries the destinys small boarding party struggled to hold together all the while the deck was flung about by the sea the motion made worse by fallen spars and great creepers of rigging which trailed over the bulwarks and pulled the hull into each trough like a seaanchor bolitho slashed out at someone opposite him his blade jarring against steel as he parried away another thrust bolitho was a good swordsman but a hanger was a poor match for a straight blade around him men were yelling and gasping bodies interlocked while they fought with cutlass and dirk boarding axe and anything which they could lay hands on little bellowed aft lads come on he charged along the littered deck hacking down a crouching shadow with his axe as he ran and followed by half of the party near bolitho a man slipped and fell and then rolled over protecting his face from the one who stood astride him with a raised cutlass bolitho heard the swish of steel the sickening thud of the blade driving into bone but when he turned he saw stockdale wrenching his own blade free before tossing the dead man unceremoniously over the side it was a wild jumbled nightmare nothing seemed real and bolitho could feel the numbness thrusting through his limbs as he fought off another attacker who had slithered down the shrouds like an agile ape he ducked and felt the man slice above his head the breath rasping out of him from the force of his swing bolitho punched him in the stomach with the knucklebow of his hanger and as he reeled away hacked him hard across the neck the pain lancing up his arm as if he had been the one to be cut down despite the horror and the danger bolithos mind continued to respond but like that of an onlooker somebody uninvolved with the bloody handtohand fighting around him the vessel was a brigantine her yards in disarray as she continued to fall downwind there was a smell of newness about her a freshly built craft her crew must have been dumbfounded when destinys canvas had loomed across their bows and that shock was the only thing which had so far saved the depleted boarding party a man bounded forward regardless of the slashing figures and sobbing wounded who were being trampled underfoot through his reeling mind one more thought came to bolitho this gaunt figure in a blue coat and brass buttons must be the vessels master the brigantine was temporarily out of control but within hours that could be put right and destiny was nowhere to be seen perhaps her damage was much worse than they had thought you never really considered it might happen to your own ship always to another bolitho saw the dull glint of steel and guessed dawn was not far away surprisingly he thought of his mother glad that she would not see his body when he fell the gaunt man yelled drop your sword rot you bolitho tried to shout back at him to rally his men to give himself a last spur of defiance then the blades crossed and bolitho felt the strength of the man through the steel as if it was an extension of his own arm clash clash clash bolitho parried and cut at the other man who took every advantage to press and follow each attack there was a clang and bolitho felt the hanger torn from his fingers the lanyard around his wrist severed by the force of the blow he heard a frantic voice yell here sir it was jury as he hurled a sword across the writhing bodies hiltfirst bolithos desperation came to his aid somehow he caught it twisting it in his grip as he felt its balance and length tiny pictures flashed through his mind his father teaching him and his brother hugh in the walled kitchengarden at falmouth then later matching careful movements against each other he sobbed as the other mans sword cut through his sleeve just below his armpit another inch and he felt the fury sweeping everything else aside an insanity which seemed to give him back his strength even his hope bolitho locked blades again feeling his opponents hatred smelling his strength and his sweat he heard stockdale calling in his strange husky voice and knew he was being pressed too hard to reach his side others had stopped fighting their wind broken as they stared with glazed eyes at the two swordsmen in their midst from another world or so it seemed came the crash of a single cannon a ball hissed over the deck and slammed through a flapping sail like an iron fist destiny was nearby and her captain had taken the risk of killing some of his own men to make his presence felt and understood some of the brigantines men threw down their weapons instantly others were less fortunate and were felled by the inflamed boarders even as they tried to grasp what was happening bolithos adversary shouted wildly too late for you sir he thrust bolitho back with his fist measured the distance and lunged bolitho heard jury cry out saw little running towards him his teeth bared like a wild animal after all the agony and the hate it was too easy and without any sort of dignity he held his balance and did not even have to guide his feet and arms as he stepped aside using the other mans charge to flick his blade in one ringing encounter and then drive his own beneath the lost guard and into his chest little dragged the man away and raised his bloodied axe as he tried to struggle free bolitho shouted belay that let him be he looked round feeling dazed and sick as some of his men gave a wild cheer little let the man fall to the deck and wiped his face with the back of his wrist as if he too was slowly but reluctantly letting go of the madness until the next time bolitho saw jury sitting with his back against a broken spar his hands clasped across his stomach he knelt down and tried to drag jurys fingers away not him he thought not so soon a seaman bolitho recognized as one of his best maintopmen bent down and jerked the midshipmans hands apart bolitho swallowed hard and tore the shirt open remembering jurys fear and his trust at the moment of boarding bolitho was young but he had done this sort of thing before he peered at the wound and felt like praying a blade must have been stopped by the large gilt plate on jurys crossbelt he could see the scored metal even in the poor light it had taken the real force and the attacker had only managed to scar the youths stomach the seaman grinned and fashioned a wad from jurys torn shirt hell be all right sir just a nick bolitho got shakily to his feet one hand resting on the mans shoulder for support thank you murray that was well said the man looked up at him as if trying to understand something i saw him throw that sword to you sir it was then that some other bugger made his play he wiped his cutlass absently on a piece of sailcloth it was the last bloody thing he did do on this earth bolitho walked aft towards the abandoned wheel voices from the past seemed to be following him reminding him of this particular moment they will be looking to you now the fight and fury has gone out of them he turned and shouted take the prisoners below and put them under guard he sought out a familiar face from others who had followed him blindly without really knowing what they were doing you southmead man the wheel the rest go with little and cut free the wreckage alongside he glanced quickly at jury his eyes were open and he was trying not to cry out from the pain bolitho forced a smile his lips frozen and unreal we have a prize thank you for what you did it took real courage jury tried to reply but fainted away again through the wind and spray bolitho heard the booming challenge of captain dumaresqs voice through a speakingtrumpet bolitho called to stockdale answer for me i am spent as the two vessels drew closer their fine lines marred by broken spars and dangling rigging stockdale cupped his big hands and yelled the ship is ours sir there was a ragged cheer from the frigate it seemed obvious to bolitho that dumaresq had not expected to find a single one of them left alive pallisers crisp tones replaced the captains resonant voice lay to if you are able we must recover mr slade and his boat bolitho imagined he could hear someone laughing he raised his hand as the frigate tacked slowly and awkwardly away men already working on her yards to haul up fresh canvas and reeve new blocks then he looked at the brigantines deck at the wounded men who were moaning quietly or trying to drag themselves away like sick animals will do there were some who would never move as the light continued to strengthen bolitho examined the sword which jury had flung to save him in the dull light the blood was like black paint on the hilt and up to his own wrist little came aft again the new third lieutenant was young in a moment he would fling the sword over the side his guts soured by what they had done together that would be a pity later he would want it to give to his father or his sweetheart little said ere sir ill take that an give it a shamper for you he saw bolithos hesitation and added affably its bin a real mate to you always look after yer mates thats what josh little says sir bolitho handed it to him i expect youre right he straightened his back even though every muscle and fibre seemed to be cutting him like hot bands lively men theres much to do he recalled the captains words it wont do it by itself from beneath the foremast and its attendant pile of fallen debris stockdale watched him and then gave a satisfied nod one more fight had ended bolitho waited wearily by dumaresqs table in destinys cabin his aching limbs at odds with the frigates motion dull daylight had revealed the brigantines name to be heloise outward bound from bridport in dorset to the caribbean by way of madeira to take on a cargo of wine dumaresq finished leafing through the brigantines logbook and then glanced at bolitho do sit mr bolitho before you fall down he rose and walked to the quarter windows pressing his face against the thick glass to seek out the brigantine which was lying in destinys lee palliser and a fresh boarding party had gone across earlier the first lieutenants experience in much demand as they sought to repair the damage and get the vessel under way again dumaresq said you performed well extremely so for one so young and as yet inexperienced in leading men you achieved more than id dared to hope he clasped his powerful hands behind his coattails as if to contain his anger but seven of our people are dead others badly injured he reached up and banged the skylight with his knuckles mr rhodes be so good as to find out what the damned surgeon is about bolitho forgot his tiredness his previous resentment at being ordered from his prize to make way for the first lieutenant it was fascinating to watch the slow rise of dumaresqs anger like a smouldering fuse as it edges towards the first cask of powder it must have made poor rhodes jump to hear his captains voice rising from the deck at his feet dumaresq turned to bolitho good men killed piracy and murder no less he had made no mention of the miscalculation which all but wrecked or dismasted both ships he was saying i knew they were up to something it was evident at funchal that too many ears and eyes were abroad he ticked off the points on his strong fingers my clerk just to get the contents of his satchel then the brigantine which must have quit england about the same time as we left plymouth happens to be in harbour her master must have known i could not beat to windrd and make a chase of it so long as he kept his distance he was safe bolitho understood if destiny had clawed round to approach the other vessel in daylight the heloise would have had the advantage of the wind and the distance the frigate could outpace her in any fair chase but under cover of darkness the brigantine would easily slip away if expertly handled bolitho thought of the gaunt man he had cut down in the fight to hold the deck he could almost pity him almost dumaresq had ordered him to be brought across so that bulkley the surgeon could save his life if that were possible dumaresq added by god it proves something if more proof were needed we are on the right scent the marine sentry called surgeon sir dumaresq glanced at the perspiring surgeon and about bloody time man bulkley shrugged either indifferent to dumaresqs explosive temper or so used to it that it meant nothing to him the man is alive sir a bad wound but a clean one he glanced curiously at bolitho hes a strong fellow too im surprised and gratified to see you in one portion dumaresq snapped never mind all that how dare that ruffian interfere with a kings ship hell get no mercy from me be certain of it he calmed slowly it was like watching the sea receding bolitho thought i must find out what i can from him mr palliser is searching the heloises hull but in view of what mr bolitho took pains to discover i think it unlikely we will gain much according to the log she was launched last year and completed just a month back though shes hardly big enough for useful commerce id have thought bolitho wanted to leave to try and wash the stain of combat from his hands and mind the surgeon remarked mr jury is well enough a nasty cut but he is a healthy boy therell be no after effects dumaresq gave a smile i spoke with him when he was brought up from the cutter a touch of heroworship there i think mr bolitho he saved my life sir hes no cause to praise me for that dumaresq nodded hmmm we shall see he changed tack we shall be sailing in company before nightfall keep all hands busy thats the thing mr palliser will need to rig a jury topgallant mast on that damned pirate but it must be done he glanced at bolitho pass the word to the quarterdeck change masthead lookouts every hour well use this enforced respite to keep our eyes open for other wouldbe followers as it stands we have a fine little prize and nobody yet knows anything about it it might assist in some way bolitho stood up his legs heavy again so there was to be no rest dumaresq said turn up the hands at noon to witness burial mr bolitho well send the poor fellows on their last journey while we lie to he scattered the sentiment by adding no sense in wasting time once we are under way bulkley followed bolitho past the sentry and towards the ladder which led below to the maindeck the surgeon gave a sigh he has the bit between his teeth now bolitho looked at him to try and understand his feelings but it was too dark between decks with only the ships sounds and smells rising around them for company is it the bullion bulkley lifted his head to listen to the muffled shouts from a boat coming alongside booming against the hull in the deep swell you are still too young to understand richard he laid a plump hand on bolithos sleeve and that was no sort of criticism believe me but i have met men such as our captain and i know him better than many he is a fine officer in most respects if a trifle headstrong but he yearns for action like a drunkard craves the bottle he commands this fine frigate but he feels deep down that it is too late or too early for him with england at peace the chances of distinction and advancement are few it suits me very well but he shook his head i have said enough but i know you will respect my confidence he ambled to the ladder leaving an aroma of brandy and tobacco to join the other smells already present bolitho walked forward into the daylight and then ran quickly up a ladder to the quarterdeck he knew that if he did not keep moving he would fall asleep on his feet destinys gundeck was littered with broken rigging amidst which the boatswain and the ropemaker stood and discussed what might still be saved above the decks the seamen were busy splicing and hammering and the torn sails were already brought down to be patched and stowed away for emergencies a shipofwar was selfsufficient nothing could be wasted some of that canvas would soon be gliding into the seabed weighted down with round shot to carry the dead to the place where there was only darkness and peace rhodes crossed to his side good to have you back dick he dropped his voice as they both turned to look across at the drifting brigantine the lord and master was like an enraged lion after youd broken free from the side i shall tread very warily for the next week bolitho studied the other vessel it was more like a dream than ever now it was hard to believe he had managed to rally his men and take the heloise after all which had happened men had died he had probably killed at least one of them himself but it had no meaning no substance he walked to the rail and saw several of the faces on the deck below turn up towards him what did they think he wondered rhodes seemed genuinely pleased for him but there would be envy others might feel he had been too lucky too successful for one so junior spillane the surgeons new helper appeared on the lee gangway and threw a parcel over the side bolitho felt sick what was it an arm or a leg it could have been his he heard slade the masters mate yelling abuse at some unfortunate seaman the destinys recovery of the launch and the thankful shouts of the exhausted crew when she had eventually discovered them had apparently done nothing to make slade any gentler in due course the dead men were buried while the living stood with bared heads as the captain read a few words from his prayer book then after a hasty meal and a welcome tot of brandy the hands turned to again and the air was filled with the noise of saws and hammers with strong smells of paint and tar for the seams to mark their progress dumaresq came on deck at the end of the afternoonwatch and for several minutes looked at his ship and then at the clearing sky which told him more than any instrument he said to bolitho who was once more officer of the watch look at our people working ashore they are branded as hawbucks and nogood drunkards but give em a piece of rope or a span of timber an youll see what they can do he spoke with such feeling that bolitho ventured to ask do you think another war is coming sir for an instant he thought he had gone too far dumaresq turned quickly on his thick legs his eyes hard as he said you have been speaking with that damned sawbones eh then he gave a deep chuckle there is no need to answer you have not yet learned deceit he moved to the opposite side for his usual stroll then added war i am depending on it before darkness closed in to hide one ship from another palliser sent word to say he was ready to proceed and would repair the less important damage in the days on passage for rio slade had gone across to the heloise to take charge of the prize crew and palliser returned in the quarterboat even as nightfall joined the sky to the horizon like a curtain bolitho marvelled at the way palliser kept going he showed no sign of tiredness and did not spare himself as he bustled about the ship using a lantern to examine every repair and shouting for the culprit if he discovered something which he considered to be shoddy workmanship thankfully bolitho climbed into his cot his coat on the deck where it had fallen around him destiny shivered and groaned as she rode a quarter sea without effort as if she too was grateful for a rest it was the same throughout the hull bulkley sat in his sickbay drawing on a long clay pipe and sharing some of his brandy with codd the purser outside barely visible on the orlop deck the remaining sick and wounded slept or whimpered quietly in the darkness in the cabin dumaresq was at his table writing busily in his personal diary without a coat and with his shirt open to the waist occasionally he glanced at the screen door as if to pierce it and see the length of his command his world and sometimes he looked up at the deckhead as gullivers footsteps told him that the master was still brooding over the collision fearful the blame might be laid at his door throughout the maindeck where there was barely room to stand upright the bulk of the ships company swung in their hammocks to destinys regular plunging motion like lines of neat pods waiting to give birth in an instant if the wind so ordered or the drums beat to quarters some men unable to sleep or working their watch on deck still thought of the short bitter fight of moments when they had known fear of familiar faces which had been wiped away or of the prize money the handsome brigantine might bring them tossing in his cot in the sickbay midshipman jury went over the attack yet again of his desperate need to help bolitho as the lieutenants hanger had been hurled away of the sudden agony across his stomach like a hot iron he thought of his dead father whom he could scarcely remember and hoped he would have been proud of what he had done and destiny carried them all from the grimfaced palliser who sat opposite colpoys in the deserted wardroom the cards mocking him from the table to the servant poad snoring in his hammock they were all at her mercy as her figurehead reached out for the horizon which never drew any nearer two weeks after seizing the brigantine destiny crossed the equator on her way south even the master seemed pleased with their progress and the distance covered a convenient wind and milder warmer air did much to raise the mens spirits and keep them free of illness crossing the line was a new experience for over a third of the ships company boisterous horseplay and skylarking which accompanied the ceremony were encouraged by a four days allowance of wine and spirits for everybody with little the gunners mate making a formidable neptune in a painted crown and a beard of spunyarn accompanied by his bashful queen in the shape of one of the ships boys all the newcomers to his kingdom were soundly ducked and abused afterwards dumaresq joined his officers in the wardroom and stated his satisfaction with the ships performance and swift passage they had left the heloise far astern with some of her damage still being repaired dumaresq was obviously in no mood to delay his own landfall and had ordered slade to meet him off rio with all the haste he could manage on most days destiny pushed her way along under all plain sail and would have made a fine sight had there been any other vessel to share their ocean working high above the decks or employed in regular sail and gun drill the new hands began to fit into the routine and bolitho saw the pallid skins of those who had come from the debtors jails or worse taking on a deeper hue as the sun grew stronger with each passing day another of the men who had been wounded in the fight had died bringing the total to eight watched night and day by one of colpoys marines the heloises master continued to regain his strength and bolitho imagined dumaresq was set on keeping him alive if only to see him hang for piracy midshipman jury had been allowed to return to duty but was confined to working on deck or standing his watch aft strangely enough their brief moment of shared danger and courage seemed to hold him and bolitho apart and although they met several times every day bolitho could sense a certain discomfort between them maybe the captain had been right perhaps jurys heroworship as he had termed it had created an embarrassment rather than a bond little merrett on the other hand seemed to have gained more confidence than anyone would have thought possible it was as if he had expected to be killed and that now he was convinced nothing worse could ever happen to him he ran up the shrouds with the other midshipmen and during the dogwatches his shrill voice was often heard in some contest or argument with his companions one evening as the ship ghosted along under her courses and topsails and bolitho took over the first watch for lieutenant rhodes he saw jury watching the other midshipmen skylarking in the fighting tops probably wishing he was up there with them bolitho waited for the helmsman to call steady as she goes sir sousouwest then he crossed to the midshipmans side and asked how is the wound jury looked at him and smiled it no longer hurts sir i am lucky his fingers strayed to his leather crossbelt and touched the scar on the gilt plate were they really pirates bolitho shrugged i believe they were intent on following us spies perhaps but in the eyes of the law they will be seen as pirates he had thought a great deal about it since that terrible night he suspected dumaresq and palliser knew a lot more than they were telling that the captured brigantine was deeply involved with destinys secret mission and her brief stay at funchal he said but if we maintain this pace we shall be in rio in a weeks time then i daresay we shall learn the truth gulliver appeared on the quarterdeck and peered up at the hardening canvas for a long minute without speaking then he said winds getting up i think we should shorten sail he hesitated watching bolithos face will you tell the captain or shall i bolitho looked at the topsails as they filled and tightened to the wind in the dying sunlight they looked like great pink shells but gulliver was right and he should have seen it for himself ill tell him gulliver strode to the compass as if unable to contain his restlessness too good to last i knew it bolitho beckoned to midshipman cowdroy who was temporarily sharing his watches until jury was fully recovered my respects to the captain tell him the wind is freshening from the noreast cowdroy touched his hat and hurried to the companion bolitho bit back his dislike an arrogant intolerant bully he wondered how rhodes put up with him jury asked quietly are we in for a storm sir unlikely i think but its best to be prepared he saw something glitter in jurys hand and said that is a fine looking watch jury held it out to him his face filled with pleasure it belonged to my father bolitho opened the guard carefully and saw inside a tiny but perfect portrait of a sea officer jury was already very like him it was a beautiful watch made by one of the finest craftsmen in london he handed it back and said take good care of it it must be very valuable jury slipped it into his breeches pocket it is worth a great deal to me it is all i own of my father something in his tone affected bolitho deeply it made him feel clumsy angry with himself for not seeing beyond jurys eagerness to please him he had no one else in the world who cared he said well my lad if you keep your wits about you on this voyage it will stand you in good stead later on he smiled a few years ago who had even heard of james cook i wonder now he is the countrys hero and when he returns from his latest voyage ive no doubt hell be promoted yet again dumaresqs voice made him spin round do not excite the boy mr bolitho he will want my command in no time bolitho waited for dumaresqs decision you never knew where you were with him we shall shorten sail presently mr bolitho he rocked back on his heels and examined each sail in turn well run while we can as he disappeared through the companion the masters mate of the watch called the cutter is workin free on the boat tier sir very well bolitho sought out midshipman cowdroy again take some hands and secure the cutter if you please he sensed the midshipmans resentment and knew the reason for it he would be glad to be rid of him from his watch jury had guessed what was happening ill go sir its what i should be doing cowdroy turned on him and snapped you are unwellmr jury do not strain yourself on our behalf he swung away shouting for a boatswains mate later as true to gullivers prediction the wind continued to rise and the seas face changed to an angry array of white crests bolitho forgot about the rift he had created between the two midshipmen first one reef was taken in then another but as the ship staggered and dipped into a worsening sea dumaresq ordered all hands aloft to take in all but the maintopsail so that destiny could lie to and ride out the gale then to prove it could be gentle as well as perverse the wind fell away and when daylight returned the ship was soon drying and steaming in the warm sunshine bolitho was exercising the starboard battery of twelvepounders when jury reported that he had been allowed to return to full duty and was no longer to bunk in the sickbay bolitho had a feeling that something was wrong but was determined not to become involved he said the captain intends that ours will be the smartest gun salute they have ever seen or heard in rio he saw several of the barebacked seamen grinning and rubbing their palms together so well have a race the first division against the second with some wine for the winners he had already asked the pursers permission to grant an extra issue of wine codd had thrust out his great upper teeth like the prow of a galley and had cheerfully agreed if you pay mr bolitho if you pay little called all ready sir bolitho turned to jury you can time them the division to run out first twice out of three tries will take the prize he knew the men were getting impatient fingering the tackles and handspikes with as much zeal as if they were preparing to fight jury tried to meet bolithos eyes i have no watch sir bolitho stared at him aware that the captain and palliser were at the quarterdeck rail to see his men competing with each other youve lost it your fathers watch he could recall jurys pride and his sadness as he had shown it to him the previous evening tell me jury shook his head his face wretched its gone sir thats all i know bolitho rested his hand on jurys shoulder easy now ill try to think of something impetuously he tugged out his own watch which had been given to him by his mother use mine stockdale who was crouching at one of the guns had heard all of it and had been watching the faces of the other men nearby he had never owned a watch in his life nor was he likely to but somehow he knew this one was important in a crowded world like the ship a thief was dangerous sailors were too poor to let such a crime go unpunished it would be best if he was caught before something worse happened for his own sake as much as anybodys bolitho waved his arm run out the second division of guns won easily it was only to be expected the losers said as it contained both little and stockdale the two strongest men in the ship but as they shared out their mugs of wine and relaxed beneath the shade of the maincourse bolitho knew that for jury at least the moment was spoiled he said to little secure the guns he walked aft some of his men nodding at him as he passed dumaresq waited for him to reach the quarterdeck that was smartly done palliser smiled bleakly if we must bribe our people with wine before they can handle the great guns we shall soon be a dry ship bolitho blurted out mr midshipman jurys watch has been stolen dumaresq eyed him calmly and so what must i do mr bolitho bolitho flushed im sorry sir ii thought dumaresq shaded his eyes to watch a trio of small birds as they dashed abeam seemingly inches above the water i can almost smell the land he turned abruptly to bolitho again it was reported to you deal with it bolitho touched his hat as the captain and first lieutenant began to pace up and down the weather side of the deck he still had a lot to learn a matter of discipline with all her canvas except topsails and jib clewed up destiny glided slowly across the blue water of rio s outer roadstead it was oppressively hot with barely enough breeze to raise much more than a ripple beneath her beakhead but bolitho could sense the expectancy and excitement around him as they made their way towards the protected anchorage even the most experienced seaman aboard did not deny the impressive majesty of the landfall they had watched it grow out of the morning mist and it was now spread out on either beam as if to enfold them rio s great mountain was like nothing bolitho had seen dwarfing all else like a giant boulder and beyond interspersed with patches of lush green forest were other ridges steep and pointed like waves which had been turned to stone pale beaches necklaces of surf and nestling between hills and ocean the city itself white houses squat towers and nodding palms it was a far cry from the english channel to larboard bolitho saw the first walled battery the portuguese flag flapping only occasionally above it in the hard sunlight rio was well defended with enough batteries to dampen the keenest of attackers dumaresq was studying the town and the anchored vessels through his glass he said let her fall off a point westnorwest sir palliser looked at his captain guardboat approaching dumaresq smiled briefly wonders what the hell we are doing here no doubt bolitho plucked his shirt away from his skin and envied the half naked seamen while the officers were made to swelter in their heavy dresscoats mr vallance the gunner was already checking his chosen crews to make sure nothing went wrong with his salute to the flag bolitho wondered how many unseen eyes were watching the slow approach of the english frigate a manofwar what did she want was she here for peaceful purposes or with news of another broken treaty in europe begin the salute gun by gun the salute crashed out the heavy air pressing the thick smoke on the water and blotting out the land the portuguese guardboat had turned in her own length propelled by great sweeps so that she looked like a giant waterbeetle somebody commented the buggers leadin us in the last gun recoiled and the crews threw themselves on the tackles to sponge the smoking muzzles and secure each weapon as a final gesture of peaceful intentions a figure waved a flag from the guardboat and as the long sweeps rose dripping and still on either beam dumaresq remarked dryly not too close in mr palliser theyre taking no chances with us palliser raised his trumpet to his mouth lee braces there hands wear ship like parts of an intricate pattern the seamen and their petty officers ran to their stations topsl sheets pallisers voice roused the seabirds from the water upon which they had only just alighted after the din of the salute topsl clewlines dumaresq said so be it mr palliser anchor helm alee destiny turned slowly into the wind the way going off her as she responded to the helm let go there was a splash from forward as the big anchor plummeted down while strung out on the topsail yards the seamen deftly furled the sails as if each mast was controlled by one invisible hand away gigs crew away quarterboat bare feet stampeded across the hot decks while destiny took the strain of her cable and then swung to the pull of the ocean dumaresq thrust his hands behind his back signal the guardboat alongside if you please i shall have to go ashore and pay my respects to the viceroy it is best to get such ponderous matters over and done with he nodded to gulliver and his mates by the wheel well done gulliver searched the captains face as if expecting a trap finding none he replied thankfully my first visit here as master sir their eyes met had the collision been any worse it would have been the last time for both of them bolitho was kept busy with his own men and had little time to watch the portuguese officers come aboard they looked resplendent in their proud uniforms and showed no discomfort in the blistering heat the town was almost hidden in mist and haze which gave it an added air of enchantment pale buildings and craft with colourful sails and a rig not unlike arab traders which bolitho had seen off the coast of africa dismiss the watch below mr bolitho pallisers brisk voice caught him off guard then stand by with the marine escort to accompany the captain ashore bolitho ducked thankfully beneath the quarterdeck and made his way aft in contrast with the upper deck it seemed almost cool in the gloom he all but collided with the surgeon as he clambered up from the maindeck he seemed unusually agitated and said i must see the captain i fear the brigantines master is dying bolitho went through the wardroom to his tiny cabin to collect his sword and his best hat for the journey ashore they had discovered little about the heloises master other than he was a dorset man named jacob triscott as bulkley had remarked previously it was not much incentive to stay alive when only the hangmans rope awaited him bolitho found that the news troubled him deeply to kill a man in selfdefence and in the line of duty was to be expected but now the man who had tried to cut him down was dying and the delay seemed unfair and without dignity rhodes stamped into the wardroom behind him im parched with all these visitors aboard ill be worn out in no time as bolitho came out of his cabin rhodes exclaimed what is it the brigantines master is dying i know he shrugged him or you its the only way to see it he added forget about it the lord and master will be the one to get annoyed he was banking on getting information from the wretch before he expired one way or another he followed bolitho through the screen door and together they looked forward to the waiting glare of the upper deck rhodes asked any luck with young jurys watch bolitho smiled grimly the captain told me to deal with it he would i expect hes forgotten about it by now but i must do something jury has had enough trouble already johns the captains personal coxswain dressed in his best blue jacket with gilt buttons strode past he saw bolitho and said gigs in the water sir youd best be there too rhodes clapped bolitho on the shoulder the lord and master would not take kindly to being kept waiting as bolitho was about to follow the coxswain rhodes said quietly look dick if youd like me to do something about that damned watch while youre ashore bolitho shook his head no but thank you the thief is most likely from my division to search every man and turn his possessions out on the deck would destroy whatever trust and loyalty ive managed to build up so far ill think of something rhodes said i just hope young jury has not merely mislaid the timepiece a loss is one thing a theft another they fell silent as they approached the starboard gangway where the sideparty had fallen in to pay its respects to the captain but dumaresq was standing with his thick legs apart his head jutting forward as he shouted to the surgeon no sir he shall not die not until i have the information bulkley spread his hands helplessly but the man is going sir there is nothing more i can do dumaresq looked at the waiting gig and at the quarterboat nearby with colpoys marine escort already crammed aboard he was expected at the viceroys residence and to delay might provoke bad feelings which he would certainly wish to avoid if he needed portuguese cooperation he swung on palliser dammityou deal with it tell that rogue triscott that if he will reveal the details of his mission and his original destination i shall send a letter to his parish in dorset it will ensure that he is remembered as an honest man impress upon him what that will mean to his family and his friends he glared at pallisers doubtful features god damn it mr palliser think of something will you palliser asked mildly and if he spits in my face ill hang him here and now and see how his family like that bulkley stepped forward be easy sir the man is dying he cannot hurt anyone go back to him and do as i say that is an order he turned to palliser tell mr timbrell to rig a halter to the mainyard ill run that bugger up to it dying or not if he refuses to help palliser followed him to the entry port it will be a signed declaration sir he nodded slowly ill get a witness and have his words written down for you dumaresq smiled tightly good man see to it he saw bolitho and snapped into the gig with you now let us see this viceroy eh once clear of the side dumaresq turned to study his ship his eyes almost closed against the reflected glare a fine surgeon is bulkley but a bit of an old woman at times anyone would think we are here for our health instead of seeking a hidden fortune bolitho tried to relax his buttocks burning on the sunheated thwart as he attempted to sit as squarely as his captain the brief confidence led him to ask will there really be any treasure sir he was careful to keep his voice low so that the stroke oarsman should not hear him dumaresq tightened his fingers around his sword hilt and stared at the land it is somewhere that i do know in what form it now is remains to be seen but that is why we are here why we were in madeira when i went to the house of a very old friend but something immense is happening because of it my clerk was killed because of it the heloise played the dangerous game of trying to follow us and now poor bulkley wants me to read a prayer for a rogue who may hold a vital clue a man who nearly killed my young and sentimental third lieutenant he turned and regarded bolitho curiously are you still in irons over jurys watch bolitho swallowed the captain had not forgotten after all i am going to deal with the matter sir just as soon as i can hmmm dont make a drudgery of it you are one of my officers if a crime is committed the culprit must be punished severely these poor fellows have barely a coin between them ill not see them abused by some common thief though god knows many of them began life like that dumaresq did not raise his voice nor look at his coxswain but said see what you can do johns it was all he said but bolitho sensed a powerful bond between the captain and his coxswain dumaresq stared toward the landingstairs there were more uniforms and some horses a carriage too probably to carry the visitors to the residency dumaresq pouted and said you can accompany me good experience for you he chuckled when the treasure shipasturias broke off the engagement all those thirty years ago it was later rumoured she entered rio it was also suggested that the portuguese authorities had a hand in what happened to the bullion he smiled broadly so some of the people on that jetty are probably more worried than i at this moment the bowman raised his boathook as with oars tossed the gig moved against the landingstairs with barely a quiver dumaresqs smile had gone now let us get on with it i want to get back as soon as possible and see how mr pallisers persuasion is progressing at the top of the stairs a file of colpoys marines their faces the colour of their coats in the blazing sunshine snapped to attention opposite them in white tunics with brilliant yellow trappings was a guard of portuguese soldiers dumaresq shook hands and bowed to several of the waiting dignitaries as greetings were formally exchanged and translated a crowd of onlookers stood watching nearby and bolitho was struck by the number of black faces amongst them slaves or servants from the big estates and plantations brought thousands of miles to this place where with luck they might be bought by a kind master if unlucky they would not last very long then dumaresq climbed into the carriage with three of the portuguese while others mounted their horses colpoys sheathed his sword and glared up at the viceroys residence on a lush hillside and complained we shall have to march dammit i am a marine not a bloody footsoldier by the time they reached the finelooking building bolitho was soaking with sweat while the marines were led to the rear of the house by a servant bolitho and colpoys were ushered into a highceilinged room with one side open to the sea and a garden of vivid blossoms and shady palms more servants softfooted and careful to keep their eyes averted from the two officers brought chairs and wine and above their heads a great fan began to sway back and forth colpoys stretched out his legs and swallowed the wine with relish sweet as a hymn in chapel bolitho smiled the portuguese officials the military and traders lived well here they would need something to sustain them against the heat and the risk of fever and death in a dozen forms but the wealth of the growing empire was said to be too vast to be assessed silver precious stones strange metals and miles of prospering sugar plantations no wonder they needed an army of slaves to satisfy the demands from faroff lisbon colpoys put down his glass and got to his feet in the time it had taken them to march up from the jetty to the residence dumaresq had apparently completed his business from his expression as he appeared through an arched doorway bolitho guessed he was far from satisfied dumaresq said we shall return to the ship the farewells were completed at the residence this time and bolitho began to realize that the viceroy was not in rio but would return as soon as he was told of destinys visit dumaresq explained as much as he strode into the sunlight touching his hat to the saluting guards as he went he growled in his resonant voice that means he insists i wait for his return i was not born yesterday bolitho these people are our oldest allies but some of them are not above a little piracy well viceroy or not when heloise catches up with us i shall weigh when im good and ready to colpoys he said march your men back as the scarlet coats moved away in a cloud of dust dumaresq climbed into the carriage you come with me when we reach the jetty i want you to take a message for me he pulled a small envelope from his coat i had it ready i always expect the worst the coachman will carry you there and i have no doubt the news of your visit will be all over the town within an hour he smiled grimly but the viceroy is not the only man with cunning as they clattered past colpoys and his sweating marines dumaresq said take a man with you he glanced at bolithos expectant face a bodyguard if you like i saw that prizefighting fellow in the quarterboat stockdale thats his name take him bolitho marvelled how could dumaresq contain so many things at once out there a man was dying and pallisers own life would not be worth much if he failed to obtain some information there was someone in rio who must be connected with the missing bullion but not the one for whom he was carrying dumaresqs letter there was a ship her people and the captured heloise and thousands of miles still lay ahead before they knew success or failure for a postcaptain of twentyeight dumaresq certainly carried a great burden on his shoulders it made jurys missing watch seem almost trivial a tall blackhaired halfcaste with a basket of fruit on her head paused to watch the carriage as it rolled past her bare shoulders were the colour of honey and she gave a bold smile as she saw them watching her dumaresq said a fine looking girl and a prouder pair of catheads i never did see it would be worth the risk of a painful payment later on just to relish her bolitho did not know what to say he was used to the coarse comments of sailors but from dumaresq it seemed vulgar and demeaning dumaresq waited for the carriage to stop be as fast as you can i intend to take on fresh water tomorrow and theres a lot to be done before that he strode to the stairs and vanished into his gig later with stockdale sitting opposite him and filling half the carriage bolitho directed his coachman to the address on the envelope dumaresq had thought of everything bolitho or any other stranger might have been stopped and questioned here but the sight of the carriage with the viceroys insignia on either door was enough to gain access anywhere the house where the carriage eventually pulled to a halt was a low building surrounded by a thick wall bolitho imagined it was one of rio s oldest houses with the additional luxury of a large garden and a welltended driveway to the entrance a negro servant greeted bolitho without a flicker of surprise and led him into a great circular entrance hall with some marble vases which contained flowers like those he had seen in the garden and several statues which stood in separate alcoves like amorous sentries bolitho hesitated in the centre of the hall uncertain of what to do next another servant passed eyes fixed on some distant object as he ignored the letter in bolithos hand stockdale rumbled ill go an stir their stumps for em sir a door opened noiselessly and bolitho saw a slightly built man in white breeches and a deeply frilled shirt watching him he asked are you from the ship bolitho stared he was english er yes sir i am lieutenant richard bolitho of his britannic the man came to meet him his hand outstretched i know the name of the ship lieutenant all rio knows it by now he led the way to a booklined room and offered him a chair as the door was closed by an unseen servant bolitho saw stockdale standing massively where he had left him ready to protect him to tear the house down brick by brick he suspected my name is jonathan egmont he smiled gently that will mean nothing to you you must be very young for your rank bolitho rested his hands on the arms of the chair heavy well carved like the house it had been here for a long time another door opened and a servant waited for the man named egmont to notice him some wine lieutenant bolithos mouth was like a kiln he said i would welcome a glass sir rest easy then while i read what your captain has to tell me bolitho glanced around the room as egmont walked to a desk and slit opened dumaresqs letter with a gold stiletto shelf upon shelf of books while on the floor were several richlooking carpets it was difficult to see very much because his eyes were still half blinded by the suns glare and anyway the windows were so heavily shaded that it was almost too dark to study his host an intelligent face he thought a man about sixty although he had heard that in such a climate men could age rapidly it was hard to guess what he was doing here or how dumaresq had discovered him egmont laid the letter carefully on the desk and looked across at bolitho your captain has said nothing of this to you he saw bolithos expression and shook his head no of course he would not and it was wrong of me to ask bolitho said he wished me to bring the letter without delay that is all i know i see for a few moments he looked unsure even apprehensive then he said i shall do what i can it will take time of course but with the viceroy away from his residence i have no doubt your captain will wish to remain for a while bolitho opened his mouth and then shut it as the door swung inwards and a woman entered the room carrying a tray he got to his feet very conscious of his crumpled shirt of his hair plastered to his forehead by the sweat of the journey set against what he was certain was the most beautiful creature he had ever seen he felt like a vagrant she was dressed all in white the waist of her gown nipped in with a thin golden belt her hair was jet black like his own and although held in check by a ribbon at the nape of her neck was arranged to fall on her shoulders the skin of which looked like silk she glanced at him and then studied him from top to toe her head slightly on one side egmont was also on his feet and said stiffly this is my wife lieutenant bolitho bowed i am honoured maam he did not know what to say she made him feel clumsy and unable to form his words and all without saying anything to him she placed the tray on a table and raised her hand towards him you are welcome here lieutenant you may kiss my hand bolitho took it feeling her softness her perfume which made his head spin her shoulders were bare and despite the darkened room he saw that she had violetcoloured eyes she was beautiful and more even her voice as she had offered her hand to him was exciting how could she be his wife she must be many years younger spanish or portuguese certainly not english bolitho would not have cared if she had just stepped from the moon he stammered richard bolitho maam she stood back and put her fingers to her mouth then she laughed bolitho i think it will be easier for me to call you lieutenant she swung her gown across the floor her eyes moving to her husband later i think i may call you richard egmont said i will write a letter for you to take with you lieutenant he seemed to be looking past even through her as if she was not there i will do what i can she turned to bolitho again please call on us while you are in rio our house is yours she gave a slow curtsy her eyes on his face until she said softly i have enjoyed our meeting then she was gone and bolitho sat down in the chair as if his legs had broken under him egmont said i shall be a few moments enjoy the wine while i put pen to paper eventually it was done and as he sealed the envelope with scarlet wax egmont remarked distantly memory has a long reach i have been here for many years and have rarely strayed but for the needs of my business then one day there comes a kings ship commanded by the son of a man once dear to me and now everything is changed he stopped abruptly and then said but you will be in a hurry to return to your duties he held out the letter i bid you good day stockdale eyed him curiously as he left the booklined room all done sir bolitho paused as another door opened and he saw her standing there her gown making her look like another perfect statue against the dark room beyond she did not speak or even smile but just looked at him directly as if bolitho thought she was already committing herself to something then her hand moved and stayed momentarily at her breast and bolitho felt his heart pounding as if trying to join hers in her hand the door closed and he could almost believe he had imagined it or that the wine had been too strong he glanced at stockdale and saw the look on his battered face and knew it was no lie we had better get back to the ship stockdale stockdale followed him towards the sunlight not a bit too soon he thought it was dusk by the time the boat from the landingstairs made fast to the main chains bolitho climbed up to and through the entry port thinking of the beautiful woman in the white gown rhodes was waiting with the sideparty and whispered quickly the first lieutenant is looking for you dick lay aft mr bolitho pallisers brusque tones silenced rhodes before he could say more bolitho climbed to the quarterdeck and touched his hat sir palliser snapped i have been waiting for you yes sir but the captain ordered me on an errand and a fine time it has taken you bolitho controlled his sudden anger with an effort whatever he did or tried to do palliser was never satisfied he said quietly well sir i am here now palliser peered at him as if to seek out some kind of insolence then he said during your absence ashore the masteratarms who was acting upon my orders searched some of the peoples messes he waited for bolitho to react i do not know what kind of discipline you are trying to instil into your division but let me assure you it will take a lot more than a bribe of spirits and wine to achieve it mr jurys watch was found in the possession of one of your maintopmen murray so what say you bolitho stared at him incredulously murray had saved jurys life but for his swift action on the heloises deck that night the midshipman would be dead and if jury had not thrown the sword to replace bolithos lost hanger he too would be a corpse it had been their bond of which none of them had spoken he protested murray is a good hand sir i cannot see him as a thief im certain of that but you have a lot to learn mr bolitho men like murray would not dream of thieving from a messmate but an officer even a lowly midshipman is fair game he controlled his voice with an obvious effort but that is not the worst part mr jury had the impertinence the monstrous audacity to tell me he had given the watch to murray as a gift can you even you mr bolitho believe it i can believe he said it to save murray sir he was wrong but i can well understand just as i thought he leaned forward i will see that mr jury is put ashore for passage to england the moment we are in company with some higher authority and what do you think of that bolitho said hotly i think you are acting unfairly he could feel his anger giving way to despair palliser had tried to provoke him but this time it had got suddenly out of hand he said if you are trying to discredit me through mr jury then you are succeeding but even to contemplate it knowing he has no family and that he will give his very soul to the navy is damnable and if i were you sir id be sick with shame palliser stared at him as if he had been struck you what a small figure bobbed from the shadows it was macmillan the captains servant he said beg pardon gentlemen but the capn would like you in is cabin at once he shrank back as if expecting to be knocked senseless dumaresq was standing in the centre of the daycabin legs apart hands on hips as he glared at his two lieutenants ill not have you brawling on my quarterdeck like a pair of louts what in hells name has got into you palliser looked shocked even pale as he said if you had heard what mr bolitho said sir heard heard dumaresq jabbed one fist towards the skylight id have thought the whole ship heard well enough he looked at bolitho how dare you show insubordination to the first lieutenant you will obey him without question discipline is paramount if we are not to become a shambles i expect no i demand that the ship is at all times ready to act as i dictate to bicker over some petty matter within earshot of anyone present is a madness and ill not tolerate it he examined bolithos face and added in a calmer tone it must not happen again palliser tried again i was telling him sir he fell silent as the compelling eyes turned on him like lamps you are my first lieutenant and i shall uphold what you do under my command but i will not have you using your temper on those too junior to hit back you are an experienced and skilled officer whereas mr bolitho is new to the wardroom as for mr jury he knows nothing of the sea but that which he has learned since we left plymouth would you say that is a fair assessment palliser swallowed hard his head bowed beneath the beams as if he was in prayer yes sir good that is something we agree upon dumaresq walked to the stern windows and stared at the reflected lights on the water mr palliser you will pursue the matter of the theft i do not wish a useful hand like murray punished if he is innocent on the other side of the coin ill not see him evade it if he is guilty the whole ship knows what has happened if he walks free from this because of our inability to discover the truth there will be no controlling the real troublemakers and sealawyers amongst us he held out his hand to bolitho you have a letter for me i expect as he took it he added slowly deal with mr jury it is up to you to treat him fairly but severely it will be as much a test for you as it is for him he nodded dismissed as bolitho closed the door behind him he heard dumaresq say that was a fine statement you took from triscott it makes up for the earlier setback palliser mumbled something and dumaresq replied one more piece and the puzzle may be solved more quickly than i thought bolitho moved away conscious of the sentrys eyes as they followed him into the shadows he entered the wardroom and sat down carefully like a man who has just fallen from a horse poad said somethin to drink sir bolitho nodded although he had barely heard he saw bulkley seated against one of the ships great timbers and asked is the heloises master dead bulkley looked up wearily and waited for his eyes to focus aye he passed away within minutes of putting his name to the statement the surgeons voice was very slurred i hope it was worth it colpoys came from his cabin and threw one elegant whiteclad leg over a stool i am growing sick of this place anchored right out here nothing to do he looked from bolitho to bulkley and said wryly i was wrong it seems here we have gaiety aplenty bulkley sighed i heard most of it triscott was making the one voyage as master it seems he was ordered to join us at funchal and determine what we were about he accidentally knocked over a goblet of brandy but did not appear to notice as the spirit ran over his legs having seen us on our way he was supposed to head for the caribbean and hand over the vessel to her new owner the one who had paid for her to be built he coughed and dabbed his chin with a red handkerchief stead o that he got too nosey and tried to follow us he peered vaguely aft as if to seek dumaresq through the bulkhead imagine that the mouse hunting the tiger well now hes paid for it in full colpoys asked impatiently well then who is this mysterious buyer of brigantines bulkley turned towards the marine as if it hurt him to move i thought you were cleverer than that sir piers garrick o course onetime privateer in the kings name and a damned pirate in his own rhodes entered the wardroom and said i heard that i suppose we should have known as the lord and master was so careful to mention him all those years ago he must be over sixty now and dyou really believe he still knows what happened to the asturiass bullion colpoys said wearily the sawbones has dozed off stephen poad who had been hovering close by said fresh pork tonight gentlemen sent off shore with the compliments of a mr egmont he waited for just the right moment the boatman said it was to mark mr bolithos visit to is ouse bolitho flushed as they all stared at him colpoys shook his head sadly my god weve only just arrived here and i see a womans hand in all this rhodes took him aside as gulliver joined colpoys and the purser at the table was he hard on you dick i lost my temper bolitho smiled ruefully i think we all did good stand up to him dont forget what i said he made sure nobody else was listening ive told jury to wait for you in the chartroom youll be uninterrupted there for a while get it over with ive been through all this myself he sniffed and exclaimed i can smell that pork dick you must have influence bolitho made his way forward to the small chartroom which was just beside the main companion he saw jury standing by the empty table probably seeing his career wiped away like gullivers calculations bolitho said i was told what you did murray s case will be investigated the captain has given his word you will not be put ashore when we join the nearest squadron you are staying in destiny he heard jurys quick intake of breath and said so its up to you now ii dont know what to say sir bolitho could feel his determination crumbling he had once been like jury and knew what it was like to face apparent disaster he made himself say you did wrong you told a lie to protect a man who may well be guilty he silenced jurys attempted protest it was not your place to act for one in a way you might not have acted for another i was equally at fault if i was to be asked if i would have cared as much if murray had been one of the bad apples in the barrel or had you been like one of the other midshipmen i should have had to admit to being biased jury said tightly i am sorry for the trouble i have caused especially to you bolitho faced him for the first time seeing the pain in his eyes i know we have both learned something from all this he hardened his tone if not we are neither of us fit to wear the kings coat carry on to your berth if you please he heard jury leave the chartroom and waited for several minutes to recover his composure he had acted correctly even if he had been late in future jury would be on his guard and less willing to depend on others heroworship the captain had termed it bolitho sighed and walked to the wardroom rhodes looked up at him as he opened the door his eyes questioning bolitho shrugged it was not easy it never is rhodes grinned and twitched his nose again it will be a delayed dinner because of the porks late arrival in our midst but i feel the waiting will put a worthwhile edge to the appetite bolitho took a goblet of wine from poad and sat in a chair it was better to be like rhodes he thought live for today with no care for the next horizon and what it might bring that way you never got hurt he thought of jurys dismayed features and knew otherwise divided loyalties two more days passed with no sign that the portuguese viceroy had returned or if he had that he intended to receive dumaresq sweltering under a blazing sun the seamen went about their work with little enthusiasm tempers flared and on several occasions men were taken aft to be awarded punishment and as the bell chimed each passing watch dumaresq whenever he appeared on the quarterdeck seemed to be growing more intolerant and angry a seaman was given extra work merely for staring at him and midshipman ingrave who had been acting as his clerk was sent back to his normal shipboard duties with too stupid to hold a pen still ringing in his unhappy ears even bolitho who had little experience of the politics used in foreign ports was aware of destinys enforced isolation a few hopeful craft hovered near the ship with local wares for barter but were openly discouraged by the vigilant guardboat and there had certainly been no message sent by the man called egmont samuel codd the purser had gone aft to complain about his inability to preserve his supply of fresh fruit and half of the ship must have heard dumaresqs fury break over him like a tidal wave what do you take me for you miser dyou think i have nothing to do but buy and sell like a common tinker take a boat and get ashore yourself and this time tell the merchant the stores are for me his powerful voice had pursued codd from the cabin and dont return emptyhanded in the wardroom the atmosphere was little changed the usual grumbles and exaggerated yarns about what had happened during the daily routine only when palliser appeared did the climate become formal even strained bolitho had seen murray and had confronted him with the accusation of theft murray had firmly denied any part of it and had pleaded with bolitho to speak on his behalf bolitho was deeply impressed by the mans sincerity murray was more resentful at the prospect of an unjust flogging than fearful but that would come unless something could be proved poynter the masteratarms was adamant he had discovered the watch in murray s dittybox during a quick search of several messes anybody could have put it there but what was the point it was obvious that something would be done to discover the missing watch a careful thief would have hidden it in one of a hundred secret places it did not make any sense on the evening of the second day the brigantine heloise was sighted heading for the land her sails shining in the dying sunlight as she completed a leisurely tack for the final approach dumaresq watched her with his telescope and was heard to mutter taking his damn time hell have to do better if he wants promotion rhodes said have you noticed dick the freshwater lighters have not been sent out to us as promised our stocks must be running low no wonder the lord and master grows pink with anger bolitho recalled what dumaresq had told him that destiny was to take on water the day after anchoring he had forgotten with so much else to occupy his thoughts mr rhodes dumaresq strode to the quarterdeck rail signal heloise to anchor in the outer roadstead mr sladell not likely attempt an entrance in the dark but just to be sure send a boat with my instructions to moor clear of the headland the trill of calls brought the boats crew running aft there were several groans when they saw how far the brigantine was standing from the land a long hard pull in two directions rhodes sought out the midshipman of the watch mr lovelace go with the boat he kept his face straight as he looked at bolitho damned midshipmen eh dick must keep em busy mr bolitho dumaresq was watching him come here if you please bolitho hurried aft until they were both at the taffrail well out of earshot of everyone i have to tell you that mr palliser is unable to discover any other culprit he watched bolitho closely that troubles you i see yes sir i have no proof either but i am convinced murray is innocent ill wait until we are at sea then punishment will be carried out it does no good to flog men before the eyes of foreigners bolitho waited knowing there was more to come dumaresq shaded his eyes to stare up at the masthead pendant a fair breeze then he said i shall need another clerk there is more writing and copying in a manofwar than powder and shot his tone hardened or fresh water for that matter bolitho stiffened as palliser came aft and then paused as if at an invisible line dumaresq said we are done what is it mr palliser boat approaching sir he did not look at bolitho it is the same one which brought the pork for cabin and wardroom dumaresqs brows lifted really that interests me he turned on his heel then said i shall be in my quarters and on the matter of my clerk i have decided to put the surgeons new helper spillane to the task he seems educated and welldisposed to his betters and ill not spoil the good surgeon by overloading him with aid he has enough loblolly boys to run his sickbay palliser touched his hat so be it sir bolitho walked to the larboard gangway to watch the approaching boat without a glass he could see no one aboard he recognized he felt like mocking himself for his stupidity what had he expected that the man jonathan egmont would be coming out to see the captain or that his lovely wife would take the fatiguing and uncomfortable journey just to wave to him he was being ridiculous childish perhaps he had been at sea too long or his last visit to falmouth which had brought so much unhappiness had left him open to fantasy and impossible dreams the boat came to the main chains and after a great deal of sign language between the oarsmen and a boatswains mate an envelope was passed up to rhodes and then carried aft to the cabin the boat waited idling a few yards from the frigates hull the oliveskinned oarsmen watching the busy sailors and marines and probably assessing the strength of destinys broadside eventually rhodes returned to the entry port and handed another envelope down to the boats coxswain he saw bolitho watching and crossed to join him by the hammock nettings i know you will be sorry to hear this dick he could not prevent his mouth from quivering but we are invited ashore to dine tonight i believe you know the house already who will be going bolitho tried to control his sudden anxiety rhodes grinned the lord and master all of his lieutenants and out of courtesy the surgeon bolitho exclaimed i cannot believe it surely the captain would never leave his ship without at least one lieutenant aboard he looked round as dumaresq appeared on deck would he dumaresq shouted fetch macmillan and my new clerk spillane he sounded different almost jubilant i shall require my gig in half an hour rhodes hurried away as dumaresq added loudly i want you and mr bolitho and our gallant redcoat ready and presentable at that rime he smiled the surgeon too he strode away as his servant scurried in his wake like a terrier bolitho looked at his hands they appeared steady enough and yet like his heart they seemed to be out of control in the wardroom there was complete confusion as poad and his assistants tried to produce clean shirts pressed uniform coats and generally attempted to transform their charges from sea officers into gentlemen colpoys had his own orderly and was cursing like a trooper as the man struggled with his gleaming boots while he examined himself in a handmirror bulkley as owllike and crumpled as ever muttered hes only taking me because of the wrong he did in my sickbay palliser snapped for gods sake he probably doesnt trust you alone in the ship gulliver was obviously delighted to be left aboard in temporary command after the long passage from funchal he had seemingly gathered more confidence and anyway he hated the ways of the quality as he had once confided to codd bolitho was the first at the entry port he saw jury taking over the watch on the quarterdeck their eyes met and then moved on it would all be different once the ship was at sea again working together would drive away the differences except that there was still murray s fate to be considered dumaresq came on deck and inspected his officers good quite good he looked down at his gig alongside at the oarsmen in their best checked shirts and tarred hats with his coxswain ready and waiting well done johns bolitho thought of the other time he had gone ashore here with dumaresq how he had casually asked johns to look into the matter of jurys missing watch johns as captains coxswain was held in great respect by the petty officers and senior hands a word in the right place and a hint to the masteratarms who never needed much encouragement when it came to harrying the people and a swift search had done the rest into the boat in strict order of seniority and watched from the gangway by several of the offduty seamen destinys officers descended into the gig last of all resplendent in his goldlaced coat with the white lapels dumaresq took his place in the sternsheets as the boat moved carefully away from the frigates hull rhodes said may i say sir how grateful we are to be invited dumaresqs teeth showed very white in the gloom i asked all my officers to join me mr rhodes because we are of one company his grin broadened also it suits my purpose for the folk ashore to know we are all present rhodes answered lamely i see sir clearly he did not in spite of his earlier misgivings and worries bolitho settled down and watched the lights on the land he was going to enjoy himself in a foreign exotic country which he would remember and describe in detail when he returned to falmouth no other thought would interfere with this evening then he recalled the way she had looked at him when he had left the house and felt his resolve giving way it was absurd he told himself but with that glance she had made him feel like a man bolitho stared along the loaded table and wondered how he would manage to do justice to so many glistening dishes he was already wishing he had heeded pallisers curt advice as they had climbed ashore from the gig theyll try to make you drunk so take care and that had been nearly two hours ago it did not seem possible the room was large with a curved ceiling and hung around with colourful tapestries the whole made even more impressive by hundreds of candles glittering chandeliers at regular intervals overhead while along the tables length were some candelabra which must be solid gold bolitho thought the destinys officers had been carefully seated and made patches of blue and white separated by the richer clothing of the other guests they were all portuguese most of whom spoke little english and shouted at one another to demand an instant translation or a means of making a point clear to the visitors the commandant of the shore batteries a great hogshead of a man was matched only by dumaresq in voice and appetite occasionally he would lean towards one of the ladies and bellow with laughter or thump the table with his fist to emphasize his remarks a parade of servants came and went ushering an endless procession of dishes which ranged from succulent fish to steaming platters of beef and all the time the wine continued to flow wine from their homeland or from spain sharptasting german hocks and mellow bottles from france egmont was certainly generous and bolitho had the impression that he was drinking little as he watched over his guests with an attentive smile on his lips it was almost too painful to look at egmonts wife at the opposite end of the table she had nodded to bolitho when he had arrived but little else and now squashed between a portuguese shipchandler and a wrinkled lady who never seemed to stop eating even to draw breath bolitho felt ignored and lost but just to look at her was breathtaking again she was dressed in white against which her skin seemed golden by contrast the gown was cut very low across her breasts and around her neck she wore a doubleheaded aztec bird with trailing tail feathers which rhodes had knowledgeably identified as rubies as she turned her head to speak with her guests the ruby tails danced between her breasts and bolitho swallowed another glass of claret without realizing what he had done colpoys was already half drunk and was describing in some length to his lady companion how he had once been caught in a womans chamber by her husband palliser on the other hand seemed unchanged eating steadily but sparingly and careful to keep his glass always half filled rhodes was less sure of himself now his voice thicker his gestures more vague than when the meal had begun the surgeon held his food and drink very well but was sweating badly as he tried to listen to the halting english of a portuguese official and answer a question from the mans wife at the same time dumaresq was incredible he turned nothing away and yet seemed completely at ease his resonant voice reaching along the table to keep a lagging conversation alive or to arouse one of his worse for wear officers bolithos elbow slipped from the table and he almost fell forward amongst the decimated dishes the shock helped to steady him to realize just how badly the drink had taken effect never again never never again he heard egmont announce i think gentlemen if the ladies are about to withdraw we should transfer to a cooler room somehow bolitho managed to get to his feet in time to assist the wrinkled lady from her chair she was still chewing as she followed the others through a door to leave the men at their ease a servant opened another door and waited for egmont to lead his guests into a room which looked out over the sea thankfully bolitho walked on to the terrace and leaned on a stone balustrade after the heat of the candles and the power of the wine the air was like water from a mountain stream he looked at the moon and then across the anchorage where the lights from destinys open gunports glittered on the water as if the ship was burning the surgeon joined him by the balustrade and said heavily that was a meal of substance my boy he belched enough to feed a village for a month just imagine it all that way from france or spain no expense spared when you consider some people are lucky to get a loaf of bread it makes you wonder bolitho looked at him he had thought about it although not from the point of injustice how could a man like egmont a stranger in this foreign land make so much wealth enough to obtain anything he wanted even a beautiful wife who must be half his age the doubleheaded bird about her throat was gold a fortune in its own right was that part of the asturias s treasure egmont had known dumaresqs father but had obviously never met his son before they had barely spoken when you thought about it and when they had it seemed to be through one of the others light and trivial bulkley leaned forward and adjusted his spectacles theres a workhungry master eh cant wait for the morning tide bolitho turned and looked at the anchorage his practised eye soon discovered the moving vessel in spite of the queasiness in his stomach a vessel under way her sails making a flitting shadow against the riding lights of other anchored craft as she headed out into the roadstead bulkley said vaguely local man must be any strangerd go aground here palliser called from the open doorway come in and join us bulkley chuckled always a generous fellow when its someone elses cellar but bolitho remained where he was there was enough noise coming from the room anyway laughter and the clink of glasses and colpoys voice rising higher and higher above the rest bolitho knew his absence would not be noticed he walked along the moonlit terrace letting the sea air cool his face as he passed another room he heard dumaresqs voice very close and very insistent i did not come all this way to be fobbed off with excuses egmont you were in it up to the neck right from the beginning my father said as much before he died the contempt in his voice was like a whip my fathers gallant first lieutenant who held off when he was sorely needed bolitho knew he should draw back but he could not move the tone of dumaresqs voice seemed to chill his spine it was something which had been pentup for years and now could not be restrained egmont protested lightly i did not know you must believe me i was fond of your father i served him well and always admired him dumaresqs voice was muffled he must have turned away with impatience as bolitho had seen him do often enough aboard ship well my father whom you so much admired died a pauper but then what could you expect for a discarded seacaptain with one arm and one leg eh but he kept your secret egmont he at least understood the meaning of loyalty this could be the end of everything for you are you threatening me sir in my own home the viceroy respects me and will soon have something to say if i choose to complain really dumaresq sounded dangerously calm piers garrick was a pirate of gentle birth maybe but a bloody pirate for all his manners if the truth had leaked out about the asturias even his letter of marque would not have saved his neck the treasure ship put up a good fight and garricks privateer was severely damaged then the don struck his colours probably did not realize that garricks hull was so badly shot through that was the worst thing he ever did in his life bolitho waited holding his breath fearful that the sudden silence meant they had somehow discovered his presence then dumaresq added quietly garrick scuttled his own command and took control of the asturias he probably butchered most of the spaniards or left them to rot somewhere where they could not be found it was all made so simple for him he sailed the treasure ship into this port on some excuse or other england and spain were at war asturias would be allowed to remain here for a short while outwardly to effect repairs but really to prove she was afloat after garricks alleged encounter with her egmont said shakily that is surmise is it let me continue and then you shall decide if you intend to call for the viceroys aid his voice was so scathing that bolitho could almost feel pity for egmont dumaresq continued a certain english ship was sent to investigate the loss of garricks vessel and the escape of the treasure which should rightfully have been a kings prize that ship was commanded by my father you as his senior were sent to take a statement from garrick who must have realized that without your connivance he was for the gallows but his name was cleared and while he gathered up his gold from where he had hidden it after destroying the asturias you resigned from the navy and quite mysteriously rose to the surface right here in rio where it all began but this time you were a rich man a very rich man my father on the other hand continued to serve then in when he was with rearadmiral rodney at martinique driving the french from their caribbean islands he was cruelly wounded broken for life there is a moral in that surely what do you want me to do he sounded dazed stunned by the completeness of dumaresqs victory i shall require a sworn testimony to confirm what i have just said i intend to enlist the viceroys aid if need be and a warrant will then be sent from england the rest you can well imagine for yourself with your statement and the power invested in me by his majesty and their lordships i intend to arrest sir piers garrick and take him to england for trial i want that bullion or what is left of it but most of all i want him but why do you treat me like this i had no part in what happened to your father at martinique i was not then in the navy you know that yourself piers garrick was supplying weapons and military stores to the french garrisons at martinique and guadeloupe but for him my father might have been spared and but for you garrick would not have had the chance to betray his country a second time ii must have time to think to it has all run out egmont all thirty years of it i require to know garricks whereabouts and what he is doing anything you can tell me about the bullion anything if i am satisfied i will sail from here and you shall not see me again if not he left the rest unsaid egmont said can i trust you my father trusted you dumaresq gave a short laugh choose bolitho pressed his shoulders against the wall and stared up at the stars dumaresqs energy was not merely inspired by duty and an eagerness for action hate had kept him sifting vague information hate had made him hunt down the key which would unlock the mystery surrounding garricks rise to power no wonder the admiralty had selected dumaresq for the task the added spur of revenge would put him leagues ahead of any other captain a door banged open and bolitho heard rhodes singing and then protesting as he was dragged bodily back into the room he walked slowly along the terrace his mind reeling from what he had heard the enormity of the secret was unsettling how could he go about his duties without giving away what he had discovered dumaresq would see through him in seconds he was suddenly completely sober the dullness gone from his mind like a sea mist what would become of her if dumaresq carried out his threat he swung angrily on his heel and made his way towards the open doors when he entered he realized that some of the guests had already gone and the commandant of the batteries was bowing almost to the floor as he swept his hat across his corpulent belly egmont was there with his wife his face pale but otherwise impassive dumaresq too seemed as before nodding to the departing portuguese kissing the gloved hand of the chandlers lady it was like seeing two different people from the ones he had overheard just a few rooms away dumaresq said i think my officers are unanimous in their delight at your table mr egmont his glance settled on bolitho for a second no more but bolitho sensed the question as if it had been shouted aloud i hope we can repay your kindness but duty is duty as you will know from experience bolitho glanced round but nobody had noticed the sudden tension between egmont and the captain egmont turned away and said we will say goodnight gentlemen his wife came forward her eyes in shadow as she held out her hand to dumaresq it is goodmorning now no he smiled and kissed her hand you are a delight to see at any hour maam his gaze lingered on her bared bosom and bolitho flushed as he recalled what dumaresq had said about the girl who had watched their carriage she smiled at the captain her eyes clear now in the candlelight then i think you have seen enough for one day sir dumaresq laughed and took his hat from a servant while the others made their farewells rhodes was carried bodily from the house and laid in a waiting carriage a blissful smile on his face palliser muttered damned disgrace colpoys whose pride was the only thing which prevented his collapsing like rhodes exclaimed thickly a fine night maam he bowed and almost fell over egmont said tersely i think you had better go inside aurora it grows damp and chill bolitho stared at her aurora what an exquisite name he retrieved his hat and made to follow the others well now lieutenant have you nothing to say to me she looked at him as she had the first time her head slightly on one side he saw it in her eyes the dare the challenge i am sorry maam she held out her hand you must not apologize so often i wish we had had more time to speak but there were so many she tossed her head and the ruby tails flashed on her bosom i hope you were not too bored bolitho realized that she had removed her long white glove before she offered her hand he held her fingers and said i was not bored i was in despair there is a difference she withdrew her hand and bolitho thought he had ruined everything by his clumsiness but she was looking at her husband who was listening to bulkleys parting words then she said softly we cannot have you in despair lieutenant now can we she looked at him steadily her eyes very bright it would never do bolitho bowed and murmured may i see you egmont called come along the others are leaving he shook bolithos hand do not delay your captain it does not pay bolitho walked out to one of the waiting carriages and climbed inside she knew and understood and now after what he had overheard she would need a friend he stared blindly into the darkness remembering her voice the warm touch of her fingers aurora he started realizing he had spoken her name aloud but he need not have bothered his companions were already fast asleep she was twisting in his arms laughing and provoking him as he tried to hold her to feel the touch of her bare shoulder against his lips bolitho awoke gasping in his cot his head throbbing wildly as he blinked at the lantern above his face it was yeames masters mate his eyes curious as he watched the lieutenants confusion his reluctance to let go of a dream bolitho asked what time is it yeames grinned unsympathetically dawn sir the ands is just turnin to to olystone and scrub down he added as an afterthought the capn wants you bolitho rolled out of his cot and kept his feet well apart on the deck for fear of falling the brief respite on egmonts cool terrace had gone and his head felt as if it contained a busy anvil while his throat tasted vile dawn yeames had said he had not been in his cot for more than two hours in the next cabin he heard rhodes groaning as if in agony and then yelping in protest as an unknown seaman dropped something heavy on the quarterdeck overhead yeames prompted better urry sir bolitho tugged on his breeches and groped for his shirt which had been tossed in one corner of the tiny space trouble yeames shrugged depends wot you mean by trouble sir to him bolitho was still a stranger and an unknown quantity to share what he knew merely because bolitho was worried would be stupid bolitho found his hat and tugging on his coat he hurried through the wardroom and blundered aft towards the cabin the sentry called third lieutenant sir and macmillan the captains servant opened the screen door as if he had been waiting behind it bolitho stepped through into the after cabin and saw dumaresq by the stern windows his hair was awry and he looked as if he had not found time to undress after his return from egmonts house in a corner by the quarter windows spillane the newly appointed clerk was scratching away with his pen trying to show no concern at being called at such an early hour the other two present were gulliver the master and midshipman jury dumaresq glared at bolitho you should have come immediately i do not expect my officers to dress as if they are going to a ball when i need them bolitho glanced down at his crumpled shirt and twisted stockings also with his hat clamped beneath one arm his hair was falling over his face just as it had been on the pillow hardly suitable for a ball dumaresq said during my absence ashore your seaman murray escaped he was not in his cell but being taken to the sickbay because he had complained about a severe pain in his stomach he turned his wrath on the master god damn it mr gulliver it was obvious what he was doing gulliver licked his lips i was in charge of the ship sir it was my responsibility i saw no cause for murray to suffer an the man not yet found guilty as charged midshipman jury said the message was brought aft to me sir it was my fault dumaresq replied tersely speak when you are addressed it was not your fault because midshipmen do not have responsibility neither do they possess the wit or the brains to be in a position to say what this or that man shall do his eyes trained round on gulliver again tell mr bolitho the rest gulliver said harshly the ships corporal was escorting him when murray pushed him down he was outboard and swimming for the shore before the alarm was raised he looked downcast and humiliated at having to repeat his explanation for a junior lieutenants benefit dumaresq said so there it is your trust in that man was wasted he escaped a flogging but when he is taken he will hang he glanced at spillane note it in the log run bolitho looked at jurys dismay there were only three ways for a man to quit the navy and they were noted as r d or dd run implied desertion d stood for discharged murray s next entry would be the last dischargeddead and all because of a watch and yet in spite of the disappointment over his trust in murray bolitho was strangely relieved at what had happened the punishment for a man he had known and liked who had saved jurys life was no longer a threat and its aftermath of suspicion and bitterness had been averted dumaresq said slowly so be it mr bolitho you will remain the others may carry on macmillan closed the door behind jury and gulliver the masters shoulders were stiff with resentment dumaresq asked hard you are thinking but it may prevent weakness later on he calmed as only he could the rage falling away without apparent effort i am glad you carried yourself well last night mr bolitho i hope you kept your eyes and ears open the sentrys musket thumped on the deck again first lieutenant sir bolitho watched as palliser entered the cabin his routine list of work for the day beneath his arm he looked gaunter than usual as he said the water lighters may come out to us today sir so i shall tell mr timbrell to be prepared two men are to see you for promotion and there is the question of punishment for the ships corporal for negligence and allowing murray to desert his eyes moved to bolitho and he gave a curt nod bolitho wondered if it was mere chance that palliser always seemed to be nearby whenever he was with the captain very well mr palliser though ill believe those water lighters when i see them he looked at bolitho go and put your appearance to rights and take yourself ashore mr egmont has a letter for me i believe he gave a wry smile do not dally too long although i know there are many distractions in rio bolitho felt his face going hot aye sir ill leave directly he hurried from the cabin and heard dumaresq say young devil but there was no malice in his voice twenty minutes later bolitho was sitting in the jollyboat being pulled ashore he saw that stockdale was acting as the boats coxswain but did not question him on this stockdale seemed to make friends easily although his fearsome appearance might also have something to do with his apparent freedom of movement stockdale called hoarsely easy all the oars rose dripping in the rowlocks and bolitho realized that the jollyboat was losing way in order not to be run down by another vessel she was a brig a sturdy wellused vessel with patched canvas and many a scrape on her hull to mark encounters with sea and weather she had already spread her topsails and there were men sliding down backstays to the deck to set the forecourse before she cleared the rest of the anchored vessels nearby she moved slowly between destinys jollyboat and some incoming fishermen her shadow falling across the watching oarsmen as they rested on their looms and waited to proceed bolitho read her name across the counter rosario one of hundreds of such craft which daily risked storm and other dangers to trade and to extend the outposts of a growing empire stockdale growled give way all bolitho was about to turn his attention to the shore when he saw a movement at the stern windows above the name rosario for an instant he imagined he was mistaken but he was not the same black hair and oval face she was too far off for him to see the violet of her eyes but he saw her looking towards him before the brig changed tack and the sunlight made the windows into a fiery mirror he was heavyhearted when he reached the house with the ageold wall around it egmonts steward told him coolly that his master had departed his wife too he did not know their destination bolitho returned to the ship and reported to dumaresq expecting a further eruption of fury at this latest setback palliser was with him as bolitho blurted out what he had discovered although he did not mention he had seen egmonts wife in the rosario he did not need to dumaresq said the only vessel to leave here was the brig he must be aboard once a damned traitor always a traitor well hell not escape this time by god no palliser said gravely so this was the reason for the delay sir no fresh water no audience with the viceroy they had us over a gate he sounded suddenly bitter we cant move and they know it surprisingly dumaresq gave a great grin then he shouted macmillan i want a shave and a bath spillane prepare to write some orders for mr palliser he walked to the stern windows and leaned on the sill his massive head lowered towards the rudder select some prime seamen mr palliser and transfer to the heloise do not rouse the guardboats attention with too much fuss so take no marines weigh and chase that damned brig and dont lose her bolitho watched the change in the man it explained why dumaresq had stopped slade from entering the protected anchorage he had anticipated something like this and had a trick to play as always pallisers mind was already busy and you sir dumaresq watched his servant as he prepared a bowl and razor by his favourite chair water or no water mr palliser i shall weigh tonight and come after you palliser eyed him doubtfully the battery might open fire sir in daylight maybe but there is a lot of socalled honour at stake here i intend to test it he turned away dismissing them but added take the third lieutenant i shall require rhodes even if his head is still falling apart from his drinking to assume your duties here at any other time bolitho would have welcomed the offer gladly but he had seen the look in pallisers eyes and remembered the face at the brigs cabin windows she would despise him after this like the dream it was over the chase lieutenant charles palliser strode to the heloises compass box and then consulted the masthead pendant to confirm his fears slade the actingmaster said dourly the winds backed a piece but its also falling away bolitho watched pallisers reactions and compared him with dumaresq the captain was in rio aboard destiny outwardly dealing with the ships affairs even to the extent of seeing two seamen who had been put up for promotion fresh water the prospect of a summons from the portuguese viceroy it would mean nothing to most of the frigates company but bolitho knew what was really uppermost in dumaresqs thoughts egmonts refusal to yield and his sudden departure in the brig rosario without egmont dumaresq would have little choice but to seek higher naval authority for instructions and in that time the scent would go cold slade had said that the brig had been steering northnortheast as she had cleared the roadstead egmont was heading along the coast probably all the way to the caribbean in a small trading vessel like that it would be extremely uncomfortable for his lovely wife palliser crossed to his side on the brigantines confined deck he looked like a giant but unusually content bolitho thought palliser was free of his captains word could act as he pleased always provided he did not lose the rosario and with the wind dropping fast that was a possibility he said theyll not be expecting a chase that is all we have on our side he glanced up irritated as the forecourse boomed and flapped empty of wind and allowing the heat to seek out the men on deck damn then he said mr slade says the brig will stay inshore unless the wind shifts i accept that we shall continue as we are change the lookouts as you think fit and have the weapons which are still aboard this vessel inspected he clasped his hands behind him dont work the people too hard he saw the surprise on bolithos face and gave a thin smile they will have to take to the oars shortly i intend to warp heloise with the boats theyll need all their muscle for that bolitho touched his hat and walked forward he should have guessed but he had to confess admiration for pallisers preparations he thought of everything he saw jury and midshipman ingrave waiting for him by the foremast jury looked tense but ingrave who was a year older could barely conceal his delight at being freed from his task of actingclerk for the captain beyond them were other familiar faces amongst the hastily selected hands josh little gunners mate his stomach hanging over his cutlassbelt ellis pearse boatswains mate a bushybrowed man who had shown the same satisfaction as bolitho that murray had deserted pearse would have been the man to flog him and he had always liked murray and of course there was stockdale his thick arms folded over his chest as he surveyed the brigantines deck remembering perhaps that fierce desperate struggle when bolitho had fought hand to hand with the vessels master dutchy vorbink foretopman who had left the east india company and exchanged their ordered and wellpaid life for that of a manofwar he spoke little english unless he wanted to so nobody had discovered his true reason for volunteering there were faces which had now become people to bolitho some coarse and brutalized others who would brawl with the best of them but were equally quick to put right a wrong for a less outspoken messmate bolitho said mr spillane examine the arms chest and make a list of weapons little you had better go through the magazine he looked around at the few swivel guns two of which had been sent across from destiny hardly enough to start a war it brought a few grins and chuckles and stockdale muttered theres still some prisoners battened below sir bolitho looked at little he had forgotten about the heloises original company those not killed or wounded had been detained here safe enough but in the event of trouble they would have to be watched little showed his uneven teeth all taken care of sir i got olsson on guard theyd be too scared to challenge im bolitho agreed olsson was a swede and was said to be half mad it shone from his eyes which were like washedout blue glass a good seaman who could reef and steer and turn his hand to anything but when they had boarded this same brigantine bolitho had chilled to olssons crazy screams as he had cleaved his way through his opponents he forced a grin id think twice myself pearse groaned as the sails shivered and then flapped dully against rigging and spars there goes the bloody wind bolitho crossed to the bulwark and leaned out over the blue water he saw the winds ripple on the surface moving away far ahead of the bows like a great shoal of fish the brigantine lifted and sighed in the swell blocks and sails clattering in protest as the power went with the wind man your boats palliser was watching from beside the helmsmen bare feet padded over the hot deck seams as the first crews went away in the quarterboat as well as destinys cutter which they had kept in tow beneath the counter it took far too long to lay out the towing warps and pass them to the boats then with each boat angled away on either bow the painful dreary business began they could not hope to make any speed but it would prevent the vessel from drifting completely out of command and when the wind came they would be ready bolitho stood above the larboard anchor and watched the towlines tautening and then sagging beneath the glittering water as the oarsmen threw their weight into play little shook his head mr jurys no and for this sir ell need to use is starter on that lot bolitho could see the difference between the two towing boats jurys was yawing badly and a couple of the oars were barely cutting beneath the surface the other boat with midshipman ingrave in charge was making better progress and bolitho knew why ingrave was not a bully but he was well aware of his superiors watching from the brigantine and was using a ropes end on some of his men to make them work harder at the oars bolitho walked aft and said to palliser ill change the crews in an hour sir good palliser was watching the sails and then the compass shes got steerageway at least few thanks to the larboard boat bolitho said nothing he knew only too well what it was like as a midshipman to be suddenly thrown into an unpopular job but palliser did not press the point which was something bolitho thought of his own sudden acceptance of his new role he had not asked palliser about changing the boats crews he had told him and the first lieutenant had accepted without question palliser was as wily as dumaresq in their very different ways they were able to draw out exactly what they required from their subordinates he glanced at slade who was shading his eyes to peer at the sky a man who wanted promotion above all else dumaresq used that too to extract the best from the intolerant masters mate which in turn would aid him when his chance of advancement finally came even palliser had his mind set on his own command and this temporary duty in charge of heloise would stand very well on his record all through the day the relentless boatpulling went on while not even a faint breeze came to revive the sails they hung from the yards limp and useless like the men who tumbled aboard from the boats as soon as they were relieved too exhausted to do much more than gulp down a double ration of wine which slade had broached from the hold they fell about like dead men in the cabin aft tiny as it was but adequate when compared with the rest of the space between decks the relieved midshipmen and their lieutenants tried to find escape from the heat and the dangerous need to drink and keep on drinking with palliser asleep and slade on watch bolitho sat at the small table his head lolling as he tried to keep his mind awake opposite him his lips cracked from the suns glare jury rested his head on his hands and looked into space ingrave was away with the boats again but even his keenness was flagging badly bolitho asked how do you feel jury smiled painfully dreadful sir he tried to straighten his back and plucked his sodden shirt away from his skin bolitho pushed a bottle towards him drink this he saw the youth hesitate and insisted ill stand your trick in the boats if you like its better than sitting here and waiting jury poured a cup of wine and said no sir but thank you ill go when im called bolitho smiled he had toyed with the idea of telling stockdale to go with the midshipman one sight of him would put a stopper on any slackness or insubordination but jury was right to make it easy for him when he most needed confidence and experience would only lay a snare for later on ii was thinking sir he looked across guardedly about murray dyou think hell be all right bolitho thought about it even that was an effort maybe provided he stays away from the sea ive known men who have quit the navy to return and find security under a different name in the service they had originally reviled but that can be dangerous the navy is a family there is always a familiar face and a memory to match it he thought of dumaresq and egmont each linked by dumaresqs dead father just as he was now involved with whatever they might attempt jury said i often think about him of what happened on deck he glanced up at the low beams as if expecting to hear the ring of steel the desperate shuffle of men circling each other for a kill then he looked at bolitho and added im sorry i was told to put it from my mind a call shrilled and a voice yelled away boats crews lively there jury stood up his fair hair brushing the deckhead bolitho said quietly i was told much the same when i joined the destiny like you i still have the same difficulty he remained at the table listening to the thump of boats alongside the clatter of oars as the crews changed around yet again the door opened and bent double like a crippled sailor palliser groped his way to a chair and thankfully sat down he too listened to the boats thrashing away from the hull the sluggish response from the tillerhead as the brigantine submitted to the tow then he said flatly im going to lose that devil after getting this far its all been cut from under me bolitho could feel the disappointment like a physical thing and the fact palliser had made no effort to hide his despair was strangely sad he pushed the bottle and cup across the table why not take a glass sir palliser looked up from his thoughts his eyes flashing then he smiled wearily and took the cup why not richard he slopped the wine carelessly over the rim why not indeed while the sun moved towards the opposite horizon the two lieutenants sat in silence occasionally taking a sip of the wine which by now was as warm as milk then bolitho dragged out his watch and said one more hour with the boats and then we shall secure for the night sir palliser had been in deep thought and took several seconds to reply he said yes theres nothing else we can do bolitho was stunned by the change in him but knew if he tried to cheer him up the truce would be shattered feet shuffled through the maindeck and littles great face squinted in at them beg pardon sir but mr slade sends is respects and says e can ear gunfire to the northrd an empty bottle rolled across the deck at the lieutenants feet and clinked against the side as the cabin suddenly tilted palliser stared at the bottle he was still seated but his head was touching a beam without difficulty he exclaimed the wind the damned wonderful wind he clawed his way to the door not a moment too soon bolitho felt the hull give a shiver as if it was awakening from a deep sleep then with a bound he hurried after the lanky palliser sobbing with pain as his skull came in contact with a ringbolt on deck the men were staring around with disbelief as the big forecourse filled and boomed noisily from its yard palliser yelled recall the boats stand by to come about he was peering at the compass and then up at the masthead pendant just visible against the early stars slade said winds shifted sir veered a little souwest palliser rubbed his chin gunfire you say slade nodded no doubt small pieces is my guess good as soon as the boats are secured get under way again and lay her on the larboard tack steer norwest by north he stood aside as the men ran through the deepening shadows to their stations bolitho tested their new relationship will you not wait for destiny sir palliser held up his hand and they both heard the muted sounds of gunfire then he said tersely no mr bolitho i will not even if my captain succeeds in leaving harbour and is able to discover more favourable winds than ourselves hell not thank me for allowing the evidence he so sorely needs to be destroyed pearse yelled boats secured aft sir man the braces stand by to come about the wind hissed over the water and thrust against the canvas with new strength pushing the brigantine over as a white troth gathered around her stem palliser said sharply darken ship pearse i want nothing to betray our presence slade said it might be over an done with before dawn sir but the new palliser snapped nonsense that vessel is being attacked probably by pirates theyll not risk a collision in darkness he turned to seek out bolitho and added not like us eh little shook his head and breathed out noisily bolitho could smell the drink on his breath as strong as an open cellar door gawd mr bolitho es really appy at last bolitho thought suddenly of the face he had seen aboard the ship now under attack please god we shall be in time little not understanding walked away to join his friend pearse for another wet so the new third lieutenant was as eager as the captain for prize money he thought and that could not be such a bad thing for the rest of them palliser prowled across the poop like a restless animal shorten sail mr bolitho take in the tgansls and staysl roundly now men groped their way to halliards and belayingpins while others ran swiftly up the ratlines and out along the topgallant yard bolitho always marvelled at the little time it took trained seamen to get used to a strange vessel even in the dark it would soon be dawn and he could feel the previous days weariness and hours without sleep clawing at his resistance palliser had kept his small company on the move throughout the night changing tack altering course retrimming sails as he plotted and estimated the whereabouts of the other vessels several times there had been short exchanges of gunfire but palliser had said it was more to deter a possible chase than with any hope of close action one thing had been proved by the occasional cannon fire there were at least three vessels out there beyond the heloises taut jib like wolves around a wounded beast waiting for it to falter or make one fatal mistake little called hoarsely all guns loaded sir palliser replied very well in a lower tone to bolitho he added all guns a few swivels and about enough canister to disturb a field of crows midshipman ingrave said permission to run up the colours sir palliser nodded yes this is a kings ship for the present and were not likely to meet another bolitho recalled some of the muttering he had heard during the night a few of the hands were troubled at the prospect of engaging pirates or anyone else with so puny an armament bolitho darted a quick glance to starboard was there a faint lightening on the horizon there was a good lookout aloft and he was their best hope of taking the other vessel by surprise it was unlikely that pirates intent on capturing and plundering a trader would be bothered about keeping a watch elsewhere he heard slade whispering with palliser he was another one who was unhappy about the coming confrontation palliser said fiercely keep an eye on your course and be ready to change tack if we outrun the enemy leave the rest to me see bolitho felt his limbs shiver the enemy palliser had no doubts anyway stockdale came from the shadows his great frame angled against the deck as the wind held them over them buggers are usin chainshot sir once or twice i eard it when i was aloft bolitho bit his lip so they intended to cripple the rosario s rigging and then pound her into submission with less risk to themselves they would get a shock when they saw heloise bearing down on them for a short while anyway he said maybe destinys already chasing after us mebbee bolitho turned away as jury came to join him stockdale did not believe that any more than he did jury asked will it take much longer sir dawn comes up swiftly youll see their topsails or upper yards at any minute now if one of them fires again we should be able to plot his bearing jury watched him in the gloom it does not trouble you sir bolitho shrugged not now later perhaps we are committed or soon will be he turned and put his hand on the midshipmans shoulder just remember something mr palliser has picked some very experienced hands for this work but his officers are somewhat youthful he saw jury nod so keep your head and be where you can be seen leave the miracles to mr palliser jury smiled and then winced as his cracked lips reminded him of the previous days boatwork he said ill stay with you stockdale chuckled beggin yer pardon young gentleman but dont you be gettin in my way he swung a cutlass across the bulwark like a scythe wouldnt want you to lose yer ead so to speak palliser called stand by to take in the forecourse keep it quiet the boatswains mate pointed abeam dawn sir palliser rasped god dammit pearse were neither blind nor bloody deaf pearse grinned at pallisers back palliser youre a real pig but he was careful that nobody should hear him deck there sail on the starboard bow and nother to larboard palliser clapped his hands together we did it damn their eyes were into them at that moment a gun fired making an orange flash on the dark water slade said anxiously theres a third to windrd bolitho gripped his hanger and pressed its scabbard against his thigh to calm himself three vessels the centre one was doubtless the rosario with her two attackers standing off to form one great triangle he heard a slithering sound and then a splintering crash and vaguely through the darkness ahead he saw a jagged patch of spray as some spars and rigging hit the water stockdale nodded chainshot right enough th buggers stand by on deck watch your slowmatches there was no need for stealth now bolitho heard a shrill whistle from the nearest vessel and the crack of a pistol it had either exploded in error or had been used as a signal to warn their consort with their muskets and powderhorns ready to use cutlasses and boarding pikes within easy reach the destinys seamen peered into the darkness take in the forecourse men ran to obey and as the great sail was brailed up to its yard the growing light revealed the crouching figures and trained swivels like the rising of a curtain there was a series of bangs and bolitho heard the chainshot screeching overhead like tormented spirits in hell little said between his teeth too igh thank the liven jesus the deadly chainshot threw up broken spray far to starboard but in direct line with the brigantines two masts lee helm palliser was gripping a backstay as he studied the enemys blurred outline as close to the wind as you can man the braces the brigantine crept round until her remaining sails were rippling in protest norwest by west sir full an bye the other vessel fired and a ball slammed down within twenty feet of the heloises bow and hurled spray high over the beakhead then firing began in earnest the balls wide and haphazard as the gun crews tried to guess what the newcomer was trying to do another ball ripped through the driver and left a jagged hole in the canvas large enough for a mans head palliser exploded that bloody fool brig fired at us little grinned thinks were pirates too ill give him pirates palliser pointed at the vessel which was rising out of the darkness to larboard and shortening as she changed tack to run down on the brigantines impudent approach schooner take her first little cupped his hands on the uproll lads men were still dragging one of the swivels across to mount it on the opposite side and yelled at little to give them more time but little knew his trade well easy lads it was like hearing a man quietening a beast fire like glowworms the matches plunged down and the swivels barked viciously at the oncoming vessel a murderous hail of closely packed canister swept across her forecastle and bolitho thought he heard screams as it found a target stand by to come about pallisers voice carried easily even without his speakingtrumpet lee braces palliser walked jerkily down the sloping deck to join slade by the helm well go for another one put up your helm heeling hard over the brigantine ran to leeward her canvas banging lustily until the seamen had hauled the yards round again the second vessel seemed to pivot across the jibboom until she lay to larboard her stern end on to the charging heloise palliser yelled rake her poop little he swung on slade and his gasping helmsmen steady as she goes you fool bolitho found time to pity slades concern the heloise was rushing down on the other vessels stern as if she was about to smash bodily through her quarter like an axe fire flashes lit up the decks of both vessels as their guns spat out darting orange tongues accompanied by the crash of iron hitting homeheloises canister must have wiped the other vessels poop clean helmsmen gun crews there was not enough room to escape as the daisy cutters jagged charges swept amongst them she began to fall downwind to be raked yet again by littles other swivels set the forecourse pallisers voice was everywhere bolitho could see him clearly now his lean body moving about the poop and framed against the brightening sea like an avenger fire more balls shrieked overhead and bolitho guessed that their first target had regained his courage and was closing to the aid of his companion he saw the rosario for the first time and his heart sank at the spectacle her foremast had gone completely and only half of her main appeared to be standing wreckage and severed rigging trailed everywhere and as the sun lifted above the horizon bolitho saw the thin scarlet threads which ran down from each scupper it was as if the ship herself and not her defenders was bleeding to death hands wear ship bolitho jabbed a seamans shoulder and yelled join the others he felt the man jump before he ran to throw his weight on the braces he had imagined it to be hot iron and not his hand there was a tremendous crash and bolitho almost fell to his knees as two hits were scored on the heloises hull bolitho saw ingrave staring at the nearest vessel wideeyed and unable to move he shouted get below and attend to the damage he strode to the midshipman and gripped his sleeve and shook him like a doll at once mr ingrave sound the well ingrave stared at him vacantly and then with unexpected determination ran to the companion stockdale unceremoniously dragged bolithos arm and held him aside as a massive block fell from aloft broken cordage whipping behind it it struck the bulwark and bounced over the side palliser shouted stand to he had drawn his sword ready to larboard against the schooners cannon small though they were the swivels sounded insignificant bolitho saw the canister blast through the schooners foresail and hurl two men into bloody bundles before more balls smashed through heloises lower hull he heard the havoc tearing between decks the crack of splinters and collapsing timbers and knew they had been badly hit someone had managed to get the pumps going but he saw two men fall bleeding badly and another who had been working on the topsail yard trying to lower himself to safety with one leg hanging to his body by a muscle palliser shouted come aft as bolitho hurried to join him he said were doing no good get below yourself and report the damage he blinked as more shots thudded into the reeling hull and somewhere a man shrieked in agony feel her shes going bolitho stared at him it was true the heloises agility had given way to an ungainly response to both helm and wind it did not seem possible so quickly and their roles had changed there was no aid at hand and their enemies would not let them die easily palliser snapped im going to steer for the brig with our men and her guns theres still a chance he looked steadily at bolitho now be a good fellow and get below bolitho hurried to the companion his quick glance taking in the splintered deck planking and stark bloodstains they had fought here before surely that was enough perhaps fate had always intended they should end thus he called to jury come with me he peered down into the darkness dreading the thought of being trapped below if the ship went down he spoke carefully to hide his anxiety we will examine the damage together then if i fall he saw jury gasp so he had not yet accepted the idea of death you will relay the details to mr palliser once down the companion ladder he lit a lantern and led the way forward careful to avoid some of the jagged splinters which had been smashed through from the deck above the sounds were muffled but filled with menace as the ship shook and bucked to the bombardment the two attacking vessels were working round on either beam heedless of the danger of hitting each other in their eagerness to destroy the little ship with the scarlet ensign at her peak bolitho dragged open a lower hatch and said i can hear water jury whispered oh dear god were foundering bolitho laid down and dipped his lantern through the hatch it was a scene of complete chaos shattered casks and remnants of canvas floated amongst splintered wood and as he watched he imagined he saw the water rising still further he said go to the first lieutenant and tell him theres no hope he restrained jury feeling his sudden surge of fear as more balls cracked into the hull walkremember what i said theyll be looking to you he tried to smile to show that nothing mattered all right jury backed away his eyes moving from the open hatch to bolitho what will you do bolitho turned his head sharply as a new sound echoed through the listing hull like a giants hammer one of the anchors had broken free and was smashing into the bows with every roll it could only speed their end ill go to olsson we must release the prisoners and then bolitho was alone he swallowed deeply and tried to keep his limbs from shaking then very slowly he groped his way aft again the regular boom of the anchor against the hull following him like an execution drum there was another thud against the hull but it was followed instantly by a loud crack one of the masts or part of it was coming down he tensed waiting for the final crash as it hit the deck or plunged over the side the next instant he was spreadeagled in the darkness the lantern gone from his hand although he did not feel anything nor did he recall the moment of impact all he knew was that he was pinned beneath a mass of wreckage and unable to move he pressed his ear to a ventilation grating and heard the surge of water as it battered through the bilges and lower hold he was on the edge of terror and knew that in seconds he could be screaming and kicking in a hopeless attempt to free himself thoughts crowded through his mind his mother as she had watched him leave the sea below the headland at falmouth where he and his brother had first ventured out in a fishermans boat and his fathers wrath when he had discovered what they had done his eyes smarted but when he tried to move his fingers to his face the fallen debris held him as cruelly as any trap the anchor had stopped its incessant boom against the hull which meant it was probably under water with the forepart of the vessel bolitho closed his eyes and waited praying that his nerve would not break before the end pallisers ruse bolitho felt a growing pressure against his spine as some of the fallen timber shifted to the brigantines motion he heard a scraping sound somewhere overhead the clang of metal as one of the guns broke free and tumbled across the deck the angle was more acute and he could hear the sea piling against the hull but much higher than before as the vessel continued to settle deeper and deeper there was still some shooting but it seemed as if the victors were standing off to wait for the sea to complete their work for them slowly but with mounting desperation bolitho tried to wriggle free from the debris across his body he could hear himself groaning and pleading gasping meaningless words as he struggled to rid himself of the trap it was useless he only succeeded in dislodging some more broken woodwork a piece of which ploughed past his head like a spear with something like panic he heard sounds of a boat being manned some hoarse cries and more musket shots he clenched his fists and pressed his face against the deck planking to prevent himself from screaming the vessel was going fast and palliser had ordered her to be abandoned bolitho tried to think clearly to accept that his companions were doing what they must it was no time for sentiment or some useless gesture he was already as dead as the others who had been shot down in the heat of the fighting he heard voices and someone calling his name needles of light probed through the tangled wreckage and as the deck gave another lurch bolitho shouted go back save yourselves he was shocked and stunned by his words and the strength of his voice more than anything he had wanted to live until he had realized someone had cared enough to risk death for his sake stockdales throaty voice said ere work that spar clear somebody else said doubtfully too late by the looks of it mate wed best get aft stockdale rasped take old like i told you now together lads eave bolitho cried out as the pain pushed harder into his spine feet moved down from the other side of the pile and he saw jury on his knees peering though a gap to look for him not long sir he was shaking with fear but trying to smile at the same time hold on as suddenly as it had smashed him down the weight of broken planking and one complete spar were levered and hoisted clear a man seized bolithos ankles and dragged him roughly up the sloping deck while stockdale appeared to be holding back a wall of wreckage all on his own jury gasped quickly he would have fallen but for a seamans ready grip and then they were all staggering and lurching like drunks running from a pressgang on deck at last bolitho forgot the pain and the lurking moments of bare terror in the strengthening light he saw that the heloise was already a total wreck her foretopmast gone completely and her main nothing more than a jagged stump her canvas broken spars and an entangled mesh of fallen rigging completed the scene of devastation to drive it home bolitho saw that both boats were manned and standing clear and the nearer of the two was already higher than the heloises lee side palliser stood in the cutter directing some of his men to use their muskets on one of the schooners the dying brigantine acted as a barrier the only thing which still stood between the enemy and their chance to run down on the boats and finish the onesided fight stockdale grunted over th side lads his mind reeling bolitho saw that two of the men who had come back for him were olsson the mad swede and one of the farmworkers who had volunteered to his plymouth recruiting party jury kicked off his shoes and secured them inside his shirt he looked at the water as it came swirling over the bulwark and exclaimed huskily its a long swim bolitho flinched as a musket ball smacked into the deck and raised a splinter as high as a goose quill within feet of where they were standing now or never he saw the sea thundering through the companion and turning one of the corpses in a wild dance as it forced the bows deeper and deeper below the surface with stockdale panting and floundering between them bolitho and jury sprang into the water it seemed to take an age to reach the nearest boat and even then they had to join the others who were hanging to the gunwales and trying not to hamper the oarsmen as they headed for the dismasted rosario most of the men around bolitho were strangers and he realized they must be the released prisoners olsson had looked so wild it was a wonder he had not left them to drown with their ship then all at once the brigs side towered above them she was a small vessel but viewed from the water as he fought for breath and clung to a thrown line bolitho thought she looked as big as a frigate eventually they were pushed dragged and manhandled up and over the side where they were confronted by the brigs own company who stared at them as if they had come from the sea itself palliser left nobody in doubt as to who was in command little take the prisoners below and put them in irons pearse discover the chance of a juryrig anything to give us steerageway he strode past some dazed and bleeding men and snapped have these guns loaded dyou hear god dammit youre like a pack of old women a man of some authority pushed through his sailors and said i am the master john mason i know why youre here but i give thanks to god for it sir though i fear we are no match for them pirates palliser eyed him coldly we shall see about that but for now do as i direct how you and your people behave today may decide what happens to you the man gaped at him i dont understand sir do you have a passenger one jonathan egmont bolitho leaned on the bulwark sucking in great gulps of air the seawater streaming from his limbs to mingle with the blood around the nearest gun aye sir but alive was when i last saw him i put my passengers below when the attack began palliser gave a grim smile that is fortunate for both of us i think he saw bolitho and added sharply make sure egmont is secure tell him nothing he was about to turn his attention to one of the schooners but instead watched the heloises final moment as with a last burst of spray from her hatches she plunged to the bottom he said i am glad you were able to stay with us i ordered the vessel to be abandoned his eyes rested momentarily on jury and stockdale however bolitho staggered to an open hatch his bruised mind still grappling with the rosario s layout as she pitched about in the swell the brig had taken a terrible beating upended guns corpses and pieces of men lay strewn with the other debris ignored in the frantic efforts to keep their attackers from boarding a seaman with one hand wrapped in a crude bandage the other gripping a pistol called down ere sir bolitho clambered down a ladder his stomach rebelling against the stench of pain and suffering three men lay unconscious or dying another was crawling back to his station as best he could in makeshift dressings and a sling egmont stood at a table wiping his hands on a rag while a seaman trimmed a lantern for him he saw bolitho and gave a tired shrug an unexpected meeting lieutenant bolitho asked have you been attending the wounded you know the navy lieutenant for me it is a long long time ago since i served your captains father but it is something you never lose bolitho heard the urgent clank of pumps the sounds of blocks and tackles being hauled noisily across the upper deck the destinys seamen were working again and he was needed up there to help palliser to keep them at it driving them by force if necessary they had been in a savage fight and some had died as he had nearly done now they were needed again let them falter and they would drop allow them time to mourn the loss of a friend and they would lose the stuff of fighting but he asked your wife is she safe egmont gestured towards a bulkhead door in there bolitho thrust his shoulder against it the fear of being trapped below decks still scraping at his mind by lanternlight in a sealed airless cabin he saw three women aurora egmont her maid and a buxom woman he guessed to be the masters wife he said thank god youre safe she moved towards him her feet invisible in the cabins gloom so that she appeared to be floating she reached up and felt his wet hair and his face her eyes large as she said quietly i thought you were still in rio her hands touched his chest and his arms as they hung at his sides my poor lieutenant what have they done to you bolitho could feel his head swimming even here amidst the stench of bilge and death he was conscious of her perfume the cool touch of her fingers on his face he wanted to hold her to press her against his body like the dream to share his anxiety for her to reveal his longing please he tried to step away i am filthy i just wanted to be sure you were safe unhurt she pushed his protest aside and put her hands on his shoulders my brave lieutenant she turned her head and called sharply to her maid stop weeping you silly girl where is your pride in those few seconds bolitho felt her breast press against his wet shirt as if there was nothing between their bodies he murmured i must go she was staring at him as if to memorize everything about him will you fight again do you have to bolitho felt the strength returning to his body he could even smile as he said i have someone to fightfor aurora she exclaimed you remembered then she pulled his head down and kissed him firmly on the mouth like him she was shaking her earlier anger with her maid a pretence like his own she whispered be careful richard my young soyoung lieutenant with pallisers voice ringing in the distance bolitho walked back to the ladder and ran to the upper deck palliser was examining the two big schooners with a telescope and without lowering it he asked dryly may i assume that all is well below bolitho made to touch his hat but remembered it had gone a long time ago aye sir egmont is helping the wounded is he indeed palliser closed his glass with a snap now listen those devils will try to divide our defences one will stand off while the other attempts to board he was thinking aloud we may have survived one fight but they will see heloises loss as their victory theyll give no quarter now bolitho nodded we might hope to hold them off if we had every gun fully manned sir palliser shook his head no we are adrift and cannot prevent one or both of them from raking our stern he glanced at some of the brigs seamen as they staggered past with a trailing serpent of rigging these people are done for no stomach left its up to us he nodded firmly his mind made up we shall allow one of the buggers to grapple divide them and see how they like that bolitho looked at the fallen masts and sprawled bodies amongst which destinys seamen moved like scavengers on a battlefield then he touched his mouth with his fingers as if he expected to feel a difference there where she had kissed him with such fervent passion he said ill tell the others sir palliser eyed him bleakly yes just tell them explanations may come later if they do we shall know we have won if not they wont matter palliser lowered his telescope and said bitterly they are better manned than i thought bolitho shaded his eyes to watch the two schooners their big fore and aft sails like wings against the bright sky as they tacked slowly to windward of the helpless brig the larger of the two vessels her canvas pockmarked by their canistershot during the dawn engagement was a topsail schooner she touched off a memory and bolitho said i think she was the one i saw leaving harbour when we were at egmonts house i recognize her rig most probably not many of them in these waters palliser was studying the schooners methodical approach one standing well up to windward the other maneouvring towards the rosarios s larboard bow where she would be best shielded from her remaining guns they were sturdy sixpounders and under littles skilled supervision could still make a mark on anything which ventured too close palliser handed bolitho the glass see for yourself he walked over to speak with the brigs master and slade by the compass box bolitho held his breath and steadied the glass on the nearest schooner she was weatherworn and illused and he could see the many men who were staring across at the defiant mastless brig some were waving their weapons their jeers and threats lost only in distance he thought of the girl in the cabin what they would do to her and gripped his hanger so tightly that it hurt his palm he heard the brigs master say i cant argue with a kings officer to be sure but ill not answer for what may happen and slade said urgently well never hold em sir and its not right to put it to the test pallisers voice was flat and uncompromising what do you suggest wait for a miracle perhaps pray that destiny will rise from the deep and save all our wretched souls he did not conceal his sarcasm or his contempt god damn your eyes slade id have expected better from you he turned and saw bolitho watching the tense little group in about fifteen minutes that cutthroat will try to grapple us if we drive him off he will stand clear and the both of them will rake us for a while then they will try again and again he waved his arm slowly towards the torn decks and weary redeyed seamen do you see these people holding out bolitho shook his head no sir palliser turned away good but bolitho had seen the expression on his face relief perhaps or surprise that someone was agreeing with him in spite of the terrible odds then palliser said i am going below i must speak with the prisoners we took from heloise little said quietly to his friend the boatswains mate them stupid clods wont know wot side they be on eh ellis they both guffawed as if it was some huge joke jury asked what will we do next ingrave suggested shakily parley sir bolitho watched the approaching schooner the expert way her mainsail was being reset to give her a perfect heading for the last half cable we shall meet them as they attempt to board he saw his words moving along the littered deck the way the seamen gripped their cutlasses and axes and flexed their muscles as if they were already in combat the brigs men were only hired hands not professional and disciplined like destinys people but the latter were tired and there were too few of them when set against the threatening mob aboard the schooner he could hear them now yelling and jeering their combined shouts like an animal roar if there had been only one vessel they might have managed perhaps it would have been better to die with the heloise rather than prolong the agony palliser returned and said little stand by the forrard guns when i so order fire at will but make quite certain the shots do no real damage he ignored littles disbelief next load the remainder with a double charge of grape and canister at the moment of coming alongside i want those bastards raked he let his words drive home if you lose every man in doing it i need those guns to fire little knuckled his forehead his heavy features grim with understanding at last the brigs bulwark offered little protection and with the other vessel grinding alongside to grapple them together the gun crews could be cut down like reeds palliser unclipped his scabbard and tossed it aside he sliced his sword through the air and watched the bright sunlight run along the blade like gold it will be warm work today bolitho swallowed his mouth horribly dry he too drew his hanger and removed the leather scabbard as he had seen palliser do to lose a fight was bad enough to die because you had tripped over your scabbard was unthinkable muskets banged across the narrowing strip of water between the two hulls and several men ducked as the balls struck the timbers or whined menacingly overhead palliser sliced down an imaginary foe with his sword and then said sharply fire the leading guns hurled themselves inboard on their tackles the smoke billowing back through the ports as their crews did their best to follow littles orders a hole appeared in the schooners big foresail but the other shots went wide throwing up spindly waterspouts nearer to the other vessel than the one which was bearing down on them there were wild cheers and more shots and bolitho bit his lip as a seaman was hurled back from the bulwark his jaw smashed away by a musket ball palliser called stand by to repel boarders all at once the long schooner was right there opposite them and bolitho could even see his own shadow on her side with those of his companions musket shots whipped past him and he heard another man cry out the sound of the ball smashing into his flesh making ingrave cover his face as if to save himself from a similar fate the sails were falling away and as the tide of men surged across the schooners deck grapnels soared above them to clatter and then grip the rosarios hull like iron teeth but someone aboard the schooner must have anticipated a last trick from men who could fight like this several shots swept through the crouching gun crews and two men fell kicking and screaming their blood marking their agony until they lay still bolitho glanced quickly at jury he was holding his dirk in one hand a pistol in the other between his teeth bolitho said keep with me dont lose your footing do what you told me to do he saw the wildness in jurys eyes and added hold on there was a great lurch as with a shuddering crash the schooner came hard downwind and continued to drive alongside until the grapnel lines took the strain and held her fast now palliser pointed with his sword fire a gun belched flame and smoke and the full charge exploded in the exact centre of the massed boarders blood and limbs flew about in grisly array and the momentary terror changed to a wild roar of fury as the attackers formed up again and hurled themselves over the side and on to the brigs hull steel scraped on steel and while a few men tried to fire and reload their muskets others thrust wildly with pikes flinging shrieking boarders between the two hulls to be ground there like bloody fenders palliser yelled another but little and his men were cut off on the forecastle a wedge of slashing yelling figures already on the deck between them and the remaining unfired cannon its crew lay sprawled nearby either dead or dying bolitho did not know but without that final burst of grape and canister they were already beaten a seaman crawled towards the gun a slowmatch gripped in one fist but he fell face down as an attacker vaulted over the bulwark and hacked him across the neck with a boarding axe but the force of the blow threw him off balance and he slipped helplessly in his victims blood dutchy vorbink shouldered jury aside and charged forward his jaws wide in a soundless oath as he struck the scrambling figure on the head with his cutlass the blade glanced from his skull and bolitho saw an ear lying on the deck even as vorbink finished the job with a carefully measured thrust when he looked again bolitho saw stockdale by the abandoned gun his shoulder bleeding from a deep cut but apparently oblivious to it as he swept up the slowmatch and jabbed it to the gun the explosion was so violent that bolitho imagined it must have split the barrel a whole section of the schooners bulwark had vanished and amidst the charred woodwork and cut rigging the men who had been waiting their chance to leap across were entwined in a writhing heap palliser yelled at em lads he cut down a running figure and fired his pistol into the press of boarders as the thin line of defenders surged to meet it bolitho was carried forward with the rest his hanger rasping against a cutlass the breath burning in his lungs as he parried the blade clear and slashed a wildeyed man across his chest a pistol exploded almost in his ear and he heard jury cry out to someone to watch his back as two kicking yelling boarders cut their way through the exhausted seamen a pike slid past bolithos hip and pinioned a man who had been trying to follow his comrades through the breach he was still screaming and dragging at the pike with his bloodied fingers as stockdale loomed out of the throng and killed him with his cutlass midshipman ingrave was down holding his head with both hands as the fightmaddened figures lurched over him in a tide of hatred above it all bolitho heard pallisers voice to me my lads it was followed by a burst of cheering and wild cries and with amazement he saw a tightly packed crowd of men surge through the companionway and forward hatch to join palliser amidships their bared blades already clashing with the surprised boarders drive em back palliser pushed through his men and this seemed to inflame them to greater efforts bolitho saw a shadow waver towards him and struck out with all his strength the man coughed as the hangers blade took him right across the stomach and fell to his knees his fingers knitted across the terrible wound as the cheering sailors blundered over him it could not be happening but it was certain defeat had changed to a renewed attack and the enemy were already falling back in a broken rout as the wave of men charged into them bolitho understood that they must be the prisoners the heloises original crew which palliser had released and had put to his own use but it was all confused in his mind as he cut and thrust with the rest his shoulder knotted in pain his swordarm like solid lead palliser must have offered them something as dumaresq had done for their master in exchange for their aid several had already fallen but their sudden arrival had put back the heart into the destinys men he realized too that some of the pirates had gone over the side and when he lowered his guard for the first time he saw that the lines had been severed and the schooner was already drifting clear bolitho let his arm fall to his side and stared at the other vessel spreading her sails and using the wind to stand away from the mastless bloodstained but victorious brig men were cheering and slapping each other on the back others ran to help their wounded companions or called the names of friends who would never be able to answer one of the pirates who had been feigning death ran for the bulwark when he finally realized his own vessel was breaking off the battle it was olssons moment with great care he drew a knife from his belt and threw it it was like a streak of light and bolitho saw the running man spin round his eyes wide with astonishment as the heft quivered between his shoulders little jerked out the knife and tossed it to the paleeyed swede catch then he picked up the corpse and pitched it over the bulwark palliser walked the length of the deck his sword over his shoulder where it made a red stain on his coat bolitho met his gaze and said huskily we did it sir i never thought it would work palliser watched the released prisoners handing back their weapons and staring at each other as if stunned by what they had done nor i as a matter of fact bolitho turned and saw jury tying a bandage round ingraves head they had survived he asked dyou think theyll attack again palliser smiled we have no masts but they have with the masthead lookouts who can see far further than we i have no doubt we owe our victory to more than a momentary and unorthodox ruse palliser as always was right within the hour destinys familiar pyramid of sails was etched against the horizon in bright sunshine they were no longer alone no childish desire the destinys stern cabin seemed unnaturally large and remote after the embattled brig in spite of what he had endured bolitho felt wide awake and wondered what had given him this renewal of energy all day the frigate had been hove to with the mastless rosario wallowing in her lee while the rest of pallisers party and the wounded had been ferried across to destiny other boats had been busy carrying men and material to help the brigs company set up a juryrig and complete minimum repairs to take them into port dumaresq sat at his table a litter of papers and charts scattered before him all of which palliser had brought from the rosario he was without his coat and sitting in his shirt his neckcloth loosely tied he looked anything but a frigate captain he said you did well mr palliser he looked up his widely spaced eyes turning on bolitho you also bolitho thought of that other time when he and palliser had been demolished by dumaresqs scathing attack dumaresq pushed the papers aside and leaned back in the chair too many dead men heloise gone too he brushed the thought aside but you did the right thing mr palliser and it was bravely done he gave a grin i will send heloises people with the rosario from what we have discovered it would seem that their part in all this was of no importance they were hired or bribed aboard the brigantine and by the time they realized they were not going on some short coastal passage they were well out to sea their master triscott and his mates took care to ensure they remained in ignorance so well release them into rosario s care he wagged a finger at his first lieutenant after you have selected and sworn in any good hands you can use to replace those lost a spell in the kings service will make a lively change for them palliser reached out and took a glass of wine as dumaresqs servant hovered discreetly beside his chair what of egmont sir dumaresq sighed i have ordered that he and his wife be brought across before nightfall lieutenant colpoys has them in his charge but i wanted egmont to remain to the last moment so that he could see what his greed and treachery has cost the brigs company as well as my own he looked at bolitho our plump surgeon has already told me about the vessel you both saw leaving rio with such stealth egmont was safe while he lay hidden but whoever gave the order for the rosario to be waylaid and seized wanted him dead according to the brigs charts her final destination was st christophers egmont was prepared to pay the master anything to take him there even to avoid his other ports of call in order that he should reach st christophers without delay he gave a slow smile so that is where sir piers garrick will be he nodded as if to emphasize his confidence the hunt is almost over with egmonts sworn evidence and he has no choice left now we shall run that damn pirate to earth once and for all he saw bolithos open curiosity and added the caribbean has seen the making of much wealth pirates honest traders slavers and soldiers of fortune they are all there and where better for old enemies to simmer undisturbed he became businesslike again complete this coming and going without too much delay mr palliser i have advised rosario to return to rio her master will be able to relate his tale to the viceroy whereas i was unable to tell mine he will know that a guise of neutrality must not be so onesided in future as palliser and bolitho stood up he said i am afraid we are short of fresh water because of my hasty departure mr codd was able to get all the yams greens and meat he could desire but water will have to be found elsewhere outside the cabin palliser said you are temporarily relieved of your duties even extreme youth has a limit go to your quarters and rest while you can he saw bolithos uncertainty well ii was wondering what will become of egmont he tried to keep his voice unconcerned and his wife egmont was a fool by remaining quiet he aided garrick garrick was trying to help the french at martinique against us and that makes egmonts silence all the more serious however if he has any sense he will tell the captain all he knows but for us hed be dead hell be thinking of that just now he turned to leave his movements showing little of the strain he had been under he was still wearing his old seagoing coat which now had the additional distinction of a bloodstain on one shoulder where he had rested his sword bolitho said i should like to put stockdales name forward for advancement sir palliser came back and lowered his head to peer at bolitho beneath a deckbeam would you indeed bolitho sighed it sounded rather like the old palliser again but palliser said ive already done that really mr bolitho youll have to think more quickly than that bolitho smiled despite the ache in his limbs and the confusion in his thoughts which the girl named aurora had roused with a kiss he entered the wardroom his body swaying to the frigates heavier motion poad greeted him like a warrior sit you down sir ill fetch something to eat and drink he stood back and beamed at him right glad we are to see you again sir an thats the truth bolitho lay back in a chair and allowed the drowsiness to flow over him above and around him the ship was alive with bustling feet and the clatter of tackle a job had to be done and the seamen and marines were used to obeying orders and holding their private thoughts to themselves across the darkening water the brig was also busy with working sailors tomorrow the rosario would make her way towards safety where her story would be retold a thousand times and they would speak of the quiet englishman with the beautiful young wife who had lived amongst them for years keeping to themselves and outwardly content with their selfimposed exile and of the frigate with her grotesque captain which had come to rio and had slunk away in the night like an assassin bolitho stared up at the deck head listening to the ships noises and the sound of the ocean against her hull he was privileged he was right in the midst of it of the conspiracy and the treachery and very soon now she would be here too when poad returned with a plate of fresh meat and a jug of madeira he found the lieutenant fast asleep his legs were outthrust the breeches and stockings torn and stained with what appeared to be blood his hair was plastered across his forehead and there was a bruise on his hand the one which had been gripping his hanger at the start of the day asleep the third lieutenant looked even younger poad thought young and for these rare moments of peace defenceless bolitho walked slowly up and down the quarterdeck avoiding flaked lines and the mizzen bitts without conscious effort it was sunset and a full day since they had parted company with the battered rosario to leave her far astern she had looked forlorn and as misshapen as any cripple with her crude juryrig and such a sparse display of sails it would take her several days to reach port bolitho glanced aft at the poop skylight and saw the glow of lanterns reflecting on the driverboom above it he tried to picture the dining cabin with her there and the captain sharing his table with his two guests how would she feel now how much had she known from the beginning he wondered bolitho had seen her only briefly when she had been brought across from the brig with her husband and a small mountain of luggage she had seen him watching from the gangway and had made to raise one gloved hand but the gesture had changed to less than a shrug a mark of submission even despair he looked up at the braced yards the topsails growing darker against the pale fleecy clouds which had been with them for most of the day they were steering northnortheast and standing well out from the land to avoid prying eyes or another wouldbe follower the watch on deck were doing their usual rounds to inspect the trim of the yards and the tautness of running and standing rigging alike from below he heard the plaintive scrape of the shantymans fiddle the occasional murmur of voices as the hands waited for their evening meal bolitho paused in his restless pacing and grasped the nettings to steady himself against the ships measured roll and plunge the sea was already much darker to larboard the swell in half shadow as it cruised slowly towards their quarter to lift destinys stern and then roll beneath her keel in endless procession he looked along the upper deck at the regularly spaced guns lashed firmly behind the sealed ports through the black shrouds and other rigging to the figureheads pale shoulder he shivered imagining it to be aurora reaching out like that but for him and not the horizon somewhere a man laughed and he heard midshipman lovelace reprimanding one of the watch who was probably old enough to be his father it sounded even funnier in his highpitched voice bolitho thought lovelace had been awarded extra duties by palliser for skylarking during the dogwatches when he should have been pondering on his navigational problems bolitho recalled his own early efforts to study to keep awake and learn the hardwon lessons laid down by his sailing master it all seemed so long ago the darkness of the smelly orlop and the midshipmans berth trying to read the figures and calculations by the flickering light of a glim set in an old oyster shell and yet it was no time at all he studied the vibrating canvas and marvelled at the short period it had taken to make so great a step once he had stood almost frozen with fear at the prospect of being left alone in charge of a watch now he felt confident enough but knew if the time came he would and must call the captain but no one else he could not turn any more to seek out his lieutenant or some stalwart masters mate for aid or advice those days were gone unless or until he committed some terrible error which would strip him of all he had gained bolitho found himself examining his feelings more closely he had been afraid when he had believed he was going to go down trapped below decks in the heloise perhaps the closest to terror he had ever been and yet he had seen action before plenty of times even as a twelveyearold midshipman in his first ship he had gritted his teeth against the thunder of the old manxmans massive broadside in his cot with the flimsy screen door of his cabin shut to the rest of the world he had thought about it wondered how his companions saw and judged him they never seemed to worry beyond the moment colpoys bored and disdainful palliser unbreakable and everwatchful over the ships affairs rhodes appeared carefree enough so perhaps his own ordeal in the heloise and then aboard the brig had made a deeper impression than he had thought he had killed or wounded several men and had watched others hack down their enemies with apparent relish but surely you could never get used to it the smell of a mans breath against your own the feel of his body heat as he tried to break your guard his triumph when he thought you were falling his horror as you drove your blade into muscle and bone one of the two helmsmen said steady as she goes sir nornoreast he turned in time to see the captains thickset shadow emerging from the companionway dumaresq was a heavy man but had the stealth of a cat all quiet mr bolitho aye sir he could smell the brandy and guessed the captain had just finished his dinner a long haul yet dumaresq tilted on his heels to study the sails and the first faint stars he changed the subject and asked are you recovered from your little battle bolitho felt stripped naked it was as if dumaresq had been reading into his very thoughts i think so sir dumaresq persisted frightened were you part of the time he nodded remembering the weight across his back the roar of water through the deck below where he had been trapped a good sign dumaresq nodded never become too hard like cheap steel youll snap if you do bolitho asked carefully will we be carrying the passengers all the way sir to st christophers at least there i intend to enlist the governors aid and have word sent to our senior officer there or at antigua the treasure sir is there still a chance of recovering it some of it but i suspect we may recognize it in a very different form from that originally intended there is a smell of rebellion in the air it has been growing and smouldering since the end of the war sooner or later our old enemies will strike at us again he turned and stared at bolitho as if trying to make up his mind i read something of your brothers recent success when i was at plymouth against another of garricks breed i believe he caught and destroyed a man who was fleeing to america a man once respected but who proved to be as rotten as any common felon bolitho replied quietly aye sir i was there with him indeed dumaresq chuckled there was no mention of that in the gazette your brother wanted all the glory for himself perhaps he turned away before bolitho could ask of the connection if there was one between the dash down the channel just a few months back and the mysterious sir piers garrick but dumaresq said i am going to play cards with mr egmont the surgeon has agreed to partner him whereas i shall have our gallant marine for mine he gave a rich chuckle we might empty one of egmonts moneyboxes before we drop anchor off basseterre bolitho sighed and walked slowly to the quarterdeck rail half an hour and the watch would change a few words with rhodes then down to the wardroom he heard yeames masters mate of the watch murmur with unusual politeness why good evenin ladies bolitho swung round his heart pounding in immediate response as he saw her moving carefully along the side of the quarterdeck her arm entwined with that of her maid he saw her hesitate and was of two minds what to do next let me assist you bolitho crossed the deck and took her proffered hand through the glove he felt the warmth of her fingers the smallness of her wrist come to the weather side maam there is less spray and a far better view she did not resist as he led her up the sloping deck to the opposite side then he pulled out his handkerchief and bound it quickly round the hammock nettings he explained as calmly as he could that it was to protect her glove from tar or any other shipboard substance she held herself close to the nettings and stared abeam across the dark water bolitho could smell her fragrant perfume just as he was very aware of her nearness then she said a long way to st christophers island is it not she had turned to look at him but her eyes were in shadow it will take us over two weeks according to mr gulliver maam it is a good three thousand miles he saw her teeth white in the gloom but did not know if she was showing dismay or impatience a good three thousand miles lieutenant then she nodded i understand through the open skylight bolitho heard dumaresqs deep laugh and colpoys saying something in reply dealing his cards no doubt she had heard too and said quickly to her maid you may leave us you have worked hard today she watched the girl reaching for the companionway and added she has lived all her life on hard dry land this ship must be strange to her bolitho asked what will you do will you be safe after all that has happened she tilted her head as dumaresq laughed again that will depend on him she looked past bolitho her eyes shining like the spray alongside as she asked does it matter so much to you bolitho said you know it does i care terribly you do she reached out and gripped his arm with her free hand you are a kind boy she felt him stiffen and added gently i apologize you are a man to have done what you did back there when i thought i was going to be killed bolitho smiled i am the one to apologize i want you to like me so much that i act like a fool she twisted round and moved closer to look at him you mean it i can tell that if nothing else if only you could have remained in rio bolitho was searching his mind for some solution which might help your husband should not have risked your life she shook her head the movement of her hair striking at bolithos heart like a dagger he has been good to me without him i would have been lost long ago i was a stranger in rio i am of spanish blood when my parents died i was to have been bought as a wife by a portuguese trader she gave a shudder i was only thirteen he was like a greasy pig bolitho felt betrayed was it not love which made you marry your husband love she tossed her head i do not find men very attractive you know so i was content with his arrangements for me like his many fine possessions i think he sees me as a decoration she opened the shawl which she had carried on deck like this bird yes bolitho saw the same twoheaded bird with the ruby tail feathers she had worn at her house in rio he said fervently i love you she tried to laugh but nothing came she said i suspect you know even less about loving than i do she reached up and touched his face but you meant what you said i am sorry if i hurt you bolitho grasped her hand and pressed it firmly against his cheek she had not laughed or piled scorn on him for his clumsy advances he said you will be left in peace soon she sighed and then you will come like a knight on your charger to save me yes i used to dream of such things when i was a child now i think as a woman she pulled his hand down and pressed it against her skin so that the warmth of the jewelled bird on his fingers was like a part of her do you feel that she was watching him intently he could feel the urgent beat of her heart rising to match his own as he touched the smooth skin and the firm curve of her breast that is no childish desire she made to move away but when he held her she said what is the use we are not alone to act as we please if my husband thinks i am betraying him he will refuse to help your captain she put her hand on his lips hear me dear richard do you not see what that would mean my husband thrown into some english prison to await trial and death i as his wife might be taken also or left destitute to await another portuguese trader or worse she waited for him to release her and then murmured but do not think i would not or could not love you voices echoed along the deck and bolitho heard a boatswains mate calling out names as the watch trooped aft to relieve his own men in those few seconds bolitho found himself hating the boatswains mate with all his soul he exclaimed i must see you again she was already making her way to the opposite side her slim outline like a ghost against the dark water beyond three thousand miles you said lieutenant it is such a long way each day will be torture she hesitated and glanced back at him for both of us rhodes clattered up through the companionway and stood aside to let her pass he nodded to bolitho and remarked a beauty indeed he seemed to sense bolithos mood that he was prepared to be hostile if he mentioned her again he added that was clumsy of me stupid too bolitho pulled him to one side oblivious of the watch mustering beyond the quarterdeck rail i am in hell stephen i can tell no one else it is driving me mad rhodes was deeply moved by bolithos sincerity and by the fact he was sharing his secret with him he said we shall think of something it sounded so unconvincing in the face of his friends despair that he said a lot can happen before we sight st christophers the masters mate touched his hat the watch is aft sir bolitho walked to the companionway and paused with one foot on the ladder her perfume was still hanging there or if not it must be clinging to his coat aloud he exclaimed what can i do but the only answer came from the sea and the rumble of the rudder beneath dumaresqs cabin the first week of the destinys passage passed swiftly enough with several blustery squalls to keep the hands busy and to hold back the scorching heat up and around cabo branco then northwest for the spanish main and the indies there were longer periods of low breezes and some of no wind at all when the boats were put down and the gruelling work of warping the ship by muscle and sweat was enforced fresh water ran lower as a direct consequence and with neither rain nor the prospect of an early landfall it was rationed after a week it was cut further still to a pint a day per man during his daily watches under the blazing sun bolitho saw very little of egmonts wife he told himself it was for her good as well as his own there were troubles enough to contend with outbreaks of insubordination which ended in fists and kicks or the use of a petty officers starter but dumaresq refrained from having any of his men flogged and bolitho wondered if it was because he was eager to keep the peace or holding his hand for his passengers benefit bulkley was showing signs of anxiety too three men had gone down with scurvy in spite of his care and the regular issue of fruit juice the surgeon was unable to prevent it once while he had been lingering in the shadow of the big driver bolitho had heard dumaresqs voice through the cabin skylight dismissing bulkleys pleas even blaming him for not taking better precautions for his sick seamen bulkley must have been examining the chart because he had protested why not barbados captain we could anchor off bridgetown and arrange for fresh water to be brought out to us what we have left is crawling with vermin and ill not answer for the peoples health if you insist on driving them like this god damn your eyes sir ill tell you who you shall answer to believe me ill not go to barbados and shout to the whole world what we are doing you attend to your duties and i shall do the same and there it had ended seventeen days after parting from the rosario the wind found them again and with even her studdingsails set destiny gathered way like the thoroughbred she was but perhaps it was already too late to prevent some kind of explosion it was like a chain reaction slade the masters mate still brooding over pallisers contempt and knowing it would likely hinder even prevent any chance of promotion poured abuse on midshipman merrett for failing to calculate the ships noon position correctly merrett had overcome his early timidity but he was only twelve years old to be berated so harshly in front of several hands and the two helmsmen were more than enough for him he burst into tears rhodes was officer of the watch and could have intervened instead he remained by the weather side his hat tilted against the sun his ears deaf to merretts outburst bolitho was below the mainmast watching some of his topmen reeving a new block at the topgallant yard and heard most of it stockdale was with him and muttered its like an overloaded waggon sir somethins got to give merrett dropped his hat and was rubbing his eyes with his knuckles when a seaman picked up the hat and handed it to him his eyes angry as he glanced at the masters mate slade yelled how dare you interfere between your betters the seaman one of the afterguard retorted hotly dammit mr slade es doin is best its bad enough for the bloody rest of us let alone fer im slade seemed to go purple he screamed masteratarms secure that man he turned on the quarterdeck at large ill see his backbone at the gratings poynter and the ships corporal arrived and seized the defiant seaman the latter showed no sign of relenting like murray eh a good and an a loyal shipmate and they was goin to flog im too bolitho heard a growl of agreement from the men around him rhodes came out of his torpor and called pipe down there whats going on slade said this man defied me and swore at me so he did he was becoming dangerously calm and glaring at the seaman as if he would strike him dead rhodes said uncertainly in that case in that case mr rhodes have the man put in irons ill have no defiance in my ship dumaresq had appeared as if by magic slade swallowed and said this man was interfering sir i heard you dumaresq thrust his hands behind his back as did the whole ship i would imagine he glanced at merrett and snapped stop snivelling boy the midshipman stopped like a clock and looked about him with embarrassment dumaresq eyed the seaman and added that was a costly gesture adams a dozen lashes bolitho knew that dumaresq could do nothing but uphold his subordinates right or wrong and a dozen lashes was minimal just a headache the old hands would term it but an hour later as the lash rose and then cracked with terrible force across the mans naked back bolitho realized just how frail was their hold over the ships company with land so far away the gratings were unrigged the man named adams was carried below grunting with pain to be revived with a washdown of salt water and a liberal dose of rum the spots of blood were swabbed away and to all intents everything was as before bolitho had relieved rhodes in charge of the watch and heard dumaresq say to the masters mate discipline is upheld for all our sakes he fixed slade with his compelling stare for your own safety i would suggest you stay out of my way bolitho turned aside so that slade should not see him watching but he had seen slades face like that of a man who had been expecting a reprieve only to feel his arms being pinioned by the hangman all that night bolitho thought about the girl named aurora it was impossible to get near her she had been given half of the stern cabin while egmont made the best of a cot in the dining space dumaresq slept in the chartroom nearby and there was always the servant and the marine sentry to prevent any casual caller from entering as he lay in his cot his naked body sweating in the unmoving air bolitho pictured himself entering her cabin and holding her in his arms he groaned at the torment and tried to ignore the thirst which had left his mouth like a kiln the water was foul and in short supply and to keep drinking wine as a substitute was inviting disaster he heard uncertain footsteps in the wardroom and then a gentle tap on his screen door bolitho rolled out of the cot groping for his shirt as he asked who is it it was spillane the captains new clerk despite the hour he was neat and tidy and his shirt looked as if it had just been washed although how he had managed it was a mystery spillane said politely i have a message for you sir he was looking at bolithos tousled hair and casual nakedness as he continued from the lady bolitho darted a quick glance around the wardroom only the regular creaks and groans of the ships timbers and the occasional murmur of canvas from above broke the silence he found he was whispering where is it then spillane replied by word of mouth sir shed not put pen to paper bolitho stared now spillane was a conspirator whether he wanted to be or not go on spillane lowered his voice further still you take over the morningwatch at four oclock sir his precise landsmans expression made him seem even more out of place here aye the lady will endeavour to come on deck for a breath of air if someone is bold enough to question her is that all it is sir spillane was watching him closely in the faint light from a shuttered lantern did you expect more bolitho glanced at him guardedly was that last remark a show of familiarity a testing insolence because of their shared conspiracy maybe spillane was nervous eager to get it over with he said no thank you for telling me bolitho stood for a long moment his body swaying to the motion as he went over everything spillane had said later he was still in the wardroom sitting in a chair the same shirt dangling from his fingers as he stared into the shadows a boatswains mate found him and whispered i see you dont need a call sir the watch is musterin now fair breeze up top but another blazin day is my guess he stood back as bolitho pulled on his breeches and fumbled around for a clean shirt the lieutenant was obviously half asleep still he decided it was a cruel waste to don any clean garment for the morningwatch it would be a wet rag by six bells bolitho followed the man on deck and relieved midshipman henderson with the briefest possible delay henderson was next in line for lieutenants examination and palliser had allowed him to stand the middlewatch on his own the midshipman almost fled from the deck and bolitho could well imagine his thoughts as he tumbled into his hammock on the orlop his first watch alone reliving it what had nearly gone wrong when he had nearly decided to rouse palliser or the master the feeling of triumph as bolitho had appeared knowing the watch was ended without mishap bolithos men settled down in the shadows and after checking the compass and the set of the topsails he walked towards the companionway midshipman jury crossed to the weather side and wondered when he would get his chance to stand a watch unaided he turned and saw bolitho moving aft by the mizzenmast and then blinked as another pale figure glided to meet him he heard the helmsmen whispering together and noticed that the boatswains mate of the watch had moved discreetly to the weather gangway watch your helm there jury saw the seamen stiffen at the great doublewheel beyond them the two pale figures seemed to have merged into one jury walked to the quarterdeck rail and gripped it with both hands to all intents he was standing his first watch unaided he thought happily a close thing under topsails forecourse and jib only the destiny headed slowly towards the green humpbacked island so gentle was the breeze that her progress was a snails pace an impression which grew as she approached the small ridge of land the masthead had sighted it the previous day just before dusk and throughout the nightwatches until the break of dawn there had been a buzz of speculation from wardroom to messdeck now in the harsh forenoon sunlight it lay across their bows and shimmered in a low haze as if it might vanish at any second like a mirage it was higher towards its centre where thick clusters of palms and other foliage were bunched together to leave the slopes and the tiny crescentshaped beaches totally devoid of cover deep six the hollow chant from a leadsman in the chains reminded bolitho of the shallows nearby the hint of a reef lying to starboard a few seabirds dotted the water and others cruised watchfully around the topgallant mastheads bolitho heard dumaresq conferring with palliser and the master the island was marked on the chart but apparently unclaimed the known survey was poor and dumaresq was probably regretting his impulse to touch land in search for water but the ship was down to her last barricoes of water and the contents were so vile that bulkley and the purser had joined forces in another plea to the captain for him to seek a new supply enough at least to take them to their destination by th mark seven gulliver tried to relax his stance as the keel glided into deeper water the ship was still standing two cables clear of the nearest beach if the wind rose or changed direction destiny might be in trouble with no depth at all to beat free of the land and outthrust reef every man but the cook and the sick ones in bulkleys care was on deck or clinging to the shrouds and ratlines strangely silent as they peered towards the little island it was one of hundreds in the caribbean but the hint of fresh drinkable water made it appear special and priceless by th mark five dumaresq grimaced at palliser hands wear ship stand by to anchor if you please with her sails barely flapping in the intense heat the frigate turned wearily on the blue water until the order to let go was yelled along the deck the anchor splashed down pushing great circles away from the bows and churning up pale sand from the bottom once anchored the heat seemed to force into the ship still more and as bolitho made his way to the quarterdeck he saw egmont and his wife standing right aft by the taffrail sheltering beneath a canvas awning which george durham the sailmaker had rigged for them dumaresq was studying the island slowly and methodically with the signal midshipmans big telescope he remarked no smoke or signs of life cant see any marks on the beach either so there arent any boats on this side he handed the glass to palliser that ridge looks promising eh gulliver said cautiously could be water there right enough sir dumaresq ignored him and turned instead to his two passengers might be able to stretch your legs ashore before we weigh he chuckled he had addressed both of them but bolitho somehow knew that his words had been aimed at the woman he thought of that one moment when she had come on deck to see him it had been unreal but precious dangerous and all the more exciting because of it they had spoken very little all through the following day bolitho had thought about it relived it hung on to each moment for fear of losing something he had held her close to his body while the ship had ploughed into the first misty light of dawn feeling her heart beat against his wanting to touch her and afraid he would spoil it with his boldness she had freed herself from his arms and had kissed him lightly on the mouth before merging with the remaining shadows to leave him alone and now just to hear dumaresqs casual familiarity towards her his mention of stretching her legs was like a barb a spur of jealousy which he had never known before dumaresq broke his thoughts you will take a landingparty mr bolitho determine if there is a stream or any useful rock pools i will await your signal he walked aft and bolitho heard him speaking again with egmont and aurora bolitho flinched he saw jury watching him and imagined for an instant he had again spoken her name aloud palliser snapped get a move on if there is no water wed best know about it quickly colpoys was standing languidly by the mizzen i will send some of my fellows as pickets if you wish palliser exclaimed hells teeth were not expecting a pitched battle the cutter was hoisted outboard and lowered alongside stockdale now promoted to guncaptain was already detailing some hands for the shoreparty while the boats coxswain supervised the loading of extra tackle for the waterbarricoes should they require them bolitho waited until the boat was manned and then reported to palliser he saw the girl watching him the way one hand was resting on her necklace remembering perhaps or reminding him that his had once lain there palliser said take a pistol fire it if you find anything his eyes narrowed against the fierce glare once the casks are filled theyll discover something else to grumble about the cutter pulled away from the side and bolitho felt the sun burn across his neck as they left the destinys protective shadow give way all bolitho trailed his arm over the side feeling the sensual touch of cool water and imagined her with him swimming and then running hand in hand up the pale beach to discover each other for the first time when he looked over the gunwale he saw the bottom quite clearly dotted with white stones or shells and isolated humps of coral deceptively harmless in the shimmering reflections stockdale said to the coxswain looks like nobodys ever been ere jim the man eased the tillerbar and nodded the movement bringing a trickle of sweat from under his tarred hat easy all bowman boat yer oar bolitho watched the cutters shadow rising to meet them as the bowman vaulted over the side to guide the stem into the sand while the others hauled their blades inboard and hung panting over the looms like old men and then there was total stillness just a faroff murmur of surf on a reef the occasional gurgle of water around the grounded cutter no bird lifted from the crowded hump of palms not even an insect bolitho climbed over the gunwale and waded to the beach he was wearing an open shirt and breeches but his body felt as if he was dressed in thick furs the thought of tearing off his crumpled clothing and running naked into the sea mingled with his earlier fantasy and he wondered if she was watching from the ship using a telescope to see him bolitho realized with a start that the others were waiting he said to the coxswain remain with the boat the crew too they may have to do several journeys yet to stockdale he said well take the others up the slope its the shortest way and probably the coolest he ran his eye over the small landingparty two of them were from the heloises original company now swornin members of his majestys navy they still appeared dazed at their swift change of circumstances but they were good enough seamen to avoid the harsher side of the boatswains tongue apart from stockdale there was none of his own division in the group and he guessed there had been little enthusiasm for volunteering to tramp round an uninhabited island later if they discovered water it would be very different stockdale said follow me bolitho walked up the slope his feet sinking in the loose sand the pistol in his belt burning his skin like a piece of hot iron it felt strange to walk here he thought a tiny unknown place there might be human bones nearby shipwrecked mariners or men cast adrift and marooned by pirates to die horribly without hope of rescue how inviting the palms looked they were moving gently and he could hear them rustling as he drew nearer once he stopped to look back at the ship she seemed far away balanced perfectly on her own reflection but in distance she had lost her rakish lines and her masts and loosely furled sails seemed to be swaying and bending in the haze as if the whole ship was melting the small party of seamen tramped gratefully into a patch of shade their ragged trousers catching in some large fronds which displayed teethlike barbs around the edges there were different smells here too of rotting undergrowth and from vividly coloured blossoms bolitho looked up at the sky and saw a frigatebird circling high overhead its scimitarshaped wings motionless as it ghosted on the hot current so they were not completely alone a man called excitedly look yonder sir water they pressed forward all tiredness momentarily forgotten bolitho looked at the pool with disbelief it was shivering slightly so he guessed there was some sort of underground source close by he could see the surrounding palms reflected on its surface and the images of his men as they peered down at the water bolitho said ill have a taste he clambered along the sandy bank and dipped his hand into the water it was a false impression but it felt as cold as a mountain stream hardly daring to hope he raised his cupped hand to his lips and after a slight hesitation swallowed deeply he said quietly its pure bolitho watched the seamen throwing themselves down on their chests and scooping the water over their faces and shoulders swallowing great gulps of it in their eager excitement stockdale wiped his mouth with satisfaction good stuff bolitho smiled josh little would have called it a wet well stand easy a while then signal the ship the seamen drew their cutlasses and drove them into the sand before squatting down against the palms or leaning over the shimmering water as if to make sure it was still there bolitho walked away from them and as he examined his pistol to ensure that it was free of sand and damp he thought of that moment when she had joined him on destinys quarterdeck it must not end it could not be allowed to die something wrong sir stockdale lumbered up the slope bolitho realized he must have been frowning in concentration not wrong it was uncanny how stockdale always seemed to know to be ready in case he was needed yet it was something very real between them bolitho found it easy to talk to the big hoarse prizefighter and the reverse was true also without any hint of subservience or as a means to gain favour bolitho said you go and make the signal he watched the pistol half disappear in stockdales great fist i need to think about something stockdale watched him impassively youre young an beggin yer pardon sir i think you should stay young for as long as you can bolitho faced him you never really knew what stockdale meant with his brief halting sentences had he implied that he should keep away from a woman who was ten years older than he was bolitho refused to think about it their life was now when they could find it they could worry about differences later he said be off with you i wish it was that simple stockdale shrugged and strode down the slope towards the beach his broad shoulders set in such a way that bolitho knew he was not going to let it rest there with a great sigh bolitho walked back towards the pool to warn his men that stockdale was about to fire the pistol sailors cooped up in a shipofwar often became nervous of such things when they were put ashore one of the seamen had been lying with his face half under the water and as bolitho approached he stood up dripping and grinning with pleasure bolitho said be ready men he broke off as someone gave a piercing scream and the seaman who had been grinning at him pitched forward into the water all at once there was frantic pandemonium amounting to panic as the sailors scrabbled in the sand for their weapons and others stared with horror at the drifting corpse the water reddening around it from a spear thrust between the shoulders bolitho swung round seeing the sunlight partially broken by running leaping figures the glitter of weapons and a terrifying scream of combined voices which made the hair rise on his neck stand to he groped for his hanger and gasped with shock as another seaman rolled down the slope kicking and spitting blood as he tried to tug a crude shaft from his belly oh god bolitho shaded his eyes against the bars of sunlight their attackers had it behind them and were closing in on the stampeding seamen that terrible din of screaming voices making it impossible to think or act bolitho realized they were black men their eyes and mouths wide with triumph as they hacked down another sailor and pounded his face to a bloody pulp with a piece of coral bolitho ran to meet the attack dimly aware that more figures were rushing past him as if to separate him from his remaining seamen he heard someone shrieking and pleading the sickening sound of a skull splintered open like a coconut he found he had his back to a tree and was striking out wildly wasting his strength leaving himself open for one of those firehardened spears bolitho saw three of his men one of whom had been wounded in the leg standing together hemmed in by screaming slashing figures he pushed himself away from the tree hacked open a black shoulder with his hanger and bounded across the trampled sand to join the embattled seamen one cried sno use cant old th buggers bolitho felt the hanger knocked from his hand and realized he had not fastened the lanyard around his wrist he searched desperately for another weapon seeing that his men were breaking and running towards the beach the injured one hopping only a few paces before he too was cut down bolitho got a terrifying impression of two staring eyes and bared white teeth and saw the savage charging towards him scooping up a discarded cutlass as he came bolitho ducked and tried to leap to one side then came the impact too great for pain too powerful to measure he knew he was falling his forehead on fire while in another world he could hear his own voice calling out brittle with agony and then mercifully there was nothing when consciousness finally returned the agony which accompanied it was almost unendurable bolitho tried to force open his eyes as if by doing so he could drive away the torment but it was so great he could feel his whole body contracting to withstand it voices murmured above his head but through his partially closed eyes he could see very little a few hazy shapes the darker shadows of beams directly overhead it was as if his head was being crushed slowly and deliberately between two heated irons torturing his cringing mind with probing pains and brilliant flashes like lightning cool cloths were being dabbed over his face and neck and then across his body he was naked not pinioned by force but with hands touching his wrists and ankles in case he struggled another thought made him cry out with terror he was badly injured elsewhere than in his head and they were getting ready for him he had seen it done the knife glittering in the feeble lanterns the quick cut and turn of the blade and then the saw easy son that was bulkley and the fact he was here helped to steady him in some way bolitho imagined he could smell the surgeon brandy and tobacco he tried to speak but his voice was a hoarse whisper what happened bulkley peered over his shoulder his owllike face with the little spectacles poised in the air like a comic bladder save your breath breathe slowly bulkley nodded thats it bolitho gritted his teeth as the pain tightened its hold it was worst above his right eye where there was a bandage his hair felt tight matted with blood vaguely the picture reformed the bulging eyes the cutlass swinging towards him oblivion he asked my men are they safe bolitho felt a coat sleeve brush against his bare arm and saw dumaresq looking down at him his shape made more grotesque by the angle the eyes were no longer compelling but grave the boats crew are safe two of your original party reached it in time bolitho tried to move his head but someone held it firmly stockdale is he dumaresq smiled he carried you to the beach but for him all of the people would have been lost i shall tell you later now you must endeavour to rest you have lost a lot of blood bolitho could feel the darkness closing over him again he had seen the quick exchange of glances between dumaresq and the surgeon it was not over he might die the realization was almost too much and he felt the tears smarting in his eyes as he gasped dont want to leave destiny mustnt go like this dumaresq said you will recover he rested his hand on bolithos shoulder so that he could feel the strength of the man as if he were transferring some of his power into him then he moved away and bolitho realized for the first time that he was in the stern cabin and that beyond the tall windows it was pitchdark bulkley watched him and said you have been unconscious all day richard he wagged his finger at him you had me somewhat troubled i can tell you then you are not worried for me now again he tried to move but the hands gripped him firmly like watchful animals bulkley made a few adjustments to the bandages a severe blow to the head with a heavy blade is never a thing to be scoffed at i have done some work on you the rest will depend on time and care it was a closerun fight but for stockdales courage and his determination to rescue you you would be dead he glanced round as if to ensure that the captain had gone he rallied the remaining seamen when they were about to flee from the beach he was like a wild bull yet when he carried you aboard he did it with the gentleness of a woman he sighed it must be the costliest cargo of fresh water in naval history bolitho could feel a new drowsiness closing in to withstand the pounding anguish in his skull bulkley had given him something he whispered you would tell me if bulkley was wiping his fingers probably he looked up and added you are being well cared for we are about to weigh anchor so endeavour to rest yourself bolitho tried to keep a grip on his senses about to weigh anchor here all day so the water must have been obtained men had died many more afterwards he thought when colpoys marines took their revenge he spoke very slowly knowing his words were getting slurred but knowing too that he must make himself understood tell aurtell mrs egmont that bulkley leaned over him and pulled at his eyelids tell her yourself she has been with you since you were brought aboard i told you you are well cared for then bolitho saw her standing beside him her black hair hanging down over either shoulder glossy in the lantern light she touched his face her fingers brushing his lips as she said softly you can sleep now my lieutenant i am here bolitho felt the hands relax their hold from his wrists and ankles and sensed the surgeons assistants withdrawing into the shadows he murmured faintly ii did not want you to see me like this aurora she smiled but it made her look incredibly sad you are beautiful she said bolitho closed his eyes the strength gone from him at last by the screen door bulkley turned to look at them he should be used to pain and the gratitude of recovery but he was not and he was moved by what he saw it was more like a painting from mythology he thought the lovely woman weeping by the fallen body of her hero he had not lied to bolitho it had been very close and the cutlass had not only made a deep scar above the eye and into the hairline but had scored the bone beneath had bolitho been an older man or the cutlass expertly used it would have ended there she said he is asleep but she was not speaking to bulkley she removed her white shawl and very gently spread it across bolithos body as if his nakedness like her words was something private in destinys other ordered world a voice bellowed anchors aweigh sir bulkley put out a hand to steady himself as the deck tilted to the sudden pressure of wind and rudder he would go to his sickbay and have several long drinks he had no wish to see the island as it fell astern in the dusk it had given them fresh water but had taken lives in exchange bolithos party at the pool had been massacred but for stockdale and two others colpoys had reported that the savages who had attacked them were once slaves who had possibly escaped when on passage to an island plantation seeing bolitho and his men approaching they had doubtless imagined they were there to hunt them down and award some brutal reprisal when destinys boats roused by the pistolshot from the beach and the sudden panic amongst the cutters crew had reached the shore those same slaves had run towards them nobody knew if they had realized destiny was not a blackbirder after all and were trying to make recompense colpoys had directed the swivel guns and musketoons which were mounted in each boat to rake the beach when the smoke had drifted away there had been nobody alive to explain bulkley paused at the top of the ladder and heard the clatter of blocks the pad of bare feet as the seamen hauled at halliards and braces to set their ship on her true course to a manofwar it was only an interlude something to be written up in her log until the next challenge the next fight he glanced aft at the swaying deckhead lantern and the redcoated sentry beneath it and yet he decided there had been a lot of worthwhile things too secrets the days which immediately followed bolithos return to the living were like parts of a dream from the age of twelve since he had first gone to sea as a midshipman he had been used to the constant demands of a ship night or day at any hour and under all conditions he had been ready to run with the others to whatever duty was ordered and had been under no illusions as to the consequences if he failed to obey but as destiny sailed slowly northwards through the caribbean he was forced to accept his inactivity to remain still and listen to the familiar sounds beyond the cabin or above his head the dream was made more than bearable by the presence of aurora even the terrible pain which struck suddenly and without mercy she somehow held at bay just as she saw through his pitiful attempts to hide it from her she would hold his hand or wipe his brow with a damp cloth sometimes when the agony probed his skull like a branding iron she put her arm beneath his shoulders and pressed her face to his chest murmuring secret words into his body as if to still the torment he watched her whenever she was in a position where he could see her while his strength held he described the shipboard sounds the names of the sailors he knew and how they worked together to make the ship a living thing he told her of his home in falmouth of his brother and sisters and the long bolitho ancestry which was part of the sea itself she was always careful not to excite him with questions and allowed him to talk as long as he felt like it she fed him but in such a fashion that he did not feel humiliated or like a helpless child only when the matter of shaving arose was she unable to keep a straight face but dear richard you do not seem to need a shave bolitho flushed knowing it was true as he usually shaved but once a week she said i will do it for you she used the razor with great care watching each stroke and occasionally glancing through the stern windows to see if the ship was on even keel bolitho tried to relax glad that she imagined his tenseness was out of fear of the razor in fact he was more than aware of her nearness the pressure of her breast as she leaned over him the exciting touch on his face and throat there she stood back and studied him approvingly you look very she hunted through her vocabulary distinguished bolitho asked could i see please he saw the uncertainty please she took a mirror from the cabin chest and said you are strong you will get over it bolitho stared at the face in the mirror it was that of a stranger the surgeon had sheared away his hair from the right temple and the whole of his forehead from eyebrow to where the hair remained was black and purple with savage bruising bulkley had appeared content when he had removed the dressing and bandages but to bolithos eyes the length and depth of the scar made more horrific by the black crisscross of the surgeons stitches was repellent he said quietly it must sicken you she removed the mirror and said i am proud of you nothing could spoil you in my heart i have stayed with you from that first moment when you were carried here have watched over you so that i know your body like my own she met his gaze proudly that scar will remain but it is one of honour not of shame later she left his side in answer to a summons from dumaresq the cabin servant macmillan told bolitho that destiny was due to sight st christophers on the following day so it seemed likely that the captain was about to clarify egmonts statement and make certain he would stand by it the hunt for the missing bullion or whatever form it had taken since garricks seizure of it seemed of no importance to bolitho he had had plenty of time to think about his future as he sweated in pain or had found recovery in her arms perhaps too much time the idea of her stepping ashore to rejoin her husband in whatever new enterprise he dictated and not to see her ever again was unbearable to mark the progress of his recovery he had several visitors rhodes beaming with pleasure to see him again unabashed as ever as he said makes you look like a real terror richard thatll get the doxies jumping when we reach port he was careful not to mention aurora palliser came too and made as close as he knew how to an apology if i had sent a marine picket as colpoys suggested none of it would have happened he shrugged and glanced round the cabin at the female attire draped near the windows after being washed by the maid but it apparently has its brighter aspects bulkley and dumaresqs clerk supervised the first walk away from the cabin bolitho felt the ship responding beneath his bare feet but knew his weakness the dizziness which never seemed far away no matter how hard he tried to conceal it he cursed spillane and his medical knowledge when he said might be a severe fracture there sir bulkley replied gruffly nonsense but still its early days bolitho had expected to die but with recovery apparently within his grasp it seemed unthinkable there was yet another course he might have to take to be sent home in the next available ship to be removed from the navy list and not even retained on halfpay to give some hope of reemployment he wished he could have thanked stockdale but even his influence had so far failed to get him past the sentry at the door all the midshipmen with the noticeable exception of cowdroy had been to visit him and had stared at his terrible scar with a mixture of awe and commiseration jury had been quite unable to hide his admiration and had exclaimed to think that i cried like a baby over my pinprick it was late evening before she returned to the cabin and he sensed the change in her the listless way she arranged his pillow and made certain his waterjug was filled she said quietly i shall leave tomorrow richard my husband has signed his name to the documents it is done your captain has sworn that he will leave us to go as we please once he has seen the governor of st christophers after that i do not know bolitho gripped her hand and tried not to think of dumaresqs other promise to the heloises master before he had died had died from bolithos own blade he said i may have to leave the ship too she seemed to forget her own troubles and leaned over him anxiously what is this who said you must go he reached up carefully and touched her hair like silk warm beautiful silk it doesnt matter now aurora she traced a pattern on his shoulder with her finger how can you say that of course it matters the sea is your world you have seen and done much but all your life still lies before you bolitho felt her hair touch his skin and shivered he said firmly i shall quit the navy i have made up my mind after all you have told me of your family tradition you would throw it all away for you yes i will she shook her head the long black hair clinging to him as she protested you must not speak like this my brother is my fathers favourite and always has been it was strange that in moment of crisis he could say it without bitterness or remorse even knowing it was the truth he can uphold the tradition it is you i want you i love he said it so fiercely that she was obviously moved bolitho saw her hand rest on her breast a pulse beating in her throat which made her outward composure a lie it is madness i know all about you but of me you know nothing what sort of life would you have watching me grow older while you yearn for the ships for the chances you threw away she placed her hand on his forehead it is like a fever richard fight it or it will destroy both of us bolitho turned his face away his eyes pricking as he said i could make you happy aurora she stroked his arm soothing his despair i never doubted it but there is more to life than that believe me she backed away her body moving in time with the ships gentle roll i told you earlier i could love you for the past days and nights i have watched you touched you my thoughts were wicked my longing greater than i would dare admit she shook her head please do not look at me like that perhaps after all the voyage took too long and tomorrow comes too late i no longer know anything she turned her face in shadow as she was framed against the saltstained windows i shall never forget you richard and i will probably damn myself for turning your offer aside but i am asking for your help i cannot do it alone macmillan brought the evening meal and said beg pardon maam but the capn an is officers send their respects an will you dine with them tonight it bein the last time so to speak macmillan was really too old for his work and served his captain in the same fashion as a respected family retainer he was totally unaware of the tension the huskiness in her voice as she replied i will be honoured nor did he see the despair on the lieutenants face as he watched her walk into the screenedoff part of the cabin where her maid spent most of the day she paused the lieutenant is stronger now he will manage she turned away her words muffled on his own with bulkleys supporting hand at his elbow bolitho ventured on to the quarterdeck and looked along the ships length towards the land it was very hot and the scorching noon sun made him realize just how weak he still was seeing the barebacked seamen bustling about the upper deck others straddled along the yards as they shortened sail for the final approach he felt lost out of things in a way he had not known before bulkley said i have been to st christophers previously he pointed towards the nearest headland with its writhing line of white surf bluff point beyond it lies basseterre and the main anchorage there will be kings ships aplenty ive no doubt some forgotten flagofficer wholl be anxious to tell our captain what to do some marines marched past panting loudly in the red coats and heavy equipment bolitho gripped the nettings and watched the land a small island but an important link in britain s chain of command at another time he would have been excited at a first visit but now as he stared at the nodding palms the occasional glimpse of native boats he could only see what it represented here they would part whatever his own fate might be here it was ended between them he knew from the way rhodes and the others avoided the subject that they were probably thinking he should be thankful to have lived through that murderous attack and then be nursed by so beautiful a woman should be enough for any man but it was not dumaresq came on deck and glanced briefly at the compass and at the set of the sails gulliver touched his hat nornoreast sir steady as she goes good prepare a salute mr palliser we shall be up to fort londonderry within the hour he saw bolitho and held up his hand stay if you wish he crossed the deck to join him his glance taking in bolithos eyes dulled by pain the horrible scar laid bare for all to see he said you will live be thankful he beckoned the midshipman of the watch get aloft with you mr lovelace and spy out fleet anchorage count the ships and report to me as soon as you are satisfied he watched the youth swarm up the ratlines and said like the rest of our young gentlemen he has grown up on this voyage he glanced at bolitho that applies more to you than anyone bolitho said ifeel a hundred sir i expect so dumaresq grinned when you get your own command you will remember the pitfalls i hope but i doubt if you will pity your young lieutenants any more than i do the captain turned aft and bolitho saw his eyes light up with interest without looking he knew she had come on deck to see the island how would she see it as a temporary refuge or a prison egmont seemed unchanged by his ordeal he walked to the side and remarked this place has altered little dumaresq kept his voice matter of fact garrick will be here you are certain as sure as anyone can be he saw bolitho and nodded curtly i see you are recovered lieutenant bolitho forced a smile thank you sir yes i ache but i am in one piece she joined her husband and said steadily we both thank you lieutenant you saved our lives we cannot repay that dumaresq watched each in turn like a hunter it is our purpose but some duties are more rewarding than others he turned away to see garrick taken is all i ask damn him too many have died because of his greed too many widows are left by his ambitions palliser cupped his hands take in the forecourse dumaresqs calm was slipping as he snapped god damn his eyes mr palliser what is lovelace doing up there palliser peered up at the mainmast crosstrees where midshipman lovelace sat precariously balanced like a monkey on a stick egmont forgot bolitho and his wife as he picked upon the captains changed mood what is worrying you dumaresq clasped and unclasped his strong fingers across the tails of his coat i am not worried sir merely interested midshipman lovelace came sliding down a backstay and landed on the deck with a thud he swallowed hard visibly shrinking under their combined stares dumaresq asked mildly must we wait mr lovelace or is it something so stupendous you cannot bear to call it from the masthead lovelace stammered bbut sir you told me to ccount the vessels yonder he tried again there is only one manowar sir a large frigate dumaresq took a few paces back and forth to clear his thoughts one ysay he looked at palliser the squadron must have been called elsewhere east to antigua to reinforce the admiral perhaps palliser said there may be a senior officer here sir in the frigate maybe he kept his face immobile dumaresq would not take kindly to being outranked by another captain bolitho did not care he moved closer to the quarterdeck rail and saw her put her hand on it dumaresq shouted where is that damned quillpusher send for spillane at once to egmont he said i must discuss a few trivial matters before we anchor please come with me bolitho stood beside her and briefly touched her hand with his he felt her tense as if she shared his pain and said quietly my love i am in hell she did not turn to look at him but said you promised to help me please i will shame us both if you continue then she did look at him her eyes steady but just too bright as she said it is all wasted if you are to be unhappy and your life spoiled because of something we both value palliser yelled mr vallance stand by to fire the salute men ran to their stations while the ship indifferent to all of them continued into the bay bolitho took her arm and guided her to the companionway there will be a lot of smoke and dust directly you had best go below until we are closer inshore how was it possible to speak so calmly on unimportant matters he added i must talk with you again but she had already gone down into the shadows bolitho walked forward again and saw stockdale watching from the starboard gangway his gun was not required for the salute but he was showing his usual interest bolitho said it seems i am at a loss when it comes to finding the right words stockdale how can i thank you for what you did if i offered you reward i suspect you would be insulted but words are nothing for what i feel stockdale smiled you bein ere for us all to see is enough one day youll be a captain sir an grateful ill be youll be needin a good coxn then he nodded towards johns the captains own coxswain smart and aloof in his giltbuttoned jacket and striped trousers like old dick yonder a man o leisure it seemed to amuse him greatly but the rest of his words were lost in the controlled crash of gunfire palliser waited for the fort by the anchorage to reply and then said mr lovelace was right about the frigate he lowered the telescope and glanced grimly at bolitho but he failed to note that she is wearing spanish colours i doubt that the captain will be greatly amused bulkley said anxiously i think you should rest you have been on deck for hours what are you trying to do kill yourself bolitho watched the clustered buildings around the anchorage the two forts each well placed at either side like squat sentinels im sorry i was thinking only of myself he reached up and gingerly touched the scar perhaps it would be completely healed or partially covered by his hair before he saw his mother again what with her husband returning home with one arm and now a disfigured son she would have more than enough to face up to he said you did so much for me too too the surgeons eyes twinkled behind his glasses i think i understand mr bolitho palliser appeared through the companionway are you fit enough to go ashore i must protest bulkley pushed forward he is barely able to stand up palliser stood facing them his hands on his hips ever since the anchor had been dropped and the boats put down alongside he had been called from one crisis to another but mostly down to the great cabin dumaresq was extremely angry if the loudness of his voice was anything to go by and palliser was in no mood for argument let him decide dammit he looked at bolitho i am shorthanded but for some reason the captain requires you to go ashore with him remember our first meeting i need every officer and man working in my ship no matter how you feel you keep going until you drop or are incapable of movement you are still one of my lieutenants is that plain bolitho nodded somehow glad of pallisers temper im ready good then get changed as an afterthought he said you may carry your hat bulkley watched him stride away and exploded angrily he is beyond understanding by god richard if you feel unsteady i will demand that you stay aboard young stephen can take your place bolitho made to shake his head but winced as the pain stabbed back at him i shall be all right but thank you he walked to the companionway adding i suspect there is some special reason for taking me with him bulkley nodded you are getting to know our captain very well richard he never acts without a purpose never offers a guinea which will not profit him two he sighed but the thought of leaving his service is worse than tolerating his insults life would seem very dull after dumaresqs command it was almost evening by the time dumaresq decided to go ashore he had sent colpoys with a letter of introduction to the governors house but when the marine returned he had told him that there was only the actinggovernor in residence dumaresq had commented sharply not another rio i trust now in the captains gig with a hint of cooler air to make the journey bearable dumaresq sat as before with both hands gripped around his sword his eyes fixed on the land bolitho sat beside him his determination to withstand the pain and the recurring dizziness making him break out in a sweat he concentrated on the anchored vessels and the comings and goings of destinys boats as they ferried the sick and wounded ashore and returned already loaded with stores for the purser dumaresq said suddenly a mite to starboard johns the coxswain did not even blink but moved the tiller accordingly from one corner of his mouth he muttered youll get a good look at er presently sir dumaresq nudged bolitho sharply with an elbow hes a rascal eh knows my mind better than i bolitho watched the anchored spaniard as she towered above them she was more like a cutdown fourthrate than a frigate he thought old with elaborately carved and gilded gingerbread around her stern and cabin windows but wellmaintained with an appearance of efficiency which was rare in a spanish ship dumaresq was thinking the same and murmured the san augustin shes no local relic from la guaira or porto bello cadiz or algeciras is my guess will that make a difference sir dumaresq turned on him angrily and just as swiftly let his temper subside i am bad company after what you have suffered under my command i can spare you civility at least he watched the other vessel with professional interest as stockdale had studied the other gun crews fortyfour guns at least he seemed to recall bolithos question it might weeks and months ago there was a secret the dons suspected there was evidence available as to the asturias s lost treasure now it seems they have more than mere suspicions san augustin is here to mime destinys role and to prevent his most catholic majestys displeasure if we do not share our confidences he gave a grim smile we shall see about that i have no doubt that a dozen telescopes are watching us so look no more let them worry about us dumaresq noticed that the landingplace was only fifty yards away and said i brought you with me so that the governor would see your scar it is better proof than anything else that we are working for our masters in admiralty nobody here need know you gained so distinguished a wound whilst seeking water for our thirsty people a small group was waiting for the boat to manoeuvre to the landingplace some red uniforms amongst them it was always the same news from england word from the country which had sent them this far anything which might maintain their precious contact bolitho asked will the egmonts be allowed to go sir he lifted his chin surprised at his own impudence as dumaresqs gaze fastened on him i should like to know sir dumaresq studied him gravely for several seconds it is important to you i can see that he untangled the sword from between his legs in readiness for climbing ashore then he said bluntly she is a very desirable woman ill not argue he stood up and straightened his hat with elaborate care you need not gape like that im neither completely blind nor insensitive you know if im anything its most likely envious he clapped him on the shoulder now lets deal with the actinggovernor of this seat of empire sir jason fitzpatrick and afterwards i may consider your problem grasping his hat in one hand and supporting his sword in the other bolitho followed the captain out of the boat dumaresqs casual acceptance of his feelings for another mans wife had completely taken the wind from his sails no wonder the surgeon could not face the prospect of a quieter and more predictable master a youthful captain from the garrison touched his hat and then exclaimed my god gentlemen that is a bad wound dumaresq glanced at bolithos discomfort and might even have winked the price of duty he gave a solemn sigh it makes itself felt in many ways place of safety sir jason fitzpatrick the actinggovernor of st christophers looked like a man who lived life to excess aged about forty he was extremely fat and his face which had seemingly defied the sun over the years was brickred as bolitho followed dumaresq across a beautifully tiled entrance hall and into a lowceilinged room he saw plenty of evidence of fitzpatricks occupation there were trays of bottles set around with neat ranks of finely cut glasses close to hand presumably ready for the actinggovernor to slake his thirst with the shortest possible delay fitzpatrick said be seated gentlemen we will taste some of my claret it should be suitable although in this damnable climate who can say he had a throaty voice and incredibly small eyes which were almost hidden in the folds of his face bolitho noticed the tiny eyes more than anything they moved all the time as if quite independent of the heavy frame which supported them dumaresq had told him on the way from the waterfront that fitzpatrick was a rich plantation owner with other properties on the neighbouring island of nevis here master bolitho turned and felt his stomach contract a big negro in red jacket and loose white trousers was holding a tray towards him bolitho did not see the tray or the glasses upon it in his minds eye he could picture that other black face hear the terrible scream of triumph as he had hacked him down with a seamans cutlass he took a glass and nodded his thanks while his breathing returned to normal dumaresq was saying by the authority entrusted in me i am ordered to complete this investigation without further delay sir jason i have the written statements required and would like you to furnish me with garricks whereabouts fitzpatrick played with the stem of his glass his eyes flitting rapidly round the room ah captain you are in a great hurry you see the governor is absent he was stricken with fever some months back and returned to england aboard an indiaman he may be on his way back by now communications are very poor we are hard put to get our mails on time with all these wretched pirates on the rampage honest craft sail in fear of their lives it is a pity their lordships of admiralty do not put their minds to that dumaresq was unmoved i had hoped that a flagofficer would be here as i explained captain the governor is away otherwise otherwise thered be no damned spaniard anchored here im certain of that fitzpatrick forced a smile we are not at war with spain the san augustin comes in peace she is commanded by capitan de navio don carlos quintana a most senior and personable captain who is also entrusted with his countrys authority he leaned back obviously pleased with his advantage after all what evidence do you really have the statement of a man who died before he could be brought to justice the sworn testimony of a renegade who is so eager to save his own skin he will say anything dumaresq tried to hide the bitterness as he answered my clerk was carrying further documents of proof when he was murdered in madeira indeed i am genuinely sorry about that captain but to cast a slur against the name of so influential a gentleman as sir piers garrick without evidence would be a criminal act in itself he smiled complacently may i suggest we await instructions from london you may send your despatches on the next homebound vessel which will probably be from barbados you could anchor there and be ready to act when so instructed by then the governor may have returned and the squadron too so that you will have senior naval authority to uphold your actions dumaresq snapped angrily that could take months by then the bird will have flown forgive my lack of enthusiasm as i told don carlos it all happened thirty years ago so why this sudden interest garrick was a felon first a traitor second you complain about the flocks of pirates who roam the main and the caribbean who sack towns and plunder the ships of rich traders but do you ever wonder where they find their own vessels like the heloise which was new from a british yard sent out here with a passage crew and for what bolitho listened entranced he had expected fitzpatrick to leap to his feet and summon the garrison commander to plan with dumaresq how they would seek and detain the elusive garrick and then wait for further orders fitzpatrick spread his red hands apologetically it is not within my province to take such action captain i am in a temporary capacity and would receive no thanks for putting a match to the powderkeg you must of course do as you think fit you say you had hoped for a flagofficer to be here no doubt to take the responsibility and decision from your shoulders when dumaresq remained silent he continued calmly so do not pour scorn on me for not wishing to act unsupported bolitho was astounded the admiralty in london some senior officers of the fleet even the government of king george had been involved in getting the destiny here dumaresq had worked without respite from the moment he had been told of his assignment and must have spent many long hours in the privacy of his cabin pondering on his own interpretation of his scanty collection of clues and now because there was no naval authority to back his most important decision he would either have to kick his heels and wait for orders to arrive from elsewhere or take it upon himself at the age of twentyeight dumaresq was the senior naval officer in st christophers and bolitho found it impossible to see how he could proceed with a course of action which might easily destroy him dumaresq said wearily tell me what you know of garrick virtually nothing it is true he has shipping interests and has taken delivery of several small vessels over the months he is a very rich man and i understand he intends to continue trading with the french in martinique with a view to extending commerce elsewhere dumaresq stood up i must return to my ship he did not look at bolitho i would take it kindly if you would accommodate my third lieutenant who has been wounded and all to no good purpose it now appears fitzpatrick lifted his bulk unsteadily id be happy to do that he tried to hide his relief dumaresq was obviously going to take the easier course dumaresq silenced bolithos unspoken protest ill send some servants to care for your wants he nodded to the actinggovernor i shall return when i have spoken with the san augustins captain outside the building his features hidden in the gloom dumaresq gave vent to his true feelings that bloody hound hes in it up to the neck thinks ill stay anchored and be a good little boy does he god damn his poxy face ill see him in hell first must i stay here sir for the present ill detail some stout hands to join you i dont trust that fitzpatrick hes a local landowner and probably as thick as thieves with every smuggler and slaver in the caribbean play the innocent with me would he by god ill wager he knows how many new vessels have fetched up here to await garricks orders bolitho asked is he still a pirate sir dumaresq grinned in the darkness worse i believe he is directly involved with supplying arms and wellfound vessels for use against us in the north america sir eventually and further still if those damned renegades have their way do you think the french will rest until they have rekindled the fires we kicked them out of canada and their caribbean possessions did you imagine theyd put forgiveness at the top of their list bolitho had often heard talk of the unrest in the american colony which had followed the seven years war there had been several serious incidents but the prospect of open rebellion had been regarded by even the most influential newspaper as bluster all these years garrick has been working and scheming using his stolen booty to best advantage he sees himself as a leader if a rebellion comes and those in power who believe otherwise are deluding themselves i have had plenty of time to mull over garricks affairs and the cruel unfairness which made him rich and powerful and left my father an impoverished cripple bolitho watched the gig approaching through the darkness the oars very white against the water so dumaresq had already decided he should have guessed after what he had seen and learned of the man dumaresq said suddenly egmont and his wife will also be landed shortly they are outwardly under fitzpatricks care but post a guard for your own satisfaction i want fitzpatrick to know he is directly implicated should there be any attempt at treachery you think egmont is still in danger sir dumaresq waved his hand towards the small residency here is a place of safety ill not have egmont on the run again with some mad scheme of his own there are too many who might want him dead after i have dealt with garrick he can do as he damn well pleases the quicker the better i see sir dumaresq signalled to his coxswain and then chuckled i doubt that but keep your ears open as i believe things will begin to move very shortly bolitho watched him climb into the gig and then retraced his steps to the residency did dumaresq care what happened to egmont and his wife or like the hunter he was did he merely see them as bait for his trap there were two or three small dwellings set well apart from the residency and which were normally used for visiting officials or militia officers and their families bolitho assumed that these visitors were rare and when they came were prepared to supply their own comforts the building allotted to him was little more than the size of a room the frames around the shutters were pitted with holes made by a tireless army of insects he thought palms tapped against the roof and walls and he guessed that in any heavy rainstorm the whole place would leak like a sieve he sat gingerly on a large handcarved bed and trimmed a lantern more insects buzzed and threw themselves at the hot glass and he pitied the less fortunate people on the island if the governor himself could be struck down by fever planks creaked outside the loosely fitting door and stockdale peered in at him with six other men he had come ashore to keep a weathereye on things as he put it he wheezed all posted sir well work watch an watch josh little will take the first one he leaned against the door and bolitho heard it groan in protest ive put two ands near the other place its quiet enough bolitho thought of the way she had looked at him as she and her husband had been hurried into the next dwelling by some of the governors servants she had appeared worried distressed by the sudden change of events egmont was said to have friends in basseterre but instead of being released to go to them he was still a guest a prisoner more likely bolitho said get some sleep he touched the scar and grimaced i feel as if it happened today stockdale grinned neat bit o work sir lucky weve a good sawbones he strolled out of the door and bolitho heard him whistling softly as he found his own place to stretch out sailors could sleep anywhere bolitho lay back his hands behind his head as he stared up at the shadows above the lanterns small glow it was all a waste garrick had gone from the island or that was what he had heard he must be better informed than dumaresq had believed he would be laughing now thinking of the frigate and her unwanted spanish consort lying baffled at anchor while he bolitho sat up with a jerk reaching out for his pistol as the planks outside the door squeaked again he watched the handle drop and could feel his heart pounding against his ribs as he measured the distance across the room and wondered if he could get to his feet in time to defend himself the door opened a few inches and he saw her small hand around its edge he was off the bed in seconds and as he opened the door he heard her gasp please watch the light for a long confused moment they clung together the door tightly shut behind them there was no sound but their breathing and bolitho was almost afraid to speak for fear of smashing this unbelievable dream she said quietly i had to come it was bad enough on the ship but to know you were in here while she looked up at him her eyes shining do not despise me for my weakness bolitho held her tightly feeling her soft body through the long pale gown knowing they were already lost if the world fell apart around them nothing could spoil this moment how she had got past his sentries he could not understand nor did he care then he thought of stockdale he should have guessed his hands were shaking badly as he held her shoulders and kissed her hair her face and her throat she whispered i will help you she stood back from him and allowed the gown to fall to the floor now hold me again in the darkness somewhere between the two small buildings stockdale propped his cutlass against a tree and sat down on the ground he watched the moonlight as it touched the door he had seen open and close just an hour ago and thought about the two of them together it was probably the lieutenants first time he thought comfortably he could have no better teacher that was certain long before dawn the girl named aurora slipped quietly from the bed and pulled on her gown for a while more she looked at the pale figure now sleeping deeply while she touched her breast as he had done then she stooped and kissed him lightly on the mouth his lips tasted of salt perhaps from her own tears without another glance she left the room and ran past stockdale seeing nothing bolitho walked slowly from the doorway and stepped down on to the sunhardened ground as if he was walking on thin glass although he had donned his uniform he still felt naked could imagine their embrace the breathtaking demands of their passion which had left him spent he stared at the early sunlight at one of his guards who was watching him curiously as he leaned on a musket if only he had been awake when she had left him then they would never have parted stockdale strolled to meet him nothin to report sir he eyed bolithos uncertainty with quiet satisfaction the lieutenant was different lost but alive confused too but in time he would feel the strength she had given him bolitho nodded muster the hands he went to raise his hat to his head and remembered the scar which throbbed and burned at the slightest touch she had even made him forget about that stockdale stooped down and picked up a small piece of paper which had dropped from inside the hat he handed it over his face expressionless cant read meself sir bolitho opened the paper his eyes misty as he read her few brief words dearest i could not wait think of me sometimes and how it was beneath it she had written the place your captain wants is fougeaux island she had not signed her name but he could almost hear her speaking aloud you feelin weak sir no he reread the small message once again she must have carried it with her knowing she was going to give herself to him knowing too that it was ending there feet grated on sand and he saw palliser striding along the path midshipman merrett trotting in his wake and hard put to keep up with the lanky lieutenant he saw bolitho and snapped all done he waited his eyes wary bolitho asked egmont and his wife sir whats happened oh didnt you know theyve just boarded a vessel in the bay we sent their luggage across during the night id have thought you would be better informed bolitho hesitated then very carefully he folded the paper and removed the lower half with the islands name written on it palliser examined it and said itll be the one he refolded the paper and handed it to merrett back to the ship my lad and present this with my respects to the captain lose it and i promise you a hideous death the youth fled down the path and palliser said the captain was right after all he smiled at bolithos grave features come ill walk back with you you say theyve already boarded a vessel sir he could not accept it where bound i forget is it important bolitho fell in step beside him she had provided the information as repayment perhaps for saving her life or for sharing his love with her dumaresq had used both of them he felt his face sting with anger a place of safety he had called it more likely one of deceit when he reached the ship he found the hands turnedto the sails loosely brailed and ready to set at short notice as instructed bolitho presented himself in the cabin where dumaresq and gulliver were studying some charts with elaborate care dumaresq told the master to wait outside and then said bluntly in order to avoid my having to punish you for insubordination let me speak first our mission in these waters is an important one for so small a vessel i have always believed it and now with that final piece of intelligence i know where garrick has made his headquarters his storehouse for arms unlawful supplies and vessels to disperse them it is important bolitho met his gaze i should have been told sir you enjoyed it did you not his voice softened i know what its like to be in love with a dream and that is all it could have been you are a kings officer and may amount to being a fair one given time and a bit of common sense bolitho looked past him towards the windows at the moored vessels there and wondered which if any of them was aurora s he asked is that all sir yes take charge of your division i intend to weigh as soon as my quillpusher has made copies of my despatches for the authorities and for london he was lost in his thoughts the hundred and one things he must do bolitho blundered from the cabin and into the wardroom it was impossible to picture the cabin as it had been her clothes hung neatly to dry the young maidservant always near in case she was needed perhaps dumaresqs way was the best but need it be so brutal and without feeling rhodes and colpoys rose to greet him and they solemnly shook hands bolitho touched the piece of paper in his pocket and felt stronger whatever dumaresq and the others thought they could never be certain or really know how it was bulkley entered the wardroom saw bolitho and was about to ask him how his wound was progressing but rhodes gave a slight shake of his head and the surgeon called poad for some coffee instead bolitho would get over it but it would take time anchors aweigh sir dumaresq walked to the rail and stared across at the spaniard as with her sails booming in a lively breeze destiny tacked round towards the open sea he said that will rile the don hes half of his people ashore gathering supplies and will not be able to follow us for hours he threw back his head and laughed damn you garrick make the most of your freedom bolitho watched his men setting the maintopgallant sail calling to each other as if they too were infected by dumaresqs excitement death prizemoney a different landfall it was all meat to them palliser shouted from the quarterdeck chase up those hands mr bolitho they have lead in their limbs today bolitho turned aft his mouth framing an angry retort then he shrugged palliser was trying to help him in the only way he knew skirting the treacherous shallows off bluff pointdestiny spread more sails and headed away towards the west later when bolitho took over the afternoonwatch he examined the chart and gullivers carefully written calculations fougeaux island was very small one of a scattered group some miles westnorthwest of st christophers it had been claimed by france spain and england in turn even the dutch had been interested for a time now it owed allegiance to no country for to all intents it had no real use it lacked timber for firewood or repairs and according to the navigational notes it had less than its share of water a bare hostile place with a lagoon shaped like a reapinghook as its one asset it could provide shelter from storms if little else but as dumaresq had observed what else did garrick require bolitho watched the captain as he prowled restlessly about the deck as if he could not bear the restraint of his quarters now that his goal was so close adverse winds were making progress hard and frustrating with the ship tacking back and forth for several miles to gain a few cables advance but the mention of lost bullion and the prospect of some share in it seemed to make up for the backbreaking work of trimming the yards and resetting the sails again and again suppose the island proved to be empty or the wrong one bolitho guessed it to be unlikely aurora must have known that garricks capture was the only way of preventing him from taking his revenge on her husband and herself also that dumaresq had no intention of freeing them without solid information the next day found destiny drifting becalmed her sails hanging flat and devoid of movement far away to starboard was the vague shape of another islet but otherwise they had the sea to themselves it was so hot that feet stuck to the deck seams and the gun barrels felt as if they had been firing in battle gulliver said if we had taken a more northerly passage wed have been in better luck for a wind sir i know that damn you dumaresq turned on him hotly and risk losing my keel as well is that what you want this is a frigate not some damned fishing boat all that day and for half of the next the ship rolled uneasily in the swell a shark moved cautiously beneath her counter and several of the hands tried their luck with hooks and lines dumaresq never seemed to leave the deck and as he passed bolitho during his watch he saw that his shirt was black with sweat and there was a livid blister on his forehead which he did not seem to notice halfway through the afternoonwatch the wind felt its way slowly across the glittering water but with it came a surprise ship sir fine on the larboard quarter dumaresq and palliser watched the tancoloured pyramid grow above the horizon the great scarlet cross clearly etched on her forecourse to dispel any doubt palliser exclaimed bitterly the don blast his soul dumaresq lowered the glass his eyes like stones fitzpatrick he must have told them now theyre hot for blood he looked past his officers if don carlos quintana interferes now it will be his own blood man the braces there destiny shivered and tilted steadily to a freshening breeze her renewed strength tossing spray up and around her white figurehead dumaresq said put the people to gundrill mr palliser he stared astern at the other vessel she already seemed to be drawing much closer and run up the colours if you please ill have no damned spaniard crossing my bows rhodes dropped his voice he means it too richard this is his moment hed die rather than share it some of the men near the quarterdeck glanced at each other and murmured apprehensively their natural contempt for any navy but their own had been somewhat blunted by the brief stay at basseterre the san augustin carried at least fortyfour guns against their own twentyeight dumaresq shouted and get those dolts to work mr palliser this ship is getting like a sty one of bolithos guncaptains muttered i thought we was only after a pirate stockdale showed his teeth an enemys an enemy tom when did a flag make any difference bolitho bit his lip this was the true responsibility of command at close quarters if dumaresq did nothing he could be courtmartialled for incompetence or cowardice if he crossed swords with a spanish ship he might be blamed for provoking a war he said stand to lads cast off the breechings maybe stockdale was right all you had to worry about was winning the following day the hands were sent to breakfast and then the decks swabbed down before the sun had crept fully over the horizon the breeze though light was steady enough and had shifted during the night watches to southwesterly dumaresq was on deck as early as anyone and bolitho saw the impatience in his thickset figure as he strode about the deck glancing at the compass or consulting the masters slate by the wheel he probably saw none of these things and bolitho could tell from the way that palliser and gulliver gave him a wide berth that they knew the measure of his moods of old with rhodes bolitho watched the boatswain detailing his working parties as usual the fact that a larger manofwar than their own was trailing astern and that the little known fougeaux island lay somewhere beyond the lee bow made no difference to mr timbrells routine pallisers brusque tones made bolitho start rig topchains before all else mr timbrell some of the seamen looked up at the yards palliser did not explain further nor did he need to for the older hands the chains would be rigged to sling each yard as the cordage which normally held them might be shot away in any sort of battle then the nets would be spread across the upper deck the slings and the nets were the only protection to the men below from falling spars and rigging perhaps it was the same aboard the spaniard bolitho thought although he had seen little evidence so far in fact now that she had caught up the san augustin seemed content to follow and watch events rhodes turned abruptly and headed for his own part of the ship hissing quickly lord and master bolitho swung round and came face to face with the captain it was unusual to see him away from the quarterdeck or poop and the seamen working around him seemed to press back as if they too were awed by his presence bolitho touched his hat and waited dumaresqs eyes examined his face slowly without expression then he said come with me bring a glass tossing his hat to his coxswain he added a climb will clear the head bolitho stared as dumaresq began to haul himself out and on to the shrouds his broad figure hanging awkwardly as he peered up at the spiralling masthead bolitho hated heights of all the things which had encouraged him to work for advancement to lieutenant he thought it was probably that no longer needed to swarm aloft with the hands no icecold terror as the wind tried to cut away your grip on frozen ratlines or throw you out and into the sea far below perhaps dumaresq was goading him provoking him if only to relieve his own tension come along mr bolitho you are in stays today bolitho followed him up the vibrating shrouds foot by foot hand over hand he told himself not to look down even though he could picture destinys pale deck tilting away beneath him as the ship drove her shoulder into a steep roller disdaining the lubbers hole dumaresq clawed his way out on the futtock shrouds so that his misshapen body was hanging almost parallel to the sea below then up past the maintop ignoring some startled marines who were exercising with a swivel gun and towards the topgallant yard dumaresqs confidence gave bolitho the will to climb faster than he could recall what did dumaresq know about love or whether he and aurora could have overcome all the obstacles together he barely noticed the height and was already peering up towards the mainroyal yard when dumaresq paused one foot dangling in space as he observed you can get the feel of her from here bolitho clung on with both hands and stared up at him his eyes watering in the fierce sunlight dumaresq spoke with such conviction and yet with a warmth which was almost akin to love itself feel her dumaresq seized a stay and tugged it with his fist taut and firm equal strain on all parts as she should be as any good vessel ought to be properly cared for he looked at bolithos upturned face head all right bolitho nodded in his mixture of resentment and anger he had forgotten about his wound good come on then they reached the crosstrees where a lookout slithered down to make room for his betters ah dumaresq unslung a telescope and after wiping the lens with his neckcloth trained it across the starboard bow bolitho followed his example and then felt a touch of ice at his spine despite the sun and the wind which hissed through the rigging like sand it was like nothing he had ever seen the island seemed to be made entirely of coral or rock obscenely stripped bare like something which was no longer alive in the centre was a ridge rather like a hill with the top sliced off but misty in distance it could have been a giant fortress and the low island there merely to support it he tried to compare it with the sparse details on the chart and guessed from the bearing that the sheltered lagoon was directly beneath the hill dumaresq said hoarsely theyre there right enough bolitho tried again the place appeared deserted stamped in time by some terrible natural disaster then he saw something darker than the rest before it was lost in the heathaze a mast or several masts while the vessels lay hidden by the protective wall of coral he looked quickly at dumaresq and wondered how differently he saw it little pieces of a puzzle dumaresq did not raise his voice above the murmur of rigging and canvas there are garricks ships his little armada no line of battle mr bolitho no flagship with the admirals proud flag to inspire you but just as deadly bolitho took another look through his glass no wonder garrick had felt so safe he had known of their arrival at rio and even before that at madeira and now garrick had the upper hand he could either send his vessels out at night or he could stay put like a hermitcrab in a shell again dumaresq seemed to be speaking to himself all the don cares about is the lost bullion garrick can go free as far as he is concerned quintana believes that he will excise those carefully selected vessels and what booty remains without firing a shot bolitho asked perhaps garrick knows less than we think sir and may try to bluff it out dumaresq looked at him strangely i am afraid not no more bluff now i tried to explain garricks mind to the spaniard at basseterre but he would not listen garrick helped the french and in any future war spain will need an ally like france be certain that don carlos quintana is mindful of that too capn sir the lookout beneath sounded anxious the dons makin more sail dumaresq said time to go he looked at each mast in turn and then at the deck below bolitho found he could do the same without flinching the foreshortened blue and white figures of the officers and midshipmen on the quarterdeck the changing patterns of men as they moved around the double line of black cannon for those few moments bolitho shared an understanding with this devious determined man she was his ship every moving part of her every timber and inch of cordage then dumaresq said the spaniard may attempt to enter the lagoon before me it is dangerous folly because the entrance is narrow the channel unknown without hope of surprise he will be depending on his peaceful intentions with a show of force if that fails he climbed with surprising swiftness down to the deck and when bolitho reached the quarterdeck dumaresq was already speaking with palliser and the master bolitho heard palliser say the don is standing inshore sir dumaresq was busy with his telescope again then he stands into danger signal him to sheer off bolitho saw the other faces nearby ones he had come to know so well in a few moments it might all be decided and it was dumaresqs choice palliser shouted he ignores us sir very well beat to quarters and clear for action dumaresq clasped his hands behind him well see how he likes that rhodes gripped bolithos arm he must be mad he cant fight garrick and the dons the marine drummer boys began their staccato beat and the moment of doubt was past last chance the don is shortening sail sir we shall do likewise dumaresq stood in the centre of the quarterdeck just forward of the mizzen like a rock take in the tgansls bolitho shielded his eyes as he peered up through the tracery of rigging and nets as his own men began to fist and fight the rebellious canvas in less than an hour the tension had risen like the sun and now with san augustin firmly placed on the starboard bow he could feel it affecting every man who was near him destiny had the windgage but by overhauling the spanish captain had placed himself between her and the approaches to the lagoon rhodes strolled aft and joined him between two of the pounders hes letting the don get away with it he grimaced i must say i approve i dont fancy a onesided fight unless the odds are in my favour he glanced quickly at the quarterdeck and then lowered his voice what do you make of the lord and master now bolitho shrugged i am bounced between contempt and admiration i despise the way he used me he must have known egmont would not betray garricks island on his own rhodes pursed his lips so it was his wife he hesitated are you over it dick bolitho looked across at the san augustin her streaming pennants and the white ensign of spain rhodes persisted in all this with the prospect of being blown to gruel because of some stupid event of long ago you can still fret for the love of a woman bolitho faced him ill not get over it if only you could have seen her rhodes smiled sadly my god dick im wasting my time when we return to england ill have to see what i can do to roust you out of it they both turned as a shot reverberated across the water then there was a splash as the ball threw up a spindly waterspout in direct line with the spaniards bowsprit dumaresq snapped god in heaven the buggers have fired first several telescopes were trained on the island but nobody was able to sight the hidden cannon palliser said dourly that was a warning i hope the don has the sense to heed it this calls for stealth and agility not a headon charge dumaresq smiled does it indeed you begin to sound like an admiral mr palliser i shall have to watch myself bolitho studied the spanish ship closely it was as if nothing had happened she was still steering for the nearest finger of land where the lagoon began a few cormorants arose from the sea when the two ships sailed past like heraldic birds as they circled watchfully overhead bolitho thought deck there smoke above th hill sir the telescopes trained round like small artillery bolitho heard clow one of the gunners mates remark that be from a bloody furnace them devils is heatin shot to feed the dons bolitho licked his lips his father had told him often enough about the folly of setting a ship against a sited shore battery if they used heated shot it would turn any vessel into a pyre unless it was dealt with immediately sundried timbers tar paint and canvas would burn fiercely while the wind would do the rest something like a sigh transmitted itself along the deck as the san augustins ports lifted in unison and then at the blast of a trumpet she ran out her guns in the far distance they looked like black teeth along her tumblehome black and deadly the surgeon joined bolitho by the twelvepounders his spectacles glinting in the sun out of deference for the men who might soon need his services he had refrained from wearing his apron i am as nervous as a cat when this is dragging on bolitho understood down on the orlop deck below the waterline in a place of spiralling lanterns and entrapped smells all the sounds were distorted he said i think the spaniard intends to force the entrance as he spoke the other ship reset her topgallants and tacked very slightly to take advantage of the southwesterly wind how fine her gingerbread looked in the suns glare how majestic were the proud pennants and the scarlet crosses on her courses she was like something from an old engraving bolitho thought she made the lean and graceful destiny appear spartan by comparison bolitho walked aft until he stood directly below the quarterdeck rail he heard dumaresq say another halfcable and then well see then pallisers voice less certain he might just force the entrance sir once inside he could wear ship and rake the anchored vessels even use them to protect himself from the shore without craft garrick is a prisoner dumaresq considered it that part is true i have only heard of one man who successfully walked on water but we need another sort of miracle today some of the ninepounder crews nearby rocked back on their knees grinning and prodding each other over the captains humour bolitho marvelled that it could be so easy for dumaresq he knew exactly what his men needed to keep them alert and keen and that was what he gave them neither more nor a fraction less gulliver said to nobody in particular if the don succeeds thats a farewell to our prizemoney dumaresq looked at him his teeth bared in a fierce grin god you are a miserable fellow mr gulliver how you can find your way about the ocean under such a weight of despair i cannot fathom midshipman henderson called the spaniard has passed the point sir dumaresq grunted you have good eyes to palliser he added he is on a lee shore it will be now or not at all bolitho found that he was gripping his hands together so tightly that the pain helped to calm him he saw the reflected flashes from the san augustins hidden gunports the great gouts of smoke and then seconds later came the rumbling crash of her broadside puffs of smoke and dust rose like plumes along the hillside and several impressive avalanches of rocks tumbled down towards the water palliser said savagely we shall have to come about shortly sir bolitho looked up at him after destiny palliser had been hoping for a command he had made little secret of the fact but with hundreds of sea officers on the beach and on halfpay he needed more than an empty commission to carry him through the heloise could have been a steppingstone for him but promotion boards had short memories heloise lay on the bottom and not in the hands of a prize court if don carlos quintana succeeded in vanquishing garricks defences all the glory would go to him the admiralty would see too many red faces for palliser to be remembered as anything but an embarrassment there was a solitary bang and another waterspout shot skywards well clear of the spaniards hull palliser said garricks strength was a bluff after all damn him the dons must be laughing their heads off at us we found their treasure for them and now were made to watch them take it bolitho saw the spaniards yards swinging slowly and ponderously her maincourse being brailed up as she edged past another spine of coral to the anchored vessels in the lagoon she would make a fiercesome spectacle when she presented herself he heard someone murmur theym puttin down boats bolitho saw two boats being swayed out from the san augustins upper deck and then lowered alongside it was not smartly done and as the men tumbled into them and cast off bolitho guessed that their captain had no intention of heaving to on a lee shore with the added threat of a heavy cannon nearby instead of making for the spur of coral or for the islands main foreshore the boats forged ahead of their massive consort and were soon lost from view but not from the masthead lookout who soon reported that the boats were sounding the channel with lead and line to protect their ship from running aground bolitho found he could ignore pallisers bitter outbursts just as he could admire the spaniards skill and impudence don carlos had likely fought the british in the past and this chance of humiliating them was not to be missed but when he glanced aft he saw that dumaresq appeared unworried and was watching the other vessel more as a disinterested spectator he was waiting the thought struck bolitho like a fist dumaresq had been pretending all along goading the spaniard rather than the other way round bulkley saw his expression and said thickly now i think i understand the spaniard fired again to starboard the smoke gushing downwind in an unbroken bank more fragments and dust spewed away from the fall of shot but no terrified figures broke from cover nor did any gun fire back at the brightly flagged vessel dumaresq snapped let her fall off two points to starboard man the lee braces the yards squeaked to the weight of men at the braces and leaning very slightly destiny pointed her jibboom towards the flattopped hill bolitho waited for his own men to return to their stations he must be mistaken after all dumaresq was probably changing tack in readiness to come about and make a circular turn until they were back on their original approach at that moment he heard a double explosion like a rock smashing through the side of a building as he ran to the side and peered across the water he saw something leap in the air ahead of the spanish ship and then drop from view just as quickly the masthead yelled one o th boats sir shot clean in alf before the men on deck could recover from their surprise the whole hilltop erupted with a line of bright flashes there must have been seven or eight of them bolitho saw the water leap and boil around the spaniards counter and a jagged hole appear in a braced topsail without a telescope it looked dangerous enough but he heard palliser shout that sails smouldering heated shot the other balls had fallen on the ships hidden side and bolitho saw the flash of sunlight on a glass as one of her officers ran to peer at the hilltop battery then as the san augustin fired again the carefully sited battery replied against the spaniards heavy broadside the returned fire was made at will each shot individually laid and aimed smoke spurted from the ships upper deck and bolitho saw objects being flung outboard and more smoke from her poop as flames took hold dumaresq was saying waited until she had passed the point of reason mr palliser garrick is not such a fool that he wants his channel blocked by a sunken ship he thrust out his arm pointing at the smoke as the vessels foretopgallant mast and yard plunged down into the water look well that is where destiny would have been if i had yielded to temptation the spaniards firing was becoming haphazard and wild and the shots were smashing harmlessly into solid rock or ricocheting across the water like flying fish from destinys decks it appeared as if the san augustin was embedded in coral as she drove slowly into the lagoon the hull trailing smoke her canvas already pitted with holes palliser said why doesnt he come about all his anger for the spaniards had gone instead he was barely able to hide his anxiety for the stricken ship she had looked so proud and majestic now marked down by the relentless bombardment she was heading into helpless submission bolitho turned as he heard the surgeon murmur a sight ill not forget ever he removed his glasses and polished them fiercely like something i was once made to learn far away where sky met sea a majestic figure grew pushed along by royal decree her aggressive pennants flew he smiled sadly now it sounds like an epitaph a rumbling explosion echoed against destinys hull and they saw black smoke drifting above the lagoon and blotting out the anchored vessels completely dumaresq said calmly shell strike he ignored pallisers protest her captain has no choice dont you see that he looked along his own ship and saw bolitho watching him what would you do strike your colours or have your people burn bolitho heard more explosions either from the battery or from within the spaniards hull like bulkley he found it hard to believe a great ship beautiful in her arrogance and now this he thought of it happening here to his own ship and companions danger they could face it was part of their calling but to be changed in the twinkling of an eye from a disciplined company to a rabble hemmed in by renegades and pirates who would kill a man for the price of a drink was a nightmare stand by to come about mr palliser we will steer east palliser said nothing in his minds eye he was probably seeing the utter despair aboard the spanish ship although with a more experienced understanding than bolithos they would see destinys masts turning as she stood away from the shore and in that they would recognize their own defeat dumaresq added then i shall explain what i intend bolitho and rhodes looked at one another so it was not over it had not even begun palliser closed the screen door quickly as if he expected an enemy to be listening rounds completed sir the ship is completely darkened as ordered bolitho waited with the other officers and warrant officers in dumaresqs cabin feeling their doubts and anxieties but sharing the chilling excitement nonetheless all day destiny had tacked slowly back and forth in the blazing sunshine fougeaux island always close abeam although not near enough to be hit by any battery for hours they had waited and some had hoped until the last that the san angustin would emerge again somehow freeing herself from the lagoon to join them there had been nothing more to the point there had been no terrible explosion and the aftermath of flying wreckage which would have proclaimed the spaniards final destruction had she blown up most of the anchored vessels in the lagoon would have perished too in some ways the silence had been worse dumaresq looked around their intent faces it was very hot in the sealed and shuttered cabin and they were all stripped to their shirts and breeches they looked more like conspirators than kings officers bolitho thought dumaresq said we have waited a whole day gentlemen it is what garrick would have expected he will have anticipated each move believe me midshipman merrett sniffed and rubbed his nose with his sleeve but dumaresqs eyes froze him into stillness garrick will have made his plans with care he will know i have sent to antigua for aid whatever chance we had of bottling him in his lair until that support arrived vanished when san augustin made her play he leaned on his table his hands encircling the chart he had laid there nothing stands between garrick and his ambitions elsewhere but this ship he let his words sink in i had few fears on that score gentlemen we can tackle garricks flotilla when it breaks out fight them together or run them down piecemeal but things have changed todays silence has proved that palliser asked dyou mean hell use the san augustin against us sir dumaresqs eyes flashed with sudden anger at the interruption then he said almost mildly eventually yes feet shuffled and bolitho heard several voices murmuring with sudden alarm dumaresq said don carlos quintana will have surrendered although he may have fallen in the first engagement for his sake i hope that was so he will receive little mercy at the hands of those murdering scum which is something you will bear in mind do i make myself clear bolitho found he was clenching and unclenching his hands his palms felt clammy and he knew it was the same sickness of fear which had followed the attack on the island his wound started to throb as if to remind him and he had to stare at the deck until his mind cleared again dumaresq said you will recall the first shots at the spaniard from a single cannon to the westrd of the hill they were deliberately fired badly to encourage the intruder into their trap once past the point they used the battery and some heated shot to create panic and final submission it gives an idea of garricks cunning he was prepared to risk setting her afire rather than allow her amongst his carefully collected flotilla and don carlos might well have persevered against an ordinary bombardment although i doubt if he would have succeeded feet moved overhead and bolitho imagined the men up there on watch without their officers wondering what schemes were being hatched and who would pay for them with his life he could also picture the ship without lights and carrying little canvas as she ghosted through the darkness tomorrow garrick will still be watching us to see what we intend we shall continue throughout the day patrolling nothing more it will do two things show garrick that we expect assistance also that we have no intention of leaving garrick will know time is running out and will endeavour to hasten things along gulliver asked uneasily wont that be the wrong thing to do sir why not leave him be and wait for the squadron because i do not believe the squadron will come dumaresq eyed the masters astonishment blandly fitzpatrick the actinggovernor may well delay my despatches until he is relieved of his own responsibility by then it will be too late anyway he gave a slow smile it is no use mr gulliver you must accept your fate as i do palliser said us against a fortyfour sir ive no doubt garricks other craft will be fairly well armed and may be experienced in this sort of game dumaresq appeared to grow tired of the discussion tomorrow night i intend to close the shore and drop four boats i cannot hope to force the entrance myself and garrick will know this hell have guns laid on the channel anyway so id still be at a grave disadvantage bolitho felt his stomach muscles tighten a boat action always chancy always difficult even with the most experienced of hands dumaresq continued i will discuss the plans further when we see how the wind supports us in the meantime i can tell you this mr palliser will take the cutter and the jollyboat and land at the souwest point of the island it is the best sheltered part and the least likeliest for an assault he will be supported by mr rhodes mr midshipman henderson and his eyes moved deliberately to slade our senior masters mate bolitho glanced quickly at rhodes and saw how pale his face seemed there were tiny beads of sweat on his forehead too the senior midshipman henderson by comparison looked calm and eager it was his first chance and like palliser he would soon be trying his luck for promotion it would be uppermost on his mind until the actual moment came there will be no moon and as far as i can discover the sea will be kind to us dumaresqs stature seemed to grow and expand with his ideas the pinnace will be lowered next and will make for the reefs to the northeastern end of the island bolitho waited trying not to hold his breath knowing what was coming it was almost a relief when dumaresq said mr bolitho you will take charge of the pinnace you will be supported by midshipmen cowdroy and jury and an experienced gunners mate with a complete guns crew you will find and seize that solitary cannon below the hillside and use it as i direct he smiled but there was no warmth in his eyes lieutenant colpoys can select a squad of picked marksmen and take them to cover mr bolithos actions you will please ensure that your marines discard their uniforms and make do with slop clothing like the seamen colpoys looked visibly shocked not by the prospect of being killed but at the idea of seeing his marines clad in anything but their red coats dumaresq examined their faces again perhaps to see the relief of the ones who would be staying the concern of those detailed for his reckless plan of attack he said slowly in the meantime i shall prepare the ship to give battle for garrick will come out gentlemen he has too much to lose by staying and as destiny will be his last witness he will be eager to destroy us he had their full attention and that is what he will have to do before i let him pass palliser stood up dismissed they moved to the door mulling over dumaresqs words trying perhaps to see a last glimmer of hope that an open battle might be avoided rhodes said quietly well dick i think i shall take a large drink before i stand my watch tonight i do not feel like brooding bolitho glanced at the midshipmen as they filed past it must be far worse for them he said i have done a cuttingout expedition myself i expect that you and the first lieutenant will be told to excise one of the anchored vessels he shivered in spite of his guard i dont fancy the prospect of taking that cannon from under their noses they looked at each other and then rhodes said the first one of us to return buys wine for the wardroom bolitho did not trust himself to answer but groped his way to the companionladder and up to the quarterdeck to resume his watch a large shadow sidled from the trunk of the mizzenmast and stockdale said in a hoarse whisper tomorrow night then sir he did not wait for a reply felt it in me bones his palms scraped together in the darkness youd not be thinkin of takin anyone else as a guncaptain his simple confidence helped to disperse bolithos anxiety more than he would have thought possible well stay together he touched his arm impulsively after this youll lament the day you ever quit the land stockdale rumbled a chuckle never ere a mans got room to breathe yeames masters mate of the watch grinned i dont reckon that bloody pirate knows what es in for sir old stockdalell trim is beard for im bolitho walked to the weather side and began to pace slowly up and down where was she now he wondered in some ship heading for another land a life he would never share if only she would come to him now as she had on that other incredible night she would understand would hold him tenderly and drive back the fear which was ripping him apart and there was another long day to endure before they would begin the next act he could not possibly survive this time and he guessed that fate had never intended it otherwise midshipman jury shaded the compasslight with his hands to examine the swinging card and then looked across at the slowly pacing figure just to be like him would be the only reward he could ever want so steady and confident and never too impatient or hasty with a quick rebuke like palliser or scathing like slade perhaps his father had been a bit like richard bolitho at that age he thought he hoped so yeames cleared his throat and said best get ready to pipe the morninwatch sir though i fear itll be a long day today jury hurried away thinking of what lay ahead and wondering why he was not apprehensive any more he was going with the third lieutenant and to ian jury aged fourteen years that was reward enough bolitho had known the waiting would be bad but throughout the day as destinys company laid out the equipment and weapons which would be required for the landingparties he felt his nerves stretching to breakingpoint whenever he looked up from his work or came on deck from the cool darkness of one of the holds the bare hostile island was always there although his knowledge and training told him that destiny covered and recovered her track again and again during the day it seemed as if they had never moved that the island with its fortresslike hill was waiting just for him towards dusk gulliver laid the ship on a new tack to take her well clear of the island the masthead lookouts had been unable to sight any sort of activity so well sheltered was the lagoon but dumaresq had no doubts garrick would have watched their every move and the fact destiny had never tacked closer inshore might have helped to shake his confidence to make him believe that help was already on the way for that solitary frigate eventually dumaresq called his officers aft to the cabin it was much as before hot and clammy the air penned in by the shutters so that they were all soon sweating freely they had gone over it again and again surely nothing on their part could go wrong even the wind favoured them it remained from the southwest and although slightly fresher than before gave no hint that it might turn against them dumaresq leaned on his table and said gravely it is time gentlemen you will leave here to prepare your boats all i can do is wish you well to ask for luck would be an insult to each of you bolitho tried to relax his body limb by limb he could not begin the action like this any one fault would break him in pieces and he knew it he plucked the shirt away from his stomach and thought of the time he had purposefully donned a clean one just to meet her on deck perhaps this was the same hopeless gesture unlike changing into clean clothing before a battle at sea to avoid infecting a wound this was something personal there would be no bulkleys on that evil island no one to see the purpose of his reasoning or to care dumaresq said i intend to lower the cutter and jollyboat in an hour we should be in position to drop the launch and pinnace by midnight his gaze moved to bolitho although it will be a harder pull for your people your cover will be better he checked off the points on his strong fingers make certain your muskets and pistols remain unloaded until you are sure there will be no accidents examine all the gear and tackle you need before you enter the boats talk to your people he spoke gently almost caressingly talk to them they are your strength and will be watching you to see how you measure up feet padded across the deck above and tackle scraped noisily along the planking destiny was heaving to dumaresq added tomorrow is your worst day you will lie in hiding and do nothing if an alarm is raised i cannot save you midshipman merrett tapped at the door and then called mr yeames respects sir and we are hove to with the cabin pitching unsteadily from side to side it was rather unnecessary and bolitho was amazed to see several of those present grinning and nudging each other even rhodes whom he knew to be worried sick about the coming action was smiling broadly it was that same madness returning perhaps it was better this way they moved out of the cabin and were soon swallowed up by their own groups of men mr timbrells hoistingparty had already swayed out the jollyboat and the cutter followed shortly over the nettings and then into the slapping water alongside there was suddenly no time for anything in the enclosing darkness a few hands darted out for brief clasps voices murmured to friends and companions a good luck or well show em and then it was done the boats wallowing round in the swell before heading away towards the island get the ship under way mr gulliver dumaresq turned his back on the sea as if he had already dismissed palliser and the two boats bolitho saw jury talking with young merrett and wondered if the latter was glad he was staying aboard it was incredible to consider how much had happened in so few months since they had all come together as one company dumaresq moved silently to his side more waiting mr bolitho i wish i could make her fly for you he gave a deep chuckle but there never was an easy way bolitho touched his scar with one finger bulkley had removed the stitches and yet he always expected to feel the same agony the same sense of despair as when he had been cut down dumaresq said suddenly mr palliser and his brave fellows will be well under way by now but i must not think of them any more not as people or friends until it is over he turned away adding briefly one day you will understand a moments courage bolitho attempted to rise to his feet gripping stockdales shoulder for support as the destinys pinnace lifted and plunged across a succession of violent breakers in spite of the night air and the spray which continually dashed over the gunwale bolitho felt feverishly hot the closer the boat drew to the hidden island the more dangerous it became and most of his men had thought the first part had been the worst being cast adrift by their parent ship and left to pull with all their might for the shore now they knew differently not least their third lieutenant occasionally and now more frequently jagged fangs of rock and coral surged past the white water foaming amongst them to give the impression they and not the boat were moving gasping and cursing the oarsmen tried to maintain the stroke but even that was broken every now and then as one of them had to lever his loom from its rowlock to save the blade from being splintered on a tooth of rock the yawing motion made thinking difficult and bolitho had to strain his mind to recall dumaresqs instructions and gullivers gloomy predictions about their final approach no wonder garrick felt secure no vessel of any size could work inshore amongst this strewn carpet of broken coral it was bad enough for the pinnace bolitho tried not to think about destinys thirtyfourfoot launch which was following them somewhere astern or he hoped it was the extra boat was carrying colpoys and his marksmen as well as additional charges of gunpowder what with pallisers large party which had already been put ashore on the southwest of the island and bolithos own men dumaresq was shorthanded indeed if he had to fight he would also need to run the idea of dumaresq fleeing in retreat was so absurd that it helped to sustain bolitho in some way watch out forrard that was the boatswains mate ellis pearse up in the bows a very experienced seaman he had been sounding with a boats leadandline for part of the way but was now acting as a lookout as one more rock loomed out of the darkness the noise seemed so great that somebody on the shore must hear them but bolitho knew enough to understand that the din of the sea and surf would more than drown the clatter of oars the desperate thrusts with boathooks and fists to fight their way past the treacherous rocks had there been even a glimmer of moon it might have been different strangely enough a small boat stood out more clearly to a vigilant lookout than a fullrigged ship standing just offshore as many a cornish smuggler had found out to his cost pearse called hoarsely land ahead bolitho raised one hand to show he had heard and almost tumbled headlong it had seemed as if the broken rocks and the millrace of water amongst them would never end then he saw it a pale suggestion of land rising above the drifting spray much larger close to he dug his fingers into stockdales shoulder it felt like solid oak beneath his sodden shirt easy now stockdale a little to starboard i think josh little gunners mate growled two ands ready to go bolitho saw two seamen crouching over the creaming water and hoped he had not misjudged the depth somewhere astern he heard a grating thud and then some splashing commotion of oars as the launch regained her balance it had probably grazed the last big rock bolitho thought little chuckled ill bet that rattled the bullocks then he touched the man nearest him go the seaman as naked as the day he was born dropped over the side hung for a few moments kicking and spitting out water and then gasped sandy bottom easy all stockdale swung the tillerbar ready about eventually stern on to the beach the pinnace backed water and aided by two men gripping the gunwales surged the last few yards on to firm sand with the ease of a man lifting a stick from a pathway stockdale unshipped the rudder and hauled it inboard as the pinnace rose once again before riding noisily on to a small beach clear the boat bolitho staggered up the beach feeling the receding surf dragging at his feet and legs men stumbled past him snatching their weapons while others waded into deeper water to guide the launch on to a safe stretch of sand the first seaman who had been detailed to go outboard from the pinnace was struggling to pull on his trousers and shirt but little said later matey just shift yerself up to the top somebody laughed as the dripping seaman hopped past and again bolitho marvelled that they could still find room for humour ere comes the launch little groaned hells teeth like a pack o bloody clergymen hoisting his great belly over his belt he strode down to the surf again his voice lashing at the confusion of men and oars like a whip midshipman cowdroy was already clambering up a steep slope to the left of the beach some men close at his heels jury remained by the boat watching as the last of the weapons powder and shot and their meagre rations were passed hand to hand to the shelter of the ridge lieutenant colpoys sloshed through the sand and exclaimed sharply in gods name richard surely there must be a better way of fighting a battle he paused to watch his marines as they loped past their long muskets held high to escape the spray and sand ten good marksmen he remarked absently damn well wasted if you ask me bolitho peered up at the ridge it was just possible to see where it made an edge with the sky they had to get over it and into their hidingplace without delay and they had about four hours to do it come on he turned and waved to the two boats shove off good luck he deliberately kept his voice low but nevertheless the men nearest him stopped to watch the boats now it would be really clear to all of them in an hour or two those same boats would be hoisted to the safety of their tier aboard destiny and their crews would be free to rest to put the tension and danger behind them how quickly they seemed to move bolitho thought without their extra passengers and weapons they were already fading into the shadows outlined only occasionally by the spray as it broke over their oars colpoys said quietly gone he looked down at his mixed garb of sea officers shirt and pair of moleskin breeches ill never live this down then surprisingly he grinned but still it will make the colonel sit up and take notice when i next see him what midshipman cowdroy came slithering back down the slope shall i send scouts on ahead sir colpoys regarded him coldly i shall send two of my men he snapped out a curt order and two marines melted into the gloom like ghosts bolitho said this is your kind of work john he wiped his forehead with his shirtsleeve tell me if i do anything wrong colpoys shrugged id rather have my job than yours he clapped him on the arm but we stand or fall together he glared round for his orderly load my pistols and keep by me thomas bolitho looked for jury but he was already there ready jury nodded firmly aye ready sir bolitho hesitated and peered down at the small sliver of sand where they had come ashore the surf was still boiling amongst the reefs but even the marks of the boats keels had been washed away they were quite alone it was hard to accept that this was the same small island four miles long and less than two miles from north to south it felt like another country somewhere which when daylight came would be seen stretching away to the horizon colpoys knew his trade well bulkley had mentioned that the debonair marine had once been attached to a line regiment and it seemed very likely he threw out his pickets sent his best scouts well ahead of the rest and retained the heavierfooted seamen for carrying the food powder and shot thirty men in all and palliser had about the same number dumaresq would be thankful to get his boat crews back aboard bolitho thought and yet in spite of all the preparations the confident manner in which colpoys arranged the men into manageable files bolitho had to face the fact that he was in charge the men were fanning out on either side of him stumbling along on the loose stones and sand and content to leave their safety to colpoys keeneyed scouts bolitho controlled the sudden alarm as it coursed through him it was like being on watch that first time the ship running through the night with only you who could change things with a word or a cry for help he heard a heavy tread beside him and saw stockdale striding along his cutlass across one shoulder without effort bolitho could picture him carrying his body down to the boat to rally the remaining seamen and to call for assistance but for this strange hoarsevoiced man he would be dead it was a comfort to have him at his side again colpoys said not far now he spat grit from his teeth if that fool gulliver is mistaken ill split him like a pig he laughed lightly but then if he is wrong i shall be denied that privilege eh in the darkness a man slipped and fell dropping his cutlass and a grapnel with a clatter for an instant everyone froze and then a marine called all quiet sir bolitho heard a sharp blow and knew that midshipman cowdroy had struck the awkward seaman with the flat of his hanger if cowdroy turned his back during any fighting it was unlikely he would ever live to be a lieutenant bolitho sent jury on ahead and when he returned breathless and gasping he said were there sir he waved vaguely towards the ridge i could hear the sea colpoys sent his orderly to halt the pickets so far so good we must be in the centre of the island when its light enough ill fix our position the seamen and marines unused to the uneven ground and the hard march from the beach crowded together beneath an overhanging spur of rock it was cool and smelled damp as if there were caves nearby in a matter of hours it would be a furnace post your lookouts then well issue food and water it may be a long while before we get another chance bolitho unclipped his hanger and sat down with his back against the bare rock he thought of his climb to the main crosstrees with the captain his first sight of this bleak menacing island now he was here jury stooped over him im not sure where to post the lookouts on the lower slope sir bolitho pushed the weariness aside and somehow lurched to his feet come with me ill show you next time youll know colpoys was holding a flask of warm wine to his lips and paused to watch them vanish into the darkness the third lieutenant had come a long long way since plymouth he thought he might be young but he acted with the authority of a veteran bolitho wiped the dust from his telescope and tried to wriggle his prone body into a comfortable position it was early morning and yet the rock and sand were already hot and his skin prickled so that he wanted to tear off his shirt and scratch himself all over colpoys slid across the ground and joined him he held out a fistful of dried grass almost the only thing which survived here in little rock crannies where the rare rainfalls sustained it he said cover the glass with it any reflected light on the lens and the alarm will be raised bolitho nodded sparing his voice and breath very carefully he levelled the glass and began to move it slowly from side to side there were several small ridges like the one which they were using to conceal themselves from enemy and sun alike but all were dwarfed by the flattopped hill it shut off the sea directly ahead of his telescope but to his right he could see the end of the lagoon and some six anchored vessels there schooners as far as he could tell pinned down by the glare and with only one small boat cutting a pattern on the glittering water beyond and around them the curved arm of rock and coral ran to the left but the opening and the channel to the sea were hidden by the hill bolitho moved the glass again and concentrated on the land at the far end of the lagoon nothing moved and yet somewhere there palliser and his men were lying in hiding marooned with the sea at their backs he guessed that the san augustin if she was still afloat was on the opposite side of the hill beneath the hilltop battery which had beaten her into submission colpoys had his own telescope trained towards the western end of the island there richard huts a whole line of them bolitho moved his glass pausing only to rub the sweat from his eyes the huts were small and crude and without any sort of window probably for storing weapons and other booty he thought the glass misted over and then sharpened again as he saw a tiny figure appear on the top of a low ridge a man in a white shirt spreading his arms wide and probably yawning he walked unhurriedly towards the side of the ridge and what bolitho had taken to be a slung musket proved to be a long telescope this he opened in the same unhurried fashion and began to examine the sea from side to side and from the shore to the hard blue line of the horizon several times he returned his scrutiny to a point concealed by the hill and bolitho guessed he had sighted destiny outwardly cruising on her station as before the thought brought a pang to his heart a mixture of loss and longing colpoys said softly that is where the gun is our gun he added meaningly bolitho tried again the ridges merging and separating in a growing heathaze but the marine was right just beyond the solitary lookout was a canvas hump it was almost certainly the solitary gun which had made such a pretence at bad markmanship to lure the spaniard past the point colpoys was murmuring put there to offer covering fire for any anchored prizes i shouldnt wonder they looked at each other seeing the sudden importance of their part in the attack the gun had to be taken if palliser was to be allowed to move from his hidingplace once discovered he would be pinned down by the carefully sited cannon and then slaughtered at leisure as if to add weight to the idea a column of men moved from the hillside and made for the line of huts colpoys said god look at em must be a couple of hundred at least and they were certainly not prisoners they strolled along in twos and threes the dust rising from their feet like an army on the march some boats appeared in the lagoon and more men could be seen at the waters edge with long spars and coils of rope it seemed likely they were about to rig sheerlegs in readiness for hauling cargo down to the boats dumaresq had been right again garricks men were preparing to leave bolitho looked at colpoys suppose were wrong about the san augustin just because we cannot see her doesnt mean shes disabled colpoys was still looking at the men by the huts i agree only one way to find out he twisted his head as jury came breathlessly up the slope keep down jury flushed and threw himself beside bolitho mr cowdroy wants to know if he can issue some more water sir his eyes moved past bolitho to the activity on the beach not yet tell him to keep his people hidden one sight or sound and well be done for he nodded towards the lagoon then come back do you feel like a stroll he saw the youths eyes widen and then calm again yes sir as jury dropped out of sight colpoys asked why him hes just a boy bolitho levelled his glass once again at first light tomorrow destiny will make a feint attack on the entrance it will be hazardous enough but if the san augustins artillery is ranged on her as well as the hilltop battery she could be crippled even wrecked so we have to know what we are up against he nodded towards the opposite end of the lagoon the first lieutenant has his orders he will attack the moment the islands defences are distracted by destiny he met the marines troubled gaze hoping he looked more confident than he felt and we must be ready to support him but if i had to choose i would say that yours is the greater value to this escapade so i shall go myself and take mr jury as messenger he looked away if i fall today colpoys punched his arm fall then we shall follow so swiftly saint peter will need to muster all hands together they measured the distance to the other low ridge someone had rolled up part of the canvas and one wheel of a military cannon was clearly visible colpoys said bitterly french ill lay any odds on it jury returned and waited for bolitho to speak bolitho unbuckled his belt and handed it to the marine to jury he said leave everything but your dirk he tried to smile were travelling like gentlemen of the road today colpoys shook his head youll stand out like milestones he removed his flask and held it out to them douse yourselves and then roll in the dust it will help but not much eventually dirty and crumpled they were ready to go colpoys said dont forget no quarter its better to die than to be taken by those savages down a steep slope and then into a narrow gully bolitho imagined that every fall of loose stones sounded like a landslide and yet out of sight from the lagoon and the ridge where he had left colpoys with his misgivings it seemed strangely peaceful as colpoys had remarked earlier there were no bird droppings which implied that few birds came to this desolate place there was nothing more likely to reveal their stealthy approach than some squawking alarm from a dozen different nests the sun rose higher and the rocks glowed with heat which enfolded their bodies like a kiln they stripped off their shirts and tied them around their heads like turbans and each gripping his bared blade ready for instant use they looked as much like pirates as the men they were hunting jurys hand gripped his arm there up there a sentry bolitho pulled jury down beside him feeling the midshipmans tension giving way to sick horror the sentry had been one of don carlos officers his body was nailed to a post facing the sun and his onceproud uniform was covered in dried blood jury said in a husky whisper his eyes they put out his eyes bolitho swallowed hard come on weve a way to go yet they finally reached a pile of fallen boulders some of which were scarred and blackened and bolitho guessed they had been hurled down by san augustins opening broadside he eased his body between two of the boulders feeling their heat on his skin the painful throbbing of the scar above his eye as he pushed and dragged himself into a cleft where he would not be seen he felt jury pressing behind him his sweat mingling with his own as he slowly lifted his head and stared at the lagoon he had been expecting to see the captured spaniard aground or being sacked and looted by the victorious pirates but there was discipline here a purpose of movement which made him realize what he was watching the san augustin was at anchor and her upper deck and rigging were alive with men splicing hammering sawing and hoisting fresh cordage up to the yards she could have been any manofwar anywhere her foretopgallant mast which had been shot away in the short battle was already being replaced by a professionallooking juryrig and from the way the men were working bolitho knew they must be some of her original company here and there about the ships deck stood figures who did not take part in the frantic activity they stood by swivelguns or with muskets at the ready bolitho thought of the tortured eyeless thing on the hillside and tasted the bile in this throat no wonder the spaniards worked for their captors they had been given an horrific lesson and doubtless others besides to break any resistance before it began boats glided alongside the anchored ship and tackles were lowered immediately with big nets to hoist cases and great chests over her bulwarks one boat separate from all the rest was being pulled slowly around the san augustins stern a small stiffbacked man with a neatly clipped beard was standing in the sternsheets pointing with a black stick jabbing at the air to emphasize a point for the benefit of his companions even in distance there was something autocratic and arrogant about the man someone who had gained power and respect from treachery and murder it had to be sir piers garrick now he was leaning on the boats gunwale pointing with his stick again and bolitho saw that the san augustins bilge was showing slightly and garrick was probably ordering a change of trim some cargo or shot to be shifted to give his new prize the best sailing quality he could manage jury whispered what are they doing sir the san augustin is preparing to leave he rolled on his back oblivious to the jagged stones as he tried to think clearly destiny cannot fight them all we must act now he saw the frown on jurys face he had never thought otherwise was i like him once so trusting that i believed we can never be beaten he said see more boats are coming down to her garricks treasure it has all been for this his own flotilla and now a fortyfourgun ship to do with as he will captain dumaresq was right there is nothing to stop him he smiled gravely but destiny bolitho could see it as if it had already happened destiny standing close inshore to provide a diversion for palliser while all the time the captured san augustin lay here like a tiger ready to pounce in confined waters destiny would stand no chance at all we must get back bolitho lowered himself through the boulders his mind still refusing to accept what had to be done colpoys could barely hide his relief as they scrambled up to join him on the ridge he said theyve been working all the time clearing those huts theyve slaves with them too poor devils i saw more than one laid flat by a piece of chain colpoys fell silent until bolitho had finished describing what he had seen then he said look here i know what youre thinking because this is a damnable rotten useless island which nobody cares about and precious few have even heard of you feel cheated unwilling to risk lives your own included but its like that big battles and waving flags are rare this will be described as a skirmish an incident if you must know but it matters if we think it does he lay back and studied bolitho calmly i say to hell with caution well go for that cannon without waiting for the dawn tomorrow theyve nothing else which will bear on the lagoon all the other guns are dugin on the hilltop it will take hours to shift em he grinned a whole battle can be won or lost in that time bolitho took the telescope again his hands shaking as he trained it on the ridge and the partly covered cannon it was even the same lookout as before jury said huskily theyve stopped work no wonder colpoys shaded his eyes see yonder young fellow isnt that a cause enough for dying destiny moved slowly into view her topsails and topgallants very pale against the hard blue sky bolitho stared at her imagining her sounds now lost in distance her smells her familiarity he felt like a man dying of thirst as he sees a wine jar in a deserts image or someone on his way to the gallows who pauses to listen to an early sparrow each knows that tomorrow there will be no wine and no birds will sing he said flatly lets be about it then ill tell the others if only there was some way of informing mr palliser colpoys backed down the slope then he looked at bolitho his eyes yellow in the sunlight hell know richard the whole damned island will colpoys wiped his face and neck with his handkerchief it was afternoon and the blazing heat thrown back at them from the rocks was sheer torment but waiting had paid off most of the activity around the huts had ceased and smoke from several fires drifted towards the hidden seamen and marines bringing smells of roasting meat as an additional torture colpoys said theyll rest after theyve eaten he glanced at his corporal issue the rations and water dyer to bolitho he added quietly i estimate that gun to be a cables distance from us he squinted his eyes as he examined the slope and the steep climb to the other ridge if we start therell be no stopping i think there are several men with the cannon probably in some sort of magazine underground he took a cup of water from his orderly and sipped it slowly well bolitho lowered the telescope and rested his forehead on his arm well risk it he tried not to measure it in his mind two hundred yards across open ground and then what he said tightly little and his crew can take care of the gun well attack the ridge from both sides at once mr cowdroy can take charge of the second party he saw colpoys grimace and added hes the senior one of the pair and hes experienced colpoys nodded ill place my marksmen where theyll do the most good once youve taken the ridge ill support you he held out his hand if you fail ill lead the shortest bayonetcharge in the corps history and then all of a sudden they were ready the earlier uncertainty and tension was gone wiped away and the men gathered in their tight little groups with grim but determined faces josh little with his guncrew festooned with the tools of their trade and extra charges of powder and some shot midshipman cowdroy his petulant face set in a scowl had already drawn his hanger and was checking his pistol ellis pearse boatswains mate carried his own weapon a fearsome doubleedged boardingcutlass which had been made specially for him by a blacksmith the marines had dispersed amongst the rocks their long muskets probing the open ground and further towards the flattopped hillside bolitho stood up and looked at his own men dutchy vorbink olsson the mad swede bill bunce an expoacher kennedy a man who had escaped jail by volunteering for the navy and many others he had come to know so well stockdale wheezed ill be with you sir their eyes met not this time you stay with little that gun has got to be taken stockdale without it we might as well die here and now he touched his thick arm believe me we are all depending on you today he turned away unable to watch the big mans pain to jury he said you can keep with lieutenant colpoys is that an order sir bolitho saw the boys chin lift stubbornly what were they trying to do to him he replied no a man whispered the sentrys climbed down out of sight little chuckled gone for a wet bolitho found his feet already over the edge his hanger glinting in the sunlight as he pointed towards the opposite ridge come on then at em lads heedless now of noise and deception they charged down the slope their feet kicking up dust and stones their breath rasping fiercely as they kept their eyes fixed on the ridge they reached the bottom of the slope and pounded across open ground oblivious to everything but the hidden gun somewhere a million miles away someone yelled and a shot whined across the hillside more voices swelled and faded as the men by the lagoon stampeded for their weapons probably imagining that they were under attack from the sea three heads suddenly appeared on the top of the ridge even as the first of bolithos men reached the foot colpoys muskets banged seemingly ineffectually and from far away but two of the heads vanished and the third man bounded in the air before rolling down the slope amongst the british sailors come on bolitho waved his hanger faster from one side a musket fired past him and a seaman fell clutching his thigh and then sprawled sobbing as his companions charged on towards the top bolithos breath felt like hot sand in his lungs as he leapt over a crude parapet of stones more shots hammered past him and he knew some of his men had fallen he saw the glint of metal a wheel of the cannon beneath its canvas cover and yelled watch out but from beneath the canvas one of the hidden men fired a fully charged musketoon into the advancing seamen one was hurled on his back his face and most of his skull blasted away and three others fell kicking in their own blood with a roar like an enraged beast pearse threw himself from the opposite of the gunpit and slashed the canvas apart with his doubleedged blade a figure ran from the pit covering his head with his hands and screaming quarter quarter pearse threw back his arm and yelled quarter you bugger take that the great blade hit the men across the nape of the neck so that his head dropped forward on to his chest midshipman cowdroys party swarmed over the other side of the ridge and as pearse led his men into the pit to complete his gory victory little and stockdale were already down with the cannon while their crew ran to discover if there was any life in the nearby furnace the seamen were like mad things yelling and cheering pausing only to haul their wounded companions to safety they roared all the louder as pearse emerged from the pit with a great jar of wine bolitho shouted take up your muskets here come the marines once again the seamen threw themselves down and aimed their weapons towards the lagoon colpoys and his ten marksmen trotting smartly in spite of their borrowed and illmatched clothing hurried up to the ridge but it seemed as if the attack had been so swift and savage that the whole island was held in a kind of daze colpoys arrived at the top and waited for his men to take cover then he said we seem to have lost five men very satisfactory he frowned disdainfully as some bloodied corpses were passed up from the gunpit and pitched down the slope animals little climbed from the pit wiping his hands on his belly plenty o shot sir not much powder though lucky we brought our own bolitho shared their madness but knew he must keep his grip at any moment a real attack might come at them but they had done well better than they should have been asked to do he said issue some wine little colpoys added sharply but keep a clear eye and a good head your gun will be in action soon he glanced at bolitho am i right bolitho twitched his nostrils and knew his men had the furnace primedup again it was a moments courage a few minutes of reckless wildness he took a mug of red wine from jury and held it to his lips it was also a moment he would remember until he died even the wine dusty and warm though it was tasted like claret ere they come sir ere come th buggers bolitho tossed the mug aside and picked up his hanger from the ground stand to he turned briefly to see how little and his crew were managing the cannon had not moved and to create panic it had to be firing very soon he heard a chorus of yells and when he walked to the crude parapet he saw a mass of running figures converging on the ridge the sun playing on swords and cutlasses the air broken by the stabbing crack of muskets and pistols bolitho looked at colpoys ready marines fire only a dream cease firing bolitho handed his pistol to a wounded seaman to reload he felt as if every fibre in his body was shaking uncontrollably and he could scarcely believe that the first attack had been repelled some of those who had nearly reached the top of the ridge were lying sprawled where they had dropped others were still dragging themselves painfully towards safety below colpoys joined him his shirt clinging to his body like a wet skin god he blinked the sweat from his eyes too close for comfort three more seamen had fallen but were still alive pearse was already supplying each of them with spare muskets and powderhorns so that they could keep up a rapid fire for another attack after that bolitho glanced at his gasping cowering sailors the air was acrid with powdersmoke and the sweet smell of blood little bawled nother few minutes sir so fierce had been the attack that bolitho had been forced to take men from the guncrew to help repel the charging yelling figures now little and stockdale with a few more picked hands were throwing their weight on wooden staves and handspikes to work the cannon round towards the head of the anchorage bolitho picked up the telescope and levelled it on the six motionless vessels one a topsail schooner looked very like the craft which had put paid to the heloise none showed any sign of weighing and he guessed that their masters were expecting the hilltop guns to smash this impudent invasion before more harm could be done he took a mug of wine from pearse without seeing what he was doing where the hell was palliser surely he must have realized what they were attempting bolitho felt a stab of despair suppose the first lieutenant believed the gunfire and pandemonium implied that bolithos party had been discovered and was being systematically wiped out he recalled dumaresqs own words before they had left the ship i cannot save you it was likely palliser would take the same view bolitho swung round trying to hide his sudden desperation as he called how much longer little he realized that the gunners mate had only just told him just as he knew that colpoys and cowdroy were watching him worriedly little straightened his back and nodded ready he stooped down again his eye squinting along the guns black barrel load with powder lads ram the charge ome he was moving round the breech like a great spider all arms and legs this as got to be done nice an tidy like bolitho licked his lips he saw two seamen taking a shotcarrier towards the small furnace where another man waited with a ladle in his fists ready to spoon the heated ball into the carrier then it was always a matter of luck and timing the ball had to be tipped into the muzzle and tamped down on to a doublethick wad if the gun exploded before the rammer could leap clear he would be blown apart by the ball equally it might split the barrel wide open no wonder captains were terrified of using heated shot aboard ship little said ill lay for the middle vessel sir a mite either way an we might it one or tother stockdale nodded in agreement colpoys said abruptly i can see some men on the hilltop my guess is theyll be raking us presently a man shouted theyre musterin for another attack bolitho ran to the parapet and dropped on one knee he could see the small figures darting amongst the rocks and others taking up positions on the hillside this was no rabble garrick had his people trained like a private army stand to the muskets rose and wavered in the glare each man seeking out a target amongst the fallen rocks a fusillade of shots ripped over the parapet and bolitho knew that more attackers were taking advantage of covering fire to work around the other end of the ridge he darted a quick glance at little he was holding out his hands like a man at prayer now load bolitho tore his eyes away and fired his pistol into a group of three men who were almost at the top of the ridge others were fanning out and making difficult targets and the air was filled with the unnerving din of yells and curses many in their own language two figures bounded over the rocks and threw themselves on a seaman who was frantically trying to reload a musket bolitho saw his mouth open in a silent scream as one attacker pinioned him with his cutlass and his companion silenced him forever with a terrible slash bolitho lunged forward striking a blade aside and hacking down the mans swordarm before he could recover he felt the shock jar up his wrist as the hanger cut through bone and muscle but forgot the screaming man as he went for his companion with a ferocity he had never known before their blades clashed together but bolitho was standing amongst loose stones and could barely keep his balance the deafening roar of littles cannon made the other man falter his eyes suddenly terrified as he realized what he had done bolitho lunged and jumped back behind the parapet even before his adversarys corpse hit the ground little was yelling look at that un bolitho saw a falling column of water mingled with steam where the ball had slammed down between two of the vessels a miss maybe but the effect would rouse panic quickly enough sponge out lads little capered on the edge of his pit while the men with the cradle dashed back towards the furnace for another ball more powder colpoys crossed the bloodspattered rock and said weve lost three more one of my fellows is down too he wiped his forehead with his arm his goldhilted sabre hanging from his wrist bolitho saw that the curved blade was almost black with dried blood they could not withstand another attack like the last although corpses dotted the slope and along the broken rim of the parapet bolitho knew there were many more men already grouping below they would be far more fearful of garrick than a ragged handful of seamen now little plunged his slowmatch down and the gun recoiled again with a savage explosion bolitho caught a brief blur of the ball as it lifted and then curved down towards the unmoving vessels he saw a puff of smoke and something solid detach itself from the nearest schooner and fly into the air before splashing in the water alongside a hit a hit the guncrew blackfaced and running with sweat capered around the gun like madmen stockdale was already using his strength on a handspike to edge the muzzle round just that small piece more shes afire pearse had his hands above his eyes god damn em theyre tryin to douse it but bolitho was watching the schooner at the far end of the lagoon she of all the vessels was in the safest anchorage and yet even as he watched he saw her jib flapping free and men running forward to sever the cable he reached out not daring to take his eyes from the schooner glass quickly jury hurried to him and put the telescope in his fingers then he stood back his eyes on bolithos face as if to discover what was about to happen bolitho felt a musketball fan past his head but did not flinch he must not lose that small precious picture even though he was in danger of being shot down while he watched almost lost in distance and yet so clear because he knew them pallisers tall frame sword in hand slade and some seamen by the tiller and rhodes urging others to the halliards and braces as the schooner broke free and fell awkwardly downwind there were splashes alongside and for a moment bolitho thought she was under fire then he realized that pallisers boarders were flinging the vessels crew overboard rather than lose vital time putting them under guard colpoys shouted excitedly they must have swum out to the vessel hes a cunning one is palliser used our attack as the perfect decoy bolitho nodded his ears ringing with the crack of musketfire the occasional bang of a swivel instead of steering for the centre of the lagoon palliser was heading directly for the schooner which had been hit by littles heated shot as they tore down on her bolitho saw a ripple of flashes and knew that palliser was raking the men on her deck smashing any hope they might have had of controlling the flames smoke was rising rapidly from her hatch and drifting down towards the beach and its deserted huts bolitho called little shift the target to the next one minutes later the heated ball smashed through a schooners frail hull and caused several internal explosions which brought down a mast and set most of the standing rigging ablaze with two vessels burning fiercely in their midst the remainder needed no urging to cut their cables and try to escape the drifting fireships the last schooner the one seized by pallisers boarding party was now under command her big sails filling and rising above the smoke like avenging wings bolitho said suddenly time to go he did not know why he knew he just did colpoys waved his sabre take up the wounded corporal put a fuse to the magazine littles slowmatch plunged down again and another heated ball ripped across the water and hit the vessel already ablaze men were leaping overboard floundering like dying fish as the great pall of smoke crept out to hide them from view pearse lifted a wounded marine across his shoulder but held his boardingcutlass in his other hand he said winds steady sir that smoke will blind the bloody battery panting like wild animals the seamen and marines scrambled down the slope keeping the ridge between them and the hilltop battery colpoys pointed to the water thatll be the closest point he fell on his knees his hands to his chest oh god theyve done for me bolitho called two marines to carry him between them his mind cringing to the din of musketfire the sound of flames devouring a vessel beyond the dense smoke there was shouting too and he knew that many of the schooners people had been ashore when the attack had begun and were now running towards the hillside in the hope of reaching the protection of the battery bolitho came to a halt his feet almost in the water he could barely suck breath and his eyes streamed so badly he could see little beyond the beach they had done the impossible and while palliser and his men took advantage of their work they were now able to go no further he knelt down to reload his pistol his fingers shaking as he cocked it for one last shot jury was with him and stockdale too but there seemed less than half of the party which had so courageously stormed the ridge and taken the cannon bolitho saw stockdales eyes light up as the magazine exploded and hurled the gun bodily down the slope amidst a landslide of corpses and broken rocks midshipman cowdroy stabbed at the smoke with his hanger boat look there pearse lowered the marine to the ground and waded into the water his terrible cutlass held above his head well take it off em lads bolitho could feel their desperation like a living force sailors were all the same in one thing get them a boat no matter how small and they felt they could manage little dragged out his cutlass and bared his teeth cut em down afore they slips us jury fell against bolitho and for an instant he thought he had been taken by a musketball but he was pointing incredulously at the smoke and the shadowy boat which was poking through it bolitho nodded his heart too full to understand it was rhodes standing in the bows of the longboat and he saw the checkered shirts of destinys seamen at the oars behind him lively there rhodes reached down and seized bolithos wrist all in one piece he saw colpoys and shouted lend a hand there the boat was so full of men some of them wounded that there was barely five inches of freeboard as like a drunken seacreature it backedwater and headed once more into the smoke between coughs and curses rhodes explained knew youd try to reach us only chance my god you raised a riot back there you rascal a burning schooner drifted abeam and bolitho could feel the heat on his face like an inferno explosions rolled through the smoke and he guessed it was either another magazine or the hilltop battery shooting blindly across the lagoon what now rhodes stood up and gestured wildly to the coxswain hard astarboard bolitho saw the twin masts of a schooner right above him and with his men reached out to catch the heavinglines which came through the smoke like serpents groaning and crying out in pain the wounded were pushed and hauled up the vessels side and even as the longboat was cast adrift with a man who had died in sight of safety as her only passenger bolitho heard palliser shouting orders bolitho felt his way through the smoke and met palliser and slade by the tiller palliser exclaimed you look like an escaped convict man he gave a brief smile but bolitho saw only the strain and the relief rhodes was kneeling beside the marine lieutenant hell live if we can get him to old bulkley palliser raised one hand and the helm went over very slightly another schooner was just abeam her sails drawing well as she stood away from the blazing hulks and headed for the entrance then he said by the time theyve discovered weve taken one of their own well be clear he turned sharply as the san augustins towering masts broke above the smoke she was still at anchor and probably had every able man from the island on board waiting to fend off the drifting fireships and douse the results of any contact with them palliser added after that it will be someone elses problem thank god a ball splashed down near the larboard bow and bolitho guessed that garricks gunners had at last realized what was happening as the smoke thinned and parts of the island merged clean and pale in the sunlight bolitho saw they were already past the point he heard pearse whisper look bob there she be he lifted the head of a wounded seaman so that he could see destinys braced topsails as dumaresq drove her as close as he dared to the reefs pearse a boatswains mate who had fought like a devil who by command of his captain had laid raw the back of many a defaulter with his catoninetails said very quietly poor bobs dead sir he closed the young seamans eyes with his tarry fingers adding nother minute and ed ave bin fine bolitho watched the frigate shortening sail the rush of men along her gangway as the two vessels tacked closer together destinys figurehead was as before pure and pale her victors laurels held up as if in defiance to the smokeshrouded island and all bolitho could think of was the dead seaman named bob of a solitary corpse left drifting in the longboat of stockdales anxiety at being ordered away from his side when he was needed of colpoys and the corporal nicknamed dipper jury and cowdroy and others who had been left behind take in the foresl palliser watched the destinys wary approach with grim satisfaction there were times when i never thought to see that lady again josh little crossed to pearses side and said roughly well ave a wet when we gets aboard eh pearse was still looking at the dead seaman aye josh an one for im too rhodes said the lord and master will have his way now a fight to the finish he ducked as a heavingline soared aboard but for myself i wish the odds were fairer he looked across at the great pall of smoke which surrounded the flattopped hill as if to carry it away youre a marvel dick you really are they examined each other like strangers then bolitho said i was afraid youd hold back that youd think we were all taken rhodes waved his arm to some of the seamen along destinys gangway oh didnt i tell you we knew what you were doing where you were everything bolitho stared at him in disbelief how remember that maintopman of yours murray he was their sentry saw you and young jury as you left cover he gripped his friends arm its true hes below now with a splinter in his leg had quite a story to tell lucky for you and young jury eh bolitho shook his head and leaned against the schooners bulwark to watch the two hulls come together in the swell death had been that close and he had known nothing about it murray must have taken the first available vessel out of rio and had ended up with garricks pirates he could have raised the alarm or could have shot them both down and become a hero instead something which they had once shared another precious moment had held them together dumaresqs voice boomed through a speakingtrumpet roundly there i shall be aground if you cannot shift yourselves rhodes grinned home captain dumaresq stood by the stern windows of his cabin his hands behind him as he listened to pallisers account of the pitchedbattle and their escape from the lagoon as he signalled for macmillan to pass round more wine to his stained and weary officers he said gravely i put a landingparty ashore to prick garricks balloon i did not expect you to make an invasion all on your own then he smiled broadly and it made him look sad and suddenly tired i shall think of you and your lads at dawn tomorrow but for you destiny would have been met with such a resistance that i doubt i could have worked her clear things are still bad gentlemen but at least we know palliser asked do you still intend to despatch the schooner to antigua sir dumaresq regarded him thoughtfully your schooner you mean he moved to the windows and stared at the dying sun reflected from the water like red gold yes i am afraid it is another prize i must take from you bolitho watched his mind strangely alert in spite of the strain the bitter memories of the day he recognized the bond between captain and first lieutenant as if it were something solid and visible dumaresq added if san augustin is little damaged we must fight her as soon as we can when garricks lookouts see the schooner standing away he will know that time is running out that i have sent for aid he nodded grimly he will come out tomorrow that is my belief palliser persisted he will be supported by the other schooners maybe two survived the fires i know better that than wait for garrick to sail against us with a completely overhauled ship id ask for better terms but few captains get the chance to choose bolitho thought of the men who had been sent over to the schooner all but a few were wounded and yet there had been something defiant about them something which had raised a cheer from destinys gangways and rigging for reasons of his own dumaresq had sent yeames masters mate in command of the prize it must have been a hard blow for slade bolitho had been moved when yeames had approached him before the last boatload had been ferried across he had always liked the masters mate but had thought little beyond that yeames had held out his hand youll win tomorrow sir ive no doubt o that but mebbee well not meet again in case we do ill want you to remember me as id be proud to serve you when you gets your command he had gone away leaving bolitho confused and proud dumaresqs resonant voice broke through his thoughts we shall clear for action at dawn tomorrow i shall speak with the people before we close the enemy but to you especially i give my thanks macmillan hovered by the screen door until he caught the captains eye mr timbrells respects sir an will you want to darken ship dumaresq shook his big head slowly not this time i want garrick to see us to know we are here his one weakness apart from greed is anger i intend that he shall grow angrier before morning macmillan opened the door and gratefully the lieutenants and midshipmen made to withdraw only palliser remained and bolitho guessed he would share the more technical details with the captain without their interruption with the door shut once more dumaresq turned to his first lieutenant and gestured to a chair theres something else isnt there palliser sat and thrust out his long legs for a moment more he kneaded his eyes with his knuckles and then said you were right about egmont sir even after you put him aboard a vessel outwardbound from basseterre he tried to warn garrick or to reason with him well probably never know he obviously transferred to a smaller faster vessel and took the northerly route through the islands to reach here before us whatever happened his words were lost on garrick he delved into his pocket and withdrew the gold necklace with its doubleheaded bird and gleaming ruby tails garrick had them butchered i took this from one of our prisoners the seamen i told you about explained the rest to me dumaresq picked up the heavy necklace and examined it sadly murray he saw it palliser nodded he was wounded i sent him in the schooner before he could speak with mr bolitho dumaresq walked to the windows again and watched the little schooner turning stern on her sails as gold as the necklace in his hand that was thoughtful for what he has said and done murray will be discharged when he reaches england i doubt if his path will ever cross with mr bolithos again he shrugged if it does the pain will be easier to bear by then youll not tell him sir not let him know that she is dead dumaresq watched the shadows reaching across the heaving water to cover the schooners hull hell not hear it from me tomorrow we must fight and i need every officer and man to give all he has richard bolitho has proved himself to be a good lieutenant if he survives tomorrow hell be an even better one dumaresq raised one of the windows and without further hesitation tossed the necklace into destinys wake ill leave him with his dream its the very least i can do for him in the wardroom bolitho sat in a chair his arms hanging at his sides as the resistance ran out of him like fine sand from a glass rhodes sat opposite him staring at an empty goblet without recognition there was still tomorrow like the horizon they never reached it bulkley entered and sat down heavily between them i have just been dealing with our stubborn marine bolitho nodded dully colpoys had insisted on staying aboard with his men bandaged and strapped up so that he could use only one arm he had barely the strength to stay on his feet palliser came through the door and tossed his hat on to a gun for a moment he looked at it probably seeing it tomorrow with this place stripped bare the screens gone the little personal touches shut away from the smoke and fire of battle then he said crisply your watch i believe mr rhodes the master cannot be expected to do everything you know rhodes lurched to his feet and grinned aye aye sir like a man walking in his sleep he left the wardroom bolitho barely heard them he was thinking of her using her memory to shield his mind from the sights and deeds of that day then he stood up abruptly and excused himself from the others as he went to the privacy of his cabin he did not want them to see his dismay when he had tried to see her face there had been only a blurred image nothing more bulkley pushed a bottle across the table was it bad palliser considered it itll be worse yet but he was thinking of the jewelled necklace on the seabed astern now a private burial the surgeon added im glad about murray its a small thing in all this misery but its good to know hes clear of blame palliser looked away im going to do my rounds and turn in for a few hours bulkley sighed likewise id better request to borrow spillane from clerks duties i shall be shorthanded too palliser paused in the doorway and regarded him emptily youd best hurry then hell maybe hang tomorrow just to stoke garricks anger further he was his spy murray saw him searching old lockyers body at funchal when it was brought aboard weariness was slurring pallisers words spillane guessed and tried to incriminate him over jurys watch to drive a wedge between focsle and quarterdeck its been done before with sudden bitterness he added hes as much a murderer as garrick he strode from the wardroom without another word and when bulkley turned his head he saw the first lieutenants hat was still lying on the gun whatever happened tomorrow nothing would ever be the same again he thought and the realization saddened him greatly when darkness finally shut out the horizon and the flattened hill above fougeaux island had disappeared destinys lights still shone on the water like watchful eyes into battle overnight fougeaux island seemed to have shrunk in size so that when the first faint light filtered down from the horizon it looked little more than a sandbar across destinys starboard bow bolitho lowered his telescope and allowed the island to fall back into the shadows within an hour it would be bright sunlight he turned his back and paced slowly up and down the quarterdeck the business of preparing the ship for battle had been unreal an almost leisurely affair carried out watch by watch during the night the seamen knew their way around the masts and hull so well that they had little left to do which required daylight dumaresq had thought that out with the same meticulous care he planned everything he did he wanted his men to accept the inevitability of a fight the fact that some if not all of them would never make another voyage in destiny there was only one alternative passage and it was marked on the masters chart two thousand fathoms straight down also dumaresq intended his people to be as rested as possible without the usual nervewrenching stampede of clearing for action when an enemy showed himself palliser appeared on the quarterdeck and after a cursory glance at the compass and each sail in turn he said i trust the watch below is completing breakfast bolitho replied aye sir i have ordered the cooks to douse the galley fire as soon as they are done palliser took a glass from midshipman henderson who had been assisting with the morningwatch midshipman cowdroy had been similarly employed during the night as next in line for promotion they might find themselves as actinglieutenants before destinys cooks relit their fires palliser scrutinized the island carefully terrible place he returned the glass to henderson and said aloft with you i want to be told the moment garrick tries to leave the lagoon bolitho watched the midshipman swarming up the ratlines it was getting lighter rapidly he could even see the boatswains topchains which he had slung on each yard the additional tackles and lines hauled up to the fightingtops for urgent repairs when needed he asked you believe it is today sir palliser smiled grimly the captain is certain thats enough for me and garrick will know it is his only chance to fight and win to get away before the squadron sends support vague figures moved about the upper deck and between the guns those black muzzles now damp with spray and a night mist would soon be too hot to touch petty officers were already discussing lastmoment changes to crews to replace those who had died or were on their way to safety aboard the captured schooner lieutenant colpoys was right aft by the taffrail with his sergeant as seamen trooped along the gangways to pack the hammocks tightly in the nettings as protection for those who shared the quarterdeck in times like these an exposed dangerous place vital to any ship an aimingpoint for marksmen and the deadly swivelguns midshipman jury took a message at the quarterdeck ladder and reported galley fires doused sir he looked very young and clean bolitho thought as if he had taken great care over his dress and bearing he smiled a fine day for it jury looked up at the masthead searching for henderson we have the agility if nothing else sir bolitho glanced at him but saw himself just a year or so back thats very true it was pointless to add that the wind was only a breeze to tack and wear with speed you required the sails drawing well wind and canvas were the stuff of a frigate rhodes climbed up to the quarterdeck and glanced curiously at the smudge of land beyond the bowsprit he was wearing his best sword one which had belonged to his father bolitho thought of the old sword which his father wore it appeared in most of the portraits of the bolitho family at falmouth it was destined to be hughs one day very soon now if his father was coming home for good he turned away from jury and rhodes somehow he did not have the feeling he would live to see it again he was alarmed to discover he could accept it palliser came back and said sharply tell mr timbrell to rig a halter from the mainyard mr bolitho he met their combined stares well rhodes shrugged awkwardly sorry sir i just thought that at a time like this palliser snapped at a time like this as you put it one more corpse will hardly make much difference bolitho sent jury for the boatswain and thought about spillane and what he had done he had had plenty of opportunity to steal information and pass it ashore in rio or basseterre like the captains coxswain the clerk was more free than most to move as he pleased garrick must have had agents and spies everywhere maybe even at the admiralty where one of them had followed every move towards putting destiny to sea when the ship had made ready to sail from plymouth spillane had been there it would have been easy for him to discover the whereabouts of dumaresqs recruiting parties he had only to read the posters now like lines on a chart they had all been drawn here to this place a cross on gullivers calculations and bearings something destined rather than planned most of the men on deck looked up as the boatswains party lowered a hangmans noose from the mainyard to the gangway like rhodes they would have little stomach for a summary execution it was outside their code of battle their understanding of justice bolitho heard one of the helmsmen mutter capns comin up sir bolitho turned to face the companionway as dumaresq wearing a freshly laundered shirt with his goldlaced hat set firmly on his head strode on to the quarterdeck he nodded to each of his officers and the men on watch while to colpoys who was attempting to draw himself to attention he said curtly save your strength you obstinate redcoat gulliver touched his hat nor by east sir winds still light though dumaresq eyed him impassively i can see that he turned to bolitho have the hands lay aft at six bells to witness punishment inform the masteratarms and the surgeon if you please he waited watching bolithos emotions and his efforts to conceal them youve still not learned deceit it seems one of his feet tapped on the deck what is it the execution yes sir its like an omen a superstition iim not sure what i mean evidently dumaresq walked to the rail and looked along the upper deck that man tried to betray us just as he attempted to destroy murray and all he believed in murray was a good man whereas he broke off to watch some marines beginning a slow climb to the fore and maintops id like to have seen murray before he left sir dumaresq asked sharply why bolitho was surprised at dumaresqs reaction i wanted to thank him oh that midshipman henderson made all of them look up deck there ship standing out from the island sir dumaresq dug his chin into his neckcloth at last he saw midshipman merrett by the mizzen go and fetch the articles of war from my servant well get this matter over with and then clear for action he patted his scarlet waistcoat and gave a soft belch that was a nice piece of pork and the wine will help to start the day he saw bolithos uncertainty bring up the prisoner id like him to see his masters ship before he swings god rot him sergeant barmouth placed a line of marines across the poop and as the pipe for all hands to lay aft and witness punishment echoed between decks spillane escorted by the masteratarms and corporal dyer appeared from the forecastle the seamen already stripped to their trousers and ready for the drums to beat to quarters parted to allow the little group through beneath the quarterdeck rail they halted and poynter reported harshly the prisoner sir bolitho made himself look at spillanes upturned face if anything it was completely empty as if the neat and usually composed man was unable to accept what had happened bolitho recalled how spillane had come to his cabin with the message from aurora and wondered how much he had passed on to garrick dumaresq waited for his officers to remove their hats and then said in his resonant voice you know why you are here spillane had you been a pressed man or one forced into the kings service against your will it might have been different you however volunteered knowing you were intending to betray your oath and where possible bring disaster to your ship and your companions yours was a conspiracy to commit murder on a grand scale look yonder man when spillane remained stricken and staring at him dumaresq snapped masteratarms poynter gripped the prisoners chin and swung him round towards the bows that ship is commanded by your master piers garrick take a long look and ask yourself now if the price of treachery was worthwhile but spillanes eyes were fixed on the swaying halter it was doubtful if he saw anything else deck there henderson s normally powerful voice sounded unsteady as if he was afraid of breaking into the drama below him dumaresq glared up at him speak man the san augustin has corpses hanging from her yards sir dumaresq swarmed into the shrouds snatching a telescope from jury as he passed then he climbed down to the deck very slowly and said they are the ships spanish officers he darted a quick glance at bolitho hung there as a warning no doubt but bolitho had seen something else in dumaresqs eyes just briefly it had been relief but why what had he expected to see dumaresq returned to the quarterdeck rail and replaced his hat then he said remove that halter from the mainyard mr timbrell masteratarms put the prisoner down he will await judgement with the others spillanes legs seemed to collapse under him he clasped his hands together and said brokenly thank you sir the lord bless you for your kindness stand up you bloody hound dumaresq looked at him with disgust to think that men like garrick can corrupt others so easily by hanging you i would have been no better than he but hear me you will be able to listen to our progress today and i suspect that will be an even greater punishment as spillane was hustled away palliser said bitterly if we sink that bugger will reach the bottom first dumaresq clapped him on the shoulder very true now beat to quarters if you will and try to knock two minutes off your time ship cleared for action sir palliser touched his hat his eyes gleaming eight minutes exactly dumaresq lowered his telescope and glanced at him shorthanded we may be but each manjack is working the harder for it bolitho stood below the quarterdeck watching his guncrews by their tackles seemingly relaxed although the waiting was far from over the distant ship had spread more sail to stand well clear of the island but as destiny lifted and fell gently in the swell the san augustin appeared to be motionless would she turn and run for it there was always a chance her sternchasers might cripple the pursuing frigate with a lucky shot midshipman henderson isolated from the preparations far below his perch had reported that two other sail had cleared the lagoon one was the topsail schooner and bolitho wondered how dumaresq could be so sure garrick was in the big manofwar and not in the schooner perhaps he and dumaresq were too much alike after all neither wishing to be a spectator each eager to inflict a quick and undeniable victory little walked slowly behind the starboard battery of twelvepounders stooping occasionally to check a tackle or to ensure that the ships boys had sanded the decks sufficiently to prevent the crews from slipping when the pace grew warm stockdale was at his own gun his men dwarfed by his great bulk as he cradled a twelvepound ball in his hands before replacing it in the shotgarland and selecting another in a manner born bolitho thought he had often seen old guncaptains do it to make certain the first shots would be perfect after the opening broadsides it was usually each crew to itself and devil take the hindmost he heard gulliver say we have the windgage sir we can always shorten sail if the enemy comes about he was probably speaking merely to release his own anxieties or to await a suggestion from the captain but dumaresq remained silent watching his adversary glancing occasionally at the masthead pendant or the sluggish wave curling back from destinys bows bolitho looked forward and saw rhodes speaking with cowdroy and some of his guncaptains the waiting was endless it was what he expected but he never grew used to the schooners have luffed sir dumaresq grunted hanging back like jackals bolitho climbed up to peer over the gangway which ran above the starboard battery to link quarterdeck to forecastle even with the packed hammock nettings and the nets spread above the deck there was little enough protection for the seamen he thought almost the worst part was the empty boattier apart from the gig and the quarterboat towing astern the rest had been left drifting in an untidy line in action flying splinters were one of the greatest hazards and the boats made a tempting target but to see them cast adrift put the seal on what they had to face henderson called the corpses have been cut down sir he sounded hoarse from strain dumaresq said to palliser like so much meat god damn his eyes palliser answered evenly maybe he wishes to see you angry sir provoke me dumaresqs anger faded before it could spread you could be right hells teeth mr palliser it should be parliament for you not the navy midshipman jury stood with his hands behind his back watching the faroff ship his hat tilted over his eyes as he had seen bolitho do he said suddenly will they try to close with us sir probably they have the numbers from what we saw on the island i would guess they outmatch us by ten to one he saw the dismay on jurys face and added lightly the captain will hold them off hit and run wear them down bolitho glanced up at dumaresq by the rail and wondered no emotion and yet he must be scheming and planning for every possible setback even his voice was as usual jury said the other two craft could be dangerous the topsail schooner maybe the other one is too light to risk a close encounter he thought of what would have happened but for their desperate action on the island was it only yesterday there would have been six schooners instead of two and the fortyfourgun san augustin might have had time to mount more guns maybe those from the hilltop battery now whatever the outcome their captured schooner would carry dumaresqs despatches to the admiral at antigua too late for them perhaps but they would ensure that garrick remained a hunted man for the rest of his life how clear the sky looked not yet too hot to be oppressive the sea too was creamy and inviting he tried not to think of that other time when he had pictured himself running and swimming with her finding happiness together making it last dumaresq said loudly they will attempt to dismast us and lay us open to boarding it is likely that the larger of the schooners has been armed with some heavier pieces so make each shot tell remember that many of their guncrews and seamen are spaniards terrified of garrick they may be but theyll not wish to be pounded to gruel by you his words brought a murmur of approval from the barebacked guncrews there was a ragged crash of cannonfire and bolitho turned to see the san augustins starboard guns shoot out long orange tongues while the smoke rolled over the ship and partially hid the island beyond the sea foamed and shot skywards as if the power was coming from beneath the surface instead of from the proud ship with the scarlet crosses on her courses stockdale said rough several of the seamen around him shook their fists towards the enemy although at three miles range it was unlikely anyone would see them rhodes strolled aft his beautiful sword at odds with his faded seagoing coat he said just to keep them busy eh dick bolitho nodded rhodes was probably right but there was something very menacing about the spanish vessel for all that perhaps because of her extravagant beauty the richness of her gilded carvings which even distance could not conceal he said if only the wind would come rhodes shrugged if only we were in plymouth another broadside spouted from the spaniards hull and some balls ricocheted across the seas face and seemed to go on forever there was an even louder shout of derision but bolitho saw some of the senior guncaptains looking worried the enemys iron was dropping short and was not that well directed but as both vessels were moving so slowly on what would likely remain a converging tack it made each barrage more dangerous he pictured bulkley and his loblolly boys on the shadowy orlop deck the glittering instruments the brandy to take away the agony the leather strap to prevent a man biting through his tongue as the surgeons saw did its work and spillane in irons below the waterline what was he thinking as the thunder rolled against the timbers around him stand by on deck palliser was staring down at the double line of guns run in and load this was the moment with fixed concentration each guncaptain watched as his men put their weight on the tackles and hauled them away from the sides bulky cartridges were passed rapidly to each muzzle and rammed home by the loader bolitho watched the one nearest to him as he gave the cartridge in his gun two extra sharp taps to bed it in his face was so set so absorbed that it was as if he was about to take on an enemy singlehanded then the wad followed by a gleaming black ball for each gun one more wad rammed down just in case the ship should give an unexpected roll and tip the ball harmlessly into the sea and they were done when bolitho looked up again the other ship seemed to have drawn much closer ready on deck each guncaptain held up his hand palliser shouted open the ports he waited counting seconds as the portlids rose along either side like reawakened eyes run out the san augustin fired again but her master had let her fall off to the wind and the whole broadside fell a good half mile from destinys larboard bow rhodes was striding behind his guns giving instructions or merely joking with his men bolitho could not tell with san augustin now lying off their larboard bow on an invisible arrowhead it was hard to keep his crews busy and prevent them from standing to look to the opposite side to see what was happening palliser called mr bolitho be ready to send some of your hands across to assist two broadsides and we will alter course to larboard and allow your guns a similar chance bolitho waved his hands aye sir dumaresq said alter course three points to starboard man the braces there helm aweather with her canvas flapping and cracking destiny responded the san augustin seeming to go astern as she showed herself to the crouching guncaptains full elevation fire the twelvepounders hurled themselves inboard on their tackles the smoke rolling downwind towards the enemy in a frothing screen stop your vents rhodes was striding more quickly now sponge out and load the guncaptains had to work doubly hard using a fist or two if necessary to contain their mens excitement to put a charge into an unsponged barrel where some smouldering remains from the first shot were still inside was inviting sudden and horrible death stockdale pounded the breachingring of his gun come on boys come on run out palliser was resting his telescope on the hammock nettings to study the other ship as you bear fire this time the broadside was uneven with each captain taking his time choosing his own moment but before they could watch the fall of shot men were already dashing to braces and halliards while aft gulliver urged his helmsmen to greater efforts as destiny changed tack standing as close to the wind as possible without losing her manoeuvrability bolithos mouth had gone dry without noticing he had drawn his hanger and was holding it to his hip as the deck tilted and then slowly but steadily his guncaptains saw san augustins gilded beakhead edge across their open ports on the uproll san augustins side erupted in darting tongues and bolitho heard the wild shriek of langrage or chainshot passing high overhead he found time to pity midshipman henderson clinging to the crosstrees with his telescope trained on the enemy while the murderous tangle of chain and iron bars swept past him fire bolitho saw the sea bursting with spray around the other ship and thought he saw her maincourse quiver as at least one ball ploughed through it as his men threw themselves on handspikes and rammers yelling for powder and shot oblivious to everything but the hungry muzzles and pallisers voice from the quarterdeck bolitho glanced at the captain he was with gulliver and slade beside the compass pointing at the enemy the sails at the drifting smoke as if he held every act and each consequence in his palm fire down destinys starboard side gun by gun the twelvepounders crashed inboard their trucks squealing like enraged hogs stand by to alter course be ready mr rhodes larboard battery load with doubleshot bolitho ducked away from running seamen and bellowing petty officers their constant aching drills on the long passage from plymouth had taught them well no matter what the guns were doing the ship had to be worked and kept afloat once again the guns roared out their challenge a different sound this time jarring and painful as the doubleshotted barrels responded to their charges bolitho wiped his face with his wrist he felt as if he had been in the sun for hours in fact it was barely eight bells one hour since spillane had been sent below dumaresq was taking a risk to doubleshot his guns but bolitho had seen the two schooners working their way to windward as if to close with destiny from astern they had to hit san augustin and hit her hard if only to slow her down dumaresq shouted fetch the gunner lively there bolitho winced as water cascaded over the opposite gangway and he felt the hull jump to a massive pounding two hits at least perhaps on the waterline but the boatswain was already yelling orders and his men were running past the marine sentries who guarded each hatchway to examine the hull and to shore up any damage he saw the gunner blinking like an owl in the sunlight his face creased with anger at being called from his magazine and powder rooms even by the captain mr vallance dumaresqs face was split in a fierce grin you were once the best guncaptain in the channel fleet is that not so vallance shuffled his felt slippers very necessary footwear to avoid kicking up sparks in so lethal a place as the magazine that be true sir no doubt on it despite the noise he was obviously pleased to be so remembered well i want you to personally take charge of the bowchasers and put paid to that topsail schooner ill bring the ship about he kept his voice level youll have to look alive vallance shuffled away jerking his thumb to beckon two of the guncaptains from bolithos battery without even asking permission vallance was the best of his kind even if he was usually a taciturn man he did not need dumaresq to elaborate for when destiny tacked round to engage the schooners she would present her full length to the enemys broadside destinys bowchasers were ninepounders although not as powerful as several other naval guns the ninepounder was always considered to be the most accurate fire rhodes crews were sponging out again and the seamen shone with sweat which cut runners through the powderdirt on their bodies like marks of a lash the range was less than two miles and when bolitho looked up he saw several holes in the maintopsail and a few seamen working to replace some broken rigging while the battle raged across the narrowing strip of water vallance was up in the bows now and bolitho could picture his grizzled head bobbing over the larboard ninepounder remembering perhaps when he had been a guncaptain himself dumaresqs voice cut through a brief lull in the firing when you are ready mr palliser it will mean five points to larboard he pounded his fists together if only the wind would come he thrust his hands behind him again as if to control their agitation loose the tgansls moments later answering as best she could to the flapping canvas destiny tacked round to larboard and in seconds or so it seemed the schooners lay across her bows bolitho heard the crash of a ninepounder and then the other on the opposite bow as vallance fired the topsail schooner seemed to stagger as if she had run headlong on to a reef foremast sails and yard all crumpled together to swamp her forecastle and slew her round out of command dumaresq yelled break off the action bring her about mr palliser bolitho knew that the second schooner was hardly likely to risk sharing her consorts fate it was a masterful piece of gunlaying he saw his men sliding down the stays to the deck after setting the extra sails and wondered how destiny would appear to the enemys guncrews as they peered through the smoke and saw one of their number crippled so easily it would hardly affect the difference of armament between the two ships but it would put heart into the british seamen when they most needed it steady as she goes nor by east sir bolitho shouted itll be our turn next he saw several of the seamen turn to grin at him their faces like masks their eyes glazed by the constant crash of gunfire the deck seemed to leap beneath bolithos feet and with astonishment he saw a twelvepounder from the opposite battery toppled on to its side two men crushed and screaming under it while others ducked or fell sprawling to flying splinters he heard rhodes yelling to restore order and the responding bang of several guns but the damage had been bad and as timbrells men ran to haul away the broken timber and upended gun the enemy fired again bolitho had no way of knowing how many of san augustins shots found their mark but the deck shook so violently he knew it was a massive weight of iron woodwork and pieces of broken metal clattered around him and he covered his face with his arms as a great shadow swooped over the deck stockdale pulled him down and croaked mizzen theyve shot it away then came the thundering crash as the complete mizzenmast and spars scythed across the quarterdeck and down over the starboard gangway snapping rigging and entangling men as it went bolitho staggered to his feet and looked for the enemy but she seemed to have changed position her upper yards misting over as she continued to shoot destiny was listing the mizzen dragging her round as men ran and stumbled amongst the tangled rigging their ears too deafened by the noise to react to their orders dumaresq came to the quarterdeck rail and retrieved his hat from his coxswain he glanced quickly around the upper deck and then said more hands aft cut that wreckage clear palliser seemed to rise out of the chaos like a spectre he was gripping his arm which appeared to be broken and he looked as if he might collapse dumaresq roared move yourselves and another ensign to the mainmast mr lovelace but it was a boatswains mate who swarmed up the shrouds through the smoke to replace the ensign which had been shot down with the mizzen midshipman lovelace who would have been fourteen years old in two weeks time lay by the nettings torn almost in half by a trailing backstay bolitho realized that he had been standing quite motionless while the ship swayed and shuddered about him to the jar of gunfire he grasped jurys shoulder and said take ten men and assist the boatswain he shook him gently all right jury smiled yes sir he ran off into the smoke calling names as he went stockdale muttered weve less than six guns whichll bear on this side bolitho knew that destiny would be out of control until the mizzen was hacked free over the side he could see a marine still clinging to the mizzentop another drowning as he watched dragged under by the great web of rigging he turned and looked at dumaresq as he stood like a rock directing the helmsmen watching his enemy and making sure his own company could see him there bolitho tore his eyes away he felt shocked and guilty as if he had accidentally stolen dumaresqs secret so that was why he wore a scarlet waistcoat so that none of his men should see but bolitho had seen the fresh wet stains on it which had run down on to his strong hands as his coxswain johns supported him by the rail midshipman cowdroy clambered over the debris and yelled i need more help forrard sir he looked near to panic bolitho said deal with it what dumaresq had said to him about the stolen watch deal with it axes rang through the smoke and he felt the deck lurch upright as the broken mast and attendant rigging drifted clear of the side how bare it seemed without it and its spread of canvas with a start he realized that san augustin lay directly across the bows she was still firing but destinys change of direction which had been caused by the mizzen dragging her round made her a difficult target balls slammed down close to the side or splashed in the sea on either beam destinys guns were also blind except for the bowchasers and bolitho heard their sharper explosions as they reopened fire in deadly earnest but another heavy ball smashed under the larboard gangway toppling two guns and painting the decks red as it cut down a group of men already wounded bolitho saw rhodes fall try to recover his stand by the guns and then drop on his side he ran to help him shielding him from the billowing gunsmoke as the world went mad around them rhodes looked directly at him his eyes free of pain as he whispered the lord and master had his way you see dick he looked up at the sky beyond the rigging the wind here at last but too late he reached up to touch bolithos shoulder take care i always knew his eyes became fixed and without understanding blindly bolitho stood up and stared around at the destruction and the pain stephen rhodes was dead the one who had first made him feel welcome who had taken life at face value a day at a time then beyond the broken nettings and punctured hammocks he saw the sea the sluggish swell was gone he peered up at the sails holed they might be but they were thrusting out like breastplates as they pushed the frigate forward into the fight they had not been beaten rhodes had seen it the wind he had said the last thing he had understood on this earth he ran to the side and saw san augustin startlingly close right there on the starboard bow men were shooting at him there was smoke and noise all around but he felt nothing close to the enemy ship was no longer so proud and invulnerable and he could see where destinys claws had left their mark he heard dumaresqs voice following him along the deck commanding all powerful even in its pain ready to starboard mr bolitho bolitho snatched up rhodes beautiful sword and waved it wildly stand to doubleshotted lads musketballs hammered across the decks like pebbles and here and there a man fell but the rest dragging themselves from the wreckage and leaving rhodes guns on the larboard side shambled to obey to load the remaining twelvepounders to crouch like dazed animals as foot by foot the san augustins towering stern loomed over them like a gilded cliff as you bear who was shouting the orders dumaresq palliser or was he himself so stunned by the ferocity of the battle that he had called them himself fire he saw the guns sliding inboard the way their crews just stood and watched the destruction as every murderous ball ploughed through the spanish manofwar from stern to bow none of the guncaptains not even stockdale made any attempt to reload it was as if each man knew the san augustin was drifting downwind perhaps her steering shot away or her officers killed by the last deadly embrace bolitho walked slowly aft and on to the quarterdeck wood splinters were everywhere and there were few men left at the sixpounders to cheer as some of the enemys rigging collapsed in a welter of sparks and smoke dumaresq turned stiffly and looked at him i think shes afire bolitho saw gulliver dead by his helmsmen and slade in his place as if he had been meant for master from the beginning colpoys his red coat over his bandaged wounds like a cape watching his men standing back from their weapons palliser sitting on a cask while one of bulkleys men examined his arm he heard himself say well lose the treasure sir an explosion shook the stricken san augustin and figures could be seen jumping over the side and trampling down anyone who tried to stop them dumaresq looked down at his red waistcoat so will they bolitho watched the other ship and saw the smoke thickening the first glint of fire beneath her mainmast if garrick was still alive he would not get far now bulkley arrived on the quarterdeck and said you must come below captain i have to examine you must dumaresq gave his fierce grin it is not a word i choose then he fainted in his coxswains arms after all that had happened it seemed unbearable bolitho watched as dumaresqs body was picked up and carried carefully to the companionway palliser joined him by the quarterdeck rail he looked ashen but said well stand off until that ship either sinks or blows up what shall i do sir it was midshipman henderson who had somehow survived the whole battle at the masthead palliser looked at him you will assume mr bolithos duties he hesitated his eyes on rhodes body by the foremast mr bolitho will be second lieutenant a greater explosion than all the previous ones shook san augustin so violently that her fore and maintopmasts toppled into the smoke and the hull itself began to turn turtle jury climbed up and joined bolitho to watch the last moments of the ornate ship was it worth it sir bolitho looked at him and at the ship around them already there were men working to put the damage to rights to make the ship live again there were a thousand things to do wounded to care for the remaining schooner chased and caught prisoners to be rescued and separated from the spanish sailors a great deal of work for one small ship and her company he thought he considered jurys question what it had all cost and what they had discovered in each other he thought too of what dumaresq would have to say when he returned to duty that was a strange thing about dumaresq dying was like defeat you could never associate it with him bolitho said quietly you must never ask that ive learned and im still learning the ship comes first now lets be about it otherwise the lord and master will have harsh words for all of us startled he looked at the sword he still grasped in his hand perhaps rhodes had answered jurys question for him epilogue bolitho tugged his hat down over his eyes and looked up at the great grey house there was a squall blowing up the channel and the rain which stung his cheeks felt like ice all the months all the waiting and now he was home again it had been a long hard journey from plymouth after destiny had dropped anchor the roads were deeply rutted and there had been so much mud thrown up on the coach windows bolitho had found it difficult to recognize places which he had known since boyhood and now that he was back again he felt a sense of unreality and for some reason he could not determine one of loss the house was unchanged just as it had looked when he had last seen it almost a year ago stockdale who had driven with him from plymouth shifted his feet uncertainly are you sure its all right fer me to be ere sir bolitho looked at him it had been dumaresqs last gesture before he had left the ship before destiny had been put into the hands of the dockyard for repair and a welldeserved overhaul take stockdale youll be getting another ship soon keep him with you a useful fellow bolitho said quietly youre welcome here youll see he climbed up the worn stone steps and saw the doubledoors swing inwards to greet him bolitho was not surprised he had felt in the last few moments that the whole house had been silently watching him but it was not old mrs tremayne the housekeeper but a young maidservant he did not recognize she curtsied and blushed welcome zur almost in the same breath she added capn james is waitin for you zur bolitho stamped the mud from his shoes and gave the girl his hat and boatcloak he strode through the panelled hall and stepped into the big room he knew so well there was the fire blazing brightly as if to hold the winter at bay gleaming pewter the filtered smells from the kitchen security captain james bolitho moved from the fire and put his hand on his sons shoulder my god richard i saw you last as a scrawny midshipman youve come home a man bolitho was shocked by his fathers appearance he had steeled himself against the loss of an arm but his father had changed beyond belief his hair was grey and his eyes were sunken because of his sewnup sleeve he was holding himself awkwardly something bolitho had seen other crippled sailors do fearful of having someone brush against the place where a limb had been sit down my boy he watched bolitho fixedly as if afraid of missing something thats a terrible scar you have there i must hear all about it but there was no enthusiasm in his voice who was that giant i saw you arrive with bolitho gripped the arms of his chair a man called stockdale he was suddenly aware of the quiet the deadly clinging silence he asked tell me father is something wrong his father walked to a window and stared unseeingly through the sleetwashed glass there have been letters of course theyll catch up with you one day he turned heavily your mother died a month ago richard bolitho stared at him unable to move unwilling to accept it died she had a short illness a fever of sorts we did all we could bolitho said quietly i think i knew just now outside the house she always gave the place light dead he had been planning what he was going to tell her how he would have quietened her concern over his scar his father said distantly your ship was reported some days back yes then fog came down we had to anchor he thought suddenly of the faces he had left how much he needed them at this moment dumaresq who had gone to the admiralty to explain the loss of the treasure or to be congratulated for depriving a potential enemy of it palliser who had got his command of a brig at spithead young jury with a break in his voice when they had shaken hands for the last time i heard of some of your exploits it sounds as if dumaresq made quite a name for himself i hope the admiralty see it that way your brother is away with the fleet bolitho tried to contain his emotion words just words he had known his father would be like this pride it was always a question of pride with him first and foremost is nancy at home his father looked at him distantly you wont know that either your sister married the squires son young lewis roxby your mother said it was on the rebound after that other wretched business he sighed so there it is bolitho leaned back against the chair pressing his shoulders against the carved oak to control his sorrow his father had lost the sea now he was alone too this great house which looked across the slopes of pendennis castle or out across the busy comings and goings of carrick roads each a constant reminder of what he had lost of what had been taken from him he said gently destiny has paid off father i can stay it was as if he had shouted some terrible oath captain james strode from the window and stood looking down at him i never want to hear that you are my son and a kings officer for generations weve left this house and some have never come back theres war in the air and well need all our sons he paused and added softly a messenger came here just two days back an appointment already bolitho stood up and moved about the room touching familiar things without feeling them his father added shes the trojan eighty guns theres going to be a war right enough if theyre recommissioning her i see not a lithe frigate but another great ship of the line a new world to explore and master perhaps it was just as well something to fill his mind to keep him busy until he could accept all which had happened now i think we should take a glass together richard ring for the girl you must tell me all about it the ship her people everything leave nothing out its all i have now memories bolitho said well father it was a year ago when i joined destiny at plymouth under captain dumaresq when the young maidservant entered with the glasses and wine from the cellar she saw the grayheaded captain james sitting opposite his youngest son they were talking about ships and foreign parts there was no sign of grief or despair in their reunion but she did not understand it was all a question of pride
