anne perry anne perrys christmas mysteries a book in the christmas novellas series a christmas guest to all those who are still hoping and still learning part one i do not accept it mariah ellison said indignantly it was intolerable i am afraid there is no alternative emily replied she was wearing a beautiful morning dress of pale water green with fashionably large sleeves and a sweeping skirt with her fair coloring it made her look prettier than she was and having married money she had airs above her station of course there is an alternative grandmama snapped staring up at her from her chair in the withdrawing room there is always an alternative why in heavens name should you wish to go to france it is only a week and a half until christmas emily sighed deeply we have been invited to spend christmas in the loire valley where in france is immaterial it is still not england we shall have to cross the channel it will be rough and we shall all be ill i know it would be unpleasant for you emily conceded and the train journey from paris might be tedious and perhaps cold at this time of year what do you mean perhaps grandmama snapped there is no possible doubt so perhaps it is as well that you were not invited emily gave a very slight smile now you will not have to worry how to decline with grace grandmama had a sharp suspicion that emily was being sarcastic she also had an unpleasant and surprisingly painful realization do i take it that you are going to leave me alone in this house for christmas while you go visiting wherever you said it was in france she tried to keep her voice angry rather than betraying her sudden sense of being abandoned of course not grandmama emily said cheerfully it would be quite miserable for you but apart from that you cant stay here because there will be nobody to care for you dont be absurd grandmama regained her temper with asperity there is a houseful of servants emilys christmas parties were among the few things grandmama had been looking forward to although she would have choked rather than admit it she would have attended as though it were a duty required of her and then loved every moment you have sufficient housemaids for a duchess i have never seen so many girls with mops and dusters in my life the servants are coming with us and you cannot stay here alone at christmas it would be wretched i have made arrangements for you to go and stay with mama and joshua i have no desire to stay with your mother and joshua grandmama said instantly caroline had been her daughterinlaw until edwards death a few years ago had left her a widow of what grandmama referred to as an unfortunate age instead of settling into a decent retirement from society as the dear queen had done and as everyone had expected of her caroline had married again that in itself was indiscreet enough but instead of a widower with means and position which might have had considerable advantages and been looked upon with approval she had married a man nearly two decades younger than herself but worse than that if anything could be he was on the boardsan actor a grown man who dressed up and strutted around on the stage pretending to be someone else and he was jewish for heavens sake caroline had lost what wits she had ever had and poor edward would be turning in his grave if he knew it was one of the many burdens of grandmamas life that she had lived long enough to see it no desire at all she repeated emily stood quite still in the middle of the withdrawing room the firelight casting a warm glow on her skin and the extravagant coils of her hair im sorry grandmama but as i said there really is no choice she repeated jack and i are leaving tomorrow and there is a great deal of packing to do as we shall be gone for at least three weeks you had best take a good supply of warmer gowns and boots and you may borrow my black shawl if you would care to good gracious can they not afford a fire grandmama said furiously perhaps joshua should consider a more respectable form of employment if there is anything else on earth he is fitted for it has nothing to do with money emily retorted they are spending christmas in a house on the south coast of kent the romney marshes to be exact i daresay the wind will be chill and one often feels the cold more when away from home grandmama was appalled in fact she was so appalled it was several seconds before she could find any words at all to express her horror i think i misheard you she said icily at last you mumble these days your diction used to be excellent but since your marriage to jack radley you have allowed your standards to slipin several areas i thought you said that your mother is going to spend christmas in some bog by the sea as that is obviously complete nonsense you had better repeat yourself and speak properly they have taken a house in romney marsh emily said with deliberate clarity it is near the sea and i believe the views will be very fine if there is no fog of course grandmama looked for impertinence in emilys face and saw an innocence so wideeyed as to be highly suspicious it is unacceptable she said in a tone that would have frozen water in a glass emily stared at her for a moment regathering her thoughts there is too much wind at this time of the year for there to be much fog she said at last perhaps you can watch the waves in a marsh grandmama asked sarcastically the house is actually in st mary in the marsh emily replied it is very close to the sea it will be pleasant you dont have to go outside if it is cold and you dont wish to of course it will be cold it is on the english channel in the middle of winter i shall probably catch my death to give her credit emily did look a little uncomfortable no you wont she said with forced cheer mama and joshua will look after you very well you might even meet some interesting people stuff and nonsense grandmama said furiously nevertheless the old lady had no choice and the next day she found herself sitting with her maid tilly in emilys carriage it made slow progress out of the city traffic then sped up as it reached the open road south of the river and proceeded toward dover roughly a hundred and fortyfive miles southeast of london of course she had known the journey would be dreadful to make it in one day she had set out before dawn and it would be late before they reached whatever godforsaken spot in which caroline had chosen to spend christmas heaven alone knew what it would be like if they were in trying circumstances it might be no more than a cottage without civilized facilities and so cramped she would spend the entire time forced into their company it was going to be the worst christmas of her life emilys thoughtlessness in gallivanting off to france of all places at this time of year was beyond belief it was an outrage against all family loyalty and duty the day was gray and still and mercifully the rain was no more than a spattering now and then they stopped for luncheon and to change the horses and again a little after four oclock for afternoon tea by that time naturally it was dark and she had not the faintest idea where she was she was tired her legs were cramped from the long sitting and unavoidably she was rattled and jolted around with the constant movement and of course it was coldperishingly so they stopped again to inquire the way as lanes grew narrower and even more rutted and overhung when at last they arrived at their destination she was in a temper fit to have lit a fire with the sheer heat of her words she climbed out with the coachmans assistance and stood on the gravel drive of what was obviously a fairly large house all the lights seemed to be blazing and the front door was decorated with a magnificent wreath of holly immediately she was aware of the smells of smoke and salt and a sharp wind with an edge to it like a slap in the face it was damp so no doubt it was straight off the sea caroline had obviously lost not only her money but the last vestige of her senses as well the door opened and caroline came down the steps now smiling she was still a remarkably handsome woman in her fifties her dark mahogany hair only lightly sprinkled with the odd silver at the temples which had a softening effect she was dressed in deep warm red and it gave a glow to her skin welcome to st mary mamainlaw she said a trifle guardedly the old lady could think of nothing whatever that met the situation or her feelings she was tired confused and utterly miserable in a strange place where she knew perfectly well she was unwanted it was several months since she had seen her erstwhile daughterinlaw they had never been genuinely friends although they had lived in the same house for over twenty years during her son edwards lifetime there had been a truce afterward caroline had behaved disgracefully and would listen to no advice at all it became necessary for grandmama to find other accommodations because caroline and joshua moved around so much as his ridiculous profession dictated there was never a question of grandmama living with charlotte the elder granddaughter she had scandalized everyone by marrying a policeman a man of no breeding no money and an occupation that defied polite description heaven only knew how they survived so she had had no choice but to live with emily who at least had inherited very considerable means from her first husband come in and warm yourself caroline offered her arm grandmama briskly declined it leaning heavily on her stick instead would you like a cup of tea or hot cocoa caroline continued grandmama would and said so stepping inside to a spacious and welllit hall it was a trifle lowceilinged perhaps but floored with excellent parquet the stairs swept up to a landing above and presumably several bedrooms if the fires were kept stoked and the cook were any good it might be endurable after all the footman carried her cases in and tilly followed behind him joshua came forward and welcomed her taking her cape himself she was escorted into the withdrawing room where there was a blazing fire in a hearth large enough to have accommodated half a tree perhaps you would enjoy a glass of sherry after such a long journey joshua offered he was a slender man of little above average height but possessed of extraordinary grace and the suppleness and beauty of an actors voice he was not handsome in a traditional sensehis nose was rather too prominent his features too mobilebut he had a presence one could not ignore every prejudice in her dictated that she dislike him yet he had sensed her feelings far more accurately than caroline had thank you she accepted i would he poured a full glass from the crystal decanter and brought it to her they sat and made conversation about the area its features and a little of its history after half an hour she retired to bed surprised to find it was still only quarter past ten a perfectly reasonable hour she had imagined it to be the middle of the night it felt like it and it was irritating to be wrong she awoke in the morning after having slept all night almost without moving from the amount of light coming through the curtains it appeared to be quite late possibly even after breakfast she had barely bothered to look at her surroundings when she arrived now she saw that it was an agreeable room if a trifle oldfashioned which normally she approved of the modern style of having less furniture making far too much open spaceno tassels frills carvings embroidered samplers and photographs on the walls and on every available surfaceshe found too sparse it made a place look as if no one lived there or if they did then they had no family or background they dared to display but here she was determined not to like anything she had been put upon dismissed from such home as she had and packed off to the seaside like a maid who had got herself with child and needed to be removed until it all could be dealt with it was a cruel and irresponsible way to treat ones grandmother but then all respect had disappeared in modern times the young had no manners left at all she rose and dressed with tillys assistance then went downstairs more than ready for something to eat then she found to her fury that caroline and joshua had risen early and gone for a walk toward the beach she was obliged to have toast and marmalade and a lightly boiled egg sitting by herself in the dining room at one end of a finely polished mahogany table surrounded by fourteen chairs it was agreeably warm in the house and yet she felt cold not of the body so much as of the mind she did not belong here she was acquainted with no one even the servants were strangers about whom she knew nothing at all nor they of her there was nothing to do and no one to talk to when she had finished she stood up and went to the long windows it looked bitterly cold outside a windragged sky clouds torn apart and streaming across a bleached blue as if the color had died in it the trees were leafless black branches wet and shivering bending at the tops there was nothing in the garden that looked even remotely like a flower an old man walked along the lane beyond the gate his hat jammed on his head scarf ends whipped around his shoulders and flapping behind him he did not even glance in her direction she went into the withdrawing room where the fire was roaring comfortably and sat down to wait for caroline and joshua to return she was going to be bored to weeping and there was no help for it it was a bitter thing to be so abandoned in her old age might there be any sort of social life at all in this godforsaken spot she rang the bell and in a few moments the maid appeared a country girl by the look of her yes mrs ellison she said expectantly what is your name grandmama demanded abigail maam perhaps you can tell me abigail what people do here other than attend church i presume there is a church yes maam st mary the virgin what else are there societies parties do people hold musical evenings or lectures or anything at all the girl looked dumbfounded i dont know maam ill ask cook and before grandmama could excuse her she turned and fled fool grandmama said under her breath where on earth was caroline how long would she walk in a howling gale she was besotted with joshua and behaving like a girl it was ridiculous it turned out to be another hour and a half before they came in cheerful windblown and full of news about all kinds of local events that sounded provincial and desperately boring some old gentleman was going to speak about butterflies at the local church hall a maiden lady intended to discuss her travels in an unknown area of scotland or worse than that one that had been known and forgottendoubtless for very good reasons does anyone play cards grandmama inquired other than snap or old maid i have no idea caroline replied moving closer to the fire i dont play so i have never asked it requires intelligence and concentration grandmama told her waspishly and a great deal of time on your hands caroline added and nothing better to fill it with it is better than gossiping about your neighbors grandmama rejoined or licking your lips over other peoples misfortunes caroline gave her a chilly look and controlled her temper with an effort the old lady could easily read in her face we shall be having luncheon at one she observed if you care to take a walk its wintry but quite pleasant and it might rain tomorrow of course it might rain tomorrow grandmama said tartly in a climate like ours that is hardly a perspicacious remark it might rain tomorrow any day of the year caroline did not try to mask the irritation she felt or the effort it cost her not to retaliate the fact that she had to try so hard gave the old lady a small perverse satisfaction good at least she still had some semblance of moral duty left after all she had been edward ellisons wife most of her adult life she owed mariah ellison something maybe i shall go for a walk this afternoon she said that maid mentioned something about a church i believe st mary the virgin caroline told her yes its attractive norman to begin with the soil is very soft here so the tower has huge buttresses supporting it we are on a marsh grandmama sniffed probably everything is sinking it is a miracle we are not up to our knees in mud or worse and so it passed for most of the next two longdrawnout days walking in the garden was miserable almost everything had died back into the earth the trees were leafless and black and seemed to drip incessantly it was too late even for the last roses and too early for the first snowdrops there was nothing worth doing no one to speak to or visit those who did call were excruciatingly boring they had nothing to talk about except people grandmama did not know or wish to they had never been to london and knew nothing of fashion society or even current events of any importance in the world then in the middle of the second afternoon a letter arrived for joshua he tore it open as they were having tea in the withdrawing room the fire roaring halfway up the chimney rain beating on the window in the dark as heavy clouds obscured even the shreds of winter light there was hot tea on a silver tray and toasted crumpets with butter melted into them and golden syrup on top cook had made a particularly good madeira cake and drop scones accompanied by butter raspberry jam and cream so thick one could have eaten it with a fork its a letter from aunt bedelia joshua said looking at caroline a frown on his face she says aunt maude has returned without any warning from the middle east and expects them to put her up for christmas but its quite impossible they have another guest of great importance whom they cannot turn out to make room for her but its christmas caroline said with dismay surely they can make room somehow they cant turn her away shes family have they a very small house perhaps a neighbor would accommodate her at least overnight joshuas face tightened he looked troubled and a little embarrassed no their house is large at least five or six bedrooms if they have plenty of room then what is this about caroline asked an edge to her voice as if she feared the answer joshua lowered his eyes i dont know i called her aunt bedelia but actually she is my mothers cousin and i never knew her very well or her sister agnes and maude left england about the time i was born left england caroline was astounded you mean permanently yes i believe so why joshua colored unhappily i dont know no one will say it sounds as if they simply dont want her there grandmama said candidly as an excuse it is tissuethin what on earth do they expect you to do joshua looked straight at her and his eyes made her feel uncomfortable although she had no idea why he had fine eyes a dark hazelbrown and very direct mamainlaw he replied using a title for her to which he had no right at all they are sending her here thats preposterous grandmama said more loudly than she had intended what can you do about it make her welcome he replied it will not be difficult we have two other bedrooms caroline hesitated only a moment of course she agreed smiling there is plenty of everything it will be no trouble at all grandmama could hardly believe it they were going to have this wretched woman here as if being banished herself like secondhand furniture were not bad enough now she would have to divide what little attention or courtesy she received with some miserable woman whose own family could not endure her they would have to cater to her needs and no doubt listen to endless pointless stories of whatever benighted spot she had been in it was all really far too much i have a headache she announced and rose to her feet i shall go and lie down in my room she stumped over to the door deliberately leaning heavily on her stick which actually she did not require good idea caroline agreed tartly dinner will be at eight grandmama could not immediately make up her mind whether to be an hour early or fifteen minutes late perhaps early would be better if she were late they were just rude enough to start without her and she would miss the soup maude barrington arrived the following morning alighting without assistance from the carriage that had brought her and walking with an easy step up to the front door where joshua and caroline were waiting for her grandmama had chosen to watch from the withdrawing room window where she had an excellent view without either seeming inquisitive which was so vulgar or having to pretend to be pleased and welcoming which would be farcical she was furious maude was quite tall and unbecomingly squareshouldered a gentle curve would have been better more feminine her hair appeared to be of no particular color but at least there was plenty of it at the moment far too much poked out from underneath a hat that might have been fashionable once but was now a disaster she wore a traveling costume that looked as if it had been traipsed around most of the world especially the hot and dusty parts and now had no distinguishable shape or color left maude herself could never have been prettyher features were too strong her mouth in particular was anything but dainty it was impossible to judge accurately how old she was other than between fifty and sixty her stride was that of a young womanor perhaps a young man would have been more accurate her skin was appalling either no one had ever told her not to sit in the sun or she had totally ignored them it was positively weatherbeaten burned and a most unfortunate shade of ruddy brown heaven only knew where she had been she looked like a native no wonder her family did not want her there at christmas they might wish to entertain guests and they could hardly lock her away but it was monstrous that they should wish her on joshua and caroline not to mention their guests she heard voices in the hallway and then footsteps up the stairs no doubt at luncheon she would meet this miserable woman and have to be civil to her and so it turned out one would have expected in the circumstances that the wretched creature would have remained silent and spoken only when invited to do so on the contrary she engaged in conversation in answer to the merest question and where a word or two would have been quite sufficient i understand you have just returned from abroad caroline said courteously i hope it was pleasant she left it open for an easy dismissal if it were not a subject maude wished to discuss but apparently it was a broad smile lit maudes face bringing life to her eyes even passion it was marvelous she said her voice vibrant the world is more terrible and beautiful than we can possibly imagine or believe even after one has seen great stretches of it there are always new shocks and new miracles around each corner were you away long caroline asked apparently forgetting what joshua had told her perhaps she did not wish to appear to maude as if they had been discussing her maude smiled showing excellent teeth even though her mouth was much too big forty years she replied i fell in love caroline clearly did not know what to make of that maudes hands were innocent of rings and she had introduced herself by her maiden name the only decent thing to do would have been to avoid the subject but she had made that impossible no wonder they had found it intolerable to have her at home really this imposition was too much maude glanced at grandmama and cannot have failed to see the disapproval in her face in love with the desert she explained lightly and cities like marrakech have you ever been to a muslim city in africa mrs ellison grandmama was outraged certainly not she snapped the question was ridiculous what decent englishwoman would do such a thing maude was not to be stopped she leaned forward over the table soup forgotten it is flat an oasis facing the atlas mountains and stretches out from the great red tower of the koutoubya to the bluepalmed fringes and the sands beyond the almoravid princes who founded it came with their hordes from the black desert of senegal and built palaces of beauty to rival anything on earth caroline and joshua forgot their soup also though grandmama did not they imported masters of chiseled plaster gilded cedar and ceramic mosaics maude continued they created garden beyond garden courts that led to the other courts and apartments some high in the sunlight others deep within walls and shadows and running water she smiled at some inner delight one can walk in the green gloom of a cypress garden or breathe in the cool sweetness of a tunnel of jasmine where the light is soft and ever whispering with the sound of water and the murmur of pigeons as they preen themselves there are alabaster urns light through jeweled glass and vermilion doors painted with arabesques in gold she stopped for a moment to draw breath grandmama felt excluded from this magic that maude had seen and from the table where joshua and caroline hung on every word she was totally unnecessary here she wanted to dismiss it all as foreign and completely vulgar but deeply against her will she was fascinated naturally she would not dream of saying so and you were allowed to see all these things caroline said in amazement i lived there for a while maude answered her eyes bright with memory it was a superb time something marvelous or terrible every week i have never been more intensely alive the world is so beautiful sometimes i felt as if i could hardly bear it one gazes at things that hurt with the passion of their loveliness she smiled but her eyes were misted with tears dusk in a persian garden the suns fire dying on the mountains in purple and umber and rose the call of the little owls in the coolness of the night dimpled water over old stones the perfume of jasmine in the moonlight rich as sweet oil and clear as the stars firelight reflected on a copper drum she pushed her soup away too filled with emotion to eat i could go on forever i cannot imagine boredom surely it is worse than dying like some terrible corroding illness that leaves you neither the joy and the hunger of life nor the release of death even that exquisite squeezing of the heart because you cannot hold the light forever is better than not to have seen it or loved it at all grandmama had no idea what on earth she was babbling about of course she hadnt at least not more than a needlesharp suspicion like a wound too deep to feel at first narrow as a blade of envy cutting almost without awareness what would anyone reply to such a thing there ought to be something but what was there that met such aa baring of emotion it was unseemly like taking off ones clothes in public no taste at all that was what came of traveling to foreign parts and not only foreign but heathen as well it would be best to ignore the whole episode but of course that was quite impossible the afternoon was cold but quite clear and sunny although the wind was sharp escape was the only solution i shall go for a walk she announced after luncheon was over perhaps a breath of sea air would be pleasant what an excellent idea maude said with enthusiasm it is a perfect day do you mind if i come with you what could she say she could hardly refuse im afraid there will be no jasmine flowers or owls or sunset over the desert she replied coolly and i daresay you will find it very chillyandordinary a shadow crossed maudes face but whether it was the thought of the lonely marsh and sea wind or the rejection implicit in grandmamas reply it was impossible to say grandmama felt a jab of guilt the woman had been refused the comfort or sanctuary of her own home she deserved at least civility but of course you are welcome to come she added grudgingly blast the woman for putting her in a position where she had to say that maude smiled thank you they set out together well wrapped up with capes and shawls and of course strong winter boots grandmama closed the gate and immediately turned to the lane toward the sea in the summer it would be overhung with may blossom and the hedgerows deep with flowers now it was merely sparse and wet if the wind were cold enough after all her living in the desert and such places the very damp of it alone should be sufficient to make maude tire of the idea within half an hour at the most but maude was indecently healthy and used to walking it took grandmama all her breath and strength to keep up with her it was roughly a mile to the seashore itself and maude did not hesitate in her stride even once she seemed to take it for granted that the old lady would have no difficulty in keeping up which was extremely irritating and quite thoughtless of her grandmama was at least fifteen years older if not more and of course she was a lady not some creature who gallivanted all over the world and went around on her feet as if she had no carriage to her name the sky above them was wide and wild an aching void of blue with just a few clouds like mares tails shredded across the east on the horizon above the sea gulls dazzling white in the winter sun wheeled and soared in the air letting out their shrill cries like noisy children the wind rippled the grass flowerless and everything smelled of salt this is wonderful maude said happily i have never smelled anything so clean and so madly alive it is as if the whole world were full of laughter it is so good to be back in england i forgot how the spirit of the land is still so untamed in spite of all weve done i was in snave so short a time i had no chance to get out of the house she is not sane grandmama thought to herself grimly no wonder her family wants to get rid of her they breasted the rise and the whole panorama of the english channel opened up before them the long stretch of sand wind and water bleached till it gleamed bone pale in the light the surf broke in ranks of white waves hissing up the shore foaming like lace consuming themselves and rushing back again then a moment later they roared in inches higher never tired of the game the surface was cold unshadowed blue and it stretched out endlessly till it met the sky they both knew that france was not much more than twenty miles away but today the horizon was smudged and softened with mist that blurred the line maude stood with her head high wind unraveling the last of her hair from its pins and all but taking her shawl as well isnt it glorious she asked until this moment i had forgotten just how much i love the sea its width its shining endless possibilities its never the same two moments together it always looks the same to me grandmama said ungraciously how could anyone be so pointlessly joyous it was halfwitted cold wet and only too happy to drown you if you are foolish enough to give it the chance she finished maude burst into laughter she stood on the shore with her eyes closed her face lifted upward smiling and the wind billowing her shawl and her skirts grandmama swiveled around and stamped back onto the tussock grass or whatever it was that tangled her feet and started back along the lane the woman was as mad as a hatter it was unendurable that anyone should be expected to put up with her the following day was no better maude usurped every moment by regaling them with tales of boating on the nile buffalo standing in the water unnameable insects and tombs of kings who worshipped animals all very fashionable perhaps but disgusting both caroline and joshua took hospitality too far and pretended to be absorbed in it even encouraging her by asking questions of course the wretched woman obliged particularly at the dinner table and all through the roast beef the yorkshire pudding and the vegetables followed by apple charlotte and cream her captive audience was made to listen to descriptions of ruined gardens in persia i stood there in the sand of the stream splashing its way over the blue tiles most of them broken maude said smiling as her eyes misted with memory we were quite high up and i looked through the old trees toward the flat brown plain and saw those roads to the east toward samarkand to the west to baghdad and to the south to isfahan and my imagination soared into flight the very names are like an incantation as dusk drew around me and the pale colors deepened to gold and fire and that strange richness of porphyry in my mind i could hear the camel bells and see that odd lurching gait of theirs as they moved silently like dreams through the coming night bound on adventures of the soul isnt it hard sometimes caroline asked not in criticism but perhaps even sympathy oh yes often maude agreed you are thirsty your body aches and of course you can become so tired you would sell everything you possess for a good nights sleep but you know it will be worth it and it always is the pain is only for a moment the joy is forever and so it went on now and then she picked at the macadamia nuts she had brought to the table to share saying that her family had given them to her knowing her weakness for them only joshua accepted indigestible grandmama said growing more and more irritated by it all i know maude agreed i daresay i shall be sorry tonight but a little peppermint water will help i prefer not to be so foolish in the first place grandmama said icily do you have peppermint water caroline asked i can give you some if you wish i prefer to exercise a little selfcontrol in the first place grandmama answered as if the offer had been addressed to her maude smiled thank you but i have one dose and im sure that will be sufficient there are not so many nuts and i cant resist them she offered the dish to joshua again and he took two more and asked her to continue with her tales of persia grandmama tried to ignore it it seemed as if morning noon and night they were obliged to talk about or listen to accounts of some alien place and pretend to be interested she had been right in the very beginning this was going to be the worst christmas of her life she would never forgive emily for banishing her here it was a monstrous thing to have done she awoke in the morning to hear one of the maids screeching and banging on the door was there no end to the lack of consideration in this house she sat upright in bed just as the stupid girl burst through into the room face ashen white mouth wide open and eyes like holes in her head pull yourself together girl grandmama snapped at her what on earth is the matter with you stand up straight and stop sniveling explain yourself the girl made a masterful attempt took a gulping breath and spoke in between gasps please maam somethin terrible as appened miss barringtons stone cold dead in er bed she is nonsense grandmama replied she was perfectly all right at dinner yesterday evening shes probably just very deeply asleep no maam she int i knows dead when i sees it an when i touches it dead as a skinned sheep she is dont be impertinent and disrespectful grandmama climbed out of bed and the cold air assailed her flesh through her nightgown she grasped a robe and glared at the girl dont speak of your betters like farmyard animals she added for good measure i shall go and waken miss barrington myself where is tilly please maam shes got a terrible chill then leave her alone you may fetch miss barringtons tea and mine also fresh mind no leftovers yes maam the girl was happy to be relieved of responsibility and of having to tell the master and mistress herself she did not like the old lady nor did any of the other servants miserable old body let her do the finding and the telling grandmama marched along the corridor and banged with her closed hand on maudes door there was no answer as she had expected she would rather enjoy waking her up from a sound warm sleep for no good reason but a maids hysterics she pushed the door open went in and closed it behind her if there were going to be a bad tempered scene over the disturbance better to have it privately the room was light the curtains open miss barrington she said very clearly there was no sound and no movement from the figure in the bed miss barrington she repeated considerably more loudly and more peremptorily still nothing she walked over to the bed maude lay on her back her eyes were closed but her face was extremely pale even a little blue and she did not seem to be moving at all grandmama felt a tinge of alarm drat the woman she went a little closer and reached out to touch her ready to leap back and apologize if her eyes flew open and she demanded to know what on earth grandmama thought she was doing it was really inexcusable to place anyone in this embarrassing position gadding about in heathen places had addled her wits and all sense of being an englishwoman of any breeding at all the flesh that met her fingers was cold and quite stiff there could be no doubt whatsoever that the stupid maid was correct maude was quite dead and had been so probably most of the night grandmama staggered backward and sat down very hard on the bedroom chair suddenly finding it difficult to breathe this was terrible quite unfair first of all maude had arrived uninvited and disrupted everything now she had died and made it even worse they would have to spend christmas in mourning instead of reds and golds and carol singing feasting making merry they would all be in black mirrors covered whispering in corners and being miserable and afraid servants were always afraid when there was a death in the house most likely cook would give notice and then where would they be eating cold meats she stood up she had no reason to feel sad it would be absurd she had barely met maude barrington certainly she had not known her and there was nobody to feel sorry for her own family had not wanted her even at christmas for heavens sake perhaps they were tired of the endless stories about the bazaar at marrakech and the persian gardens or the boats on the nile and the tombs of kings who had lived and died a thousand years or more before the first christmas on earth and worshipped gods of their own making who had the heads of beasts but then her family could not have been nice people or they would not have turned maude away at christmas they would have listened with affectation of interest as caroline and joshua had done indeed as she had done herself she could imagine the water running over blue tiles in the sun she did not know what jasmine smelled like but no doubt it was beautiful and to give her credit maude had loved the english countryside just as much even in december it was wretched that she should have died among people who were veritable strangers taking her in out of charity because it was christmas her own had not loved or wanted her grandmama stood still in the middle of the bedroom with its flowered chintzes heavy furniture and dead ashes in the grate and a hideous reality took her breath away she herself was here out of charity as well unloved and unwanted by anyone else caroline and joshua were good people that was why they had taken her in not because they cared for her they did not love her they did not even like her no one did she knew that as well as she knew the feel of ice on her skin and the cold wind that cut to the bone she opened the door her fingers fumbling on the handle breath tight in her chest outside in the passage she walked unsteadily to the other wing of the house and joshua and carolines room she knocked more loudly than she had intended and when caroline opened the door to her she found her voice caught in her throat the maid came and told me maude died in the night she gulped really this much emotion was ridiculous she had barely known the woman i am afraid it is true i saw her myself caroline looked stricken but she could see from the old ladys face that there was no doubt at her age she had seen enough death not to mistake it you had better come into the dressing room and sit down caroline said gently ill have abby fetch you a cup of tea im so sorry you had to see her she held out her arm to support grandmama as she stumbled across the room and into the wide warm dressing room with its seats and wardrobes and one of carolines gowns already laid out for the day grandmama was angry with herself for being so close to weeping it must be the shock it was most unpleasant to grow old thank you she said grudgingly caroline helped her into one of the chairs and looked at her for a moment as if to make sure she were not going to faint then as grandmama glared back at her she turned and went out to set in motion all the endless arrangements that would have to be made the old lady sat still the maid brought her tea and poured it for her encouraging her to drink it it was refreshing spreading warmth from the inside but it changed nothing why was maude dead she had been in almost offensively good health the short time she had been here what had she died of certainly not old age not any kind of wasting away or weakening she could march like a soldier and eat like one too she closed her eyes and in her mind she saw maude again lying motionless in the bed she did not look terrified or disturbed or even in any pain but there had been an empty bottle on the table beside her probably the peppermint water the stupid woman had given herself indigestion guzzling all the nuts just as grandmama had told her she would why were some people so stupid no selfcontrol she drank the last of her tea and stood up the room swayed around her for a moment she took several deep breaths then went out of the dressing room and back along the corridor to maudes bedroom there was no one else in sight they must all be busy and caroline would be doing what she could to settle the staff staff always behaved erratically when someone died at least one maid would have fainted and someone would be having hysterics as if there were not enough to do she opened the door and slipped inside quickly closing it after her then turned to look yes she had been quite right there was an empty bottle on the bedside table she walked over and picked it up it said peppermint water on the label but just to be certain she took out the cork and sniffed it experimentally it was quite definitely peppermint clean and sharp filling her nose maude had brought it with her with only one dose left she must use it regularly stupid woman if she ate with any sense it would not be necessary curious that they should have it even in arabia or persia or wherever it was she had come from most recently and the label was in english too she looked at it again it was printed with the name and address of a local apothecary in rye just a few miles away around the dungeness headland but maude had said she had not left snave in fact not had the chance to go out at all so someone had given it to her with one dose in it presumably that was to treat the result of eating the macadamia nuts but one dose how very odd especially when they could have been all but certain that she would require it surely no household would be short of so ordinary a commodity especially over christmas when it could be guaranteed that people would overindulge there was something about it that was peculiar she picked up the bottle again and keeping it concealed in the folds of her skirt returned to her room where she hid it in the drawer with her underclothes then with tillys assistance she dressed in the darkest clothes she had with hernot quite black but a gray that in the winter light would pass for it she went downstairs to face the day caroline was in the withdrawing room before the fire joshua had gone to fetch the local doctor so that the necessary authorities could be satisfied are you all right mamainlaw she asked anxiously it is a terrible experience for you it was a much worse experience for maude grandmama replied with tart candor there were troubling thoughts in her mind but she was not quite certain exactly what they were she could not share them especially with caroline who had never detected anything as far as she knew she might even wish to avoid scandal and refuse even to consider it and maude deserved better than that perhaps it rested with mariah ellison and no one else to face the truth a few minutes later the doctor arrived and was taken upstairs heart failure he informed them when he came down again very sad she seemed in excellent health otherwise she was grandmama said quickly before anyone else could reply she was a world traveler walked miles rode horses and even camels she never spoke of any ailment at all it can come without warning the doctor said gently an attack that kills grandmama demanded she did not look as if she were in that kind of agony no he agreed with a slight frown i think it more likely that her heart simply slowed and then stopped slowed and then stopped grandmama said incredulously mamainlaw caroline remonstrated i think it may well have been peaceful the doctor said to grandmama if that is of comfort to you were you very fond of her she barely knew her caroline said tartly yes i was fond of her grandmama contradicted her equally tartly im very sorry the doctor was still gentle he turned to joshua if i can assist with arrangements of course i shall be happy to thank you joshua accepted we shall have to inform the rest of her family grandmama said loudly bedelia whateverhernameis i have been thinking how on earth i can write such a letter caroline acknowledged what to say that will make itbetter sounds absurd if i simply say that we are terribly sad to inform them will that be best she looked worried and sad would be no exaggeration there was a grief in her face that was quite genuine grandmamas mind was racing what was she allowing herself to think heart slowing down nuts that everyone knew were indigestible one dose of peppermint water had maude been murdered preposterous thats what came of allowing ones daughter to marry a policeman this was carolines fault if she had been a mother of the slightest responsibility at all she would never have permitted charlotte to do such a thing thomas pitt as a law enforcement official was not a suitable husband he had absolutely nothing to commend him except possibly height but if someone like pitt could solve a crime then most certainly grandmama could she would not be outwitted by a gamekeepers son half her age and if maude barrington had been murdered then mariah ellison would see that whoever had done so was brought to justice and answered to the last penny for such an act maude might have been an absurd woman and a complete nuisance but there was such a thing as justice grandmama felt as if a light and a warmth had gone out of the air and a heaviness settled in its place which she did not understand at all you should not write she said firmly to caroline it is far too dreadful and sudden a thing to put in a letter when apparently they live so near snake isnt it or something like that snave caroline corrected yes its about four or five miles away still well within the marsh do you think i should go over and tell them myself her face tightened yes of course youre right no grandmama said quickly i agree it should be done personally after all she was their sister however they treated her perhaps they will even feel an overwhelming guilt now she thought that extremely unlikely they were obviously quite shameless but i will go you have arrangements to make for christmas and joshua would miss you and i imagine i actually spent more time with maude than you did anyway i may be able to be of some comfort inform them a little of her last days she sounded sententious and she knew it she watched carolines expression acutely it would be a disaster if she were to come too in fact it would make the entire journey a waste of time in order to have a hope of accomplishing anything she would be obliged to tell caroline what she suspected with increasing certainty the more she considered it a spark of hope lit in carolines eyes but that is a great deal to ask of you mamainlaw of course she was dubious mariah ellison had never in her life been known to discomfort herself on someone elses behalf it was totally out of character but then caroline did not know her very well for nearly twenty years they had lived under the same roof and for all of it grandmama had lived a lie she had hidden her misery and selfloathing under the mantle of widowhood but how could she have done anything else the shame of her past continually burned inside her as if the physical pain were still raw and bleeding and she could barely walk she had had to lie for her sons sake and the lie had grown bigger and bigger inside her estranging her from everyone you did not ask it of me she said more sharply than she meant to i have offered it is the answer that makes the greatest sense should she add that caroline and joshua had made her welcome here and it was a small repayment no caroline would never believe that they had allowed her in she was not welcome nor was she stupid enough to imagine that she could be caroline would be suspicious i have nothing else to do she added more realistically i am bored that was believable she was certainly not about to admit to caroline of all people that she actually had admired maude barrington and felt a terrible anger that she should have been abandoned by her family and very possibly murdered by one of them she waited for carolines reaction she must not push too hard are you certain you would not mind caroline was still unconvinced quite certain she replied it is still a pleasant morning i shall compose myself have a little luncheon and then go that is if you can spare the carriage to take me there i doubt there is any other way of travel in this benighted spot a sudden idea occurred to her perhaps you fear that no caroline said quickly it is most generous of you and i think entirely appropriate it shows far more care than any letter could do no matter how sincere or well written of course the coachman will take you as you say the weather is still quite clement this afternoon would be perfect i do appreciate it grandmama smiled trying to show less triumph than she felt then i shall prepare myself she replied finishing her tea and rising to her feet she intended to remain at snave for as long as it required to discover the truth of maudes death and to prove it knowing alone was hardly adequate her visit might well stretch into several days she must succeed it was not a matter of sentimentality it was a matter of principle and she was a woman to whom such things mattered part two the journey was bumpy and cold even with a traveling rug wrapped around from the waist downward there was a bitter whining wind coming in off the sea though now and again it cleared the sky of clouds the light was chill and hard over the lowlying heath this was the invasion coast where julius caesar had landed fiftyfive years before the birth of christ no such thing as christmas then he had gone home and been murdered the following year that had been by his own people too those he had known and trusted for years eleven centuries after that william duke of normandy had landed with his knights and bowmen and killed king harold at hastings just around the coast from here somehow she was faintly satisfied with caesar coming rome had been the center of the world then england had been proud to be part of that empire but williams invasion still rankled which was silly since it was the best part of a thousand years ago but it was the last time england had been conquered and it annoyed her king philip of spain s armada would probably have landed here too if the wind had not destroyed it and napoleon bonaparte only he went to russia instead which had proved to be a bad idea was this a bad idea too arrogant stupid the result of a fevered imagination but how could she possibly turn back she would look like a complete fool to be disliked was bad enough to be despised as wellor worse pitiedwould be unendurable looking out of the carriage window as the sky darkened and the already lowering sun was smeared with gray she could not imagine why anyone would choose to be here if they did not have to except maude of course she thought these flat wide spaces and windraging skies were beautiful with their banners of cloud marsh grasses and air that always smelled of salt perhaps she did not remember it frozen solid or so shrouded in fog that you could not make out your hand in front of your face that was exactly what would be useful now some dreadful weather so she could not return to st mary in the marsh for several days she had undertaken a very big task and the more she thought of it the bigger it seemed and the more hopeless it was in a way a comfort that she could not turn back or she might have she had no idea what these people were like and not a shred of authority to back up what she was intending to do or to try it might have been better after all if charlotte were here she had meddled so often surely she had acquired a knack for it by now but she wasnt here grandmama would have to make the best of it by herself forward regardless she had intelligence and determination which might be enough ohand right on her side as well of course it was monstrous that maude barrington should have been murdered if she had been but whatever the truth of that they had still turned her away and at christmas that in itself was an unforgivable offense and on maudes behalf she felt it to the core the distance was covered far too quickly it was only a handful of miles forty minutes journey at a brisk trot far less as the crow flew every lane seemed to double back on itself as if to circumnavigate each field and cross every ditch twice the sky had cleared again and the light was long and low making the shivering grass bright and casting networks of shadow through the bare trees when the carriage drove into the tiny village of snave there was really only one big house the rest seemed to be cottages and farm buildings why in heavens name would anyone choose to live here it was no more than a widening in the road she took a deep breath to steady her nerves and waited with pounding heart for the coachman to open the door for her a dozen times she had rehearsed what she was going to say and now when she needed it it had gone completely out of her mind outside in the driveway the wind was like a knifeedge and she found herself rocking on her feet in the strength of it she grasped onto her cloak to keep it from flying away and stamped up to the front door leaning heavily on her stick the coachman pulled on the doorbell for her and stood back to wait it was answered almost immediately someone must have seen the carriage arrive an extremely ordinarylooking butler spoke to her civilly enough good afternoon she replied i am mrs mariah ellison mr joshua fielding with whom miss barrington was staying is my soninlaw the exact nature of their relationship could be explained later if necessary i am afraid i have extremely distressing news to bring to the family the sort of thing that can really only be told in person he looked alarmed oh dear please do come in mrs ellison he opened the door wider for her and backed away a little thank you she accepted may i ask you the favor of a little warmth and refreshment for my coachman also and perhaps water for the horses and at least in the meantime shelter from this rather cutting wind of course of course do you he swallowed do you have miss barrington with you no indeed not she replied following him inside after a brief glance behind her to make certain that the coachman had heard and would drive around to the stables and make himself known inside the hall she could not help but glance around it was not a house of london fashion nevertheless it was well furnished and extremely comfortable the floor was very old oak stained dark with possibly centuries of use the walls were paneled but lighter and hung with many paintings mercifully not the usual portraits of generations of forebears with expressions sour enough to turn the milk instead they were glowing still lifes of fruit and flowers and one or two pastoral scenes with enormous skies and restful cows at least someone had had very good taste it was also blessedly warm the family is all together maam the butler continued gravely would you perhaps prefer to tell mrs harcourt this news in private she is miss barringtons elder sister thank you she will know best how to inform the rest of the family the butler thereupon led her to a doorway off to the side he opened it to show her into a very agreeable room lighting the lamps for her and poking up a fire which had almost gone out he placed a couple of pieces of coal on it judiciously then excused himself and left he did not offer her tea perhaps he was too alarmed at the news even though he did not yet know what it was judging by his manner he expected a disgrace rather than a tragedywhich in itself was interesting she stood by the fire trying to warm herself her heart was still thumping and she had difficulty keeping her breath steady the door opened and a woman of great beauty came in closing it behind her she was perhaps sixty with auburn hair softening to rather more gold than copper and the clear fair skin that so often goes with such coloring her features were refined her eyes large and blue her mouth was perfectly shaped she bore little resemblance to maude it was not easy to think of them as sisters no one would have called maude beautiful what had made her face so attractive was intelligence and a capacity for feeling and imagination a soul of inner joy there was no echo of such things in this womans face in fact she looked afraid and angry her clothes were up to the moment in fashion and perfectly cut with the obligatory shoulders and high crowned sleeves good afternoon mrs ellison she said with cool politeness i am bedelia harcourt my butler tells me that you have driven all the way from st mary in the marsh with unfortunate news about my sister i hope she has notshe hesitated delicatelyembarrassed you grandmama felt a fury of emotion rise up inside her so violently she was overwhelmed by it almost giddy she wanted to rage at the woman even slap her perfect face however that would be absurd and the last way to detect anything she was quite sure pitt would not have been soso amateur im so sorry mrs harcourt she controlled herself with a greater effort than she had ever exercised over her temper before but the news i have is very bad indeed that is why i came personally rather than have anyone write a letter to you she watched intently to see if there were the slightest betraying foreknowledge in bedelias face and saw nothing i am afraid miss barrington passed away in her sleep last night i am so very sorry that at least was sincere she was amazed how sorry she was bedelia stared at her as if the words had no meaning that she could grasp passed away she repeated she put her hand up to her mouth maude but she never even said she was ill i should have known oh how terrible how very terrible i am sorry grandmama said yet again the maid knocked on my door i was in the same part of the house i went to her immediately but miss barrington must have died early in the night she wasquite cold we called a doctor naturally oh dear bedelia stepped backward and almost folded up into the chair behind her it was a collapse and yet it was oddly graceful poor maude how i wish she had said something she was tootoo reticenttoo brave grandmama remembered bedelias letter to joshua saying that she would not have maude in the house because they had other important guests and she found it extremely difficult not to remind her of that but to do so would make an enemy of her and then gaining any knowledge would be impossible really this detecting required greater sacrifices than she had foreseen i am deeply sorry for coming bearing such painful news she said instead i cannot imagine what a shock it must be for you i spent a little time with miss barrington and she was a delightful person and i admit that to me she appeared to be in the most excellent health i can understand your shock bedelia raised her eyes and looked up at her sheshe had lived abroad for some time in very harsh climates it must have affected her more than we appreciated possibly more than she appreciated herself grandmama sat down in the other chair opposite bedelia she spoke somewhat of marrakech and i believe persia and egypt also was she there for some time years bedelia replied straightening up since she left shortly before i was married and that is all but forty years ago she must have lived in a style far moreinjurious to her health than we had realized perhaps she did not fully know it herself perhaps not grandmama agreed then a thought occurred to her sitting here being pleasant and questioning nothing was unlikely to gain her any knowledge pitt would have done better or maybe she was only too well aware that she was not in good health and that is why she returned to england and her family the people to whom she was closest in the world bedelias magnificent eyes opened wider and were momentarily as hard and cold as the midwinter sea grandmama looked back at her without so much as blinking bedelia let out her breath slowly i suppose you could be right no such thought had crossed my mind like you i imagined her to be in the most excellent health it seems we were both tragically mistaken she said nothing that could lead you to expect this grandmama felt most discourteous to press the matter but justice came before good manners bedelia hesitated as if she could not make up her mind how to answer i can think of nothing she said after a moment i confess i am utterly devastated my mind does not seem to function at all i have never lost anyone soso very close to me before your parents are still alive grandmama said in amazement oh no bedelia corrected herself quickly i meant of my own generation my parents were excellent people of course but distant a sister isis very dear perhaps one only realizes it when they are gone the void left behind is greater than one can conceive beforehand you are overplaying it grandmama thought to herself you wouldnt even have her in the house outwardly she smiled it was a totally artificial expression you are very naturally suffering from shock she commiserated when ones own generation passes away it is a reminder of mortality the shadow of death across ones own path i remember how i felt when my husband died so she didthe most marvelous liberation of her life even if she could tell no one and had to pretend to be devastated and wear mourning for the rest of her days like the queen oh i am sorry bedelia said quickly you poor soul and now you have come all the way in this weather to bring this news to me personally and i am sitting here without even offering you tea my wits are completely scattered i still have my beloved arthur how can i complain of anything perhaps poor maude has gone to a better place she was never a happy creature i shall allow that to be my comfort she rose to her feet a trifle unsteadily thank you that is most kind of you grandmama accepted i must admit it has been a dreadful day and i am quite exhausted i am so glad you have your husband he will no doubt be a great strength to you one can be veryalone bedelias face softened in concern i can scarcely imagine it i have always been so fortunate this room is a little chill would you care to come through to the withdrawing room where it is far warmer we shall all take tea and consider what must be done of course if you prefer to return to st mary in the marsh as soon as possible we shall understand thank you grandmama said weakly i should be most grateful for as long a rest as i may take without imposing upon you and certainly tea would be very welcome she also rose to her feet as unsteadily as she could without risking actually falling over which would be ridiculous and only to be resorted to if all else failed bedelia led the way back across the hall to the withdrawing room and grandmama followed refusing to offer her arm to the younger woman she must be consistent about her own exhaustion or she might be disbelieved the withdrawing room was spacious also and the warmth from the enormous fire engulfed them both as soon as they entered there was too much furniture for more modern tastes carved sideboards heavily stuffed sofas and chairs with antimacassars on all of them there were also hardbacked chairs by the walls with fat leatherupholstered seats and slightly bowed legs and several footstools with tassels around the edges a brightly colored turkish rug was worn duller where possibly generations of feet had passed on the walls were embroidered samplers paintings of every variety large and small and several stuffed animals in glass cases even a case full of butterflies as dry as silk the colors were mostly hot golds browns and ocher reds caroline would have thought it oppressive grandmama was annoyed to find it very agreeable indeed almost familiar the people in it were entirely another matter she was introduced to them and bedelia was obliged to explain her presence to them my dears everyone turned to her this is mrs ellison who has most graciously come in person rather than send a message to tell us some terrible news she turned to grandmama i am certain you would prefer to sit down perhaps by the fire may i introduce you to my sister mrs agnes sullivan she indicated a woman whose superficial resemblance to her was explained by the relationship they appeared of a similar height although mrs sullivan did not rise as the three men had done her coloring had probably been similar to bedelias in youth but now it was scattered with more gray and the dark areas were duller her features were less finely chiseled and her expression apart from a certain sadness was much gentler her clothes although well cut managed to look commonplace how do you do mrs sullivan grandmama said formally and her husband mr zachary sullivan bedelia continued zachary bowed very slightly he was a slender man with brown hair now graying at the temples his face also was pleasant but marked by a certain sense of loss as if he had failed to achieve something that mattered to him too much to forget my daughterinlaw clara and my son randolph bedelia continued indicating in one sweep a young man whose coloring resembled hers although his features did not being considerably stronger and blunter the woman beside him was handsome enough in a powerful way darkhaired darkeyed and with brows rather too heavy bedelia smiled in spite of the occasion and my husband arthur she finished turning to a remarkably handsome man whose dark hair was now iron gray his eyes held a wit and life that captured attention instantly and his smile at grandmama showed perfect teeth welcome to snave mrs ellison he said warmly i am sorry it is distressing news that brings you may i offer you tea or would you prefer something more robust such as a glass of sherry i know it is early but the wind is miserable and you have to be chilled and perhaps tired also that is most generous of you and understanding grandmama made her way over to the fire and the seat zachary had left vacant for her whoever was guilty of having killed maude if indeed someone had she hoped it was not arthur harcourt what is it you have to tell us mrs ellison agnes sullivan asked with a tremor in her voice i am afraid miss barrington passed away in her sleep last night grandmama replied solemnly i believe it must have been peaceful and she seemed to be in excellent health and spirits right until the last moment she made no remark as to feeling unwell i am so sorry she glanced rapidly from one to the other of them trying to judge their reactions not that she was sure she could tell guilt from shock anyway or from grief for that matter zachary looked least surprised rather more puzzled as if he had not fully understood the meaning of her words agnes gave a gasp and her hand flew to her mouth in a gesture of stopping herself from crying out oddly like bedelias five minutes before she was very pale poor aunt maude randolph murmured im so sorry mama he looked at bedelia with concern clara harcourt said nothing perhaps as one who had barely known maude she felt it more appropriate not to speak arthur harcourts olive complexion was a muddy color neither white nor gray and his eyes seemed to have lost focus what was he feeling was that the horror of guilt now that the act was real and not merely dreamed i am sorry to bring you such news grandmama felt compelled to fill in the silence that seemed to choke the room the mere flickering of the fire sounded like a sheet torn in the wind itit was good of you agnes stammered such a terrible thing for youa guest in your housea virtual stranger suddenly a quite brilliant idea lit in grandmamas mind it went up like a flare of light she could almost feel the heat of it in her face oh not at all she said with feeling we talked for hours maude and i she was stunned at her own audacity she told me so much aboutoh of any number of things her feelings her experiences where she had been and the people she had met she waved her hands for emphasis believe me there are those i have been acquainted with for years about whom i know far less i have never made such excellent friends with anyone so rapidly or with such a natural affection that was a monstrous liewasnt it i must admit her trust in me was most heartwarming and that was a great deal the reason why i could not possibly allow anyone else to come to you now she hurried on i shall never forget maude or the confidence she placed in me regarding her life and its meaning it was an extraordinary feeling to have made such statements as if they were true as if she and maude had become instant and total friends she realized with a flutter of absurdity even of sweetness that it was not completely a lie maude had told her more of meaning in a couple of days than most of her acquaintances had in years although not the personal details she implied to her wretched family and grudgingly like the lancing of a boil she admitted that she had actually liked maude at least more than she had expected to considering the gross imposition of having her in carolines home for christmasuninvited bedelia stared at her incredulously really but you knew her for barely a dayor two but we had little to do but talk to each other she was fascinating at the luncheon and dinner table but even more so when we were out walking just the two of us i was very flattered that she should tell me so much i found myself speaking equally frankly to her and finding her most gentle and free from critical judgment it was a quitequite wonderful experience she added too quickly she said it purely to frighten them into believing she knew something of whoever it was who had murdered maude if indeed they had this was a deviousness added to her new grief she intended them to think her too desolate to consider the long carriage ride in the dark to go home again she also found to her dismay that she wished quite painfully that it were all true she had not been anything like such friends with maude nor had she confided in her the agonies of her own life the shame she had carried for years that she had not had the courage to leave her abusive husband and flee abroad as his first wife had done but it was startlingly sweet to think that maude might have sympathized rather than despising her for a coward as she despised herself there would have been nothing in the world more precious than a friend who understood but that was idiotic maude would never have submitted herself to such treatment then you grieve with us arthur said gently intruding across her thoughts please feel welcome here and do not consider the journey back to st mary tonight it will be dark quite soon and you must be both tired and distressed i am certain we can supply anything you might need such as a nightgown and toiletries and of course we have plenty of room since lord woollard has left the guest room is perfectly available clara put in quickly oh yes the guest who was staying with you before when poor maude arrived grandmama noted how very kind of you i really should be most grateful may i inform my coachman of your generosity so he can return to st mary it is possible mr and mrs fielding may require the coach tomorrow and of course if they do not hear they may worry that something has happened to me naturally arthur agreed would you care to tell him yourself or shall i have the butler inform him that would be very kind of you she accepted and ask him to tell mrs fielding of your graciousness and that i am perfectly welljustjust so grieved of course now the die was cast what on earth was she thinking of her stomach lurched and her mouth was dry she sipped the excellent sherry she had been given and allowed herself to bask for a moment in its delicious warmth she had embarked upon an adventure that is the way she must look at it she was still angry that maude had been treated so appallingly whether it included murder or not although she really thought it might and she was tired and grieved quite truly grieved maude had been too full of life to die too joyous in tasting every good experience to give it up so soon and no one should be unwanted by their own whatever the reason what was the reason who in this comfortable room with its roaring fire its silver tea tray and overstuffed sofas had wanted maude out of the house and why had the rest of them allowed it were they all guilty of something secrets so terrible they would kill to hide them they looked so perfectly innocuous even ordinary good heavens what wickedness can lie beneath a smiling exterior as commonplace as a slice of bread later a maid showed her to the spare bedroom it was warm and agreeably furnished with a fourposter bed heavy curtains of wine brocade another red turkish carpet and plenty of carved oak furniture a very fine ewer with painted flowers on it held fresh water there was a matching bowl for washing in and on the stand beside them plenty of thick towels with which to dry oneself there was no way of telling whether lord woollard or anyone else had occupied it recently but she would take the opportunity to see how many guest rooms there were so she would know whether maude could have been accommodated had they wished to she tiptoed along the corridor feeling like a sneak thief and cautiously tried the handles and opened the doors of the two other rooms they were both bedrooms and both presently unoccupied so much for that lie she returned to her own room her hands trembling a little and her knees weak she sat down then another idea struck her she opened the small cupboard beside the bed and found lavender water a vial with a couple of doses of laudanum and a full bottle of peppermint water the cork was jammed in tightly but more telling than that there was a film of dust over it it had not been purchased in the last couple of days since maude had left so much for being out of it that put a new complexion on maudes single dose had there been something else in it disguised by the pungent taste and the macadamia nuts to make her require it she closed the cupboard door and sat down heavily on the bed so far everything had gone quite marvelously but there was a great deal to do she must ascertain if maude had indeed been murdered if so by whom precisely howand it would hardly be complete if she did not also know why how could she possibly do all that before they politely sent her home pitt had no challenge of mere hours in which to solve his cases he went on for days sometimes even weeks and he had the authority to ask questions and demand answersnot necessarily true ones of course she was going to have to be much cleverer than he was it might not be quite so easy as she had assumed still so far so good and she was much too angry to give up however later on when in ordinary circumstances she would have been changing for dinner she was overwhelmed by the strangeness of her surroundings and all the events that had occurred in the last few days this time last week she had been in london with emily and jack as usual then she had been upheaved and sent to st mary in the marsh she had barely settled to accepting that when maude barrington had arrived that was almost accommodated and maude died without the slightest warning of any sort grandmama had been the only one to perceive that it might well not be natural but a crime the most appalling of all crimes and there was no one else but herself to find justice for it and here she was sitting quite alone in a house full of strangers at least one of whom she was now convinced was a murderer added to that she had not even fresh underclothes or a nightgown to sleep in they had offered to lend her something but all the women in the family were at least three or four inches taller than she was and thinner as well by more inches than that she must have taken leave of her wits certainly she could never admit any of this to caroline or anybody else theyd have her locked up there was a knock on the door and she started so violently she gulped and gave herself hiccups come in she said hiccuping again it was the housekeeper to judge from her black dress lace cap and the cluster of keys hanging from her waist she was short and rather stout exactly grandmamas own build good evening maam she said very agreeably im mrs ward the housekeeper it was very good of you to come personally with the sad news it must have inconvenienced you very much her death grieved me grandmama answered frankly relieved that it was a servant not one of the family to come and tell you personally seemed no more than the obvious thing to do she died among strangers even if they were people who liked her immediately and very much mrs wards face colored as if with considerable emotion she felt obliged to hide im very glad you did she said with a tremble in her voice she blinked rapidly you knew her grandmama deduced she made herself smile you must be grieving as well yes maam i was a maid here when i was a girl miss maude would have been sixteen then and mrs harcourt grandmama asked shamelessly she must detect time would not wait upon niceties oh eighteen she was and such a beauty as youve never seen grandmama looked at the housekeepers face there was no light in it she might respect bedelia harcourt even be loyal to her but she did not like her as she had maude that was something to remember servants said little good ones seldom said anything at all but they saw just about everything and mrs sullivan oh she was only thirteen just a schoolgirl all ink and books and clumsiness but full of enthusiasm poor girl the governess was always trying to get her to walk with the dictionary on her head but she kept losing it dictionary only for the weight of it miss agnes was perfectly accurate with her spelling but thats all in the past long ago she blinked rapidly again i just came to say that if there is anything i can get for you i should be happy to she had an air of sincerity as if her words were far more than mere politeness or even obedience to bedelias request thank you grandmama replied iim afraid i have none of the usual necessities with me dare she ask for a clean petticoat or chemise mrs ward looked embarrassed there is no difficulty in the least finding you toiletries mrs ellison i was thinking ofof more personal things if youll forgive my saying so it seems to me that you and i are much the same height if you would not be offended maam you might borrow one or two of mymy clothes it would give us the chance tocare for yours and return them to you she was very pink as if afraid already that she had presumed grandmama was suddenly touched by the womans kindness it seemed perfectly genuine and perhaps added to because she had cared for maude that is extremely generous of you to offer she said warmly i would be most grateful i have nothing but what i stand up in it was the last thing on my mind as i left this morning mrs ward colored even more but most obviously with relief then i shall see that they are brought thank you maam it is i who thank you grandmama said startled by her own courtesy and rather liking it it flashed into her mind that in a way maudes death had given her the opportunity to begin a new life herself even if only for a day or two no one here in snave knew her she could be anything she wanted to be it was a dizzying sort of freedom as if the past did not exist she suddenly smiled at the housekeeper again you have extraordinary courtesy she added mrs ward blushed again then she retreated fifteen minutes later she returned carrying two black dresses an assortment of undergarments and a nightgown with the assistance of one of the maids assigned to help her a most agreeable girl grandmama was able to dress for dinner in very respectable black bombazine well cut and modest in fashion as suited an elderly lady or a housekeeper she put on her own jet and pearl jewelry serving the double purpose of lifting the otherwise somberness of the attire and also being classic mourning jewelry she had a lot of such things from the period when she had made a great show of being a widow added to which they were really very pretty the seed pearls made them dainty she went down the stairs and across the hall to the withdrawing room she could hear lively conversation from inside amazingly so but she did not know the voices well enough to tell who they belonged to she opened the door and they all ceased instantly faces turned toward her the gentlemen rose to their feet and welcomed her the ladies looked at her made polite noises observed the change of gown but did not remark on it conversation resumed but stiffly with a solemnity completely different from that before she had come in i hope you are comfortable mrs ellison bedelia inquired very thank you grandmama replied sitting in one of the overstuffed chairs you are most generous again she smiled it is fortunate lord woollard left when he did clara observed grandmama wondered whether that remark was made to convince her that they had not had sufficient accommodation for more than one further guest at a time hence the need to turn maude away if so it was ridiculous she knew there were at least two more rooms unoccupied and family should be first most particularly when they were returning from a long time away indeed she said as if she were agreeing is he a close friend he will be very sad to hear of maudes demise he never met her bedelia said hastily i do not think we need to cloud his christmas by telling him bad news that can scarcely be of concern to him so they had entertained a mere acquaintance in maudes place i thought perhaps he was a relative grandmama murmured arthur smiled at her not at all a business acquaintance he sounded tired a strain in his voice a kind of bitter humor sent actually to assess whether i should be offered a peerage or not see if i am suitable of course you are suitable bedelia said sharply it is a formality and i daresay he was pleased to get out of the city and visit us for a day or two cities are sogrubby when it snows it isnt snowing he pointed out she ignored him at least his visit was not marred by tragedy or anything else clara added quietly i think it will snow agnes offered glancing toward the curtained windows the wind has changed and the clouds were very heavy before sunset grandmama was delighted snow might mean she could not leave tomorrow if it were sufficiently deep oh dear she said with pretended anxiety i did not notice i do hope i am not imposing on you not in the slightest bedelia assured her you say you were a friend of maudes even on so short an acquaintance how could you not be welcome of course agnes agreed again echoing bedelia you said maude spoke to you a great deal we saw her so little perhaps it would not be too distressing if we were to ask you what she told you of hertravels she looked hastily at bedelia that isif it is seemly to discuss i do not wish to embarrass you in any way at all what on earth was agnes imagining orgies around the campfire perhapsanother time arthur said shakily his voice hoarse if indeed it does snow you may be here with us long enough to he trailed off quite bedelia agreed without looking at him zachary apologized we are all overwrought he explained this is so unexpected we hardly know how tobelieve it we had no idea at all that she was ill randolph spoke for the first time since grandmama had come into the room she seemed soso very aliveindestructible you no more than met her my dear bedelia said coolly grandmama turned to her in surprise maude left before my son was born bedelia explained as if an intrusive question had been asked i think you do not really understand what anan extraordinary woman she was her use of the word extraordinary covered a multitude of possibilities most of them unpleasant grandmama did not reply she must detect the room was stiff with emotion grief envy anger above all fear did she detect the odor of scandal for heavens sake she was not achieving much she had no proof that it had been murder only a certainty in her own suspicious mind no she said softly of course i didnt know how extraordinary she was i spoke with her and listened to her memories and feelings so very intense a woman of remarkable observation and understanding but as you say it was only a short time i have no right to speak as if i knew her as you must have who grew up with her she let the irony of the fortyyear gap hang in the air i imagine when she was abroad she wrote wonderful letters there was an uncomfortable silence eloquent in itself so maude had not written to them in the passionate and lyrical way she had spoken at st mary or she had and for some reason they chose to ignore it she plowed on determined to stir up something that might be of meaning she had traveled as very few people men or women can have done a collection of her letters would be of interest to many who do not have such opportunities or such remarkable courage it would be a fitting monument to her do you not think agnes drew in her breath with a gasp and looked at bedelia she seemed helpless to answer without her approval a lifetime habit forged in childhood perhaps forged was the right word it seemed to fetter her like iron it made grandmama furious with agnes and with herself it was a cowards way and she knew cowardice intimately as one knows ones own face in the glass clara turned to her husband then her motherinlaw expecting some response but it was arthur who answered yes it would he agreed arthur bedelia said crisply i am sure mrs ellison means well but she really has no idea of the extent or the nature of maudestravels or the unsuitability of making them public have you arthur asked his dark brows raised i beg your pardon bedelia said coolly have you any idea of maudes travels he repeated i asked you if she wrote and you said that she didnt he did not accuse her of lying but the inevitability of the conclusion was heavy in the air she sat palefaced tightlipped it was clara who broke the silence do you think it will still be acceptable for us to have the matlocks and the willowbrooks to dine with us on christmas eve mamainlaw or to go to the watch night services at snargate or would people think us callous i dont suppose we can agnes said sadly i was looking forward to it too my dear she looked at clara not at zachary who had drawn in his breath to say something death does not alter christmas bedelia responded after a moments thought in fact christmas is the very time when it means least it is the season in which we celebrate the knowledge of eternity and the mercy of god of course we shall go to the watch night services in snargate and show a bond of courage and faith and solidarity as a family dont you think so my dear she looked at arthur again as if the previous conversation had never taken place it would seem very appropriate he answered to the room in general no discernible emotion in his voice oh im so glad agnes responded smiling and we have so much to be grateful for it seems only right grandmama thought it an odd remark for what were they so grateful just now the fact that lord woollard had considered arthur suitable for a peerage could that matter in the slightest compared with the death of a sister of course it could maude had not been home for forty years and they had considered her absent permanently she had chosen to return at a highly inconvenient time otherwise they would not have dispatched her to stay with joshua and caroline was there really some family scandal she might speak of and ruin such a high ambition any further speculation on that subject was interrupted by the announcement of dinner the meal was excellent and richer than anything caroline had offered conversation at the table centered on other arrangements for christmas and how they might be affected either by maudes death or the weather they skirted around the issue of a funeral and when or where it should be conducted but it hung in the air unsaid like a coldness as if someone had left a door open grandmama stopped listening to the words and concentrated instead upon the intonation of voices the ease or tension in hands and above all the expression in a face when the person imagined they were unnoticed clara appeared relieved as if an anxiety had passed perhaps the visit of lord woollard had made her nervous she might be less confident than she appeared had she been socially clumsy or otherwise unacceptable since her husband was the only heir that would have been a serious problem perhaps she came from a more ordinary background than the rest of the family and had previously made errors or her mother was one of those women ruthlessly ambitious for their daughters and no achievement was great enough zachary did not say a great deal and she saw him look at bedelia more often than she would have expected there was an admiration in him a sense of awe for her beauty she was certainly far better looking than poor agnes she had a glamour an air of femininity mystery almost power that confidence gave her grandmama watched her as well and in spite of herself what was it like to be beautiful there were not many women so blessed certainly she had never been so herself and neither were agnes nor maude clara was no more than handsome luminous heartstopping beauty was very rare even bedelia did not have that grandmama had seen it once or twice and one did not forget it emilys greataunt by her first marriage lady vespasia cumminggould had possessed it even in advanced years it was still there unmistakable as a familiar songone note and the heart brings it all back why did zachary still watch bedelia ordinary masculine fascination with beauty or good manners because this was her house arthur did not watch her the same way agnes looked at both of them and seemed to see it also there was a sadness in her eyes was it an awareness that she could never compete perhaps that was the sense of failure grandmama detected and understood she knew it well a plain face no magic in the eyes or the voice above all the knowledge of not being loved envy even hate over the years why simply beauty could it matter so much very few women were more than pleasing in their youth and perhaps gaining a little sense of style or even better wit in their maturity and she had not been left on the shelf but sisters did compete it was inevitable was money also involved and now a peerage too the conversation continued around her concern for those who would be alone over the christmas period and possibly in need those whose health was poor anyone to whom they could or should give a small gift would the weather deteriorate do you often get shut in by the snow grandmama inquired with interest it must be a rather frightening experience not at all zachary assured her we will be quite safe we have food and fuel and it will not be for more than a day or two but please dont concern yourself if it happens at all it will be in january and february you know the old saying as the days get longer the weather gets stronger he smiled transforming his face from its earlier gravity to a surprising warmth she smiled back enjoying the sudden and inexplicable sense of freedom it gave her i have found it very often true she agreed and i am sure you are quite wise enough to guard against any possible need it was rather more such things as someone falling ill that i was thinking of but i daresay that is a difficulty for all people who live in the wilder and more beautiful country areas she continued being charming it was like having a new toy she turned to bedelia you know mrs harcourt i would never have seen romney marsh as anything more than a very flat coast rather vulnerable with a permanent smell of the sea until i met miss barrington but on our walks i saw how she was aware of so much more she spoke of the wildflowers in the spring and the birds she knew the names of a great many of them you know and their habits the water birds especially she was inventing at least part of this as she was going along it was exhilarating the surprised and anxious faces around her increased her sense of adventure she drew in her breath and went on i had never realized before how perfectly everything fits into its own place in the scheme of things really bedelia said her voice almost expressionless it is an interest she had developed recently in fact since she left england altogether she must have gained it from reading except perhaps in her early childhood she never saw them in life she did not go walking a great deal grandmama asked innocently she was only here for a matter of hours bedelia informed her she did not have time to go out at all surely she told you that she arrived without giving us any prior warning and we were thus unable to accommodate her do you imagine we would have asked joshua fielding to offer his hospitality were it possible for us to do so ourselves so she was correct maude had been given the single dose of peppermint water by someone in the house she must think very rapidly better to retreat than to cause an argument much as the words stuck in her mouth was it better to be considered a fool and of no danger at all or as a highly knowledgeable woman who needed to be watched she must decide immediately she could not be both and time was short bedelia was waiting they were all looking at her a brilliant idea flashed into her mind she could be both apparently stupid and extremely cleverif she affected to be a little deaf she drew in a breath to say so and apologize for it then just before she did she had another thought of infinitely greater clarity if she were to claim to be deaf then any evidence she gained could later be denied she smothered her pride a thing she had never done before except on that unmentionable occasion when her own past had loomed up like a corpse out of the river but if she had survived that then nothing this family could do to her would ever make a dent in her inner steel you are quite right she said meekly i had forgotten she had been away so very long if she had no interest before then it must have been acquired entirely by reading perhaps she was homesick for the wide skies the salt wind and the sound of the sea there was a flash of victory in bedelias eyes a knowledge of her own power grandmama felt it as keenly as if it had been a charge of electricity between them such as one is pricked by at times if one touches certain metals when the air is very dry she had read that predatory animals scented blood in the same way and it gave her a shiver of fear and intense knowledge of vulnerability which made life suddenly both sweet and fragile was that what agnes had known all her life or was she being fanciful what about maude was she crushed too was that really why she had left england and everything familiar that she unquestionably loved and gone to all kinds of ancient barbaric and splendid other lands where she neither knew anyone nor was known a desperate escape perhaps there was very much more here beneath the surface than she had dreamed even when she had stood in the bedroom beside maudes dead body this morning bedelia was smiling perhaps she was she agreed aloud but she could have chosen to live by the sea if she had wished to poor maude had very little sense of how to make decisions even the right ones it is most unfortunate we were hoping to go out far more later when she returned agnes glanced at bedelia in the new yearoror whenever we were certain she trailed off knowing that somehow she had put her foot in it grandmama stared at her willing her to explain bedelia sighed impatiently agnes dear you really do let your tongue run away with you she turned to grandmama in exasperation you had better know the truth mrs ellison or you will feel that we are a cruel family and it is not so at all maude is our middle sister and she was always unruly the one who had to draw attention to herself by being different it happens in families at times the eldest have attention because they are first the youngest because they are the babies the middle ones feel left out and they show off to use a common term maude was not a showoff arthur corrected her she was an enthusiast whatever she did it was with a whole heart there was nothing affected or contrived in her bedelia did not look away from grandmama my husband is a man of extraordinarily generous spirit it is his work for the less fortunate for which her majesty is offering him a peerage i am immensely proud of him because it is for the noblest of reasons nothing tawdry like finance or political support she smiled patiently but occasionally his judgment is rather more kind than accurate it was apparent as soon as she arrived that maude had traveled in places where manners and customs are quite different from ours im afraid that even her language was not such that we could subject our other guests to herher more colorful behavior we knew that joshua being on the stage might be more tolerant of eccentricity of course we could not know that you also would be staying with him and if maude has shocked you or made you uncomfortable then we are guilty of having caused that and on behalf of all of us i apologize our inconsideration in that regard is what has been disturbing agnes agnes smiled but there were tears in her eyes i see grandmama tried to imagine maude as an embarrassment so severe as to be intolerable she did not know lord woollard perhaps he was insufferably pompous there certainly were people so consumed by their own emotional inadequacy and imagined virtue as to take offense at the slightest thing and the maude she had met would find a certain delight in puncturing the absurd the selfimportant and above all the false it would be a scene to be avoided if arthur harcourt had done as much for others as bedelia said then he was deserving of recognition and more importantly the added power to do more good that such an accolade would offer him im sure you do bedelia said gently all families seem to have their difficult members zachary added ruefully grandmama had an unpleasant feeling that in her family it was she herself although caroline was now giving her some competition marrying an actor so much younger than herself and there was charlotte of course and her policeman a short while later the ladies retired to the withdrawing room and she learned little more of interest she considered inquiring after peoples health but could think of no way of approaching the subject without being catastrophically obvious she was extremely tired it had been one of the longest days of her life beginning with tragedy and horror and ending with mystery and the growing certainty in her mind that someone in this house had altered maudes medicine exactly how it had been achieved and with what she had yet to ascertain even more important to her was why maude had been successfully sent to stay with joshua lord woollard had been and gone what was the element so precious or so terrible that it was worth murder she excused herself thanked them again for their hospitality and went up to her room please heaven it would snow tonight or in some other way make it impossible for her to leave there was so much she had to learn this detection matter was more difficult than she had supposed and against her will she was being drawn into other peoples lives she cared about maude there was no use denying that anymore she disliked bedelia and had felt the strength of her power she was sorry for agnes without knowing why arthur intrigued her in spite of all that was said about him his success and his goodness to others she felt an unnamed emotion that disturbed her it did not fit in randolph and clara were still too undefined except that clara had great social ambitions could that possibly be enough to inspire murder it was all swirling around in her head as she put on the housekeepers nightgown and climbed into the bed intending to weigh it all more carefully and instead fell asleep almost immediately the following morning she slept in and was embarrassed to waken with the chambermaid standing at the foot of the bed with tea on a tray and an inquiry as to what she would care for for breakfast would two lightly boiled eggs and some toast be possible indeed it would with the greatest pleasure after enjoying it in spite of the circumstances and the thoughts that occupied her mind she rose and washed she dressed in the housekeepers other black gown again with the chambermaids assistance and found she rather enjoyed talking to her then she made her way downstairs she met agnes in the hall she was wearing outdoor clothes and apparently about to leave good morning mrs ellison she said hastily i do hope you slept well such a distressing time for you i hope you were comfortable and warm enough i have never been more comfortable grandmama replied with honesty you are most generous i do not believe i stirred all night are you about to go out yes i have a few jars of jams and chutneys to take to various friends nearby villages you know i am afraid the weather does not look promising grandmama had another burst of illumination of double worth she could catch agnes alone unguarded by bedelia and if the weather did not oblige by snowing them in she could affect to have caught a slight chill to prevent her returning to st mary in the marsh tomorrow or worse this afternoon may i come with you she asked eagerly i am not here beyond this brief christmas period and i would so love to see a little of the outside it is quite unlike london so much widerand cleaner the city always seems grubby when the snow has been trodden and everything is stained with smoke from so many chimney fires but of course agnes said with pleasure it would be most agreeable to have your company but it will be cold you must wear your cape and i will have another traveling rug brought for you grandmama thanked her sincerely and ten minutes later they were sitting side by side in the pony trap with agnes holding the reins it was as agnes had warned extremely cold the wind had the kiss of ice on it clouds streamed in from the seaward side and the marsh grasses bent and rippled as if passed over by an unseen hand the trap was well sprung and the pony inexplicably enthusiastic but it was still not the most comfortable ride they left the village of snave and moved quite quickly in what grandmama presumed to be a westerly direction and slightly south it was all a matter of judging the wind and the smell of the sea agnes began by companionably telling her something about the village of snargate and its inhabitants and then explaining that from snargate they would continue to appledore then if there were time to the isle of oxney as well which of course was not an island at all simply a rise from the flat land of the coast however if there were floods then it would live up to its name grandmama thought that possibly the history of these ancient villages might be quite interesting but at present it was the history of the barrington sisters that demanded her entire attention she must direct agnes to it and not waste precious time of which there was far too little as it was you speak of the land so knowledgeably she began with flattery it always worked your family has its roots here you belong here people always wanted to belong no one wished to be a stranger as maude must have been all her adult life oh yes agnes said warmly my greatgreatgrandfather inherited the house and added to it a hundred and fifty years ago it is bedelias of course we had no brothers unfortunately and then it will be randolph s but then it would have been his anyway because i have no sons either she turned her face forward so grandmama could see no more than a fleeting moment of her expression and the moisture in her eyes could have been from the east wind it was certainly cold enough you are fortunate to have sisters grandmama told her i grew up with only brothers and they were a great deal older than i too much so to be my friends im sorry there was no expression in agness face no lift of memory that made her smile grandmama lied again you must have christmas memories and traditions in the family she looked at the baskets of jars covered with dainty cloth and tied with ribbons you do those so very well more flattery even if true we always have agnes answered still no lift in her voice grandmama continued to probe and finally drew a few more specific answers in heavens name it was hard work did pitt always have such a struggle it was worse than pulling out teeth but she was determined justice might depend upon this i imagine you all did this together when you were girls she said with what she knew was tactlessness or perhaps you were courting i can think of nothing more romantic had she gone too far zachary did with bedelia agnes replied it was this season and terribly cold several of the streams froze that year i remember it she remained looking forward her expression bleak as the wind pulled strands of her hair loose and whipped them across her face grandmama was momentarily lost zachary was agness husband she would dearly like to let this go she heard pain in agness voice and old griefs were none of her affair but maude was dead she could not feel the sting of salt in the air or see the wild flight of seabirds skittering down the wind and whirling back up again high and wide wheeling far out over the land mrs harcourt is very beautiful even now she tested the verbal knife she must have been quite breathtaking then i have a distant relative who was like that yes agness hands were tight on the reins the leather of her gloves strained half the young men in the county were in love with her and she chose mr harcourt it was a stupid question and probably entirely irrelevant to maudes death but she had nothing better to pursue yes for a moment it seemed as if agnes was going to say no more then she drew in her breath wanting to speak after all although it was not so simple as that really i suppose things seldom are grandmama said sympathetically and even less often are they what they seem to be on the surface people make very hasty judgments sometimes they are the easiest agnes agreed she negotiated a sharp turn in the lane and grandmama saw the village of snargate ahead this was proving very difficult indeed they were almost at the village green the inn the church with ancient yew trees and graveyard and the lychgate covered with the bare vines of honeysuckle lay beyond they made their first delivery of christmas fare and the second and then left snargate and continued the short distance to appledore i suppose there is always speculation where there are sisters and one is as beautiful as bedelia grandmama said as soon as they were on their way again blankets carefully tucked around shivering knees the sky cleared a little and banners of blue appeared bright between the clouds as if deliberately hurting herself agnes told the story maude didnt know about it not really she was away that christmas aunt josephine was ill and alone and maude went to look after her zachary was courting bedelia he was so in love with her they went everywhere together to the balls and the dinners and the theater in dover even through the snow that was when the queen was young and happy and prince albert was so dashing we saw drawings of them in the newspapers it was before the crimean war i expect you remember i do it had been a nightmare time her own husband had been alive charming persuasive privately brutal demanding things no decent woman ever imagined she could still taste the wool of the carpet in her mouth and remember his weight on top of her forcing her down in public it had been all contentment the glamour of endless crinoline skirts on a figure unrecognizable now in her too ample waist and hips and at home a hell she could not think of without a hot shame making her feel sick how could she of all people criticize anyones cowardice it stirred in her rage and pity and a hunger to avenge it so sharp she could feel it the bitter wind was almost a comfort but agnes was lost in her own passions and did not even glance to see if her companion was with her mentally then arthur harcourt arrived she went on i think it was early march the beginning of spring the days were getting longer and everything was coming into bud arthur was not only handsome but charming and funny and kind he could make us all laugh so hard we were embarrassed to be caught at it one did not enjoy things so openly then it was thought to be unladylike he didnt care and he could dance like an angel everything seemed worth doing when he was with us grandmama thought she could guess the rest bedelia fell out of love with zachary and in love with arthur who was a much better catch a far better catch poor zachary was cast aside and in time took second best the duller plainer agnes and agnes accepted without thinking grandmama reached across and put her hand on agness where it rested above the edge of the rug holding the reins tightly she did not say anything it was a silent understanding a pity without words for a few moments they rode through the lanes toward appledore in silence then suddenly agnes spoke again of course we thought then that bedelia and arthur would marry it seemed inevitable yes it would grandmama agreed but aunt josephine died and maude came back home everything changed agnes said indeed grandmama had almost forgotten about maude how arthur and maude just agnes gave a tiny shrug just seemed toto fall so in love it was as if bedelia ceased to exist it didnt seem like a flirtation bedelia wasunable to believe it at first i mean maude of all people goodness knows what she told him told him grandmama said before she could stop herself well she must have told him something terrible about bedelia to have caused him to abandon her like that and of course untrue jealousy isa very unkind thing it eats the heart out of you if you allow it to oh that is true grandmama agreed sincerely it can be an instant passion or a slowgrowing one but it is certainly deadly but it seems as if arthur saw through it whatever it was she hated saying that because it blamed maude and she was far from prepared to do that but she must keep agnes telling the story oh yes agnes agreed it lasted perhaps a month then arthur came to his senses he realized that he truly loved bedelia he broke off the silly business with maude and asked bedelia to marry him of course she forgave him and accepted i see she did not see at all three sisters two men someone had to have lost grandmama resented that it should have been maude or had it really been all of them no one truly finding what they hungered for and maude she said quietly maude was heartbroken agnes replied her voice catching in her throat she turned away as if there were something on the other side of the pony trap that required her attention although there was nothing but the grasses and the sea wind and the marsh stretching out to the horizon she simply ran away god knows where she went but about a month later we received a postcard from granada in the south of spain there were only a few words on it i remember going to africa will probably stay maude and bedelia had said she never wrote again was that true until she returned a few days ago grandmama asked aloud thats right why did she come back now after all these years agnes shook her head and rubbed her hand over her eyes perhaps she knew she was dying maybe she wanted to be buried here people do want to be buried in their own land i mean their own earth did she say anything like that she did say something about death i cant recall exactly what it was but she was sad that much was clear ii wish i had listened my mind was on lord woollards visit and how anxious we all were that it should go well guilt was heavy in her voice and the misery of her face arthur really does deserve recognition you know and the amount of good he could do with it would be enormous and you were concerned that maudes behavior would be inappropriate agnes glanced at grandmama then away again a mixture of impatience and shame in her face she had been living in extraordinary places for the last forty years mrs ellison places where people eat with their fingers have no running water where women do things thati would rather not even think of let alone speak about i thought women in the middle east were rather more modest than we are here in england grandmama said thoughtfully at least that was the impression i gained from maude they keep to their own apartments and dont speak to men other than those in their own families their clothing is certainly most decorous agnes was frowning but maude went unaccompanied wandering around like alike a man she exclaimed who knows what happened to her her taste is highly questionable even her virtue im afraid i beg your pardon grandmama said in angry disbelief then realized she had gone too far she must find an escape very quickly im so sorry she apologized the words all but choking her i felt so close to maude because she confided in me and i in her that i am more offended than i have any right to be at the thought that someone who did not know her at all should question her virtue it is quite unreasonable and even impertinent of me please forgive me she was your sister not mine and it is your right to defend her i did not mean to presume she watched agness face intently as if she were eager for pardon she was actually extremely eager to see agness reaction agness hands froze on the reins and she stared ahead even though they were now very close to the village of appledore and she should have been slowing the pony it is not presumptuous she said her face scarlet then she stopped again still uncertain im sure you meant it only kindly perhaps we live too much in the past imagine too much about maude grandmama had to ask she was overwhelmingly aware of the misery in agnes and the knowledge that she would always be second choice she was sorry for itshe even understood itbut it did not excuse lies or answer justice now they were passing the village church and she saw the festive wreaths on doors and a group of children ran past them shouting greetings what happens to people that they become bitter and why do we not turn to each other and help we all walk a common path from cradle to grave just stumble over different stones in it trip in different holes or drown in different puddles agnes had not answered her i understand grandmama said impulsively you had old memories of maude once taking arthurs affection and you were afraid she would say or do something outrageous now perhaps even spoil his chances of receiving the peerage so you made sure she could not be in the house when lord woollard was here and now that she has died you feel guilty and of course it is too late to do anything about it agnes turned to face her eyes wide and hurt she said nothing but acknowledgment was as clear in her as if she had admitted it in so many words they delivered the jams and chutneys in appledore and went on to the isle of oxney the rising wind was cruelly cold the horizon was blurred with gathering clouds and there was a smell of snow in the air perhaps it would not be necessary to feign a chill after all although how deep the snow would have to be to make travel inadvisable she did not know st mary in the marsh was only five miles away not even an hours journey maybe a few sneezes and a complaint of a sore throat would be better she had barely scratched the surface of what there was to detect there were emotions old loves and jealousies old wrongs but what had caused them to erupt now pitt had said that there was always a reason why violence occurred at a particular time some event that had sparked the final act why had maude come home why not before in all the forty years of her exile or next year why at christmas not summer when the weather would be infinitely more agreeable whose death was it that she had been referring to surely not her own on the ride back to snave she deliberately spoke only of christmas arrangements what to eat goose naturally and plenty of vegetablesroasted boiled baked and with added sauces after there would be a christmas pudding rich with dried fruit and covered with brandied butter and flamed at the time of serving and covered with cream but before that there were literally dozens of other things to think of and prepare cakes pastries mince pies sweets gingerbread and all manner of drinks both with and without alcohol and naturally a wealth of decoration wreaths and boughs garlands golden angels colored bows flowers made of silk and ribbon pine cones painted with gold little dolls to be given afterward to the poor of the village there were presents to be made skittles painted as wooden soldiers pincushions ornaments handmade and decorated with lace and beads and colored braid the hours of work could hardly be counted they spoke of them together and remembered about their own childhood christmases before the advent of cards and trees and such modern ideas that so much added to the general happiness after luncheon grandmama took a brief walk in the garden she needed time alone to think detection required order in the mind there were facts to be considered and weighed there was little to see beyond a welltended neatness and very obvious architectural grace and skill there were arbors gravel walks herbaceous borders carefully weeded perennials cleared of dead foliage a flight of steps that curved up to a pergola covered with the skeletons of roses and finally a less formal woodland overlooking the open marsh it was very wet underfoot and rather muddy the long grasses soaked the hem of her skirt but it was inevitable in spring this would be beautiful with flowers snowdrops primroses in all likelihood wood anemones certainly bluebells wild daisies campion perhaps narcissi with their piercingly sweet scent she saw two or three crowns of foxglove leaves she loved their elegant spires in purples or white one of them looked a little ragged as if an animal had cropped it except that no animal would eat foxgloveit was poisonous creatures always seemed to know it slowed the heart it was used by doctors for people whose hearts raced digitalis she froze racedslowed stopped was that it the answer she was searching for she bent and looked at the leaves again there was no earthly way of proving it but she was perfectly sure someone had picked two or three leaves the broken ends were visible she stood up again slowly how could she find out who it must have been the day maude was here had it been wet or dry never dry in winter in this wood but if freezing then the ice would prevent anyone getting as wet as she was now or as muddy four days before joshua had received bedelias letter think windy the noise of it howling in the eaves was clear in her mind it had irritated her unbearably and relatively mild who had come in with muddy boots a dress soaked at the hems a ladies maid would know but how to ask her she turned and walked briskly back into the house and went to find mrs ward im so sorry she apologized profusely startled that she meant it without any pretense at all i went walking in the garden and became distracted with the beauty of it it is lovely isnt it mrs ward agreed thats mrs harcourts skill mrs sullivan can paint a picture of a flower thats both lovely and correct but its mrs harcourt who plans the garden itself what a gift grandmama said and one from which we all benefit but i am afraid that i have thoroughly muddied both my boots and the hem of your dress it was deeply careless of me and i regret it now oh dont worry it happens all the time mrs ward dismissed it your own dress is quite clean and dry and nora can clean this again in no time im sure it doesnt happen to everybody grandmama told her i cannot imagine mrs harcourt being so inelegant or so thoughtless you cannot name me the last time she did this mrs ward smiled certainly i can the very day miss maude came home went looking for some nice branches to add to the flowers in the hall woodland branches can be most graceful in a vase please dont think of it mrs ellison really grandmamas heart was racing so it was bedelia but she should be certain i expect she and clara were in quite a state with lord woollard expected as well certainly she also went out on an errand and came back as muddy as you like poor nora was beside herself then mrs sullivan the day after at least i think it was ill find nora and send her up to you thank you you are most considerate grandmama left with her mind whirling so who had boiled up the leaves where how could she find that out perhaps they were simply crushed and steeped as one makes a cup of tea that could have been any of them she must think morepay attention and be careful in the afternoon grandmama offered to help bedelia in some of the lastminute preparations of course cook would see to the meal itself and most of the other things that required the use of the kitchen but there was still much sewing to be done lavender bags that were not finished ornamental roses to be made and definitely more decorations for the great tree in the hall i could have sworn that we had more than this last year bedelia said looking at it with dismay it seems almost bare dont you think mrs ellison grandmama regarded the huge tree its dark green needles still fresh and scented with earth and pine it was liberally decorated with ribbons and ornaments and there was a handsome pile of parcels beneath and smaller ones with lace and flowers hanging from the branches it was far from bare but certainly there were places where more could be hung it was important that she make herself necessary it is very handsome she answered judiciously but you are quite right of course there are still one or two places to be filled in i am sure it would not be difficult to find the materials to make a couple of dozen more ornaments one needs only a childs ball perhaps two of different sizes would be even better paste and as many different colors of paper as possible beads dried flowers ribbon lace whatever else can be spared that is pretty sometimes an old gown can provide an amazing variety of bits and pieces its not difficult to make tiny dolls or angels she had rather run away with herself but it was all in the growingly desperate cause of detection very definite ideas were crystallizing in her mind but she needed more time christmas was supposed to be a time of forgiveness but surely there could be no healing without honor no real peace without change of heart and no change without truth it is not a lack of materials bedelia told her i have not the time and i doubt the maids have the skill i should be happy to help you if i may grandmama offered she had not been so courteous in years and in spite of her amusement at herself she was rather enjoying it it was like a step outside her own life a curious freedom from the expectations of others or the chains of past failure i should be delighted to contribute something to such a glorious tree she continued eagerly and also a sort of family tradition the barringtons have been in this village for so many generations there are bound to be scores of people who will call in to wish you seasons greetings and share your hospitality that was certain tradesmen always paid their respects this time of year and partook of mince pies candied fruit and nuts and of course a cup of punch bedelia accepted and half an hour later they were sitting in the sewing room at opposite sides of the table cannibalizing an old evening gown cutting off beads braid fine silk and velvet pieces and the paler ribbons and lace from two old petticoats that had also been found there is too much dark red bedelia said critically all of the silk and velvet is the same shade that is true grandmama agreed what we really need is something else bright in a completely different tone she looked at bedelia with a frown i have a very daring idea perhaps you would find it offensive but i have to ask if it grieves you i apologize in advance good gracious bedelia was intrigued i am not easily shocked what is this idea maude said that she traveled in many strange and exotic places a faint distaste flashed in bedelias eyes but she masked it is that helpful no doubt she wore somestrange clothes grandmama said tentatively possibly of colors we would not choose bedelia understood instantly and her face lit with pleasure oh but of course how clever of you yes certainly some of them might be cut up for the most excellent christmas ornaments grandmama felt a chill at the thought of cutting up any of maudes clothes things she had worn in the places that she had obviously loved so far from home she might have stood in the sunset in some persian garden and smelled the perfume of strange trees and the wind off the desert and looked up to unimaginable stars or perhaps there would be scarves of silk she had bought at a noisy multitudinous bazaar in marrakech or some such city they should all be treated with tenderness folded to keep in the odor of spices and strange fruit oils and leathers and the smoke from the campfires you are so clever mrs ellison bedelia was saying of course most of her things are here and we have only to unpack them and it is unlikely that any of them are things that anyone else would wear i really do not care to offer them even to the poor it would be disrespectful grandmama filled in meaning it and enjoying forcing bedelia to agree she hated herself for doing it but truth required some strange sacrifices this way they will be totally anonymous and give pleasure for years to come forgive me maude she thought to herself detection is not easy and i refuse to fail she stood up i suppose we should begin see what we can find that was crass she had not been invited to look into maudes effects but she was most curious to see if there was anything helpful no one else who knew that she had been murdered would ever have such an opportunity if bedelia were offended she did not show it upstairs in the box room where the luggage had been stored they set about opening the two trunks maude had brought back with her grandmama found herself with the one packed with ordinary blouses and skirts underclothes and sensible rather scuffed boots they were of moderate quality linen cotton and some of raw unbleached wool she wondered in what marvelous places maude had worn these what had she seen what emotions of joy pain or loneliness had she felt had she longed for home or had she been at home wherever she was with friends even people who loved her she glanced across at bedelia and studied her face as she pulled out a length of silk striped in purples scarlets crimsons and tawny golds mingled with a hot pink she drew in her breath sharply at first it seemed to be pleasure excitement even a kind of longing then her mouth hardened and there was hurt in her eyes good heavens above she said sharply what on earth could she have worn this for whatever is it she shook it out until it billowed and appeared to be a sheet with very little distinctive shape one can only hope it was a gift and not something she purchased for herself no woman could wear such a thing even at twenty never mind at maudes age she would have looked like something out of the circus she started to laugh then stopped abruptly a very good thing we looked at this first mrs ellison if the servants had seen it we should be the talk of the village grandmama felt her fury flare up and if she had dared she would have lashed out verbally in maudes defense but there were bigger considerations and with intense difficulty she choked back the words she forced herself to look as close to goodnatured as she could manage which effort cost her dearly instead they will be talking about the gorgeous and perfectly unique ornaments on your tree she said sweetly and you will be able to say that they are a remembrance of your sister bedelia sat rigid her eyes unmoving her face set it could have been grief or the complexity and hurt of any memory including anger that would never now be redeemed or regret for forgiveness too late or even debts uncollected the only thing grandmama was certain of was that the emotion was deep and that it brought no ease or pleasure they took the silks downstairs and bedelia cut into them with large fabric shears bright clouds like desert sunsets drifted across the table and onto the floor grandmama picked them up and began to work on the papiermâché and paste to make the basic balls before they should be covered in the bright gauze after that they would stitch little dolls to dress in the gold and bronze and white with pearls she smiled at the prospect it was fun to create beauty but she was not here to enjoy herself this silk in her hands had been a wonderful wild garish robe that maude had worn on the hot roads of arabia or somewhere like it i imagine maude must have known some very different people she said thoughtfully they would seem odd to us perhaps even frightening she allowed the lamplight to fall on the purple silk and the brazen red i cannot imagine wearing these colors together nor could anyone else outside a fairground bedelia responded you see why we could not have her here when lord woollard stayed we allowed him the courtesy of not shocking or embarrassing him is he a man of small experience grandmama inquired with as much innocence as she could contrive of discreet taste and excellent family bedelia said coolly his wife whom i have met is the sister of one of her majestys ladiesinwaiting an excellent person perhaps even a week ago grandmama would have been impressed now all she could think of was maudes persian garden with the small owls in the dusk there was a knock on the door and agnes came in a brief conversation followed about parties games to be played especially blindmans bluff and of course refreshments we must remember some lemon curd tarts for mrs hethersett agnes reminded her she is always so fond of them she will have to make her own bedelia responded she will not be coming oh dear is she unwell again agnes asked sympathetically she will not be coming because i have not invited her bedelia said tersely she was unforgivably rude that was over a year ago agnes protested it was bedelia agreed what has that to do with it agnes did not argue she admired the rapidly progressing baubles and returned to the task of organizing pies and tarts how very unpleasant grandmama sympathized wondering what on earth mrs hethersett could have said that bedelia still bore a grudge a year later and at christmas of all times she must have been dreadfully rude to distress you so much she nearly added that she could not understand why people should be rude but that was too big a lie to swallow she could understand rudeness perfectly and practice it to the level of an art it was something she had never previously been ashamed of but now it was oddly distasteful to her she imagines i will forget bedelia responded but she is quite mistaken as she will learn grandmama bent to the stitching again blending the bright colors with less pleasure and wondered what maude had done to bedelia that old memories lingered so long in unforgiveness why had maude returned now was it possible grandmama was completely mistaken had she allowed her bored and lonely imagination to conjure up murder where there was only an unexpected death and grief that looked like anger and a proud woman who would not allow another to see that she was bitterly ashamed of having turned away her sister for fear that her behavior was socially inappropriate and now regretted it so terribly when it was too late was grandmama making a crime out of what was only a tragedy dinner was tense again as on the first night there was the palpable undercurrent of emotions that perhaps there always is in families knowledge of weaknesses indulgences things said that would have been better forgotten only there is always someone who will remind aloud they recalled past christmases particularly those when randolph had been a boy which necessarily excluded clara grandmama studied her face and saw the flicker of hurt in it and then of annoyance the others were enjoying themselves for once arthur joined in the laughter and the open affection as bedelia told a tale of randolph s surprise at receiving a set of tin soldiers in perfect replica of wellington s army at waterloo it seemed he had refused to come to the table even for goose he was so enraptured he could not put his soldiers down bedelia had tried to insist but arthur had said it was christmas and randolph should do as he pleased grandmama found herself smiling alsountil she saw the hunger in zacharys eyes his look at bedelia agness look at him and remembered that randolph was the only one among all four of them likely to have a child he was forty clara strongwilled and ambitious was a great deal younger when would they have children or might that be another grief waiting in the wings she would have liked to have had more children herself a daughter like charlotte might have made all the difference or even like emily a lot of work a lot of frustration and disappointment but who could measure the happiness it would be better if she did not think of the past anymore far better to treasure what you have than grieve over what you have not she looked around their faces again why does anybody hate someone enough to kill them with all the risk involved you dont if you are sane you kill to protect to keep what you have and love position power money even safety from scandal the pain of humiliation or loss or the terror in loneliness she could easily imagine that perhaps we were all as fragile if one found the right passion the fear that eats at the soul she looked at the light from the chandeliers glittering on the silver the crystal at the white linen the lilies from the hothouse and the red wine all the different faces and wondered if she really wanted to know the answer then she remembered maudes laughter and the memories in her eyes as she described the moonlight over the desert there was no escaping the answer that would be the ultimate irredeemable cowardice the following day the scullery maid cut her finger so badly she could not use her hand and the kitchen was in pandemonium agnes had been going to take the pony trap to deliver gifts to the vicars widow in dymchurch and now all plans had to be rearranged without a thought for her own competence for such a task grandmama offered to go in her stead the stable boy could drive her and she would call with explanations upon mrs dowson and give her the already wrapped gifts for herself and one or two other families her offer was accepted and at ten oclock they set off she feeling very pleased with herself it was a bitter day with clouds piling slate gray on the horizon and the wind had veered round to come from the north with ice on the edge grandmama sat with the rug wrapped tightly around her knees and tucked in under her hoping profoundly that it would not snow before she returned to snave or she might find that the chill she had considered pretending could be only too real she had no desire whatever to spend christmas in bed with a fever and then another thought assailed her even more unpleasant what if she discovered beyond doubt who it was that had picked the foxglove leaves and distilled their poison and could prove it and that person became aware of the fact then it might be a great deal more than a chill that afflicted her she wondered if it was painful to die of a heart slowing until it stopped altogether she could feel it bumping in her chest now with fear if she died would anyone miss her enough to be sorry would anyones world be colder or grayer because she was not in it she thought of maude alone in the house of strangers who had taken her in out of kindness or worse a sense of duty or pity that was even worse again had maude felt obliged to work hard to be charming hide the rejection she must feel inside in order to win their warmth had she even known that grandmama liked her genuinely liked her now that was a lie her face was hot in spite of the knifeedge wind she had loathed maude even before she arrived because maude would displace her as the center of attention she had realized only after maude was dead how much she had liked her admired her found her exciting to listen to freeing the imagination and awakening dreams she wished now with a desire so strong it was like a physical ache that she had allowed maude to see that she liked her more than anyone else she could think of they were going toward the sea and she could smell the salt more sharply dymchurch was not far from st mary in the marsh she could not return home until she had solved this it would be a betrayal not only of maude but of friendship itself the length of it was irrelevant it was the depth that mattered she ignored the great ragged skies clouds streaming across its vastness like the torn banners of an army spears of ice not far behind as they drove into the village itself she could hear the roaring of the surf on the shore and the tower of the church seemed to stand aloft against the racing darkness coming in on the storm they pulled up to a small cottage with bare vines covering the arch over the gate and the stable boy announced that they had arrived he said he would take the parcels in for her as soon as they had ascertained that mrs dowson was at home then he would take the pony and trap around to the stable to shelter until she was ready to leave again he looked anxiously at the sky and then smiled showing gapped teeth grandmama thanked him and with his help alighted mrs dowson was at home she was a lean woman with narrow shoulders and bright eyes she must have been closer to eighty than seventy but seemed to be still in excellent health there was a color in her cheeks as if she had recently been outside even in this darkening weather grandmama introduced herself my name is mariah ellison mrs dowson please excuse me for calling unannounced on mrs harcourts behalf but i am afraid i have accepted their hospitality in the wake of tragedy and the whole family is bravely making the very best of a hard situation i offered to come on this errand for her i feel it is the least i can do oh dear im so sorry very kind of you mrs ellison she looked at grandmama curiously but without apprehension may i offer you tea and perhaps a mince pie or something of the sort she did not ask what the tragedy had been was that extreme discretion or had word somehow come this far already thank you grandmama accepted wondering if there were a third possibility that she simply did not care i admit it is remarkably cold outside i do not know this area very well i live in london and am merely visiting but i find something most pleasing about the sea air even when there is so very much of it mrs dowson smiled it pleases me too she agreed conducting the way into a small but very pretty sitting room it was lowceilinged with furniture covered in floral chintz and a fire burning in the hearth she rang the bell and when the maid came requested tea and tarts now my dear she said when they were seated what is the trouble with poor agnes now i imagine it is agnes is it not how interesting grandmama thought aloud she said i am afraid it is all of them did you ever know the third sister miss maude barrington something hardened in mrs dowsons face and her eyes were chill i did but if you have come to say something uncomplimentary about her i would thank you not to i know she was a little unruly and perhaps she threw herself too fully into things but she had a good heart and it was all very long ago i think one should take ones victories very lightly and ones losses with silence and dignity do you not agree mrs ellison how curious not at all what grandmama had expected mrs dowsons eyes might be bright and cold but they kindled a sudden new warmth in grandmamas mind indeed i do she said heartily that is one of the reasons i felt an affection for maude the moment i met her it is one of the great sadnesses of my life that i knew her such a very short time i beg your pardon mrs dowson said huskily her face now filled with alarm even a week ago grandmama would have made a condescending reply to that now all she wanted to do was find some kinder way of telling the news i am so sorry maude arrived home from abroad and because of other family commitments at her sisters house she came and stayed with her cousin mr joshua fielding who is also a relative of mine hence my presence there maude died quite peacefully in her sleep three days ago she saw the undisguised pain in the old ladys face i felt so very grieved i chose to take the news to her family in person rather than merely send some written message she concluded which is how i come to be still staying with them now i am doing what little i can to help oh dear mrs dowson said shaking her head a little i assumed it was no more than another of agness chills or whatever it is she has how stupid of me one should not assume this is a deep loss suddenly the tears filled her eyes im so sorry she apologized grandmama did not find it absurd that after forty years mrs dowson should still grieve so keenly time does not cloud certain memories bright days from youth laughter and friendship can remain but crass as it seemed it was also an opportunity that she could not afford to ignore did you know her well before she left to travel abroad she asked oh yes mrs dowson smiled i knew all the girls then my husband was a curate just young in his ministry very earnest you know as dedicated men can be i rather think maude overwhelmed him she was so fierce in her love for arthur harcourt and of course arthur was quite the dashing young manabouttown he was extraordinarily handsome and he knew it but he could hardly fail to if hed crooked a finger at any of the girls in the south of england theyd have followed him i might have myself if id thought he meant it but i was never very pretty and i was happy enough with walter he was genuine i rather thought arthur wasnt sincere was he simply playing with maude suddenly grandmamas liking for arthur harcourt evaporated as if she had torn the smiling mask off and seen rotten flesh underneath oh no mrs dowson said quickly that was where walter and i disagreed he thought arthur loved bedelia he called them a perfect match something of an idealist my husband thought beauty was bone deep not just a chance of coloring and half an inch here and there and of course confidence selfbelief you know imagine how the map of the world might have been changed if cleopatras nose had been half an inch longer then caesar might not have fallen in love with her or mark anthony either grandmama was carried along in a hurricane of thought im so sorry mrs dowson apologized again walter always said my mind was totally undisciplined i told him that was not so at all simply that it moved in a different pattern from his bedelia barrington could twist him around her little finger and half the men in the county too poor zachary never got over it which is such a shame agnes was the better girl if only she could have believed that herself grandmama did not interrupt her the tea arrived mrs dowson poured and passed the mince pie and jam tarts bedelia thought she was glamorous agnes was dull and maude was plain and eccentric because of her confidence far too many people believed that she must be right but she was not certainly she was mrs dowson contradicted her but only because we allowed her to be except maude she knew bedelias beauty was of no real value no warmth in it do you see but she fell in love with arthur so much so that she could not bear it when he came to his senses and married bedelia after all grandmama deliberately chose her words provocatively i used to think he lost his senses again mrs dowson argued i was furious with maude for not fighting for the man she loved fancy simply giving up and running away like that off to north africa and then egypt and persia riding horses in the desert and camels too for all i can say lived in tents and gave what was left of her heart to the persians she wrote to you grandmama was astonished and delighted maude had had a friend here who had cared for her over the years and kept her in touch with home of course mrs dowson said indignantly she never told me why she left but i came to realize it was a matter of honor and must not ever be discussed she did what she believed to be the right thing but i dont think that she ever stopped loving arthur new ideas began to form in grandmamas mind mrs dowson do you know why maude chose to come home now after so long she asked did she have anyany anxieties about her health not that she confided in me mrs dowson frowned she was certainly afraid a little oppressed by the thought of returning after so long but the gentleman she had cared for in persia and who had loved her had died she told me that it grieved her very much and it also meant that she had no reason for remaining there anymore in fact she implied that without his protection it would be unwise for her to do so i do not know their relationship i never asked and she never told me but it was not regular as you and i would use the term i see was bedelia aware of this was that the scandal she was afraid might come to lord woollards earseven perhaps quite frankly told by maude in order to shock after bedelias coolness over the years and the fact that it was she arthur had married whatever his reason it would not be unnatural now if maude had been unable to resist at least preventing her sister from becoming lady harcourt she asked mrs dowson as much she may have been tempted mrs dowson replied but she would not have done it maude never bore a grudge that was bedelia was bedelia not very much in love with arthur even before maude returned from caring for her aunt grandmama asked maude did tell you a great deal didnt she mrs dowson observed grandmama merely smiled however much maude had despised bedelia she would never have hurt arthur mrs dowson continued as i said she never stopped loving him and i refer to that emotion that seeks the best for the other the honor and happiness and inward spiritual journey not the hunger to possess at all costs the joy for oneself in their company and the feeling that they are happy only when they are with you that is bedelia all about winning and poor agnes was concerned she was always going to be no more than secondbest then why was arthur so foolish grandmama marveled was he really blinded by mere physicaloh a far simpler and more understandable answer came to her mind she saw that mrs dowson was watching her intently she felt the heat in her cheeks as if mrs dowson could read her thoughts i do not know mrs dowson said quietly but i believe maude did and that is why bedelia was very happy that she should remain in persia for the rest of her life the idea became firmer in grandmamas mind it made sense of what was otherwise outside the character and nature of the people she had observed looking at mrs dowson she was certain she had guessed the same answer she smiled across at her how very sad she said gently aware of what an absurd understatement that was poor arthur she hesitated and poor zachary and agnes mrs dowson added but above all i wish that maude had notnot suffered so but she made the best of it grandmama said with an intensity of feeling an absolute conviction that welled up inside her driving away all doubt mrs dowson nodded maude always knew how to live she knew the worst was there and she accepted the pain as part of the truth of things but she chose to see the best also and to find the joy in variety she did not close herself off from the richness of experience i think that was her gift i shall miss her terribly even though i knew her only briefly i shall miss her also grandmama confessed but i am profoundly grateful that i did know her andand gratitude is something i have not felt lately simply to have that back is a she did not know how to finish she sniffed pulled her emotions together with an effort then rose to her feet but i have something to do i must return to snave and attend to it thank you very much for your hospitality mrs dowson and even more for the understanding you have given me may i wish you the joy of the season and remembrance of all that is good in the past together with hope for the future mrs dowson rose also why how graciously put mrs ellison i shall endeavor to remember that may i wish you joy also and safety in your journey both in the body and in the spirit happy christmas outside it was beginning to snow white flurries on the wind so far it was only dusting the ground but the heavy pall of cloud to the north made it apparent that there was a great deal more to come whether she wanted to or not grandmama would be unlikely to be able to return to st mary in the marsh today that was a good thing what she had to do would be best done in the evening when they were all together after dinner it would be uncomfortable extremely so she felt a sinking in her stomach as she sat in the pony trap wrapped against the snow the biting wind was behind her and the roar of the sea breaking on the shore growing fainter as they moved inland between the wide flat fields beginning to whiten she was afraid she admitted it to herself she was afraid of unpleasantness even physical attack although she expected any attack to be secret disguised as the one on maude had been even more than that and it surprised her she was afraid of not doing it well but then like agnes she had regarded herself as a failure most of her life she had lived a lie always pretending to be a highly respectable woman even aggressively so married to a man who had died relatively young and left her grieving since her late forties unable to recover from the loss in truth she had married wretchedly and his death had released her at least on the outside she had never allowed herself to be released in her own mind and worse still in her heart she had kept up the lie to save her pride of course no one ever needed to know the details but she could have been honest with herself and it would slowly have spread through her manner her beliefs and in the end the way she had seen and been seen by others maude barrington had suffered a monstrous injustice she had borne it apparently without bitterness if it had marred an earlier part of her life perhaps when she first went abroad she had healed her own spirit from the damage and gone on to live a passionate and adventurous life perhaps it had never been comfortable but what was comfort worth bitterness blame and selfhatred were never comfortable either and perhaps they were also not as safe as she had once imagined they were a slowgrowing disease within killing inch by inch it was snowing quite hard now lying thick and light on the ground beginning to drift on the windward side of the furrows left in the fields after their winter plowing and on the trunks of the trees the wind was blowing too hard for the snow to stay on the branches as they swayed against the sky there was little sound from the ponys hooves because the ground was blanketed already just the deep moan of the wind and the creak of the wheels it was a hard beautiful world invigorating icecold and on every side sweet and sharpsmelling from the sea infinitely wide she arrived back at snave before she was really ready but there was no help for it and maybe she would never feel as if it were time she allowed the stable boy to assist her and to his surprise thanked him for his care inside she took off her cape and shawl and was very glad to be in the warmth again her hands were almost numb from the cold and her face was stinging her eyes watering but she had never felt more intensely alive she was terrified and yet there was an unmistakable bubble of courage inside her as if something of maudes vitality and hunger for life had been bequeathed to her she was too late for luncheon and too excited to eat much anyway cook had prepared a tray for her with soup and new warm bread and that was really all she required she thanked her sincerely with a compliment and after finishing it all went upstairs with the excuse that she wished to lie down in reality she wanted to prepare herself for the evening it was going to be one of the biggest of her life perhaps her only real achievement it would require all the nerve and the intelligence she possessed there was in her mind no doubt of the truth now proving it would be altogether another matter but if she did not attempt it whatever it cost her then she would have failed the last chance that fate had offered she dressed very carefully in the housekeepers best black gown and thanked the maid it seemed appropriate she was going to be a different person from the woman she had been as long as she could clearly remember she was going to be brave face all the ugliness the shame and the failure and be gentle toward them because she understood them intimately she had been a liar herself and every stupid ugly corner of it was familiar she had been a coward and its corroding shroud had covered every part of her life she had tried to touch other peoples lives with her own meanness of spirit her belief in failure there was no victory in that one could spoil others dirty them damage what could have been whole now she could touch all their wounds with pity but none of them could deceive her she regarded herself in the glass she looked different from the way she was accustomed it was more than the dress that was not her own the face also was not the one that had been hers for so long there was color in her skin her eyes were brighter most of all the sulk had gone from her lips and the lines seemed to be curving upward not down ridiculous she had never been pretty and she wasnt now if she did not know better she would think she had been imbibing rather too freely of the christmas spirit of that nature that comes in a bottle she straightened her skirt a last time and went down to join the family for dinner tomorrow she would leave she would probably have to even if the snow were up to the eaves there was something exhilarating and a little mad in casting the last die crossing the rubicon if she were remembering her schoolroom history correctly it was war triumph or disaster because she could not stop until it was over part three she was a few minutes late as she had intended there was very little time before dinner was announced and they all went into the dining room it was now looking even more festive with scarlet berries intertwined in the wreaths and the swags along the mantelpiece all tied with gold ribbons there were scarlet candles on the table even though they were not yet lit and everything seemed to be touched with light from the chandeliers i hope you are recovered from your journey mrs ellison arthur asked with concern im afraid the weather turned most unpleasant before you were able to return i should not have allowed you to go bedelia added i had not realized it would take you so long it was entirely my own fault grandmama replied i could have been back earlier and i should have for the stable boys and the ponys sake if nothing else to tell you the truth the ride back was very beautiful i have not been out in a snowstorm for so long that i had forgotten how amazing it is the sense of the power and magnitude of nature is very marvelous what a refreshing view arthur said then suddenly the sadness filled his eyes overwhelming him you remind me of maude he stopped unable to continue it was the greatest compliment grandmama had ever received but she could not afford to stop and savor it now she continued with what she had intended to say regardless of their responses she even ignored the butler and the footman serving the soup thank you mr harcourt the more i learn of maude the more i appreciate how very much that means i know that for you it is as profound as it could be and i wish more than you can be aware of to live up to it bedelia was startled then her mouth curled in a smile more of disdain than amusement we all grieve for maude mrs ellison but there is no requirement for you to cater to our family perception with such praise she left the implied adjective fulsome unsaid but it hung in the air oh im not grandmama said candidly her eyes wide maude was a most remarkable person i learned far more of just how amazing from mrs dowson that im afraid is why i stayed so long bedelia was stiff her shoulders like carved ivory beneath her violet taffeta gown mrs dowson is sentimental she replied coolly a vicars widow and obliged to see the best in people perhaps the vicar did grandmama corrected her mrs dowson certainly does not she is quite capable of seeing pride greed selfishness and other things cowardice in particular she smiled at agnes the acceptance of failure because one does not have the courage to face what one is afraid of and pay the price in comfort that is sometimes necessary for success the blood drained from agness face leaving her ashen her spoon slithered into her soup dish and she ignored it zachary started to speak and then choked on whatever it was he had been going to say it was randolph who came to her rescue that sounds extremely harsh mrs ellison how on earth would mrs dowson be in a position to know anything of that sort about anybody and what she did know must have come to her in a privileged position and therefore should not be repeated most unchristian clara added it can be very difficult to recognize the right thing to do at times grandmama continued grateful for the extraordinary ease with which the opportunities she needed were opening up for her but i must not misrepresent mrs dowson actually she said nothing except to praise maudes love of beauty her laughter and above all her courage to make the best of her life even after so great a sacrifice which was given silently and with the utmost dignity zachary looked totally confused arthur was pale his breathing seemed painful bedelia was as white as agnes now and her hands on her lap were clenched no one ate i am not sure what you imagine you are referring to mrs ellison she said icily it appears you are a lonely woman with nothing to do and you have concerned yourself in our familys affairs in a way that exceeds even your imagined duty to maude whom you barely met your meddlesomeness has run away with you i think we had better find a way to return you to st mary in the marsh tomorrow regardless of the weather i am sure that would be better for all of us randolph blushed scarlet it was arthur who spoke bedelia that is unnecessary i apologize mrs ellison i dont know what maude told you but i think you must have misunderstood her she told me nothing grandmama said meeting his eyes she would never betray you like that and surely by now you must know beyond any question at all that she would not betray bedelia either she did not come here to cause any kind of trouble the man who had loved her and protected her in persia died and she could no longer remain there she came back home because she wished to perhaps she even imagined that after all these years she would be welcome which of course was an error quite obviously she was not you have no right to say that clara cut in she had been living in the desert in tents and by campfires like aa gypsy and with a foreign man to whom she was not married we could hardly have her in the house at the same time as lord woollard my fatherinlaw has given more to society than you have any idea this peerage would have been not only a just reward but an opportunity to do even more good we could not jeopardize that and it would in time have made you lady harcourt grandmama added with all that that means of course you did not wish to lose such a prize oh noi clara faded into silence she had the grace to be ashamed stuff and nonsense bedelia snapped you overstep yourself mrs ellison your behavior is disgraceful she came home because she had nowhere else to go agnes asked her face pinched with sorrow we should have forgiven her bedelia it was a very long time ago bedelia does not forgive grandmama answered agnes not that there was anything of maudes that needed pardon tragically there are some people who can never forgive a gift especially from someone who is aware of their vulnerability sometimes it is harder to forgive a gift than an injury because you have incurred a debt and in your own eyes you have lost control and your superiority there was an electric silence those who themselves do not forgive find it impossible to believe that others do grandmama went on so they expect vengeance where there is none and strike out to defend themselves from a blow that existed only in their own guilty imaginations arthur leaned forward i think you had better stop speaking in riddles mrs ellison i have very little idea of what you are talking about neither has she bedelia said tartly really arthur you should have more sense than to encourage her cant you see that she has been drinking let us speak of something civilized and stop descending into personal remarks it is extremely vulgar she spoke as if that was the end of the matter arthur drew in his breath but it was agnes who answered she looked at grandmama directly was maude ill did she know she was going to die and that was why she came home at last to make peace no grandmama replied with authority as i said there was nothing to keep her in persia anymore nor was it safe she had made enemies no doubt bedelia observed you did not say that this man was married to someone else but knowing maude i have no doubt that it was true oh bedelia you should forgive her that agnes pleaded it was forty years ago and she is gone now its christmas dont be so feeble bedelia accused her wrong does not suddenly become right just because of the season agnes blushed scarlet of course it doesnt grandmama agreed vehemently some debts can be forgiven but there are some that have to be paid one way or another i dont care for your opinion mrs ellison bedelia said frigidly there is no reason why you should again grandmama agreed with her but you care about your familys opinions in the end it is really all you have that and the knowledge within yourself of course perhaps that is why maude was happy in the deepest sense she knew she was loved and no matter what the cost she had done the right thing i have no idea what you are talking about yes you do you are probably the only one who does nothing was going to stop grandmama when you were a young woman and even more beautiful than you are now mrs harcourtshe glanced at zacharyhe fell in love with you and like many young people you did not deny yourselves the pleasure of love bedelia hissed in her breath but the shame in zacharys face made her denial impossible but then mr harcourt came along and he was a far better catch so you went after him instead grandmama continued relentlessly and you caught him at least his admiration for your beauty and a certain physical appetite you also did not deny yourselves after all you fully intended to marry him which would all have gone very well had not maude returned home and mr harcourt fell truly in love with her bedelias eyes on her were like daggers grandmama ignored them but her heart was pounding almost in her throat if she were wrong catastrophically insanely wrong she would be ruined forever her mouth was dry her voice rasping you were furious that maude of all people should take your lover but there was worse to follow you learned that you were with child mr sullivans of course but it could have been mr harcourts for all he knew that gave you your perfect weapon for regaining everything you told him being a man of honor in spite of his lapse of selfcontrol he broke off his relationship with maude whom he truly loved as she loved him and he married you he paid a bitter price for his selfindulgence so did your sister rather than allow you to be shamed there were gasps of breath the clink of cutlery even a broken glass stem that is what you cannot forgivethat you wronged her she went on regardless and she sacrificed her happiness for yoursand perhaps for mr harcourts honor although i believe it was actually mr sullivans in fact arthur stared at bedelia a stunned and terrible look in his eyes randolph is not mine and you know it he said very quietly areare you sure agnes asked then she looked more closely at bedelia and did not ask again what does she mean that you could not forgive arthur asked bedelia i have no idea bedelia replied she is an inquisitive meddling old woman who listens at doors and hears half stories gossips with other old women who should know better and apparently listened to maudes selfdelusions of her own romantic youth it wasnt a delusion arthur told her very quietly i loved maude as i have never loved anyone else in my life before or since but i could not marry her because you told me that you were carrying my child i cant blame you for that it was my doing as much as yours nor can i blame zachary he was no worse than i and by heaven you were beautiful but maude was funny and kind she was brave and warm and honest and she was generous with life with her own spirit her beauty would have lasted forever and grown with time rather than fade i knew it then and i was proved right when she came back even after forty years which were like a lifetime while she was gone and nothing at all once she returned oh arthur agnes breathed out how terrible for you zachary was looking at agnes with amazement i found the rest of the peppermint water grandmama said in the silence i beg your pardon arthur frowned grandmama wavered for an instant should she tell them or was this enough but would it last there would be no further chance she turned to bedelia and saw the fury in her eyes you told maude when you gave her the macadamia nuts which are so indigestible to some of us that you had very little peppermint water just the end of one bottle sufficient for a single dose but actually you had plenty there is some in my room and some in the other guest rooms also a nice courtesy especially over a festive season when we will all eat a little heavily what has that to do with anything at all clara demanded why are we talking about peppermint water are you quite mad i wish i were grandmama answered it would be so much less ugly an answer than the truth i dont eat macadamia nuts myself they give me indigestion zachary was staring at her as if he could not believe his ears agnes looked appalled but peppermint water would help grandmama carried on unless of course it were laced with foxglove leaves then it would kill most of us who have ever arranged flowers know that there are a few one must be careful of especially with children about laburnum monks hood belladonna and of course foxgloves such handsome flowers but the distilled juice can cause the heart to fail it is used in medicine to slow it down if it is racing but only a very little naturally that is a wicked thing to suggest clara was horrified howhow dare you randolph touched her gently there is no need to be afraid my dear she could not possibly prove it he gulped could you grandmama looked at him and realized it was a question i dont know she replied i had not considered trying to although it might not be too difficult i dont think that is what matters it is knowing the truth that is important it gives you the freedom to do whatever you choose to knowing right from wrong she turned to arthur waiting for him to speak but he was not looking at her his gaze did not move from bedelias face and he read in it the fear and the hatred that betrayed her whatever she had said he would know what she had done randolph was staring at his mother with horror and pity in his face and a revulsion he could not hide he turned swiftly to zachary then embarrassed away again zachary was looking at him with wonder and an intensity quite naked in his eyes arthur sighed he spoke to grandmama as if bedelia had ceased to exist you mentioned a garden in persia that maude described to you as if she loved it have you any idea where it was exactly no but i believe mrs dowson would know grandmama replied maude wrote to her quite regularly i imagine she would be happy to tell you good i have a great desire to see it since she loved it so much you made it sound marvelous also mrs ellison and for that i shall always be grateful to you the truth you have shown us is terrible but deep as it cuts a clean wound will heal in time youyou cant go to persia now papai mean randolph faltered and stopped arthur smiled at him gently and with great affection you will always be my son in spirit randolph and i will always love you as such but i can go to persia and i will i shall write to lord woollard and decline a peerage i may return from persia one day and i may not the estate will provide for your mother please see that mrs ellison is safely returned to st mary in the marsh tomorrow now i shall wish you good night he rose to his feet he was still a startlingly handsome man but it was his dignity that remained in the mind and goodbye he added before turning and leaving the room without looking behind him he did not once glance at bedelia zachary reached out his hand to agnes and very slowly as if uncertain that it could be true she took it reluctantly grandmama abandoned her dinner and excused herself also it was quite impossible to remain she had shown them the truth what they did with it she should not influence only hope upstairs in her bedroom she sank down into the chair suddenly her legs were weak and she found she was trembling had she done enough should she have tried harder to prove something that would stand the test of trial and the law as it was now the family knew the truth there could be no denying that arthur would leave perhaps forever bedelia would probably never see him again people would know in the way that they do they would look at her and whisper there would be speculation most of it ugly the kindest she would receive would be pity and that would be the most painful of all to a woman like bedelia she would see it in their glances in the street the halfhidden smiles gradually perhaps even some of the truth would emerge but imagination would be more colorful and crueler agnes and zachary would be happy with each other at last and perhaps with randolph too and clara old mrs dowson would understand a great deal she might be discreet but bedelia would know that she knew and would never allow maudes name to be blackened bedelia would be provided for waited on but starved of friendship or admiration no one would care how beautiful she had been or how clever she would be alone a woman unloved at a glance that was a gentler punishment than trial and possibly the gallows or possibly a verdict of innocence but it would be more certain and far far longer she would taste it for the rest of her life but the others would be happy perhaps for the first time in their lives grandmama stopped shaking and sat still slowly beginning to smile even if there was sadness in it and pity in the morning zachary drove her back through the deepening snow to st mary in the marsh he did not speak much but she felt a great certainty that he had at last realized that agnes was not a paler secondbest version of bedelia but a kinder if less brave person a gentler more generous one who might now at last find the courage to be the best and she had always truly loved him thank you mrs ellison he said as the trap rounded the last corner through the dazzling snow and she saw joshua and carolines house blazing with lights i hope you will be happy she replied meaning it far more than the simple words could convey ii understand why you and maude were such good friends he said earnestly even in so short a time you are like her you have such courage to tell the truth however difficult and such joy for life i am amazed at your compassion for even the weakest of us i imagine you will have a wonderful christmas because you will make it so but i wish it for you just the same i will she assured him as they drew up in front of the door it opened and joshua came down the step and across the grass to the trap to assist her i shall have the best christmas of my life she went on still speaking to zachary i am beginning to understand what it truly means welcome home mamainlaw joshua said with surprise lifting his eyebrows he gave her his arm and she alighted thank you joshua she smiled at him happy christmas my dear i have wonderful things to tell you brave and beautiful things when i can think how to find words for them about hope and honor and what love really means your aunt maude was a very wonderful woman she has given me the greatest gift of allan understanding of christmas itself yes i see that joshua said with sudden conviction it is perfectly plain happy christmas mamainlaw a christmas secret to all those who would like to start again clarice corde leaned back in her seat as the train pulled out of the station in a cloud of steam smuts flew and engine roared as they gathered speed on their journey northward the rain beat against the window she could barely see the glistening rooftops of london it was december ten days until christmas eve she had been married little more than a year and she was far from used to being a vicars wife neither obedience nor tact came to her except with a considerable effort but she made that effort for dominics sake she glanced sideways at him now and saw him deep in thought she knew he was concerned about his ability to rise to this opportunity they had been offered so unexpectedly the elderly reverend wynter had taken a richly deserved holiday therefore his church in the small village of cottisham in oxfordshire needed someone to stand in for him and care for his flock over christmas dominic had seized the chance he was a widower who had abandoned a selfindulgent life and embraced the ministry somewhat late perhaps no one but clarice saw beyond his startlingly handsome face and charm of manner to the doubts beneath she loved him the more fiercely because she knew he understood his own weaknesses as well as the power of his dreams he looked up and smiled at her once again she was warmed by amazement that he should have chosen her the awkward sister the one with the slightly crooked nose that gave her face a wry individual look the one with the tactless tongue and the pungent sense of humor rather than any of the reliable and more conventional beauties eager for his attention this chance to go to cottisham was the greatest christmas gift they could have been given it was an escape from serving under the reverend spindlewood in the bleak area of industrial london to which he had been sent as curate how could clarice reassure him that they expected only patience and that he should be there to listen and comfort to assure them of the message of christmas and peace on earth she reached her hand across and touched his arm tightening her fingers for a moment it will be good she said firmly and being in the country will be a delight he smiled at her his dark eyes bright knowing what she meant to tell him they traveled for nearly two hours most of it through gently rolling countryside the fields now bare except for the meadows still green the woodlands and copses were without leaf and the higher crowns of the hills were dusted with snow here in the heart of england winter could be surprisingly fierce and no doubt there was far worse weather to come for the most part the villages lay in the hollows the first sight from the train windows being the steep spires of the churches then the huddled roofs they reached the station nearest to cottisham and hired a pony trap to take them the last few miles through winding lanes up the brow of a long ridgebacked hill and down into the sloping valley the village was beautiful even though it boasted little more than a wide green with a duck pond and houses all around it many of the dwellings were thatched their bare winter gardens neatly tidied perhaps half a dozen narrow roads twisted away into the surrounding woods and the fields beyond the church was saxon slateroofed with a square tower rising high against the windtorn clouds the pony trap drew up in front of the rambling stone vicarage the driver unloaded their cases onto the gravel and quickly drove away clarice looked at the closed door then at the fine georgian windows it was a beautiful house but it seemed oddly blind as if it were oblivious to their arrival and they would knock on the oak door in vain this was to be their home and dominics challenge and opportunity would be to preach and to minister without the supervisionor constant meddlingof the reverend spindlewood clarice knew she must behave with enthusiasm now whatever doubt or loneliness she felt that was what faith was about anyone can be cheerful when she is confident and the sun is shining she looked at dominic once then marched up to the front door and banged briskly with the lions head knocker there was total silence from inside stay here with the boxes dominic said quietly ill go to the nearest house they must have left the keys with someone but before he could go more than a dozen steps a stout woman her hair piled atop her head in an untidy knot came bustling along the road she struggled to hold a shawl around her shoulders against the wind all right all right im coming she called out no hurry it aint snowin yet you must be the reverend corde an mrs corde i take it she stopped in front of them and looked clarice up and down dubiously her blunt face skeptical i spose you know how to care for a house an all she said in a tone close to accusation im mrs wellbeloved i look after the vicar but i cant do no more for you than a bit o the heavy work cos ive got family coming for christmas an i need me holiday too int good for a body to work all the days o the year an it int right to expect it of course we dont expect it clarice agreed although she had in fact expected exactly that if you show me where to find everything and assist with the laundry im sure that will be most satisfactory mrs wellbeloved looked more or less mollified she produced a large key from her pocket unlocked the door and led the way in just leave them boxes old will and young tomll bring em on up for yer clarice followed her pleasantly surprised by the warmth of the house even though the vicar had been gone for a couple of days it smelled of lavender beeswax and the faint earthy perfume of chrysanthemums everything looked clean the wooden floor the hall table the doors leading off to left and right the stairs going up toward a wide landing there was a large vase of branches and leaves of gold and bronze on the floor for all her lack of grace mrs wellbeloved seemed to be an excellent housekeeper youll be liking it here she said more to dominic than to clarice it sounded something of an order folks know how to behave decent come to church reglar and give to the poor wont be nothing for you to do but your duty just keep it right for the vicar to come back to im sure hes left you a list of them as needs visiting but if he hasnt i can tell you she opened the sitting room door to show them a graceful room with a wide fireplace and bay window and then closed the door again youll be takin all services reglar she went on walking quickly toward the kitchen an you wont be wantin the sexton but if you do hes first on the right on the glebe road grave diggers two down beyond thank you mrs wellbeloved dominic avoided meeting clarices eyes and answered with as straight a face as he could manage ill be in reglar for the heavy stuff ceptin christmas day an boxin day o course mrs wellbeloved continued youll have enough coal an coke an likely enough kindlin but if you havent you can go walk in the woods an pick up plenty works best of all if you dry it proper first an youll walk harry too i cant be doin that harry dominic asked puzzled harry she looked at him witheringly the dog didnt the vicar tell you about harry retriever he is good as gold if you treat him right an etta but you dont need to do nothin for her cept scraps and stuff an milk shell fend for herself clarice made a quick guess ettas a cat mrs wellbeloved looked appeased for their ignorance right good little mouser she is plain as you like but clever capture em all in the end she said it with satisfaction as if she identified with the animal and were in some oblique way describing herself as well clarice could not help being amused i am sure we shall get along excellently thank you for showing us in we shall have a cup of tea and then unpack theres everything youll need for today mrs wellbeloved said nodding game pie in the pantry an plenty o vegetables such as there is this time o year youll need onions vicar loved em hot onion soup best thing in the world for a cold he said smells worse n whiskey but at least youre sober she gave dominic a hard level look he returned it unflinchingly then slowly smiled mrs wellbeloved grunted a pink blush spread up her face and she turned away handsome is as handsome does she muttered under her breath clarice thanked her again and saw her to the door she was ready to be alone in her new temporary home and take stock of things but first she wanted a cup of tea it had been a long journey and it was close to the shortest day in the year storm clouds were looming up over the trees and the light was fading the house was everything she could have hoped it had charm and individuality the furniture was all well used but also well cared for nothing really matched as if each piece had been gathered as opportunity arose and yet nothing appeared to be out of place oak mahogany and walnut jostled together and age had mellowed them all elizabethan carving did not clash with georgian simplicity everything seemed to be useful except for one small table with barleytwist legs which was apparently there simply because it was liked the pictures on the walls were also obviously personal choices a watercolor of bamburgh castle on the northumberland coast rising out of the pale sands with the north sea beyond a dutch scene of fishing boats half a dozen pencil sketches of bare trees more winter fields and trees in pen and ink she found them remarkably restful her eyes returned to them again and again upstairs she found another sketch this time of the ruins of rievaulx abbey bare columns and broken walls towering against the clouds look at this she called to dominic who was carrying the last case up to the box room isnt it lovely he put the box away before coming to stand a little behind her his arm around her shoulder yes he agreed examining the picture carefully i like it very much he peered at the signature its his own did you see that his own she asked the bishop told me he painted he replied he didnt say how good he was though that has both power and grace to it at least i think so im looking forward to meeting him when he comes back she caught the edge of ruefulness in his voice those three weeks would go by too quickly and then they would have to return to london and the reverend spindlewood before that time he must somehow show that he was wise enough gentle enough and patient enough in listening to care for the village alone he must be passionate and original in his sermons not only to hold interest but also to feed the heart with the special message of christmas she knew this mattered to him intensely and that his belief in himself wavered only the total upheaval of his life had made him consider religious faith at all empty words of assurance from her would not help he already knew she believed in him and took it for granted that it was born of her love more than any realism i wonder if hell do any more drawing while hes away this time she said aloud i dont even know where hes gone she awoke the next morning to stand shivering in her nightgown and drew open the curtains onto a glistening white world the vicarage garden was surprisingly large and backed onto the woods the trees were dusted with snow in wildly intricate patterns like heavy lace against a leadgray sky and the pale light gave it an eerie luminous quality she breathed out slowly in amazement at its beauty momentarily forgetting to shiver she stared at the scene in rapture until suddenly she remembered there was housework to be done grates to clean out fires to be laid and lit and breakfast to be cooked and of course harry and etta to be fed she could not afford to wait for mrs wellbeloved to come a little after ten oclock when dominic was in the study reading some of the vicars notes and trying to familiarize himself with the parish there was a noise outside in the gravel drive harry came trotting out of the kitchen where he had been asleep by the stove his nose was in the air and his plumed tail was waving however he did not bark clarice snatched off her apron and went to open the door just as the knocker sounded she pulled it wide to see a man standing just back from the step he was a little above average height and apparently slender although under the weight of his winter coat it was hard to tell his face was fineboned not exactly handsome but full of intelligence and a wry sad wit his complexion was deep olive and his eyes had the liquid darkness that comes from the east when he spoke however his voice was as english as her own how do you do mrs corde i am peter connaught he gestured vaguely behind him from the manor house i wanted to welcome you to the village he held out his hand then glanced at the smooth leather glove and apologized pulling it off how do you do mr connaught she replied smiling at him that is most kind of you may i offer you a cup of tea its terribly cold this morning that would be most welcome he said with a nod i think its going to be a hard christmasfor weather but i hope not for anything else she stepped back and opened the door wider for him he came in glancing around as if perhaps the vicarage might have changed since he had been there last then he relaxed and smiled again reassured did he think they would have moved things in a night she took his coat and showed him into the sitting room grateful she had lit the fire early and it was pleasantly warm she noticed how again he looked around smiling at familiar things the pictures the way the furniture was arranged the worn chairs with their colors blending if you will excuse me i shall tell my husband you are here then i shall bring tea of course he inclined his head rubbing his hands together his polished boots were wet from the snow the wind had whipped color into his face she went to the study first and opened the door without knocking dominic mr connaught from the manor house is in the sitting room im just going to bring tea its very good of him to come isnt it he looked a little surprised yes and very quick there was a note of apprehension in his voice clarice heard it and was afraid he was anxious already that she might be too frank in her opinions too quick not only to see a better way of doing something but also to say so it had been known to happen before i suppose i should call upon his wife she will know all the women in the village and everything about them he didnt mention her she added biting her lip and looking straight into his eyes but i promise i shall behave perfectly i will find her delightful and extremely competent i swear even if she is a blithering idiot with a tongue like a dose of vinegar i really do promise he stood up just dont expect me to be there i couldnt keep a straight face he warned touching her cheek so lightly she barely felt it dont change too much i wouldnt care to be archbishop of canterbury if i had to lose the person you are in order to do it oh if you were archbishop of canterbury she said cheerfully i would probably say whatever i pleased everyone would be far too in awe of you to criticize me he rolled his eyes and went out to meet their guest she went into the kitchen happily to be loved for herself with all her dreams and vulnerabilities the mistakes and the virtues was the highest prize in life and she knew that when she returned with the tray of tea and biscuits she found both men seated by the fire talking they rose immediately dominic took the tray from her and set it down they exchanged the usual pleasantries she poured and passed connaught his cup then dominic sir peter has been telling me a little about the village dominic said catching her eye his family has been here for centuries she felt herself blush she had not known his title and had called him mister when she had asked him in she wondered if he was offended normally she would not have cared but all this mattered so much she was not impressed with peoples ancestors but this was not the time to say so she composed her face into an expression of interest really how fortunate you are to have deep roots in such a lovely place yes he agreed quickly it gives me a great sense of belonging and like all privileges it carries certain obligations but i believe they are a pleasure also i was very sad when i learned the reverend wynter was taking his holiday over christmas but now that we have you here i am sure it will be as excellent as always christmas is a great time for healing rifts forgiving mistakes and welcoming wanderers home how very well you express it dominic responded is that what the reverend wynter has said in the past or your own feeling sir peter looked slightly surprised even momentarily disconcerted my own why do you ask i thought it so well phrased i might ask you if i could use it dominic replied candidly i would like to say something truly appropriate in my watch night sermon which has to be as short as possible yet still have meaning but i cannot prepare it until i have at least a slight acquaintance with the village and the people sir peter leaned forward a little a very slight crease between his dark brows did the reverend wynter not tell you at least a little about us collectively and individually watching him clarice had the sudden certainty that the answer mattered to him far more than he wished them to know there was a tension in the lines of his body and the knuckles of his beautiful hands were white on his lap dominic appeared not to have noticed unfortunately i never met him he answered the request came to me through the bishop i gather the reverend wynters decision to take a holiday was made very quickly i see sir peter leaned back again and picked up his tea that is a trifle awkward for you whatever i can do i shall be more than happy to call upon me at any time perhaps you will dine with me at the hall one evening when you are settled in he looked at clarice i regret my hospitality will offer you no female company since my mother has passed away and i am not married but i promise to show you much that is of interest if you care for history art or architecture i can tell you stories of all manner of people good and evil tragic and amusing belonging to this village down the ages she did not have to pretend interest i think that would be infinitely more enjoyable than any feminine gossip i can imagine she replied and i will most certainly come he looked pleased as if the prospect excited him obviously he was enormously proud of his heritage and loved to share it to entertain people fill them with laughter and a little awe as well he looked at dominic i see you have moved the chessboard you do not play dominic glanced around he clearly had no idea where the chessboard had been you didnt sir peter said quickly it was already gone when you came yes i havent seen one he looked at clarice questioningly i havent seen it either she said did the reverend wynter play a look of pain burned deep in sir peters eyes with an effort he banished it he swallowed the last of his tea yes yes at one time he had a particularly beautiful set not black and white so much as black and gold the black was ebony and the gold that extraordinary shade that yew wood sometimes achieves almost metallic quite beautiful still he rose to his feet it hardly matters i just noticed because it was such a feature in the room the light caught it you know it sounds wonderful clarice responded because the silence demanded it but her mind was filled with the certainty that his reason for asking was nothing like as casual as he had said there was a depth of emotion in him that could not be explained by the mere absence of an artifact of beauty what more had it meant to him and why did he conceal it she still wondered as she also rose to her feet and followed him to the door thanking him again for his kindness in coming mrs wellbeloved arrived after luncheon carrying a large bag of potatoes which she set down on the kitchen table with a grunt of relief youll be needin em she said thank you clarice accepted telling herself that mrs wellbeloved meant it kindly and it would be most ungracious to tell her that she would rather have gone to the village shop and bought them herself three weeks was such a short time to get to know people so she could help dominic thank you she repeated that was very thoughtful we had a visitor this morning she carried the potatoes into the scullery followed hopefully by the dog who was ever optimistic about something new to eat come down here did he mrs wellbeloved said her round eyes wide with interest wispy eyebrows high well i never she picked up the longhandled broom and began to sweep the floor clarice returned to the kitchen harry still on her heels he said his family has been in the village for years she added tidying one of the cupboards and setting jams pickles savory jellies in some sort of order years mrs wellbeloved exclaimed i should say centuries more like since the normans came the way he tells it the normans really yes ten sixtysix you know mrs wellbeloved looked at her skeptically how could she be the lady she pretended if she did not know that clarice was amazed thats terribly impressive oh hes impressed mrs wellbeloved bent awkwardly and picked up the modicum of dust from the floor carefully pushing it into the dustpan come over with william the conqueror so he said an bin in this village since the year twelve hundred everyone knows that she made an expression of disdain then concealed it quickly reaching for the bucket putting it in the low stone sink and turning on the tap he didnt tell me that clarice felt a need to defend him although she had no idea why well theres a surprise then mrs wellbeloved turned off the tap and heaved the bucket out she looked at the floor skeptically dont seem too bad it isnt clarice replied we havent been here a whole day yet i really dont think you need to do it praps youre right ill just do the table then got to keep the table clean she took the scrubbing brush off its rack along with a large box of yellow kitchen soap knew his father sir thomas he was a real gentleman poor man why what happened to him went abroad he did mrs wellbeloved began scrubbing energetically slopping water all over the place wetting the entire surface of the table at once foreign parts somewhere out east dont recall if he ever said where exact fell in love and married she poked loose strands of hair back into their knot then she died when sir peter was only about five or six years old wonderful woman she was from all he says an very beautiful sir thomas were so cut up by it he came home and never went back there ever raised peter himself teaching him all about his family the land all that very close but never got over her death i spose sir peter didnt either he never married theres time yet clarice said quickly he looks no more than in his forties hell want to keep the line going the family surely mrs wellbeloved put her weight into the scrubbing her lips tight soapsuds flying she stepped sideways and nearly fell over the dog its his duty she agreed but he isnt doing it for all that maybe thats what it was all about what what was all about clarice asked unashamedly used to come here often mrs wellbeloved replied wringing out a cloth with powerful redknuckled hands twice a week most months played chess with the vicar reglar loved their game they did then he stopped all of a sudden about two years ago never came here since except it were business or with other folk vicar never said why but then he wouldnt could keep other folks secrets better than the grave he could you mean they quarreled clarice felt a stab of disappointment it seemed such a sad and stupid thing to do what quarrel could be so bad and last so long mrs wellbeloved jerked upright banging her elbow on the bucket which was still on the table she winced well it wouldnt be the reverend wynters fault an thats for certain he was the best man that ever lived in the village whether his family went back to the manor or the workhouse forgive anybody anything he would if it were against himself tried over and over to make it up with sir peter and sir peter werent having any of it she grunted fiercely but the vicar would never say a thing were right if it werent fear o gods in him like a great light it is mr cordes a very lucky man to be allowed to step in for him over christmas she nodded several times walk a few miles in the reverends footsteps an hell be the better man for it mark my words she savagely wiped half the table dry lifted the bucket onto the floor and wiped the other half wringing the cloth out several times clarice felt defensive of dominic but bit her tongue rather than say anything she needed mrs wellbeloved on their side she took a deep breath he seems to be a very remarkable man even for a vicar she said with as much humility as she could manage mrs wellbeloveds face softened that he is she agreed more gently man o god i say he deserves a holiday go off an do more of his paintings an drawings thats what he needs she looked clarice up and down and then turned away so her face was out of sight obliged you could come she sniffed choking off the emotion in her voice she picked up the bucket and threw the dirty water into the sink so hard it splashed up and a good deal of it went out again on either side waking the cat etta shook herself angrily and then curled up again nose in her tail clarice considered whether to wipe the water up for mrs wellbeloved and decided against it better to pretend she hadnt noticed instead she fetched etta a dry towel for her bed and put the kettle on for another cup of tea and then went to dust the hall not that it needed it there was a sharp drop in the temperature that evening and another heavy fall of snow dominic banked the fires high hoping they would stay burning most of the night so there would be at least some warmth left in the air by morning at dawn he looked out of his study window and saw the bleak beauty of the pale light but he knew it meant that no one could plow through the deep drifts to leave the villageand some would find it hard even to leave their home to fetch food this was where his ministry could begin he had no knowledge yet at which houses he would be welcome however and he could not afford even one mistake he was an outsider temporarily taking the place of a man he realized was deeply loved so far he had only one source of information mrs wellbeloved clarices exact words had been she has opinions about everything which shell share at the drop of a hat be busy about something else and even if shes talking complete nonsense for heavens sake dont argue with her local knowledge is her great achievement clarice was probably right dominic had not had to deal with maids before hed never even considered them it was time he did so he rose and went to find clarice who was busy in the kitchen warming two flatirons on the top of the range ready to iron his shirts which she had washed the day before cat and dog were squashed into one basket together by the stove dominic looked at clarice with a deep stab of guilt she was not beautiful in the traditional sense except for her eyes which were wide clear gray with dark lashes there was far too much character in her face too much readiness to laugh or lose her temper she was quick with her opinions and far too candid for a vicars wife and much too perceptive of the truth he could no longer count the times she had embarrassed him but she was also generous and swift to forgive she was without arrogance and he had never known her to make a promise and fail to keep it she could have married a man able to give her a large house and maids to look after her every need she could have had a carriage fashionable clothes and invitations in society could she really be as happy as she seemed face flushed apron around her waist testing the flatirons for temperature she looked up at him and smiled im going to see mrs wellbeloved he told her i need her advice as to whom i should call on in this weather shell know excellent idea she said approvingly then she frowned do be tactful with her wont you shes a funny creature he bit his lip to keep from laughing i had noticed that my dear wrap up well she advised its bitter outside id noticed that too he kissed her quickly on the cheek and before she could catch his arm he turned and went into the hall he put on his heavy boots a thick woolen scarf around his neck then his overcoat gloves and a hat even so he was unprepared for the blast of cold as he opened the front door instead of yesterdays chill in the air there was a slicing wind with the cruel edge of ice on it and the glare of light off the snow caused him to narrow his eyes he stepped out and heard the crunch of his own footsteps it would be very nice to change his mind and go back inside but he could not afford to part of being a vicar was not listening to the tempting little voice that told you another day would do or that there was somebody else to perform the task he was the man people looked to here to do the work of god and he must not fail he crossed the village green seeing only a few other footprints in the snow the pond was partially iced over the bench beside it deserted the air was gray the houses seemed to huddle down roofs pale thin trails of smoke smeared up against the sky only the blacksmiths glowing forge looked inviting beyond the village the woods were tangled branches of black here and there denser where the evergreens clustered palepatched where the snow clung he passed an old woman with a bundle of sticks and called good morning to her but her reply was mumbled and he could not make out her words he increased his pace and finally felt the warmth return to his body ten minutes later he was knocking on mrs wellbeloveds door and was relieved when she opened it and invited him in he stepped over the threshold into a dark warm hallway smelling of floor polish and smoke well now mr corde she said briskly she refused to call him vicar what can i do for you fraid youll have to manage the housework yourselves today got company coming like i said i need your advice mrs wellbeloved he replied watching her expression change immediately and guarding himself from smiling ah well that i can do mr corde what is it you need to know come in an sit a moment its my duty to spare you that long she led the way into a neat front parlor where a fire was just beginning to burn up mr wellbeloved a sturdy man with a weathered face and a shock of gray hair was sitting whittling a piece of wood into a whistle there was a pile of shavings on a piece of brown paper on the floor in front of him painted blocks were neatly stacked beside him when introductions were made and he had explained that he was carving christmas presents for the grandchildren dominic asked mrs wellbeloved for advice about whom he should visit he wrote down her answers with addresses in the notebook he had brought with him an youd best ask mr boscombe to add to that her husband put in helpfully lives at the end o the lane as you come in from the south a big house with three gables he was vicars right hand till about six months ago knew everything there was he did mrs wellbeloved nodded her agreement that he did an all good man mr boscombe hell see you right until about six months ago dominic questioned mr wellbeloved glared at his wife then back at dominic his knife stopped in midair thats right what happened then again they looked at each other dont know mrs wellbeloved answered thatd be between mr boscombe and the vicar give up all his church duties he did but still a good man an very friendly nothing whatever you could take against you go ask him hell tell you all as i cant and dominic had to be content with that he thanked them and made his way reluctantly out into the bitter air again with the directions they had given him he walked briskly the half mile against the wind to the large thatched house where john and genevieve boscombe lived with their four children he was welcomed in shyly but with a gentle warmth that made him immediately comfortable john boscombe was a lean quietly spoken man with fair hair which was thinning a little his wife was unusually pretty her skin was without blemish her smile quick and the fact that she was a little plump and her hair was definitely untidy seemed only to add to a sense of warmth dominic heard happy laughter from upstairs and at least three sets of feet running around a large dog of indeterminate breed was lying on the floor in the kitchen in front of the range and the whole room smelled of baking bread and clean linen there was a pile of sewing in a basket the bodice of which was obviously a dolls dress what can we do for you vicar boscombe asked a cup of tea for a start its turned cold enough to freeze the he stopped coloring faintly at a sharp look from his wife tea he repeated his blue eyes wide thank you very much dominic replied genevieve hastily moved a pile of folded laundry from one of the chairs and invited him to sit down at the kitchen table he did not need the explanation that this was the only warm room in the house people careful with money did not burn more fires than they had to he knew that with sharp familiarity there was the sound of a shriek and then giggles from upstairs i need your advice he said mrs wellbeloved tells me you were very close to the vicar and could advise me as to all the people i should keep a special care for those alone unwell in hard or unhappy circumstances of any kind im not asking for any confidences he added quickly seeing the look of anxiety in boscombes face only where i should begin and whom i must not overlook boscombe frowned did the vicar not tell you those things at the range genevieve turned to look at him the kettle still in her hand no dominic said regretfully i never actually met him the bishop directed me here i assume the reverend wynter advised him rather late perhaps his need to take a holiday arose very suddenlya relative ill or in need i was given no details i was happy to come oh boscombe looked surprised and oddly relieved that was very good of you he added hastily yes of course well both do anything we can to help thank you id like to talk to you a little about the vicars sermons particularly past christmases i dont want to repeat his words or his exact message but id like to be suddenly he was uncertain exactly what he meant familiar but original encouraging and new but not disturbing that was nonsense he needed to make up his mind decide between the safe and the daring was christmas supposed to be safe comfortable nothing more than the restating of old beliefs yes boscombe prompted dominic smiled selfconsciously appropriate this short time in cottisham mattered so much and he was making a mess of it being trite boscombe seemed to relax of course anything i can tell you but i havent beenin the vicars confidence for the last few months at least not as closely as i used to be but im sure i can help what advice did mrs wellbeloved give you ill see what i can add ive been here awhile and genevieve was born here and indeed he did giving dominic the color and flavor of the village life and in particular those who might have a needor the reverse be willing and able to help he spoke of them all with kindness but a cleareyed view of their vulnerabilities he also summarized several of the vicars more notable sermons but when dominic sat beside his own fire with clarice that evening hearing the wind moan in the eaves rising shrill and more insistent and harry snoring gently next to the hearth it was boscombes anxiety that came to his mind he tried to explain it to her but put into words it sounded so insubstantiala matter of hesitations that could as easily have been shyness or even a matter of discretionthat he felt foolish to have remembered it at all he asked after her day how she was finding the house and if the work was onerous he knew she would say it was not whatever the truth of it he admired her for that and was grateful but it only increased his sense of guilt that he could not give her the standard of comfort she had been used to before they were married oh very good she said wearily its a lovely house she drew in her breath to add something then changed her mind he knew what she had been going to saythat she wished they could stay there it was far nicer than the grim accommodation they had in london of course spindlewood and his wife had the vicarage in the back of dominics mind he was always aware of how callous he had been to his first wife in the long past he had not thought of it as a betrayal at the time but it had been deeply and bitterly so perhaps if he had been loyal to her with or without love she would not have been murdered he did not deserve such a second chance looking at clarice sitting in the chair opposite him the cat in her lap her face grave he was overwhelmed with gratitude except for harry she said still answering his question hes fine now but hes been sulking on the back doorstep half the day perhaps he wanted to go out he started to rise to his feet no he didnt i know enough to let a dog out now and then she protested hed only just come in he sat there most of the time or wandered around the kitchen pawing at the doors all of them even cupboards could he have been hungry he suggested dominic i fed him he tries the hall cupboard and the cellar not just the cupboards with food in i think he really misses the vicar he sat back in his chair again i suppose so i expect hell settle the cats certainly happy she gave him a quick smile stroking etta who needled her lap happily with her claws then went back to sleep dominic leaned forward and poked the fire sending sparks up the chimney clarice was rightit was a lovely house there was almost a familiarity about it as if at some far distant time he had lived here before and he would know instinctively where everything was it was like coming home to some origin so far back he had forgotten he belonged here the third morning it was even colder clarice could see the village pond from the front door when dominic went out to begin his visiting the surface was icing over and a dusting of white snow made most of it indistinguishable from the banks harry went charging out into it and had to be brought back his chest and tummy caked with snow and then dried off in front of the kitchen stove loving the attention clarice did not expect mrs wellbeloved today after feeding harry and etta she set about the sweeping and dusting straightaway as much to keep warm and busy as from any need for it to be done the sitting room fire would have to be cleaned out and relit of course but since the ashes were still warm it would be foolish to remove them before time it was a waste of coal to light it simply for herself when she could perfectly easily sit in the kitchen one day soon she would have to clean out the kitchen stove completely polish the steels with emery paper bath brick and paraffin blacklead the iron parts and then polish them then wash and whiten the hearthstone but it did not have to be today such a job should really be begun at six in the morning so she could get it set and relit in time for breakfast she was still thinking about it with dislike when the doorbell jangled and she went out into the hall to answer it a woman was standing on the step she was muffled in a heavy wellcut cloak and had a shawl over her head but from what clarice could see of her she was about forty she had a handsome face with wide brown eyes a short upper lip and a round rather heavy chin mrs corde she inquired she had a pleasant voice but not the local accent yes may i help you i rather thought i might help you the woman replied my name is mrs paget i know the reverend wynter and i know the village quite well i imagine many people are willing to do all they can especially at christmas but you might not know who is good at which thingsflowers baking and so on oh thank you clarice said gratefully please come in i would be most obliged for any advice at all she held the door open wide mrs paget stepped in as if it was all very familiar and clarice had the sudden feeling that perhaps she had been here many times possibly since john boscombe had withdrawn from his church duties she had in some practical ways taken over clarice led the way to the kitchen explaining that she had not lit the sitting room fire yet and offered a cup of tea etta bristled at the intrusion and shot past clarice and up the stairs mrs paget gave a little cry of surprise im sorry clarice apologized shes a very odd cat i think both animals miss the reverend wynter the dog is in and out like a fiddlers elbow and nothing seems to satisfy the cat ive fed her given her milk set up a warm place to lie but she just sits there like an owl im afraid i dont know animals very well mrs paget took off her cloak and shawl and arranged herself on one of the hardbacked chairs by the table adjusting her skirts i cant offer any advice i expect you are correct and they are missing the reverend wynter he is a wonderful man very charming and utterly trustworthy he knows everybodys secrets all their private doubts and griefs and never whispered a word to anyone i was happy to help him in any way i could but even to me he never gave so much as a hint of what needed to remain unsaid admirable clarice agreed filling the kettle and setting it on the hob and absolutely necessary all i really would like to know is who is gifted at what practical skilland of course who is not she gave mrs paget a quick smile oh quite mrs paget eased quickly smiling back with a flash of understanding that can be every bit as much a disaster at all costs avoid mrs lampeters baking and mrs porters soup never give mrs unsworth the flowers she only has to touch lilies and they go brown they both laughed then settled in to discuss matters of skill tact need and general usefulness i imagine youll want to have a celebration for the whole village round about christmas itself boxing day perhaps mrs paget said firmly clarice understood immediately of course she agreed it would be the best possible thing i would appreciate your guidance as to how it has been done here in the past and what people like not every place is the same mrs paget smiled with satisfaction id be delighted mince pies naturally with plenty of raisins sultanas and candied peel plum pudding and cream best be discreet with the brandy but a bit is always nice gives a good flame when you light it and cake naturally clarices heart sank at the prospect of so much cooking in the home she had grown up in her mother had enjoyed a full kitchen staff to attend to such things mrs pagets brown eyes were watching her intently if you would allow me to id be happy to help she offered its a lot for one person and i enjoy cooking clarice felt a weight of anxiety slip from her thank you she said sincerely harry remained sulking in the corner and etta never reappeared dominic returned for luncheon then went out again clarice spent the afternoon going through various cupboards seeing what polishes brushes and so on she could find and if she could repack them a little more tidily so as to make more room it was annoying to open a cupboard door and have the contents slide out around your feet or worse fall on top of you from the shelf above in the middle of the afternoon she cleaned out and lit the fire in the sitting room to warm it for dominics return he was bound to be frozen earlier she had made hot soupbetter she hoped than mrs porters she was tidying the bookshelves behind the sofa in the sitting room when she came across a leatherbound bible its pages were goldedged but very well used as if it was someones personal possession rather than one for general reference she opened it and saw the vicars name on the front page dated some fifty years ago she ruffled the pages and saw tiny handwritten notes in the margins particularly in the book of isaiah and the four gospels of the new testament she had to carry them to the window for enough light to read them they were very personal there was a passion and an honesty in them that made her stop reading they were too intimate a mans reminder to himself not to others she stood in the fading winter sun the light graying outside the fire burning up behind her why had he not taken this with him an accidental omission surely it did not belong in this room in his bedroom if not with him he must have left it out to pack and somehow overlooked it she should find his address and send it on to him the postal service was good it would get to him in a day or two at the outside her mind made up she went into the study and looked for the address of the reverend wynters holiday dwelling it took her only ten minutes she was surprised it was an area of norfolk she knew quite well with beautiful wide skies and open beaches facing the north sea it would be a wonderful place for him to create more of his pictures it was famous for its artists she smiled imagining him drinking in its splendor and then striving to capture it on paper then she read the address again it was a small hotel in one of the seaside villages but she had been there herself two years agoand the hotel was closed turned into a private house he could not be there it must be a mistake an address from a previous holidayalthough she had seen no pictures in the house that could be from that region she would have to put on her coat and boots and go and ask mrs wellbeloved no doubt she would have the correct address she must send him his scriptures but mrs wellbeloved had no idea where the vicar might be if he was not at that hotel she was very sorry and not a little annoyed also to have been misled clarice should try sir peter she could think of no one else the light was waning in the winter dusk but to the northwest the clouds had cleared as she approached the manor house the sun burned low and spread a tide of scarlet across the snow she came to the gates formal wrought iron between magnificent gate quoins with heraldic gryphons on each she tried them and they opened easily she walked up the curved gravel driveway until she came around the clipped trees and saw the magnificent façade of the early tudor house with its mullioned windows and cloistered chimneys the gardens were formal herbs flowers and low hedges carefully nurtured into the complicated patterns of an elizabethan knot garden i bet theres a maze somewhere to the back she thought beyond the old cedars at the side and the oaks she felt a little presumptuous walking up and knocking on the front door uninvited but her reason was compelling the reverend wynter would need his bible his own copy not something lent to him by a strangersomething with his passions his dreams and his understandings written in over the years she knocked and waited the purple cloud banners were a pall over the embers of the setting sun nothing happened then in the fastfading light she noticed a gryphons head to one side and realized it was an elaborate bellpull she tried it and a few moments later a butler appeared he was an elderly gentleman with white hair and a thin ascetic face with a surprising flash of humor in it yes maam may i help you she stood on the step shivering i am clarice corde wife of the vicar who is taking the reverend wynters place this christmas she began indeed maam sir peter spoke of you would you care to come in its a distinctly chilly evening distinctly she agreed through chattering teeth yes i need to ask sir peters advice if i may of course the butler stepped back took her cloak and shawl and conducted her into the withdrawing room which was paneled in oak with a coffered ceiling a magnificent arras hung on the wall and the fire burning in the hearth was big enough to have roasted a pig on a spit above the flames sir peter was sitting in a huge leather armchair by the blaze and he stood up the moment she came in the butler offered her tea which she accepted she took the seat opposite sir peter what may i do to help he asked her she told him of finding the bible and then the address that she knew could not be correct i wondered if you know where he had really gone she finished i think he will miss his own scriptures and i would like to send them to him indeed he said frowning now how odd that he should forget to pack such a thing no doubt it was an oversight he will be searching for it already but i am afraid i dont know where he went in fact i did not even know he was going it was a surprise to me i would have wished him a good journey i am sorry i didnt there was gentleness in his voice and a softness of genuine regret in his eyes looking at him clarice was suddenly aware of how deeply fond of the reverend wynter he must have been and that perhaps he was more hurt by the rift between them than he admitted you have no idea where else he goes she pressed i could at least write a letter if he writes back i shall know where to send the bible i must not risk losing it no he leaned forward you must keep it safely please dont risk it unless you are absolutely certain where he is family bibles matter intensely so many memories could you not be mistaken about this hotel no she had no doubt about it she had been sorry and inconvenienced to find it changed herself she told him of her experience she did not mention that it had been the vicars personal bible not a family one a shadow flickered across his face with its delicate lines i see no there seems to be no room for error im sorry i really dont know where else he might have gone i wish i could offer help the branch of the tree burning in the grate settled a little and a shower of sparks flew up the vast chimney she looked around at the age and beauty of the room and wondered how many generations of connaughts had sat here hearing the stories of the village helping protecting disciplining governing and probably using and taxing as well walls like these had seen england s history unfolding since before the spanish armada had sailed in the time of queen elizabeth perhaps even henry viii had visited here with one of his six wives or walsingham had sent out his spies there would be a priest hole behind that fireplace for fugitive catholics when they were hunted and burned which side had the connaughts been on in the civil war or the bloodless revolution sir peter was smiling at her his eyes bright again in the firelight would you like to see the house he asked it would be my pleasure to show you id love to she said sincerely he guided her through it all with a kind of gentle pride she found endearing he did not boast except once and then immediately apologized for it as though it had been a breach of good manners you have a right to be proud she said honestly it is so beautiful and obviously it has been loved over the centuries thank you for your generosity in showing me he looked pleased even a little selfconscious are you sure you wish to walk home alone it is now quite dark oh certainly she said with confidence it is only a mile or so still i would rather accompany you at least as far as the village green i would be happier she did not argue when she was within sight of the vicarage lights which were already familiar to her he bade her good night and turned back toward the manor clarice went another few yards then saw the dark outline of a figure coming toward her leaning into the wind and huddling a shawl around her it was so small and walked with such tiny hurried steps it had to be a woman good evening clarice said clearly thinking the woman had not seen her and was in danger of bumping into her unless she moved off the path into the snow oh my dear you gave me a fright the woman exclaimed i was quite lost in my own thoughts since i dont know you you must be the new vicars wife yes i am clarice corde clarice held out her hand how do you do the woman responded her voice was husky and a little cracked but it must have been rich in her youth my name is sybil towers she went on holding out a small hand in a woolen mitten welcome to cottisham i am sure you will be happy here we all love the reverend wynter and we will make you comfortable too mrs towers clarice said impulsively you dont know where the reverend wynter went for his holiday do you i have found something he left behind and i would very much like to send it after him but the only address i have is not for this year no im afraid i have no idea she responded in fact i didnt even know he was going away im so sorry it would be inexcusable to keep the old lady standing outside in the rising wind any longer so clarice dismissed it wished her good night and hurried on to the vicarage dominic was at home and intensely relieved to see herso much so that she found no suitable opportunity to tell him about the bible or the fact that she could find no one who knew the vicars holiday address the morning was milder and thick wet snow blanketed everything even the air swirled in white flurries blocking out the village green so that the houses at the farther side were all but invisible it was a world of movement and shadows seen through a haze dominic left to go visit the sick and the lonely and clarice began the necessary duties of housework there was no point in thinking of doing laundry beyond shirts and underclothing nothing else would dry she should air the vicars bedroom closed rooms especially in this weather could come to smell stale she did not wish him to return to that stuffy unoccupied feeling the cat pattered around behind her poking her nose into everything and giving her the uncomfortable suspicion that there could be mice here after all harry had gone back to sleep in front of the range in the kitchen as if he was still sulking he had been outside first thing with dominic but now he refused to wag his tail or in any other way respond the first thing she noticed in the bedroomafter opening the windows briefly just to let the cold sweet air circulatewas a stark drawing of bare trees in the snow there was no color in it at all and yet there was a grace to the lines that held her attention she stared at it so long she grew cold then realized the window was still open she shut it quickly and returned to the picture it was another of the vicars own drawings she had begun to recognize his style even before she read his signature in the corner she was glad the vicarage had been designed for a family and was large enough that they had not needed to use this room it belonged to the reverend wynter and he should not have to move his belongings to make way for them she looked around it with pleasure amazed that she could feel such a liking for a man she had never met people spoke so well of him he was obviously a man of great compassion but that might not be personal so much as part of his calling it was the delicacy the simple grace of his drawings that showed his nature he saw extraordinary beauty in a bare branch the tiny twigs against the light the strength of a trunk stripped of its summer glory powerful in its nakedness she gazed around the walls at the other pictures each was different and yet all had the same inner qualities she wondered if he was busy now creating more was he out walking in the snow somewhere in east anglia selecting just the right scene under the wide norfolk skies perhaps he would draw the bare coastline and the sea grasses the windriven skies clouds dragged out in long streamers above the line of the waves reluctantly she made certain the windows were fastened securely and then went back downstairs she was tidying the study when she came across a carefully sharpened softleaded pencil sitting on top of the chest of narrow drawers near the window her first thought was that dominic had unintentionally sharpened one of the vicars pencils before realizing what it was she should put it away perhaps it belonged in one of the drawers she opened the top one to see and found a dozen more pencils there all sharpened there were also charcoals of various thickness white pencils erasers and a sharp bladein fact all one needed for drawing were they extras she closed the drawer and opened the one below it was full of unused blocks of watercolor artists paper he must have a great deal if he had this much to leave behind without thinking she pulled open the cupboard door with a sudden chill she saw an easel neatly folded how could he not have taken it with him this and his pencils were the tools of his art mystified she went back up to his bedroom and shamelessly opened the wardrobe door there were only four pairs of boots inside smart black boots for sundays a pair of brown boots a second pair of black boots definitely older and stout walking boots for country wear up to the ankles thicksoled such as one would choose on a day like this there were winter clothes hanging on the rail as well including an extremely nice woolen overcoatnot city wear more casualwith a collar to turn up against the worst weather it was just the sort of coat a man would like for walking in the country or by the sea why had he not taken it with him and the boots and for that matter the stout walking stick leaning against the wall in the corner to forget the bible might be an oversight even the pencils or paper but not the winter clothes as well there was something wrong he had left in haste and not for pleasure as he had said was it some family emergency or bereavement would he be gone until the situation whatever it was had been resolved had he a brother or sister in some kind of trouble possibly it was a sudden and serious illness when dominic returned home late and cold to the bone she started to tell him then realized he was not listening to her he heard her words but not their meaning he was too deep in his own fear that he could not find something new and powerful to say to the people of this village for him to hear the anxiety within her and it would be sunday in two days and his first sermon here they are good people he said standing in the sitting room with his back to the fire which burned brightly thawing the cold that chilled and numbed his flesh they know their scriptures at least as well as i do the vicar has preached to them with passion and eloquence not only at christmas but all through the year there was a shadow in his eyes a tightness across his cheeks what can i say to them that will be anything more than an echo of what he has already said he asked her any one of them could stand up in the pulpit and tell the christmas story as well as i can clarice what can i say to make it new she saw the spark of fear in his eyes the knowledge that he might not be equal to the task that mattered to him so much this village was old comfortable and secure in its habits it was not conscious of any hunger that needed filling any ignorance or darkness waiting for light the townspeople wanted to stay as they were and be reassured that all was well anyone could do that pass and leave no mark at all like wind over water she ached to be able to help him she was seeing for the first time the need in him not desire to do a job or fulfill a duty but a hunger to succeed that would not let him rest or leave him free from pain if he failed whats the best thing about christmas she asked trying to strip away the trite all the things that had already been said what does it really mean to us whatwhat is it for its not goodwill a brief time of peace or generosity it has to be more than that its the beginning of our faith he replied christ coming into the world he said it as if it were obvious i know she felt crushed but what for she insisted why was everything different afterward the fire was scorching him and he stepped away from it im not exactly sure how to answer that he replied it soundsit sounds too much like an academic answer and thats not what they need clarice i need a spiritual answer a joy in the soul she could think of nothing better to add she was failing him and feeling empty she turned and went into the kitchen clarice woke to find a white world silent deep in snow the air was motionless and when she opened the back door into the garden to let harry out the bitter cold of it was sharp in her lungs she drew in her breath in amazement at the beauty of it the old apple tree was laden like an extravagant blossom other trees soaring upward were naked too thin to hold the snow shining against an enamel sky but it was a dangerous beauty a cold that paralyzed a depth of snow that soaked heavy skirts and exhausted old or fragile limbs the low winter sun was almost blinding she closed the door and turned to find dominic standing behind her a rueful smile on his face youre going out she said more as a statement than a question she wished he did not have to but if he had found excuses to stay at home she would have been even more deeply disappointed what use was preaching or praying if one was not willing to act ill try not to be long he answered but therell be people who shouldnt go out in this even to fetch wood never mind to get bread or milk i know she gave him a quick kiss hugging him tightly for a moment then going back to the kitchen to tidy up it was warm in there and she had hot water which made her more fortunate than many however in the middle of the morning she found with surprise that the coal bucket beside the stove was empty and the coke scuttle as well she would have to go down to the cellar to fetch more what was left would not last her until dominic returned she picked up the scuttle and went to the hall the cellar door was locked but she had the key on the big household ring and it opened with ease a rush of chilled air engulfed her immediately making her shiver and step back there was a swish past her ankles and etta disappeared down the steps into the darkness mice clarice said in disgust i suppose its your job but you really are a nuisance well im not taking a candle down there itll blow out and then ill not even find my way back she put down the coke scuttle and went to look for a lantern she knew there was one in the scullery by the back door she found it lit it settled the glass to protect the flame and then returned etta was nowhere to be seen it was no more than a tenminute job to fill the coke scuttle take it back up to the kitchen and then fill the coal bucket for the sitting room fire as well etta she called encouragingly come on etta theres a nice warm fire for you up here and ill give you some fresh milk better than mice the only sound was harrys feet on the hall floor he came padding through looking interested at last his head on one side eyebrows cocked shes gone down there after mice clarice explained then thought how absurd she was being talking to the animal as if he understood actually she was ridiculously pleased that at last he was taking more notice of her he went to the door slithered through the opening and disappeared down the steps fetch her back up clarice called after him im not leaving this door open all morning its far too cold she stood hopefully for several minutes but neither of them reappeared drat she said fiercely she was now thoroughly chilled and rapidly losing patience but she really did not feel as if she could close them in this was their home she was the interloper impatiently she picked up the lantern and went down the steps again neither harry nor etta was visible she held the light higher and up near the far corner which was where she found the rather narrow entrance to the second cellar they must be in there more mice no doubt she had not known that dogs ate mice too or perhaps he was just curious she went through the doorway her skirts brushing against the sides now she would be covered in coal dust perhaps it would brush off without staining but then it would still need sweeping up harry she said sharply etta she held the lantern forward and saw them immediately standing side by side ettas tail was up and bristling harrys tail down unhappily he let out a long low wail then she saw the crumpled heap beyond them dark but quite definitely not coal her stomach clenched and her hand shook so the light danced unevenly she moved forward until it was all horribly clear an elderly man lay faceup on the rubble remains of an old coal heap his eyes were closed his gaunt features smeared with dust and dark with what might have been bruises a gash was scored across his nose but any blood had long since dried and darkened clarice breathed in shakily gasping the heat drained out of her body as if sucked away the cat and dog were so close they seemed to be touching each other as though for comfort she did not need to question if that was their master the dogs repeated low howl of grief was answer enough anyway who else could it be even smeared with coal dust the white of his clerical collar was clearly visible there was no question if there was anything she could do for him it was perfectly obvious there was not slowly her knees wobbling the lantern swaying she fumbled her way back up the steps again and then stood gulping air at the top she grasped the door lintel in the gray daylight she must report the death the poor old man had probably had a heart attack or something of that sort everyone thought he had gone away so no one would have missed him and gone to look what a bitterly sad way for a vicar of all people to die from everyones account he had been a fine man and deeply and justly loved she could wait for dominic to return but in this weather he could be a long time doing all that was necessary she did not want to stay here alone knowing what was downstairs she was perfectly capable of putting on boots and a cape and going to find the doctor herself she knew where he lived that was one of the things mrs wellbeloved had told her it was a stiff walk but along open road all the way she would make it in half an hour even in the snow and he might have a pony and trap for the way back extinguishing the lantern she left the cellar door wedged open so harry and etta could come out if they chose or stay and mourn if that was their nature perhaps that was more fitting anyway she rather hoped they would then she put on the boots wrapped herself around in her cloak and set out her mind so filled with pity she scarcely noticed either the cold or the way the deep snow dragged at her feet heart attack i expect poor man dr fitzpatrick told her coming back up the steps and closing the cellar door behind him the cat and dog had come upstairs again persuaded with some difficulty and were now sitting side by side in front of the kitchen stove only comfort is he probably felt very little fitzpatrick went on he was a fussy man with a large mustache are you all right mrs corde horrible experience for you what on earth were you doing down there she had already explained to him or she thought she had perhaps she had been more incoherent than she supposed i went to fill the coke scuttle and the cat came too and then i couldnt find her he nodded smelled something i suppose or perhaps just after the mice he held up his coalsmeared hands oh im sorry she apologized quickly please come into the kitchen and wash and perhaps youd like a cup of tea she glanced down at his trouser legs sodden where the snow on them had melted in the warmth of the house then her own heavy wet skirts yes he said with alacrity thank you she busied herself with water in the kettle warming the teapot fetching milk from a very chilly pantry and offering him a slice of cake which he made an excuse for accepting as well ill take care of the arrangements he said with his mouth full i daresay they wont be able to hold a funeral for a few days considering the weather and what the bishop might care to do but ill have the body removed and all the appropriate registrations dealt with you dont need to concern yourself mrs corde i will take care of it all and i would be obliged if you would speak of this to no one yet there is a proper order of things which we must observe thank you she felt relieved but more than a little sad it was a lonely and undignified way to go not that she supposed he was more than briefly aware of it he had lived well very well and in the end that was all that mattered thank you she repeated no doubt my husband will be in touch with the bishop he mayhe may wish us to remain a little longer she realized as she said the words how much she hoped that he woulda lot longer perhaps always it was ten minutes later with the doctor on his second cup of tea when dominic came in slamming the front door behind him and striding down the hall shedding snow everywhere clarice he called urgently fear edging his voice sharply clarice she came to the door immediately and almost ran into him his coat was wet his face whipped red by the cold his eyes frightened as soon as he saw her he was flooded with relief someone told me you sent for the doctor urgently what is it were they wrong she could not help smiling it was wonderful and still faintly surprising to her that he should care so intensely im perfectly well she said almost all the shiver gone out of her voice i went for coke in the cellar and the cat got into another cellar beyond i found the vicars body the poor man must have gone down there and had a heart attack i felt the doctor was the best person to inform she met his eyes looking to see if he understood what she had done he was momentarily shocked dead the reverend wynter you mean he has been down there all the time yes dont look like that she added gently she touched his hand there was nothing we could have done for him the doctor drank the last of his tea and came into the hall fitzpatrick he said introducing himself you must be the reverend corde sad thing to happen so sorry your poor wife had to be the one to find him he shook his head but ill take care of all the details perhaps youd just give me a hand to carry the poor old man up the steps then i can fetch the blacksmiths cart and have him taken away my trap is rather too small you know yes of course dominic replied quickly beginning to take off his heavy outdoor coat it was an awkward job up the cellar stairs and required both men so clarice walked in front of them with the lantern on the way back up she moved ahead and laid a clean blanket on the kitchen table so they could put him down gently on it as soon as it was accomplished the doctor went to find the blacksmith i think i should clean him up a bit clarice said very quietly her throat ached and she found it hard to swallow dominic offered to do it but she insisted laying out the dead was a job for women she would wash the coal dust from his head and face and hands she did it with hot soapy water very gently as if he could still feel pain he had had fine features aquiline and sensitive but they were hollow now in death there was a bad scrape on his nose as if he had struck it fallingand yet they had found him on his back and to reinforce that fact there was a deep gash in the back of his head he must have gone down hard in straightening his legs clarice also noticed that his trousers were slightly torn at the shins and the skin underneath abraded and bruised how did he do that she said curiously it happened before he died dominic said quietly people dont bruise after the heart stops he must have stumbled as he went down the steps perhaps he wasnt feeling very well even then i wonder why he went down at all she said thoughtfully pulling the fabric straight the buckets of coal and coke were all full i expect mrs wellbeloved filled them he pointed out she looked at him almost apologetically if shed gone down there and he had the buckets with him then why didnt she find him what are you suggesting clarice i dont know she admitted i just wondered why he went down there and nobody knew they thought he had gone away on holiday he answered we all did she frowned why why did the bishop think he was going on holiday because he wrote and told him dominic said she said nothing something made her more than sad but she wasnt sure what it was there was a voice at the door calling out urgently dominic turned and went back to the hall what is it can i help oh vicar it was a mans voice deep and unfamiliar poor mrs hapgoods had bad news and shes that upset i dont know what to do for her can you come dreadful state shes in poor thing dominic hesitated turning back toward clarice she knew how much it mattered this was their chance to prove they could do everything that a parish needed yes of course you can she said firmly there was no need to tell this man that the reverend wynter was dead he had his own griefs to aid first theres nothing here i cant take care of oh bless you maam the man in the hall said fervently this way vicar the doctor came back with the blacksmith and his cart and the two men carried the body out quickly and discreetly wrapped in a blanket after they had gone clarice went back to the kitchen and washed the few dishes they had used her mind whirling there was something wrong she could not put her finger on it standing here at the bench she would have to go down to the cellar again and yet she was reluctant to it was more than the cold or even the memory of what she had found come on harry she said briskly come keep me company she relit the lantern and the dog surprisingly obeyed her it was the very first time he had done as shed asked together they went to the door and opened it she went first down the steps very carefully and he followed behind a little more than halfway he stopped and sniffed what is it she said gulping her hand swaying so the light gyrated around the walls harry sniffed again and looked up at her swallowing hard she retraced her steps up to him and bent to examine what hed spotted it was a very small piece of fabric no more than a few threads caught in a splinter of the wood at first she thought how odd it was that the dog had noticed it then she saw the smear of blood it wasnt much darker than the coalsmudged steps themselves but when she licked her finger and touched it it came away red was this where the vicar had stumbled and then gone on down the rest of the way to the bottom how could she find out she held the lantern so she could see the steps closely they were dark with years of troddenin coal dust each bit dropped from a bucket or scuttle carried up full no matter how closely she looked all she could distinguish were the most recent marks a heel dent and the smear of a sole they could have been anybodys dominics the doctors even mrs wellbeloveds she went to the bottom and looked again not expecting to find anything or knowing what it would mean even if she did then she saw it a small neat pattern of marks she understood very easilycat prints etta had been this way she walked after the marks for no real reason except that they led to the second cellar they were easy to read because they were on plain ground as if someone had swept all the old marks away with a broom why would anybody sweep just a single track no more than eighteen or twenty inches wide it was not even clean just brushed once several times it was disturbed at the sides by footprints then she understood it was not sweptthese were drag marks someone had pulled something heavy covered in cloth from the bottom of the stairs over into the second cellar could the reverend wynter have fallen struck his head and become confused mistaken where he was and dragged himself in the wrong direction no that was idiotic there were no handprints in the dust and his hands would have been filthy when they found him they werent only smudges here and therethe backs as much as the palms she was in the second cellar now when she had found him he had been lying on his back but his nose had been scraped as if he had fallen forward and there was coal dust on his front as well as his back the hard deep wound was on the back of his head somebody killed him harry she said softly putting her hand out to touch the dogs soft fur somebody hit him on the head and dragged him in here and then left him why would they do that he was an old man whom almost everyone loved the dog whined and leaned his weight against her leg i dont suppose you know and even if you do you cant tell me she was talking to him because it was so much better not to feel alone ill have to find out without you well have to she corrected ill tell dominic when he comes back right now in case anybody calls i think we should pretend that we dont know anything at all come on its cold down here and we shouldnt stay anyway it isnt safe when dominic returned from his visits tired and cold she had no alternative but to tell him immediately it was already midafternoon there would be little more than an hour before the light began to fade and the ground froze even harder what he said incredulously sitting at the kitchen table his hands thawing as he held the cup of tea she had made are you sure yes i am sure she said looking at him steadily im not being overimaginative dominic remember the marks on his face and head remember how little coal dust there was on his hands or on his knees but there was a tear on the shin of his trousers and dust where he had been dragged go down to the cellar and look its still there he hesitated please she urged i dont want to be the only one who saw it anyway i dont think the doctor is going to listen to me she was perfectly correctdr fitzpatrick did not believe either of them that suggestion is preposterous he said irritably pulling on his mustache it is a perfectly ordinary domestic tragedy an elderly man had a heart attack and fell down the cellar stairs or perhaps he simply tripped and then the shock of the fall brought on an attack he was confused naturally perhaps hurt and he mistakenly crawled in the wrong direction you are trying to make a horror out of something that is merely sad and if i may say so that is a completely irresponsible thing to do clarice took a deep breath facing his anger what did he go into the cellar for she asked my dear mrs corde surely that is perfectly obvious fitzpatrick snapped exactly the same reason as you did yourself for coal she met his gaze steadily i took a lantern and a coal bucket and i left the door open at the top she replied then perhaps he went for some other reason fitzpatrick said didnt you say something about the dog he must have gone to look for it why would you go to look for anything in a cellar without a lantern dominic pressed it doesnt make sense he probably stood at the top and called fitzpatrick was becoming more and more annoyed his face was tight lips thin reverend you are a guest here in view of poor wynters death it will possibly be for far longer than you had originally intended you are now required to guide the village through a sad and very trying time as shepherd of the people it is your calling to sustain comfort and uplift them not indulge in what i have to say is idle and vicious speculation on the death of a deeply loved man i am sorry that it falls to my lot to remind you of this dont make it necessary for me to take it further dominics face flamed but he turned and left without retaliation he could not afford it as the doctor had reminded him clarice went with him not daring to meet fitzpatricks eyes in case he saw in hers the rage she also felt toward him he had humiliated dominic and that she had no idea how to heal so she could not forgive him for it as she went out into the snow she remembered her father telling her that if you sought wealth or fame other people might dislike you for it but if you sought only to do good no one would be your enemy how wrong he was good held a mirror to other peoples hearts and the reflection was too often unflattering people could hate you for that more than for almost anything else she caught up with dominic and linked her arm through his holding on to him when he tried to pull back he was ashamed because he had not found a way to stand up for the truth she struggled for something to say that would make it better not worse if she were to sound superficial it would be worse than silence it would be patronizing as if she thought him not strong enough to face their failure yet she ached to comfort him if she could not at least do that what use was she im sorry she said a trifle abruptly i shouldnt have urged you to speak to him so quickly perhaps if we had waited until tomorrow and thought harder we might have persuaded him no we wouldnt he said grimly he doesnt want to think that anyone would kill the reverend wynter i dont want to either she said hotly i hate thinking it but i have to follow what my sense tells me and i dont believe one goes into the cellar alone in the dark to fetch coal to look for a cat or dog or anything else if hed fallen down then mrs wellbeloved would have found him the door would have been open maybe when she came in the front door the wind slammed the cellar door shut he suggested it faces the other way she pointed out it would have blown it wider open well what do you think did happen he asked they were walking side by side along the road their feet making the only tracks in the new snow in the east the sky was darkening i think someone came in and said or did something to make him go into the cellar then pushed him she answered when he was at the bottom perhaps crumpled over stunned they hit him on the back of the head hard enough to kill him whether they meant that or not although i cant see why they would do it unless they intended him to die they could hardly explain it away her mind was racing the rising wind was edged with ice and she blinked against it then they dragged him into the other cellar so he wouldnt be found too soon why he interrupted what difference would it make so nobody would know when it happened of course the ideas came to her as she spoke that way nobody could have been proved to be here at the right time then they closed the door and probably took his cases away so people would think he had already gone on his holiday only they forgot about his painting thingsand his favorite bible he was frowning do you really think so why that doesnt sound like a quarrel in the heat of somesome dispute its perfectly deliberate and coldblooded yes it is she agreed reluctantly i suppose he must have known something about one of the people here that was so terrible to them they couldnt afford to trust that he would never tell anyone he couldnt tell dominic argued they would know that not if it was confessed to him no priest would then maybe it wasnt confessed to him she would not let go of the idea perhaps he found it out some other way he knew lots of things about all sorts of people he would have to hes been here in cottisham for ages he must have seen a great deal what could possibly be worth killing over he was putting up a last fight against believing i dont know she admitted but he wrote to the bishop saying he was going on holiday he pointed out so he obviously intended to is that coincidence did he she asked or did someone else write copying his hand it wouldnt be too difficult and if the bishop didnt look closely or compare it with other letters it would be easy enough and plenty of people in the village could have letters or notes the reverend wynter had written at one time or another dominic said nothing trudging steadily through the snow the light was fading rapidly the shadows under the trees were already impenetrable thats what we have to find out she insisted quietly her voice heavy with the burden of what she was thinking she would very much rather have been able to say they should let it go pretend they had never known but it would be a lie that would grow sharper all the time like a blister on the tender skin of ones feet christ was kind he forgave she went on but he never moderated the truth to make people like him or pretended that something was all right when it wasnt because that would be easier i think the reverend wynter was killed for something he knew what do you think really she took a deep breath and let it out slowly ill do whatever you decide that was so difficult for her to say he gave an almost jerky little laugh you cant do that clarice youd grow to hate me i think he was probably killed either way i cant pretend i dont know the reverend wynter deserves better and if someone did kill him then they deserve better too they need justice more than he does justice heals in the end if you allow it to he walked a few more yards in silence i suppose we need to find out what he knew and about whom a wave of relief swept over her well begin in the village she said we cant get out of it now anyway whom do we trust he asked glancing at her quickly no one she said simply we cant afford to we have no idea who it was they spent a long quiet evening by the fire neither of them talked very much but it was one of the most companionable times she could remember despite the ugly task that awaited them the following days the fire crackled and the coals grew yellow hot in the heart of it the snow deepened in blanketing silence outside except for the occasional whoosh as it grew too heavy on the steep roof and slid off to the ground there was nothing to discussthey were in agreement sunday morning was awful dominic was so anxious he barely spoke to her as he ate breakfast before church he picked up books and put them down again found quotes then discarded them one minute he wanted to be daring challenge people to new thought the next to be gentle to reassure them in all the old beliefs comfort the wounds of loneliness and misunderstanding and say nothing that might awaken troubling ideas or demand any change a dozen times clarice drew in her breath to say that he had no time in three short weeks to stay within safe bounds no one would listen certainly no one would remember anything about it afterward she nearly said so then she saw his slender hand on the back of the chair and realized that the knuckles were white this was not the right time but she was afraid there never would be a right time the next sermon would be for christmas one pedestrian sermon now safe and colorless might be all it would take to lose the congregations sympathy and their hope dont quote she said suddenly dont use other peoples words whatever they are theyll have heard them before people like repetition he said with a bleak smile his eyes dark with anxiety and the crushing weight of doubt spindlewood had laid on him in that moment clarice hated spindlewood for what he had done with his mealy mouth and grudging timeserving spirit do you remember how terrible it was when unity bellwood was murdered and how the police suspected all of us she said quietly of course tell them what you said to me about courage then and how its the one virtue without which all others may be lost she urged him you meant it say it to them he did so passionately eloquently without repeating himself she had no idea whether the congregants were impressed or not they spoke politely to him afterward even with warmth but there was no ease among them she and dominic walked home through the snow in silence on monday the wind sliced in from the east like a whetted knife straight after breakfast dominic set out to make his calls clarice started where she had traditionally been told lay the root of all evil although actually she thought it was far more likely to find its roots in selfishnessand perhaps selfrighteousness which was not such a different thing when one thought about it still money was easier to measure and she had ready access to the vicars ledgers both from the church and from the household she had barely begun examining them when she was interrupted by the arrival of mrs wellbeloved carrying two hard white cabbages and a string of very large onions she looked extremely pleased with herself stamping her feet and shedding snow everywhere said as it would be cold tree fell over with the weight of it an the road souths blocked she announced it as a personal victory less you want to go all round abingdon an the like an theres no saying you can get through that either could all be closed then we are very fortunate to have coal and food clarice replied warmly onions mrs wellbeloved put them on the table not that anyone could have mistaken them for something else thank you clarice smiled at her she already knew from the brief glance at the accounts she had taken that mrs wellbeloved had done all the shopping for the vicar she wanted to tell her of their discovery of the body in the cellar but fitzpatrick had asked them not to and his implication had been clear enough still clarice felt guilty saying nothing thats very kind of you she added mrs wellbeloved smiled her face pink she began to take off her overcoat and prepare to scrub the floor it was half past eleven before clarice could return to the ledger and read through it carefully she had gone through it twice before she noticed the tiny anomalies they were sometimes of a shilling or two but more often just pennies the mistakes seemed to be in the reverend wynters own money which he accounted very carefully as anyone on a church stipend had to clarice herself knew where every farthing went the expression poor as a church mouse was not an idle one the church accounts including the donations signed for by john boscombe until a few months ago and more recently by a man named william frazer were accurate then inaccurate then accurate again the final sum was always as it should be clarice could understand how people ended up chewing pencils it made no sense why on earth would anyone steal tuppence or even less she was convinced it was not carelessness because the same figures kept recurring in what she realized was a sequence she placed them side by side according to date and then she saw the pattern the few pence went missing from the church accounts then from the reverend wynters personal account finally the church accounts were correct again someone was taking tiny amounts from the collection for the poor box irregular and always very small the reverend wynter was replacing them from his own money but why would it not have been the right thing to do to find out who was the thiefif that was not too serious a word for such petty amounts might it be a child perhaps he did not want to have such an accusation made if it could become uglier than a simple question of family discipline whom could she ask perhaps william frazer who had taken over the bookkeeping would know or have an idea he lived next to the village store and even in this weather she could walk there quite easily of course she would not go across the green one could barely see where the pond was never mind avoid treading on the ice beneath the snow and perhaps falling in but frazer had no idea im so sorry mrs corde he said earnestly as she sat in the small crowded room by his parlor fire still shivering from her journey in the snow the wind seemed to find its way through even the thickest cloak and a hat was useless to protect the neck or ears now she was almost singeing at the front and her back was still cold from the draft behind her your records are immaculate she said as flatteringly as she could at the end of the day the money is always correct but somewhere along the way a few pennies disappear and then turn up again it looks as if the reverend wynter made up the difference himself frazer looked startled his thin bony face pale with anxiety why on earth would he do such a thing he demanded john boscombe never said anything to me and hes as honest as the day ask anyone if thered been any irregularities hed have told me perhaps if the reverend wynter knew who it was he might have asked mr boscombe not to say anything she suggested puzzled herself why would he do that frazers voice was sharp his big hands were clenched in his lap more like the old gentleman lost a few pence here and there he nodded can happen to anyone got the wrong change by mistake praps or dropped it in the street and couldnt find it done that myself only pennies you said yes dont worry about it daresay youll keep better books yourself being younger and seeing a good bit clearer should have had spectacles maybe perhaps but she did not agree she thanked him and went out into the bitter wind to walk all the way to john boscombes house in the summer there was a shortcut through the woods when the stream was low and the steppingstones clear but the current was strong and deep now and would pull a person under its dark surface like greedy hands it was a long walk but she found the man at home kept from his work in the fields by the smothering snow come in come in he said warmly as he almost pulled her into the hallway and slammed the door against the wind behind her what a day its going to be a hard christmas if it goes on like this you must be frozen lets dust the snow off you before it thaws and gets you wet he suited the action to the word without waiting for her to agree sending snow flying all over the hallway fortunately the floor was polished stone so it would mop up well enough come into the kitchen he invited satisfied with his work and turning to lead the way have some soup always keep a stockpot on the simmer this time of year the children are out playing theyve built a snowman bigger than i am genny new vicars wife is here genevieve boscombe stood in the middle of the kitchen with her hands in a big bowl of flour and pastry she was smiling but she did not make any move to stop what she was doing welcome she said cheerfully ill not shake your hand or ill have you covered johnll get you a dish of soup its just barley and bones but its hot there was a faint flush of defiance in her cheeks from more than just the exertion of rolling the pastry one was not defensive unless one was vulnerable clarice knew that from experience she was conscious of her own clumsiness where her sisters and her mother had been graceful the comparison even made in what was intended as humor had sometimes hurt her sharply once or twice when she had fancied herself in love she had felt it even more she smiled at mrs boscombe deliberately avoiding looking around the kitchen though she had noticed that the good linen sheets over the airing rail had been carefully cut down the wornout middle then turned to be joined at the sidesto give them longer life the china on the dresser was good but a few pieces were chipped one or two even broken and glued very carefully together they had had money and were now making do and mending even genevieves dress indicated the same thing it was of good quality but had been uptodate ten years ago thank you i would like that very much she thought of adding something about barley being very light and pleasing and decided not to it would so easily sound patronizing actually i called because i hoped mr boscombe might be able to help me with a little of the church bookkeeping she said hastily i do so much wish to be accurate i tried mr frazer but he was unable to offer any assistance what is the difficulty mrs corde boscombe said with concern boscombe served the barley soup into a blueandwhite bowl and set it on the table in front of clarice who thanked him suddenly she realized how difficult it was to explain her problem without lying at least by implication boscombe was waiting eyes wide she must speak ii was going through the reverend wynters account books and i found certain he was staring at her something in his look darkening she could think of nothing to excuse what she had done except the truth fitzpatrick had no authority to order her silence everyone would have to know at some time perhaps even by tomorrow she plunged in the reverend wynter is dead she said very quietly sadness overwhelming her we found his body quite by chancein the second cellar i went for coal and the cat followed me down i she looked at him and saw the shock in his face followed immediately by a terrible regret he turned to look at genevieve then back at clarice im so sorry he said a little huskily what happened ii hadnt heard no one has she said quietly dr fitzpatrick asked us not to tell anyone until the bishop has been informed but this was the difficult part but we disagree upon what happened however i would be grateful if you would not let people know that i told you at least not yet of course not he agreed that is why you were going through the account books he still seemed puzzled but there was an inexplicable sense of relief in him as if this wasnt what he had feared yes she knew she had not yet said enough for him to understand it was unavoidable now you see what she had planned sounded ridiculous yes genevieve also had stopped her work and was listening clarice felt the heat burn up her face you see i dont believe he died by accident she said she hated the sound of her voice it was wobbly and absurd she cleared her throat i think someone hit him he had injuries both on his face and on the back of his head they may not have meant to kill him but she was telling them too much but there was someone else there and they didnt tell anyone she turned from boscombe to genevieve he was lying all by himself in the second cellar but he had no lantern she went on whod go into a cellar without a lantern no one genevieve said quietly but why would anyone quarrel with the reverend wynter he was the nicest man she stopped for a moment they all were silent clarice and boscombe at the kitchen table genevieve standing with the bowl still in her arms do you think its the money in the church accounts boscombe asked finally his face smooth his eyes avoiding genevieves surely theres hardly enough there to provoke a quarrel no clarice agreed its only pennies missing a shilling or two at the most but it happened a lot of times over six months or more genevieve was looking at boscombe staring at him boscombe sat still his back stiff he knows clarice thought the conviction growing in her mind he knows the reverend wynter was putting the money back but had the vicar known who was taking it was that what he had been trying to find out all those months and had at last succeeded and was killed for no that was absurd as she had said before it was pennies boscombe was watching her his face tense with concentration waiting you knew didnt you clarice said very softly isis that why you stopped working with the reverend wynter because you knew he was protecting someone who his eyes were wide his face almost comical with disbelief you didnt she went on answering her own question no oh i knew there were pennies missing here and there he assured her shifting a little in his seat at first i thought it was just that the reverend wynter was a bit careless or even that he wasnt very good at his sums then i realized that in the end the figures were always exactly right so he knew someone was taking bits and pieces but i didnt object to his dealing with it in his own way did he know who it was she asked boscombe smiled he didnt tell me she knew he was speaking the literal truth but there was a real truth a more whole and honest one that he was concealing but he knew she insisted as you did no i didnt but even if i had mrs corde im not sure that i would be free to tell you she leaned forward a little across the table her elbows on its pale scrubbed wood i think the reverend wynter was killed by someone mr boscombe they may not have set out to but they hit him and when he was dead or dying she saw him wince but she went on they dragged him into the farther cellar and took the lantern to go back upstairs leaving him alone there in the dark for days it may not have anything to do with the moneyits so small its meaningless but it has to do with something genevieve shivered if thats true john then an awful thing has happened perhaps you should tell the reverend corde even if you cant tell mrs corde he looked at her at last the reverend wynter knew he admitted at least i believe he did but it was something else something bigger behind it and he wanted to know what that was the greater sin do you suppose he found out clarice asked him he bit his lip now his face was pale they were talking about something so dark it had caused the death of a good man and perhaps the damnation of another i prefer to think not he said slowly at least for as long as i can think it but john genevieve began and then her voice trailed away i dont know he said again and thats the truth clarice could draw no more from him she thanked them both and left as the children trooped in from the garden brightfaced eyes dancing skin glowing from the exertion in the sudden confines of the warm kitchen with its scrubbed table and floor its familiar precious but mismatched china and the smell of drying linen and herbs their voices were louder than they realized violence seemed like an offensive wordand utterly inappropriate it was early afternoon when dominic decided to call again at the manor house he had to put his trust in someone or else simply abandon the idea of finding out exactly how the reverend wynter had died it still seemed an absurd idea that anyone could have killed him it was below freezing even at this hour and his feet crunched on the snow he walked as quickly as he could his mind also racing the decision he made now could affect the rest of his life andof more urgent importance to himclarices life also she had given up much to marry him and he wanted passionately that she should never regret that he found to his surprise that as he learned to know her better with each passing month he loved her more she had an honesty of mind that was brighter more translucent than any he had imagined he kept thinking he knew her and then she said or did something that surprised him she made him laugh even when he did not want to she never complained about the lack of money or about the small grubby accommodations she had to make to poverty or spindlewoods petty officiousness then she would blow up with temper over an injustice and put into irretrievable words exactly what he had been thinking only been wise enough not to say or was that cowardly enough or was he simply older and more acquainted with the infinite possibilities of failure he did not want to disappoint her she was still so much in love with him he could see it in her eyes the sudden flush to her skin if she caught him looking at her with his own emotions too naked in his face could he ever live up to what she thought of him sometimes being handsome was not a blessing it led peoplewomento hope for more from one than one could live up to it ignited dreams that were too big for the reality of what any man could be the manor house loomed up ahead rising out of the virgin snow as the dark trees of the driveway parted that was a dream in stone did peter connaught ever feel the weight of past glory crushing him did the ghosts expect too much was clarice building a drama of murder out of a simple domestic tragedy weaving together facts into a picture that would create sorrow and injustice not solve it dominic thought again with a shiver of his earlier acquaintance with her family and the murder of unity bellwood he had been a curate staying in her fathers house to further his studies the reverend ramsay parmenter had been a good mentor but a conventional man of passionately orthodox views when unity bellwood modernthinking pregnant and unmarried was pushed down a stairway to her death the reverend parmenter became a major suspect but it was clarices beautiful selfish and deadly mother who had been at the core of it with her obsessive fantasy that dominic was as much in love with her as she was with him it had been a time of grief shock and fear for the whole family clarice had been the bravest of them the most willing to see and face the dreadful truth whatever the pain or the price he lengthened his stride he would believe her this time better to have pursued it and been proven wrong than to run away into blind comfort that would lie between them always he reached the great oak front door and pulled the bell it was beginning to snow again huge white flakes falling like petals the door opened and the butler welcomed him in sir peter was in his office but he appeared within moments smiling offering tea and crumpets apologizing because he thought there was almost certainly no cake we should have mince pies he said shaking his head ill make sure we have them next time you come just tea would be excellent thank you dominic answered following peters elegant figure into the huge withdrawing room and a little of your time the warmth engulfed him like an embrace the dog in front of the hearth stood up and stretched luxuriously then padded over to see who he was and make sure he should be allowed in what can i do for you peter asked when they were seated how are you settling in im afraid i have very hard news indeed dominic replied i have been told not to break it yet but you are not leaving peter said in alarm no not in the foreseeable future i would like not to leave at all but that is up to the bishop dominic was startled by how passionately he meant that he longed to stay here to be his own master free to succeedor failon his own beliefs not spindlewoods i dont understand peter replied confusion clear on his dark face as briefly as possible dominic told him what had happened including fitzpatricks admonition to tell no one yet and his own reasons for not obeying oh dear peter said quietly he looked crushed i liked him enormously you know dominic believed him he did not even have to weigh it in his mind the sorrow in peters face was reala pain one could sense in the room almost like a third presence the more i learn of him the more i realize how much he was loved dominic said gently i feel a loss myself and i never even met him that is why i intend to find out what happened i dont know whom to trust or where to begin he smiled ruefully a trifle selfconscious i have a brotherinlaw who is a policeman a detective suddenly i appreciate how appallingly difficult his job is i have no real authority to ask anyone questions i am an outsider here no matter how much i want to belong but i feel a duty to find the truth of how the reverend wynter died peter frowned do you not think perhaps it was an accident more than deliberate and someone panicked felt guilty for provoking a quarrel and so denied it even to themselves his voice dropped to little more than a whisper we can be at our ugliest when we are frightened i have seen men act quite outside what one had believed their character to be certainly dominic agreed but there is a cowardice in that and a certain brutality in allowing him to lie there undiscovered which speaks of a terrible selfishness i dont intend to allow that to go unaddressed itit would seem as if i were saying it doesnt matter and it does of course it does peter lifted his eyes and met dominics levelly what can i do to help i have no idea as to who could or would have done such a thing or why dominic asked peters mouth pinched very slightly or why he conceded he drew in his breath as if to add something and then changed his mind and remained silent dominic wondered what he had been going to say that it must be a secret the reverend wynter had learned possibly even by accident but that someone cared about so passionately with such fear of loss that they had killed rather than risk it being known it was the obvious thing if a priest was murdered could peter have failed to say this for any reason except that he knew or feared it was true his own secret or someone elses what secret could the elegant charming and secure peter connaught care about enough to commit murder or who was the friend for whom he would condone such an act anything anyone the most ordinary countenance could hide stories of pain the outsider would never imagine peter had quarreled with wynter himself to the point that despite their very real affection he had suddenly stopped calling at the vicarage and wynter had put away the chess set and apparently never played again dominic considered challenging the man but decided not to at least not yet i might be able to narrow it to some degree by knowing who called on him after the last time he was seen alive he said aloud peter relaxed fractionally the difference in his posture in the big chair was so slight it was no more than an easing in the tiny wrinkles in the way his jacket lay but dominic was aware of it a log settled in the fireplace sending up a shower of sparks peter stood up and added another then waited a moment to make certain it was balanced the flames reached higher to embrace it that seems like a good idea he said taking his seat again if i can help i should be happy to i might even be able to make some discreet inquiries myself i should be most grateful dominic replied he had no idea how far to trust him but sometimes one could learn as much from a lie as from the truth even omissions could tell a person something thank you he went on with warmth i hope that as you say it may turn out to be no worse than a grubby accident someone failed to report peter smiled a weakness not easy to forgive but not impossible dominic remained another fifteen minutes and then took his leave out into a fading afternoon now even more bitterly cold some of the clouds had cleared away and it had stopped snowing the light was pale with the amber of the fading sun low on the horizon shadows were growing longer the edge of the wind cut like a blade making his skin hurt and his eyes water his feet slipped a little on the ice as he trudged down the drive other than the thud of the mounded snow on the evergreens overbalancing onto the ground below there was silence in the gathering gloom beyond the trees the village lights shone yellow making little golden smudges sparkling against the bluegray of twilight someone opened a door onto a world of brilliance a dog scampered out then back in again and the light vanished dominics hands and feet were numb hunching his shoulders from the cold he stopped for a moment to retie his scarf that was when he heard the footsteps behind him he swung around his breath catching in his throat from the icy air in his lungs the figure was there crossing the village green only a few yards away she was bent shivering and very small she stopped also motionless as if uncertain whether to try running away but who could run in the deep snow and like dominic she was probably too stiff with cold even to try dominic took a step toward her are you looking for me he asked gently ohreverend corde she began can i help you he asked gently no i was justwell mrs towers he was almost certain it was the elderly woman he had met in about this same spot a few days ago he recognized the small hands in their woolen mittens yeser yes no i am just on my way home she did not move perhaps i could walk with you he offered just to make sure you get home safely its a terribly cold evening wellthats very kind of you there was an eagerness in her slightly husky voice he could barely see her face under the shadow of her hat and the scarf wound around her neck and shoulders but he thought she might have been smiling he crossed the short distance between them and offered her his arm she took it pulling at him very slightly to direct him the right way walking at her pace was hard there was no briskness to keep the blood flowing is there anything i can do for you mrs towers he asked trying to guess why she had seemed to be following him do you need some wood brought in or coal the moment he had said it he wondered if he had been clumsy possibly she had none and that was the real issue oh no thank you she said shaking her head and shivering really i have everything very kind of you but a hand not to slip is all i need as if to emphasize it she clung to him harder he walked in silence for several minutes still believing that there was something she wanted to ask him if she could work up the courage he ought to be able to guess it and help her if it was difficult surely a good minister would see needs understand them before they were voiced perhaps she was just lonely hardly anyone would say that please vicar talk to me and break the silence i live in it doesnt matter what i say or think but please pretend for half an hour that it does listen to me ask me then when you go again i shall feel better would she spend christmas alone too apart from coming to church he should ask her to tea but he should invite her once before that so the kindness wasnt so obvious no one wanted to be asked simply for charitys sake mrs towers he began i hope that one day soon when the snow is a little less deep you will come to tea with us my wife and i would be delighted to better make your acquaintance you could tell us much about the village its history and the people who have lived here would you oh she sounded thoroughly startled oh well she gripped his arm as if she was in very real danger of falling that would be very nice im sure when the weather is better i should be very pleased to come when there isnt so much snow you know thank you so much i am nearly home now just around the corner she pulled her arm away do have a nice evening good night vicar thank you for your kindness so nice to see you she doubled her speed and disappeared into the gloom swallowed by the shadows of trees and garden hedges until she was indistinguishable from the other shapes in the night there was no point in standing here as if she might change her mind and come back and yet dominic had been certain that she had wished to say something more to him had he put her off by speaking he had only asked her to tea at some time in the future did she already know that the reverend wynter was dead or did she perhaps fear it had he confided in her or perhaps living alone with little to do and with no relatives nearby she watched and listened in the village it would not be snooping just the instinct of a lonely person with time on her hands but she might have seen or deduced all kinds of things for herself he should have asked her could she even be in danger herself he was freezing in the bonedeep cold he was beginning to shake now that he had stopped moving he turned and began to walk back across the snow toward the spires of the church black against the first stars he knew the vicarage lay to the right of it invisible in the trees its lights kept to a minimum for economys sake when he opened the front door the warmth engulfed him and after a moment he smelled the hot pastry oil lamps coal and lavender furniture polish clarice he called out eagerly clarice she was there a moment later hugging him she gasped when the ice on his coat touched her neck and throat then ignored it and held him tighter after supper they sat by the fire opposite each other outside the wind rose whipping the branches and now and then clattering small twigs against the glass he told her about speaking with peter connaught did he tell you anything useful she asked leaning forward eyes intent upon his i dont think so he admitted she caught his hesitation you think you arent sure he looked at her face with its large tender eyes and vulnerable mouth had he brought her into the presence of murder again into the violence and tragedy of human hatred he remembered how much she had been hurt the last time and how frightened he had been himself she had never doubted him no matter what the facts had appeared to be he owed her honesty but he also owed her protection he did not wish her to be hurt ever and yet if he shut her out he was alone he could not tell her halftruthsnot without destroying the thread between them that was so infinitely precious it wasnt what he said so much as a look in his face he said feeling ridiculous he believed you she said understanding instantly you told him the reverend wynter was murdered and he knew you were right he felt a warmth inside deeper than anything the fire or the room could give him he believes someone has a secret and that the reverend wynter could have learned it he said in confirmation should he tell her the rest the impression only barely formed in his mind she was waiting for him to finish she had something urgent to say also he could see it in her eyes in the clenching of her hands in her lap i think he was almost relieved he said as if he had feared it and now that it had happened it could be faced and he was no longer alone he isnt alone she said quickly and i told john and genevieve boscombe as well i couldnt help it dr fitzpatrick may be furious but i couldnt ask their help and then lie to them they wouldnt have helped me anyway because i had no sensible explanation for what id done he was confused then touched by a tendril of fear just a tiny thing but unmistakable what have you done she blinked with guilt lowering her eyes i wasnt accusing you he leaned far forward enough to grasp her hand clarice i only meant what had he meant he gulped and then clenched his teeth i was afraid for you if someone in this village really lured the reverend wynter to the cellar steps and then hit him so hard he died as a result then it would be foolish to think we are safe if we go looking for the secret that provoked them to it despite the snow and the peace the kindness christmas in a few days there is still something very terrible here just because we havent lived here all our lives doesnt mean we are safe from it we have made ourselves part of whatever it is im sorry she took his hand closing her fingers around it dont be the only way to be safe is not to be alone at all i shall be very careful no you wont he contradicted her sharply i know you youll go charging in doing whatever you think is right safety or anything to do with sense will be the last thing on your mind she sidestepped the issue i looked at the books she told him very carefully he was confused what books it appeared to be irrelevant the ledgers she said impatiently the accounts oh why im sure we can manage until the bishop makes a decision he heard the unhappiness in his own voice he had not meant to allow himself to care so much certainly not to let clarice know but he wanted to belong here have his own church his own congregation to teach to care for and to learn from already he dreaded going back to the reverend spindlewood and his gray sanctimonious ways his tediousness of spirit the accounts are not right clarice said firmly there are inconsistencies in the last seven months or more her voice was low and tense and she was staring at him demanding his attention someone was stealing tiny amounts from the church collections just pennies quite often never more than a shilling or two the reverend wynter was putting the amount back from his own money his own ledgers were balanced to the farthing except for those amounts if you look carefully they tally up he frowned trying to understand why i dont know and neither does john boscombe but there is something bigger behind it something they really care about the reverend wynter was hiding it for a reason until he could find what that is john boscombe didnt say so exactly but i saw the moment in his face when he knew it i will be careful dominic i promise but we have to find out what it is how could we stay here and just pretend this hasnt happened or that we dont know we do know but maybe he stopped her look was withering if there really is a godand i cant bear to believe that there isnt despite anything mr darwin saysthen he knows that we know in the end thats all that counts isnt it now she needed an answer not just to that question but to all that was wrapped within it for all of their lives he closed his eyes for a second two seconds and three she had a way of smashing through pretense that left one nowhere to hide yes of course thats all there is he answered her we must find the truth and deal with it but please be careful clarice whoever it is has a secret which to them is so terrible they will kill a priest to keep it it could be anythingeven another death we dont yet know of or something that to us seems trivial but to them is so grave they cannot bear it if anything happened to you it would be unbearable to me i love you so much i dont know how i would be any use without you to myself or to others i might once have worked alone quite well but not since ive known you ive known something too good to forget she smiled and her eyes were full of tears but shining tears ill be careful she promised sniffing and blinking hard im much too happy to let anyone take it away from me either the morning was bright with a cold hard wind they had been in cottisham little more than a week it seemed longer clearing away breakfast dishes and wondering if mrs wellbeloved would come today or not or if mrs paget would still consider after the reverend wynters death that they should cook for a christmas party clarice felt as if it were months ago that she and dominic had first walked into this comfortable hallway and she had been so immediately at home there had been not the slightest shadow of tragedy then the whole vicarage had been warm with the memories of generations of families living here they would have had their joys and griefs like everyone but also a security of faith in this small community under the shadow of the church and the sound of its bells how could she have imagined that below there in the darkness of the cellar the vicar himself was lying alone growing colder and colder each day would it ever get really warm again not until they had found the truth and faced it dominic had gone out again to see dr fitzpatrick it was not a duty he was looking forward to but there were many issues to be dealt with the village must be told officially of the reverend wynters death dominic would have to remain silent while the doctor passed it off as natural he had written to inform the bishop of course but whether the letter had reached him depended on the snow not being too deep for a horse and trap to get out of the village even the main roads could be impassable if it had drifted and he might have to hold the funeral regardless clarice stood in the middle of the kitchen floor towel in her hand overtaken by surprise at how much she dreaded being replaced it would be crushing she wanted to stay here not only because dominic wanted it so much but also for herself despite what she had found in the cellar she wanted to live in this house see spring come to this garden she wanted to see the village pond unfrozen and with the spring ducklings on it their funny little flat feet on the new grass she wanted to see the apple trees in blossom and children flying kites she wanted to be here for easter and summer and harvest festival it could be a fulfillment she had never known before for both of them there was good work to be done dominic would become as loved as the reverend wynter had been and she would watch it and help first though they must learn who had killed the vicar and why they could not find the light if they had not the courage to explore the darkness everyone had secrets it was within the nature of life whether they were acts of wickedness or merely of foolishness guilt and embarrassment could look alike but which one had provoked murder she thought about her visit to the boscombes yesterday as she put away the crockery and cleaned the top of the range she restoked it and then started to warm the flatirons to press dominics clean shirts which were now rolled up damp in the scullery and awaiting her attention the boscombes was such a happy house and yet she had sensed a fear there or was that too strong a word had it been no more than anxiety and sorrow because a friend had died tragically she knew she had not imagined the glance between them so quick as to seem guarded a communication they preferred not to put into words nor had she imagined the small but very clear signs of recent poverty what was their sudden misfortune and had the reverend wynter known about it she had no idea but it was very possible one thing she was certain about and that was that both john and genevieve boscombe were aware that the reverend wynter knew secrets at least one of which was dangerous they had understood instantly what the tiny thefts were and why he had concealed them were they also protecting each other why did she ask herself that when she was perfectly certain that they were if the reverend wynter had known some secret about them what could it be she tested the irons on the hob they were hot enough she must pay attention to what she was doing she could not afford to scorch dominics shirts apart from the fact that she had too much pride in being a good wife they were far too expensive to replace they came from the days of his profession as a banker long before he decided to be a minister she kept a piece of extra rag to test the temperature before touching the iron to a shirt she tried it now carefully only when she was satisfied did she begin to iron if the vicar had known something about the boscombes it would have to be something they cared about passionately and she did not believe that could ever be money what was the most precious thing in the world to them not material goods of any sort not power or prestige they had never had either nor would they want them they treasured warmth in their home the laughter of children playing the certainty of gentleness and companionship and the good things that all people of true sanity want what could jeopardize those things the iron was getting hot in her hand she snatched it off the collar and was flooded with relief that there was no brown mark on its white surface the smell of warm clean cotton filled the air could there be something wrong with the boscombes marriage and somehow the vicar had discovered it had genevieve been underage at the time she looked several years younger than john perhaps her father had not given consent and they had run away to be married and lied to obtain permission did that make their union illegal had she been from a wealthy family and promised to someone else but that would not invalidate their marriage were any of their children conceived or born out of wedlock that would be scandalous but not irrevocable why would the reverend wynter concern himself with it it might be a sin in the eyes of the church but it was over and done with now surely a confession and absolution would deal with it she could find out she had only to go to the church itself which was next door across the strip of grass and up the path through the graveyard the church records would be there in the vestry marriages christenings and burials boscombe had said genevieve grew up here she would have been married here too very carefully she finished the final shirt she put both irons to cool and carried the shirts upstairs clarice felt rather grubby searching the parish records for someone elses secrets but sometimes one could feel grubby doing what was necessary to get to the truth and if she found she was wrong so much the better she put on her outdoor boots again and her heavy cape then picked up the keys and went out the snow was almost up to her knees in places where the land was low and it had drifted the bare honeysuckle vine on the lychgate was sparkling with icicles and the path through the gravestones was slippery the sky was ragged now with patches of hard light making the expanse of the village green difficult to look at the snow glared achingly white she wondered if someone had fed the ducks she should make sure should take them something herself the church was bitterly cold inside the stainedglass window with its pictures of christ walking on the water cast patches of blue and green and gold light on the floor the robe of st peter in the boat was the only warm color a splash of wine how many people down the centuries had brought their joys and their griefs here made promises prayed for forgiveness or poured out their thanks she hurried to where the parish record books were kept she unlocked the cupboard and found the one most likely to contain the baptism of the boscombes oldest child she skimmed through a couple of years worth of entries before finding it it was a swift job since the village was small just four or five hundred people then she started to go backward looking for john and genevieves marriage she went through ten years but didnt find it twentythree years before the birth of their first child she came across genevieves own baptism even more carefully she moved forward there were baptisms of two sisters of genevieve then the burial of both her parents the sisters marriages were recorded but not baptisms of any children presumably they had moved to wherever their husbands lived then genevieves children were baptized but clarice could find no reference to her marriage of course they could have been married somewhere else but the ugly thought kept intruding into clarices mind that perhaps they had not been married at all why would that be the only reason she could think of was that something had prevented it the obvious thing would be that one of them was already married if it were genevieve the whole village would probably know therefore it must be john had the reverend wynter somehow found that out she closed the book and replaced it locking the cupboard door she walked back through the icy vestry and outside into the freezing world again it glittered sharp on daggers of water from the earlier thaw now hanging from every black branch her feet crunched on the surface there were gray clouds looming in from the west fatbellied with more snow little shivers of wind stirred the topmost branches when dominic returned at lunchtime she told him what she had found she could have been married somewhere else he said taking a fresh piece of bread and another slice of cold mutton perhaps in his village he might have had elderly parents who couldnt travel for example she passed him the rich sharp pickle possibly but the boscombes are in some kind of hardship there are lots of small signs of it if you look he smiled with a touch of sadness and she saw the mounting pain in his eyes they were not in that situation themselves but it was not too far ahead of them if he remained a curate much longer she regretted having said it yet she could not deny the evidence she had seen in the boscombes house perhaps avoiding the subject of poverty was in a way making it worse as if it were a secret too shameful to acknowledge people do fall on harder times without there being a dark secret he pointed out ruefully i know she poured him more tea although he had not asked for it one of her pleasures was to notice his needs and meet them before he said anything its just a little piece of information but i think it fits in with the missing pennies in the ledgers the fact that john boscombe suddenly resigned from his position in the church and that they are both afraid of something none of which would matter if the reverend wynter were not dead but he is and at least for now this is your village then she corrected herself our village he frowned why would their not being married and the vicar knowing that have anything to do with financial hard times or the petty thefts from the collection that doesnt make any sense she struggled through the confusion in her own mind i think he knew about the petty thefts before giving up his job keeping the books he was close enough to the vicar that they trusted each other then something happened and john boscombe left they still go to church as everyone does but thats all could mean their sudden tightening of circumstances dates from that time too with children you can go through sheets quickly youll wash them every other week perhaps give them a little rubbing middles can wear thin best to trim them before they actually tear and what caused the hardship he asked the reverend wynter was blackmailing them so they paid for half a year and then they killed him she blinked no no i dont believe that but maybe if the reverend wynter found out so did someone else thats possible isnt it he considered for a moment staring at his cup but without reaching for it yes he said finally who would that be his first wife she said without hesitation or really his only wife why didnt she come forward and accuse him openly if he deserted her oh dominic she said in exasperation dont be so otherworldly much better to ask him for money to keep quiet about it than admit to everyone that he ran away from her to be with someone else except that if genevieve doesnt know or didnt at the time then he probably ran away just because she was ghastly he tried to hide a smile and failed clarice you dont just run away because your husband or wife is appalling or there would hardly be a married person in england living at home she raised her eyebrows very high thank you i hadnt thought of running awayyet he shook his head im so glad he said drily its cold out there do you really think the boscombes have a secret she wrinkled her nose yes and i really do think it could have to do with their marriage that is the only thing of sufficient importance to them that they might fight very hard to protect it she met his eyes and hoped he could see in hers that she understood the boscombes perfectly she too would have fought with every weapon she had to protect her marriage for her too it was the most precious thing she had he reached across the table and touched her fingertips gently i agree he answered and i am beginning to think that sir peter connaught also has something about which he is less than honest she was startled sir peter are you sure you dont think hes justgrieved he seemed to be very fond of the reverend wynter and they never made up their quarrel before he died that makes people feel very guilty you know he fiddled with his knife i thought of that but its more a matter of little things that dont fit discrepancies in his stories about his parents perhaps they dont even matter but i noticed them he seemed about to add something further then changed his mind he looked unhappy what is it she asked what are you thinking he gave a slight shrug i dont know people do boast sometimes exaggerate their abilities or money all sorts of things but sir peter doesnt seem in any need to do that he is obviously a man of great wealth or he could not maintain a place like the manor house and it is superbly kept he gives generously to the village i know that from the reverend wynters remarks in the notes to his accounts and the whole connaught family is above reproach their history is pretty well public they could still have secrets clarice pointed out almost every family does she bit her lip we certainly do for heavens sake i would go to great lengths to prevent anyone in cottisham knowing about my mother she felt hot with shame even saying it to dominic who already knew everything about it she understood what secrets could cost and what lengths people could be driven to by love and fear dominic it is possible the connaughts also have something they would pay a great deal to keep unknown she went on it is very hard to live with people prying through ones affairs perhaps that was at the root of his quarrel with the reverend wynter they used to be close we know they played chess every week he looked at her unhappily the reverend wynter quarreled with peter connaught and with john boscombe are you saying that he was behind some kind of extortion or threat of exposure i dont know sometimes the wicked flee where no man pursueth maybe just his knowledge was enough he said what they were both thinking or he used his special knowledge in the most appalling betrayal imaginable to blackmail those who had trusted him and even turned to him for help and forgiveness she gripped his hand across the table we didnt know him she said urgently perhaps we have imagined him the way we wanted him to be everyone speaks well of him he pointed out closing his fingers over hers well they would she said biting her lip he was a priest and now he has died who is going to say he was brutal a slimy betrayer of trust who blackmails the most vulnerable they would only know it if they had been a victim themselves and wished him dead possibly murdered who would admit that no one he said miserably please god i hope youre wrong were wrong he corrected himself dominic went out again to visit one of the old gentlemen who was too frail to leave his house in the snow and afraid of what the deepening winter would bring he stayed a little while assuring mr riddington of his care regardless of who the vicar of cottisham should be he would always have time for going to those who could not come to the church then after bidding him goodbye he walked along the lane toward the green in the dusk again he became aware of footsteps behind him they seemed to be gaining on him as though the person was keen to catch him up he stopped and turned he saw the brisk figure of mrs paget hurrying toward him her breath a white vapor in the freezing air she was dressed rather smartly with a russetbrown cape and there was a flush in her cheeks im glad to see you reverend corde she said warmly as she reached him have you been to see mr riddington poor old soul cant make it even to his front gate anymore afraid of slipping and breaking a leg very wise he stays in broken bone at his age can be nasty dont let me hold you up ill walk beside you without waiting she started forward again and he was left to keep step with her mrs blount next door drops in every day he told her not the same as having the vicar call mrs paget shook her head no one else can comfort with the spiritual promises of the church believe me mrs blount is a far better cook than i am he replied keeping his balance on the uneven path with difficulty and there are times when a hot apple pie is more use than a sermon you may joke vicar she said seriously but there are dark things to fight against darker than most folks are willing to admit he was uncertain how to answer her the wind was rising again it whined in the branches above them and little flurries of dry snow skittered over the ice i know the truth she went on her voice quiet but very clear the reverend wynter was murdered wasnt he please dont try to spare me by denying it it doesnt help to close ones eyes thats how evil flourishes because we want to be kind and end up being cruel he wanted to argue but she was right he asked her the question that filled his mind how do you know that mrs paget now it was she who was silent they were out of the lane and starting across the open green the pond was almost invisible just a smooth white surface a little lower than the slope of the grass the air was darkening color staining the west with fire and the shadows growing so dense the houses blended into one another he began to think she was not going to answer the reverend wynter was here in cottisham well over thirty years she said at last he knew a lot about people sometimes things theyd rather no one did he wouldnt have told of course priests dont do they it wasnt really a question but she stopped as if waiting for him to speak her features indistinguishable in the shadows no he replied was she trying to find a way to tell him that the reverend wynter had done infinitely worse than use his privileged knowledge to manipulate and extort the darkness felt as if it were inside him as well as beyond in the sky and the black lace of the trees but those that betray dont trust anyone she said looking straight ahead of her is that why you believe he was murdered mrs paget he asked just that he knew peoples secrets all priests do what are most village secrets she asked a few silly mistakes a little spite all things you can repent of suddenly her voice dropped and became bitter cottishams different but here there are things that are against the law of god and a priest cant overlook or forgive them god can forgive all sins mrs paget he pointed out after youve paid she said harshly not while youre still committing them and the innocent are suffering dont tell me thats gods way cos it isnt i know that and so do you vicar yes he said a little tartly and the reverend wynter would have pointed that out to anyone who was continuing to do what was wrong exactly she agreed staring at him but what if that person didnt want to stop what if they werent going to stop no matter what he didnt want to know but he couldnt avoid it simply because it was uncomfortable if a priest refused to address sin what use was he to anyone he was here precisely to deal with weakness physical or spiritual he must face it wherever it led him he started to walk again trusting his instincts though he could only dimly see the road what you say is true mrs paget but i imagine you expect me to do more than agree in theory you didnt know the reverend wynter she said after another few steps the emotion was carefully controlled in her voice now and he could not see her face it was dark all around them only the yellow gleam of a few uncurtained windows shone warmly here and there illuminating short distances touching branches with gold and making the night beyond seem deeper he was a good man she went on he was brave and honest he knew right from wrong and he didnt flinch from doing what he had to even though he didnt like it did he know things about more than one person he asked he was trying to evade the issue and he knew it perhaps she did too he might have known things about a lot of people she admitted but he knew that john and genevieve boscombe are living together in sin he walked out on his first wife left her alone to fend for herself vicar never told a word but i dont come from cottisham and i know one or two other places as well i recognized him and told the reverend wynter he asked shivering a little no i didnt she said stiffly but if i had id have been doing those poor children a service branding them as illegitimate he said disbelief making his voice hard the scandal would ruin the parents and make them all outcasts how is that a service mrs paget they crossed the road together side by side only if the vicar told people she answered with exaggerated patience and he wouldnt do that you said so yourself there was triumph in her but thin and shivery full of hurt you havent been a vicar very long have you she observed he felt the heat burn inside him despite the bitter edge of the wind no what do you suppose the reverend wynter intended to do he wanted to know for himself but also because it might lead him toward whoever had killed wynter face them she said simply tell them they have to put things right go back and face mrs boscombe the real one and care for her make some restitution to her for what her husband did perhaps if hes lucky shell divorce him for his adultery with her that calls herself his wife now if all that happens then they can marry and make their children legitimate at last by adoption or however its done not their fault poor little souls he felt an intense pity more than she could have understood his own first marriage had been less than happy as he understood happiness now he had not left his wife but he had certainly betrayed her more than once she may well have expected it but that excused nothing he still had a guilt to expiate and he knew and accepted it that certain knowledge made him far quicker to forgive others to understand ugliness and stupidity and try to heal it rather than destroy the perpetrator you are quite right he said to her gently that would be the correct thing to do even if not the easiest he never lacked courage she kept walking at a steady even pace into the wind takes courage to be a priest reverend corde cant just go around being nice to people sometimes that isnt the real help yes mrs paget im sure it isnt he agreed im home now good night vicar mrs paget he said quickly you said the reverend wynter knew things about many people so he did she cut across him but its no good asking me what things they were or who they were about because i dont know i just knew that one because i knew ive lived in other villages too good night vicar this time she turned and walked away briskly up the path toward the nearest cottage good night mrs paget he said more to himself than to her it was not a good night he knew that after supper he would have to go see john boscombe and ask him if what he had been told was the truth because he felt sure that was what the reverend wynter was doing before he died he had racked his brains to find another alternative all the time knowing that there was none clarice had offered to come with him and he had refused she had no part in it and no chaperone was necessary she would worry he knew that imagining all kinds of anger and distress but that was the burden of a priests wife and she did not ask to be relieved of it it was a hard walk to the boscombes house he did not dare take the shortcut through the woods even if the stream was frozen his arm ached from carrying the lantern and trying to hold it against the wind he was welcomed in the house was warm although not as warm as the vicarage where they could afford to burn a little more coal how nice to see you reverend corde boscombe said immediately its a terrible night for visiting what brings you no one ill or needing help dominic almost changed his mind maybe this was something the bishop should deal with or whoever was given this living permanently but if he evaded it clarice would despise him even now he could imagine her disappointment in him he followed boscombe inside to the parlor where genevieve was sitting sewing she was patching the sleeves of a jacket she put it away quickly as if to welcome him but he saw from the quick flush in her face that she was ashamed were they really paying blackmail to someone the vicar please god no or to anyone else perhaps from boscombes home village even mrs paget but it was the reverend wynter who was dead mrs paget was very much alive genny please get the vicar a cup of tea or soup boscombe requested which would you like how could dominic accept the mans hospitality given out of their little with what he had come to say guilt almost choked him and who was he to blame a man for doing what he might so easily have done himself had the temptation been there sarah was dead however and he was free to love clarice as he wished but due to luck not virtue no thank you not yet he prevaricated but i would like to speak to you confidentially mr boscombe i beg your pardon for that on such an evening dont worry vicar genevieve said quickly i have jobs to do in the kitchen you just call when youd like the soup what is it boscombe asked as soon as the door was closed and they were alone you look very grave vicar not more money gone is it or did you find out who took it i think the reverend wynter was inclined to let it go you know he could always see the greater picture the one that mattered yes i imagine he could dominic answered it seems to me he thought past todays embarrassment and saw the grief that could come in the future if present sins however easy to understand or even to sympathize with were not put right boscombes face paled his eyes were steady on dominics face im sorry dominic said gently there is no record of your marriage in this parish if i ask the bishop will he find it in some other place boscombes voice was husky his eyes wretched no vicar genevieve is the wife of my heart but not of the law the reverend wynter knew that and he wanted to find a way for us to make it right but i couldnt stay on in office in the church once he knew but you could stay until then the moment the words were out of his lips dominic wished he had not said them it was a criticism boscombe did not need however justified boscombe blushed and looked down at his big hands i wasnt the one who told him i couldnt bring myself to i wanted to be happy he said softly that was the cowards way i suppose but he asked me to help with the money and other tasks in the church i couldnt refuse without telling him why he twisted his fingers together crushing the flesh till they were white i didnt think youd find out so quick did you kill the reverend wynter boscombes head jerked up his eyes wide no god in heaven man how can you ask such a thing he was my friend he wanted us to put it right and i told him i wasnt leaving genevieve for anything church or no church and i wasnt going back to my first wife either if god sent me to hell at least id have a life first but go back and it would be hell now and who would support genny and my children who supports your first wife dominic asked she had money of her own and no need of mine boscombe said bitterly as she often reminded me if she divorced you for your adultery and desertion you would be free to marry genevieve and make your children legitimate dominic pointed out in the law if not in the church wouldnt it still be better boscombe gave a sharp bark of laughter do you think i didnt ask her to shes not a woman to forgive reverend corde not ever as long as she lives shell hold me to bondage my only choice is to live in sin with genevieve the best and gentlest most loyal woman i know or live in virtue cold as ice with a woman who hates me and will make me pay every day and night of my life because i dont love her the reverend wynter wanted me to make it right for genevieves sake and my childrens he told me theyd get nothing if i die and i know thats true he blinked several times ill just have to pray i dont die he was looking for a way for me to make it right with god but he never found it before he died i dont know who killed him but i swear to you before the lord who made the earth and everything in it it was not me i loved the reverend wynter and ive got enough on my soul as it is without adding violence to it dominic believed him it fit with what mrs paget had told him and what he had come to know of wynter boscombe might have thought in a moments desperation that if wynter were dead he could continue to live in peace but he must have known that it would only be a matter of time before he was exposed with murder on his hands and his heart there would be no happiness ahead for him or for the woman and the children he loved so deeply could dominic find an answer for him if wynter with a lifetime in the church could not then how could he a novice ill try to find a way for you to sort it out he promised rashly thank you for your honesty if there were wed have found it by now boscombe said miserably what are you going to say to the bishop nothing dominic replied again rashly he stood up im concerned with finding who killed the reverend wynter anything else is between you and god living with a woman to whom you are not married may be a sin but it is not against the law we will address that problem later perhaps after christmas they will move me somewhere else i hope not but i cannot choose he heard the roughness of grief in his own voice and was angry with himself what had he to grieve over when he was returning to the woman he loved with no shadow over them or between them except whatever he might create himself by being less than she believed of him first let us celebrate the birth of christ and leave other things until after that boscombe held out his hand blinking rapidly again thank you dominic gripped him hard but if i stay here we will have to seek an answer one day i know boscombe replied i know the morning dawned bright the sky was a pale windscoured blue and the ice crust on the snow was hard enough to support a childs weight the few ducks out eager for bread paddled across it without making a crack someone had been thoughtful enough to put out water for them but it would need thawing every hour or two clarice had baked bread a skill she was very proud of because it had not come naturally to her dominic took a loaf to old mr riddington and found him frail and hunched up in his chair he was grateful for the bread but even more for the company in his chilly and almost soundless world dominic brought in more wood and coal making them both a cup of tea he found it was more than two hours before he could decently leave the old man he went next door to check with mrs blount and thank her for her kindness then he set out for home he was close to the green again when he was aware of footsteps behind him he heard every crack and crunch of the ice he turned to see the small figure of sybil towers struggling to catch up with him her mittened hands were waggling awkwardly as she tried to keep her balance her cape was trailing lopsidedly and her hat was a trifle awry it was the last thing he wanted to do but he started back toward her she looked so frantic and lonely he had no choice good morning mrs towers are you all right he offered her his arm it isnt weather for hurrying you know where are you going perhaps i can accompany you and see you dont fall you are too kind reverend corde she grasped his arm as if it were a lifeline in a stormy sea those poor ducks i know mrs jones is putting out bread and a little lard for them such a nice woman which way are you going mrs towers he asked again oh over there she gestured vaguely with her free arm nearly losing her balance again how are you settling in is mrs corde finding the vicarage to her liking a home matters so much i always think we both like it very much indeed he answered a good garden she went on old trees make a garden dont you agree yes he nodded i expect in spring they are beautiful she told him how many blossom trees there were then the various other flowers in season all the way through to the tawny chrysanthemums the purple michaelmas daisies and the offer of an excellent recipe for crab apple jelly one of my favorites i confess she said with enthusiasm i prefer the tart to the very sweet dont you they were now well across the green and into the lane at the far side they had passed several cottages the way through the woods lay ahead winding between the trees presumably it led eventually to open fields and perhaps a farm or two he had realized half a mile ago that she was not actually going anywhere she needed to talk to him but could not bring herself to come to the subject easily his hands were numb and his feet so cold he was losing sensation in them also but he felt her need as sharply as the wind rattling the bare branches above them did she know something about the reverend wynters death was that what she was struggling to say of course we will probably not be here for very long he prompted her surprised again by the regret in his voice once the bishop finds a permanent replacement for the reverend wynter we will return to london from everything i hear he was a most remarkable man one whose shoes it will not be easy to fill he was she said eagerly oh he was so kind so very patient one knew one could trust him with anything she took a deep shuddering breath but i think perhaps you are the same reverend corde it seems to me you are a man who has understood pain she looked away from him and he knew she was afraid she had been too bold he hastened to reassure her thank you that is a very fine thing to say mrs towers i shall endeavor to live up to it at least i can say that i understand loneliness and the grief of knowing that you have done something ugly and wrong but i also know there is a path back they walked in silence for several yards crows wheeled up in the sky cawing harshly then circled back into the lower branches again i was going to speak to the reverend wynter she said at last i wanted to make a confession but i think he knew that dominic said for her still holding her arm lets turn back or we will have too far to go all the earth is gods house you do not have to speak in a church for it to be a sacred trust no no i suppose not i kept doing little things wrong you see to find out if he would forgive them before ibefore i told him the real thing he walked a few moments perhaps thirty or forty yards along the path and then he prompted her again was it you who took the pennies from the collection for the poor she drew in her breath with a little cry it was only pennies i made it up always i gave extra he put his other hand over her arm holding her more tightly that doesnt matter the books were never short i know that but you wanted to speak to him and never quite found the resolve he did not use the word courage perhaps now would be a good time she gulped again ii committed aa terrible sin when i was young im so ashamed and it can never be undone i wanted to confess butbut ihe was such a good man i was afraid he would despise me then tell me mrs towers i am not so very good i understand very well what it feels like to sin and to repent i do repent i do then cast it on the lord and be free of it but i must pay i think that is not for you to decide what is it you did that is so heavy for you to bear i had a love affair she whispered oh i did love him you see i am not mrs towers i never married andand again she could not find the words he guessed you had a child she nodded yes she took a few more steps i only saw her for a few moments then they took her away from me she was so beautiful the tears were flowing down her face now in moments the wind would freeze them on her cold skin she must have been nearly seventy and yet the memory was as sharp as yesterday he ached to do anything that would take away the pain could the compassion in his own heart speak for god surely god had to be better greater than he was is that all he asked her is that not enough she said incredulously yes and the penance you have already paid is enough also more than enough god forgave you long ago and the reverend wynter would tell you that were he here i wish id had the courage to tell him she said swallowing hard did he not guess he asked oh no he knew i wished to say something but he did not know what it was she sounded certain he knew many peoples secrets he went on they were now almost back to the far side of the village green do you not think perhaps the father could have told him oh no indeed not the fathernever knew it would have been quite impossible for him to marry me there was no purpose in my telling him about it i simply went away it is what girls do you know yes yes i do know he did not say any more it was an ageold story of love and pain and sometimes betrayal sometimes simple tragedy it had happened untold times and would happen again had it been here in this village whoever the father was she had protected him all these years she would not betray him now and it was not part of her penance that she should dominic was still holding her arm and he gripped it a little more tightly as they stepped into the rutted road icy where wheels had pressed it down deep between ridges thank you for speaking to me he said sincerely please dont think of it any further except with love or grief but never again with guilt she nodded unable even to attempt words he left her at her door and turned to walk back toward the vicarage he was quite certain that he had said to her exactly what the reverend wynter would have and his admiration for the old mans wisdom and compassion grew even greater how would dominic follow in his footsteps and guide and comfort the people of this villagebe strong for them judge wisely know the hearts and not merely the words he would be here for christmasthat much he was certain of what could he say that was passionate and honest and caught the glory of what christmas was truly about it was gods greatest gift to the world but how could he make them see that there would be yule logs and carols and bells mulled wine gifts decorated trees lights across the snow they were the outer marks of joy how could he make just as visible the inward ones he wanted clarice to be proud of him he wanted it with a hunger close to starvation he must give her the gift she most wanted toofinding the best in himself for both of them of course he said nothing to her of what sybil towers had told him and he found that a hardship he would have liked her advice but he never considered breaking the trust instead over luncheon clarice told him that mrs wellbeloved had been in that morning bringing yet more onions and another rockhard cabbage which with a strong wrist and a sharp knife she would be able to slice mrs wellbeloved was full of gossip about the poor vicars death and the fact that john boscombe had had a terrible quarrel with him shortly before the village was buzzing with the news but no one had the faintest idea what the argument had been about his marriage or lack of it i should think dominic replied since it was clarice who had discovered it that was not a confidence between the two of them poor man you sympathize with him clarice said in surprise dont you i do with genevieve if she didnt know very little if she did clarice responded he smiled if i had been married unhappily and met you i might have done the same oh she did not know whether to smile or disapprove she tried both with singular lack of success he saw the conflict in her face and laughed and you think i would have lived with you anyway she said hotly she took a deep breath and speared a carrot with her fork youre probably right he smiled more widely with a little flutter of warmth inside him but he was wise enough not to answer at almost two oclock he set out to go up to the manor there were one or two favors he wished to ask peter connaught with regard to villagers he knew were in need but more than that he wondered if perhaps peters father could have been sybil towerss lover if the reverend wynter had known that was it a secret worth killing him for did it even matter now so many years afterward it would be a scandal and peter was inordinately proud of his family and its heritage of honor and care in the village it was not his fault of course but the stain would touch him was he protective enough of his fathers name to have killed to keep it safe what if sybils daughter were known to him she was illegitimate and had no possible claim in law even if her heritage could be provedwhich it probably could not but in a small community like cottisham proof was irrelevant reputation was all the weather had deteriorated the wind was rising clouds piled high in the west darkening the sky and promising heavy falls of snow that night he was welcomed at the hall as always and in the huge withdrawing room the usual log fire was blazing the afternoon was dark and the candelabra were lit making the room almost festively bright he accepted the offer of tea longing to thaw his hands on the warm cup as much as he looked forward to the drink they addressed the business of the village help must be given with discretion even the most needy did not like to feel they are objects of charity many would rather freeze or go hungry than accept pity food could be given to all so none felt their poverty revealed they arranged for the blacksmith to go after dark and add a few dozen logs to certain peoples woodpiles the butler came with tea and hot toasted tea cakes thick with currants and covered with melted butter the two men left not a crumb finally dominic had to approach the subject of sybil towers he had thought about it considered all possibilities and found no answer that pleased him fully but he could not break sybils confidence i have to ask you a very troubling question he began he was awkward he knew it and could think of no way to help himself i have gained certain knowledge not because i sought it and i cannot reveal any more to you than that so please do not ask me peter frowned you may trust my discretion what is it that is wrong dominic had already concocted the lie carefully but it still troubled him many years ago a young woman in the village had a love affair with a man it was impossible for her to marry there was a child i believe the father never knew he was watching peters face but saw in it only sympathy and a certain resignation no doubt he had heard similar stories many times before im sorry peter said quietly if it happened long ago why do you raise it now because the reverend wynter may have known of it dominic said frankly still watching peters face and he was murdered did you say murdered peter demanded his voice hoarse that is very far from what fitzpatrick told me i know dr fitzpatrick does not want to face the unpleasantness of such a thing but i believe the reverend wynter was a fine man and his death should not be treated with less than honesty just for our convenience he deserved better than that what makes you think it was murder corde peter reached for the poker readjusted his grasp on it and drove the end into the burning embers the log shifted weight and settled lower sending up a shower of sparks he replaced the poker in its stand and added another log dominic found himself shivering despite the heat he fell at the bottom of the cellar stairs he replied there were marks of being dragged and he was found in the second cellar with injuries both to his face and the back of his head the cellar door was closed behind him and he had no lantern there was silence in the room beyond the thick curtains and the glass even the sound of the wind was muffled i see peter said at last his face somber in the firelight i have to agree with you as an accident that does not make sense how tragic he was a good man wise brave and honest what is it you think this unfortunate woman has to do with it surely you are not suggesting the reverend wynter was the father of this child that i do not believe if he had done such a thingwhich of course is possible we are all capable of love and hatethen he would have admitted it he would not have lied or disclaimed his responsibility no dominic agreed but i think he may have known something of the truth and someone could not bear the thought that he would reveal it perhaps the vicar even wished the father to honor his responsibility in some way he was not prepared to how very sad what is it i can do to help now i presume you cannot tell me the names of either the woman or her child i cannot tell you the name of the woman dominic agreed it has to be confidential the name of the child i do not know but i fear it may be someone who has returned to the village with a certain degree of retribution in her mind oh dear and killed poor wynter because he was the vicar at the time and did not do as she would have wished or thought fair it seems possible dominic replied that at least was true the more he considered it the more likely it became the missing money and wynters quarrel with john boscombe had already been explained peter was waiting for an answer to his first question you must be very careful dominic said softly if it is this woman who kills then she does it with stealth and skill i think it may be someone nobody suspects why should she wish me any harm peters eyes widened when wynter first came here i was a child myself in fact i wasnt even in england that is when my parents were living in the east beforebefore my mother died he looked down and a faint color touched his cheeks did your father not return to england at all during that time dominic asked peter looked up sharply the whole air of their conversation had altered there was pain in his face and anger his body was stiff in the chair exactly what is it you are asking corde she could not marry him because he was far beyond her social station dominic told him it seems in cottisham that thats most likely to have been your father peters face paled to a sickly yellow as if the blood had drained out of his skin he was shaking when he spoke my father was devoted to my mother it is monstrous that you should make such a revolting suggestion who is this woman i demand to know who hasnoi apologize i know you cannot tell me his hands gripped the arms of his chair but she is a liar of the most vile sort it is not true dominic was startled by the vehemence of his denial it was not so very unusual that a man of wealth and position should produce a few illegitimate children it made dominic wonder if perhaps peter himself might have quarreled with the reverend wynter over it was it conceivable that charming as he was generous diligent in his duties still his family pride was such that he would have struck out in rage at the suggestion that his father had begotten any child other than himself you seem inexplicably angry at the thought sir peter dominic said gently it does not threaten either your inheritance or your title and it is no more than a remote possibility i told you in case you yourself were in some danger your flash of temper makes one wonder if perhaps this same suggestion was the cause of your difference with the reverend wynter and you did not forgive him for making it peter stared at him and slowly the awful meaning of what he had said dawned on him god in heaven man are you saying you think i murdered poor wynter because he believed it was true my father begot thisthis child you cant he dragged in his breath gulping painfully and then he started to laugh it was a terrible sound wrenched out of him with pain dominic was appalled he wanted to run away leave this scene of naked emotion but he must stay find the truth and then face it is that really absurd he said when peter had gained some small measure of control yes yes it is absurd peters voice rose to near hysteria my father could never have had an illegitimate child would to god he could have the words made no sense at all yet in the small discrepancies in what peter had said of his parents a tiny glimmer of light appeared why would you want that dominic asked peter leaned forward his face beaded in sweat eyes dark you know dont you did wynter leave something that you found he swore to me he wouldnt but what is his word worth eh what is yours worth reverend why do you want your father to have begotten an illegitimate child dominic asked again his voice perfectly steady now he was still trying to untangle the confused threads in his mind do you want this woman to be your sister do you know who she is did she kill wynter ive no idea who killed wynter or why peter said forcing the words between his teeth and my father did not beget her at least sir thomas connaught didnt he was sterile god knows who my father was i dont dominic was stunned was that why peter was so defensive of his mother the beautiful woman who had died tragically somewhere in the east had thomas found out her infidelity and killed her no that was impossible if he knew he could not have fathered a child then he would have killed his wife when he knew she was expecting not after the child was born it still made no sense he killed her he said struggling for some kind of logic in it you fool peter shouted at him then he covered his face with his hands of course he didnt he never even knew her i was an orphan one of thousands of children who live in the streets i was good looking intelligent sir thomas found me stealing and lied to the police to save me he had no children and knew he never would have no wife either he adopted me i am quite legally and honorably his heir but i am not of his blood i am no more a connaught of cottisham hall than you are i am illegitimate unwanted i have no father and no mother that i remember either she died or she gave me away it hardly matters now i dont belong here wynter knew thats what we quarreled over he wanted me to stop boasting about my heritage he lowered his hands slowly i hated him because he knew but he was my friend and i would never have harmed him that i swear on the little honor i have left dominic spoke slowly weighing each word did the reverend wynter not tell you that it was the pride of blood that was wrong a man is great or petty because of who he is not who his father was sir thomas connaught gave you the opportunity to be his son and carry on the tradition of service that his father gave to him if you have done so then your actions have earned you the right to be here the respect and love of people is earned it cannot be bequeathed by anyone else you know your father peter said with a raw edge of pain in his voice almost of accusation you were part of him whatever you did that is a bond you cannot make with all the wishing in the world you have no idea whether i knew my father or he knew me dominic said actually i looked like him so i reminded him of all that he disliked in himself the words were still hard to say he greatly preferred my brother who was fair and mildfeatured like my mother whom he adored he was surprised that he remembered it even now with a sense of exclusion and strange inexplicable loss im sorry peter stammered my arrogance is monumental isnt it as if i were the only one in the world who feels he does not belong in his own skin his own life do you know who this woman is the mother perhaps i could do something to help her you could attend to it discreetly it isnt your responsibility dominic pointed out havent you just been telling me that that is irrelevant peter asked smiling very faintly for the first time yes yes i suppose i have dominic agreed you understand me better than i understand myself by all means help her she has little in the way of possessions even sufficient fuel to keep her warm would be a great gift consider it done and the others in the village who are in any need the estate has plenty of wood and certainly no better use for it thank you dominic meant it profoundly he smiled back thank you he repeated while dominic was at the manor house clarice took a lantern and went down into the cellar again though mrs wellbeloved had swept the steps clarice knew which one had the splinter on it that had frayed the reverend wynters trouser leg as well as where he must have landed at the bottom carefully she continued on down the stairs holding the lantern high no one could come down here without a light of some sort and a candle would be blown out by the draft from the hall above if he had tripped and fallen he would have dropped the lantern and it would have broken what had happened to it had someone swept up all the shards and hidden them and what had they done with the metal frame she should find out from mrs wellbeloved if there was a lantern missing or not but whom would the reverend wynter go into the cellar with what excuse had they given to fetch coal for him on the pretext that it was heavy no it wasnt not very mrs wellbeloved normally did it herself she was strong but not like a man and where was the coke scuttle to carry it in whoever it was had dragged the reverend wynters body from the bottom of the steps across the floor and into the other cellar leaving the marks in the coal dust why they had tried to scuff them out but hadnt entirely succeeded why make them in the first place he was an old man lightboned frail why not carry him because the killer had not been strong enough to carry him a weak man or a woman genevieve boscombe it was a sickening thought but genevieve had much to lose a woman would do almost anything to protect her children a bear to protect her cubs would kill indiscriminately she turned around slowly and started climbing back up again glad of the light from the hallway at the top she reached it and was facing mrs paget sorry to startle you mrs paget said with a smile i took the liberty of coming in the door was unlocked the reverend wynter always left it unlocked too and its bitter outside that wind is cruel yes of course clarice felt as if she should apologize for being less than welcoming after all in a sense the vicarage belonged to the whole village and mrs paget had obliquely reminded her of that please come in its warmer in the kitchen would you like a cup of tea thats very kind of you mrs paget said i brought you a bottle of elderflower wine i thought it might be pleasant with your christmas dinner the vicar was very fond of it she held out a bottle with a red ribbon around its neck the liquid in it shining clear pale gold how very kind of you clarice said she blew out the flame in the lantern and set it on the hall shelf then took the bottle she led the way into the kitchen and pushed the kettle over onto the hob to boil again thank goodness today she had cake she must not get the reputation for having nothing to offer visitors mrs paget made herself comfortable in one of the kitchen chairs i see you were down in the cellar again she remarked not to get coal her eyes wandered to the full coal and coke receptacles by the stove then back to clarice hard for you that it happened right here clarice was taken aback by her frankness yes i suppose youre working out what happened should she deny it that would be pointless it was obviously what she had been doing and mrs paget knew it that too was clear in her bright brown eyes trying to clarice admitted poor man that was a terrible thing mrs paget shook her head but vicars sometimes get to know secrets people cant bear to have told you be careful mrs corde theres wickedness in the village in places you wouldnt think to look for it you watch out for your husband a pleasant face can very easily fool men some look harmless that arent clarice decided to be just as blunt indeed mrs paget she thought of the marks of dragging in the cellar floor the vicar had trusted a woman he should not have perhaps even trying to help her do you have anyone in particular in mind mrs paget hesitated again but it was clear in the concentration of her expression that she was not offended at being asked the kettle started to steam clarice warmed the teapot then placed the leaves in and poured on the water setting it on the table to brew she sat down opposite mrs paget still waiting for an answer instead mrs paget asked another question what did you find down there clarice was not sure how much she wanted to answer nothing conclusive mrs paget surprised her again no doubt you were disturbed by my coming im sorry about that i did call out but not loud enough for you to hear downstairs perhaps there is something if we looked properly the poor man deserves justice and that old fool fitzpatrick isnt going to do anything about it ill come with you if you like hold the lantern clarice felt her stomach tighten but she had no possible excuse to refuse and she could not bring herself to tell mrs paget a deliberate lie for one thing it could be too easily found out if anyone at all were to go down there and what could she say she needed to keep the evidence it might be the only proof of what had happened thank you that would be a good idea i didnt really have time to look after tea and cake clarice went gingerly down the steps again with mrs paget behind her holding the lantern of course they found exactly what clarice had already seen that was where i found him she pointed to the doorway of the second cellar so he fell here mrs paget said quietly pointing to the bottom of the steps and whoever it was dragged him there she indicated the marks over to there yes i think so mrs paget studied the floor by the shoulders from the look of it and those are their own footmarksunless they are yours clarice stared at the distinct mark of a boot well to the side of the tracks it might be dr fitzpatricks she said with a frown going backward mrs paget asked gently her eyes bright why would he do that unless he was dragging something and it looks a little small dont you think she was absolutely right it was a womans boot or a boys as if reading her thoughts mrs paget said the same thing tommy spriggs one of the village boys said he saw a woman hurrying away from here the day the vicar was last seen hell tell you if you ask him hurrying she was who was it ah that he doesnt know couldve been any grown woman who could walk rapidly and wasnt either very short or very tall can you take me to him clarice asked of course i can mrs paget picked up her skirts to climb back up the stairs good thing you came down here mrs corde and a good thing youre not minded to let injustice go by simply because its easier and i daresay more comfortable in the evening clarice told dominic about it and of finding tommy spriggs and confirming what mrs paget had said had he any idea who she was dominic asked none at all what he had told mrs paget was all he knew she answered she looked at him both fearing the same answer neither spoke it christmas eve dawned so cold the windows were blind with fresh snow and even inside the air numbed fingers and toes outside all color was drowned white earth white sky even the black trees were mantled in white just a few filigree branches were hung with icicles here and there though when it had thawed sufficiently for them to melt into daggers of ice was hard to say blizzards blew in from the east and through that coldgripped world genevieve boscombe came to the door and asked to see dominic the study fire wasnt lit so he took her into the sitting room he spent several moments poking the wood and coal until the fire caught a better hold and started to give a little more heat only when she sat down and he looked more closely at her eyes did he realize that no hearth in the world was going to assuage the cold inside her i killed the reverend wynter she said quietly her voice was flat almost without emotion i lied to you when i said he wasnt going to do anything about john and me not being married he was going to tell everyone so all the village would know i couldnt take that not for my children dominic was stunned after what clarice had told him the previous evening they both knew it was horribly possible that genevieve boscombe was guilty even so he could not easily believe it he hated the thought he had liked both of them but then how good was he really at judging character any more deeply than the superficial qualities of humor or gentleness good manners the ability to see what is beautiful and he sympathized with her he well understood those who truly loved and could not bear to lose the warmth and purpose from their lives i did she repeated as if he had not heard her its not a religious confession vicar i expect you to tell the police so they can arrest me she sat with her back straight and her hands folded in her lap her eyes were redrimmed but there were no tears in them now he thought she had probably done all her weeping at least for the time being how did you do it mrs boscombe he asked still reluctant to accept and looking for a way for her to be not totally at fault she looked surprised although it was visible as just a momentary flicker of the eyes i carried the coke scuttle down for him she replied i hit him with it he fell and i pulled him into the other cellar so he wouldnt be found too soon but you knew he would be found sometime he said i didnt think i dont remember and she refused to say anything further merely requesting that he report her to the constable so she could be arrested there was in effect no constable only the blacksmith who was appointed to represent the law in the village she insisted on going with him after much protest the blacksmith locked her in the large warm storeroom next to the forge dominic went straight to tell john boscombe what had happened trudging through the snow he was cold inside and out even when he stood in boscombes kitchen in front of him she only said it to protect me boscombe said frantically his face was haggard his eyes wild where is she ill reason with her i was the one who killed the vicar i quarreled with him because he wanted me to get straight with the law and the church his voice was rising in pitch rising desperately i had an accident in the summer could have been killed was then the vicar told me that if i had been my family would get nothing not even the house because they werent legal genny and the children would be thrown onto charity and folks might not be that kind to them seeing i still had a wife alive that id never sorted things with i see dominic said quietly and did you believe that the reverend wynter would have forced you to do this whatever the cost to you boscombe hesitated did you dominic insisted i was afraid he would boscombe evaded a direct answer his eyes were angry challenging thats why i did it gennys innocent she didnt even know i was already married when she he stopped agreed to live with you without marriage dominic asked boscombe was caught to deny it would suggest genevieve did not care about marriage and that was obviously ridiculous was the vicar blackmailing you dominic asked good god no boscombe was appalled but a tide of color swept up his face dominic guessed the reason then who is he said i dont believe you killed the reverend wynter nor did genevieve but you are each afraid that the other did so there must be a terrible reason why it could be so someone is threatening you who is it boscombes face was wretchedeyes full of shame my wife shes here in cottisham shes asking money every week shell bleed us dry all the jumbled pieces were beginning to make sense at last but shes still alive isnt she dominic said gently why would you kill the reverend wynter and not her why would either of you slowly the darkness melted from boscombes face and he straightened his shoulders leaning forward a little as if to rise it wasnt genevieve it was maribelle the vicar wouldnt have forced us to do the right thing only helped us but if we did then maribelle would get nothing and he knew what she was doing he wanted it all out just like you did maribelle dominic asked although by now he was certain he knew his blood chilled at the thought of her alone with clarice in the cellar where she had killed the reverend wynter but there was no time to stare into nightmares now maribelle paget was my first wife boscombe admitted and a crueler woman never trod the earth come dominic stood up we must go and face her but genevieve shes safe we have other things to do first she thinks you did it and she wont back down from her confession until weve proved otherwise after dominic had left with genevieve boscombe clarice stood in the kitchen staring out of the window at the snow on the apple tree going over and over in her mind what mrs paget had said in the cellar the impression would not leave her that mrs paget had expected to find the footprint where it was almost as if she had known it was there she had read the drag marks without hesitation knowing what they were how did she do that so accurately why did she assume that the woman seen leaving the vicarage in the wind and snow had had anything to do with the vicars death she could have been anyone she had even known at which step he had fallen she had stopped at it instinctively clarice turned from the window taking her cape from the hook in the hall she wound it around herself and set off in the snow toward the boscombes house she must tell dominic immediately that neither john nor genevieve was guilty she was afraid john boscombe might panic even fight dominic when he heard what had happened and do something that in itself would condemn him there was no time to waste she took the shortcut along the path through the trees the stream would be frozen over and safe to cross the boscombes house was only just beyond the crust on the snow was hard for a moment it bore her weight then cracked and pitched her off balance the icy breath of the wind sighed in the branches blowing clumps of heavy snow onto the ground two or three fell close to her distracting her attention she was almost upon the three figures before she saw them dark and blurred in the colorless landscape it was dominic and john boscombe facing mrs paget clarice stopped abruptly the stream was to her right identifiable now only as a winding strip of level ground between the banks they must all have seen her but it was mrs paget ten feet closer who moved first she plunged forward through the deep snow flailing her arms crossing the ground with extraordinary speed she reached clarice in moments her face contorted with fury clarice stepped back but not quickly enough mrs paget grasped hold of her fingers like a vise pulling her toward the stream dragging her along she had no time to think she struggled but her fists struck only the other womans heavy cloak dominic was shouting something but another avalanche from above drowned his words the snow was melting now they were on the flat icy surface of the stream itself where it was easier to move it wont hold you mrs paget shouted back at the man triumph loud and high in her voice step onto it too and well all go down she turned back to clarice struggle too hard and youll crack the ice under us clever vicars wife believe me the cold under there will kill you clarice stopped moving instantly good mrs paget said with satisfaction now come with me slowly carefully when we get to the far side i might let you go and then i might not theyre too heavy to come after us nothing they can do she pulled again hard and clarice nearly fell boscombe and dominic stopped at the brink aware that their weight would break the ice mrs paget laughed with a high vicious sound she yanked on clarices arm and started forward again clarice did all she could to resist but her feet had no purchase on the ice she heard it before she realized what it was a sharp sound like a shot then another more like ripping cotton mrs paget screamed grabbing at clarice and clinging to her hand so hard clarice cried out in pain mrs paget had fallen down on her back legs thrashing the ice swayed and tipped the cracks in it fanning out the black water swirling over it as cold as death her big cloak imprisoned her in its folds clarice felt the water with a shock that almost took the air from her lungs the cold was unbelievable she could not even cry out dominic started out across the ice calling her heedless of the danger to himself boscombe was in the churning ice floes of the shallows kneedeep then waistdeep his whole body outstretched to hold on to dominics arm clarice was paralyzed with the cold her hand still gripped by mrs pagets like a small animal caught in the jaws of a trap dominic seized her other hand pulling hard but mrs paget would not let go if she drowned clarice would drown with her dominic reached past her there was a piece of branch in his hand he swung out hard striking mrs pagets fingers with a force enough to break the bone she shrieked once drawing the black water into her lungs and then she was gone sucked into the current as it swept under the unbroken ice carrying her away dominic and boscombe dragged clarice out she was almost unconscious and shuddering so violently she could barely breathe she saw lights in the gloom and heard voices then drifted into a kind of sleep she woke with someone rubbing her hands and arms then her legs someone else put hot tea between her lips and she swallowed it awkwardly it hit her stomach like fire and made her choke then she saw dominic his face white with fear dont be so silly she whispered hoarsely im not going to drown i was justdetecting he laughed but there were tears in his eyes and on his cheeks of course you were he agreed you have to hear my christmas sermon there were murmurs of assent and more tea and then it all faded into a blur distant and happy and full of kindness the usual watch night service was not held in deference to the death of maribelle paget however word rapidly spread of exactly how it had come about if not why nor did anyone mention that she was really maribelle boscombe but in the morning every man woman and child was in the village church to celebrate christmas day even old mr riddington was there wrapped in a blanket and warmed with liberal doses of blackberry wine the bells rang out over the snow carrying the message of joy across fields and woodlands from spire to spire throughout the land inside the organ played the old favorites and the voices sangfor oncein total unison dominic went to the pulpit and spoke simply passionately knowing that what he said was true christmas is the time when we give gifts most especially to children many have spent long hours making them carefully and with love putting into them the best that they have there are dolls toy trains a wooden whistle a new dress painted bricks he saw nods and smiles he leaned forward over the pulpit rail we are the children of god every one of us and nearly nineteen hundred years ago he gave us the greatest of all the gifts he has greater even than life he gave us hope a way back from every mistake we have made no matter how small or how large how ugly or how incredibly stupid or how shameful there is no corner of hell secret enough or deep enough for there to be no path back if we are willing to climb up it may be hard and steep but there is light ahead and freedom deliberately he did not look at sybil towers or peter connaught nor did he look at the boscombes with their children or mrs wellbeloved or mr riddington only once did he glance at clarice and saw the pride and the joy in her it was all the reward he ever wanted do not deny the gift he said accept it for yourself and for all others that is what christmas is everlasting hope a way forward to the best in ourselves and all that we can become amen the congregation replied then again with passion they rose to their feet one by one amen above them the bells pealed out across the land anne perry anne perry is the bestselling author of
