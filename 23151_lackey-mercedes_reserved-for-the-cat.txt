making sure there were no little bits of grit or nearinvisible lumps that would make themselves known in the middle of the performance then she took surgical tape and bound her toes so that if the inevitable blisters did break and bleed the blood wouldnt seep through and stain the pink silk of the shoes it did not do for a pretty little sylph to have bleeding feet it spoiled the illusion she had already spent half an hour pounding on the toes of her shoes with a hammer to break up the glue just so old shoes for practice new shoes for performance it was a mantra like so many other mantras of a ballet dancer ninette was only a sujet a soloist and a newmade one at thatone step up from the coryphées and two from the quadrilles of the chorus but not yet to the exalted status of the premier danseurs and as far from the etoiles as she was from the stars in the sky coryphées did not often have new shoes one could see them backstage at rehearsal covering their old shoes with new silk reblocking and reglueing the toes a soloist yes as a soloist she got a pair of new shoes for every new production ninette did not get the sort of pampering that the etoiles got but as a soloist she could at last do what she was here to do in the first place not to become a star performer oh no her goal was more oblique to catch the eye of a rich old gentleman her mother marie dupond had made no bones about it when she had enrolled her daughter in the ballet school of the paris opera there were not many options open to a pretty little girl like ninette alone with her mother in montmartre she could become a washerwoman and starve and possibly marry some poor workingman who would overlook the fact that she had no father and bear a dozen children bury most of them and die young she could work for the painters as her mother did and also starve with them she would have no reputation and go to bed with them because at least they had beds and food most of the time and were always generous if improvident she could simply become a whore because no respectable man of any means would marry a girl with no father never mind that her mother had a marriage license and all such things could be faked and when there was no live father and no grave and even if one accepted the license well the man had deserted the woman likely he had a dozen wives or more which would make ninette a bastard not many respectable men with good positions would take the chance on marrying a pretty girl whose backgroundor relativesmight come back to haunt him so ninette could marry a poor man who would not have such concerns or she could put herself where rich men would see her and become something better than a mere whore she could become a courtesan one of the places to be seen by men with money was on the stage preferably the opera or ballet though the folies were marginally acceptable and it was clear to marie dupond when she saw her flowerlike child dancing almost before she could walk that the place for her was the paris opera ballet many rich old men in large fur coats took mistresses from among the little ballerinas and if the girls were clever they kept their rich old men very happy and were given a tidy little something as a parting gift when another little ballerina took their place by then they were known at maxims and on the boulevards and another rich old man would quickly take the place of the former one if they were not clever of course they ended up drinking absinthe to excess and showing their legs at the moulin rouge or even less desirable places and ended up as washerwomen and starved but along with ballet lessons little ninette received lessons in being clever from a very young age and the very first one repeated so often that ninette thought if one were to take off her skull it would be engraved on her brain was this never fall in love maman had fallen in love she had fallen in love with an englishman and they had even marriedshe truly did have the license to prove itand set up housekeeping in a little garret apartment and ninette supposed had been very happy then one day shortly after ninette was born when she was wailing away in her cradle and maman had been at her wits end to soothe her papa had gone out and he had never come back again and that was all ninette knew of her papa there had most certainly been no trace of him whatsoever no bodies had turned up no one even remembered seeing him in their street he was justgone and there was maman with no money and a tiny baby and no idea how to keep them from starving except to take in washing and take off her clothes for the artists in their quarter so she did both and ninette grew up in an atmosphere where the smell of harsh soap and paint drying meant comfort meager comfort but nevertheless comfort for soap and paint meant cabbage beans bread and cheese and perhaps even sausages sometimes the artists were kinder than the people who sent them laundry to clean the artists bounced her on their knees when she was quiet to make her laugh sang outoftune songs with questionable lyrics to soothe her to sleep and sometimes had musician friends who played music that made her dance the artists were more generous too which was strange considering that the people who sent them laundry had far more money than the artists did learning to dance was hard work dancing was even harder ninette had liked making up her own dances and not having to do them teetering on her burning toes with her calves and arches aching ballet hurt she ended every performanceand she had been performing since she was twelvewith cramped and blistered feet with aching ankles and knees she ended every rehearsal wishing she could have been anywhere else she was not one of those few for whom the stage was a fairytale place where nothing bad could ever touch them the stage for her was one thing a show window where she would somehow manage to catch the eye of someone with a great deal of money while at the same time keeping the etoiles and the premier danseurs from noticing that she had done so as she wedged her feet carefully into her pink satin shoes and bound the pink ribbons just so around her ankles the scent of the ballet filled her nostrilsrosin and sweat chalkdust and flowers perfume and gaslights the heavy makeup they all wore the pomade on their hair to hold it in place all the sylphgirls wore their hair in stiff little buns with wreaths of white artificial flowers around them the scottish girls all had the same stiff little buns but wore scottish bonnets over them so they didnt need as much pomade the orchestra was tuning up on the other side of the red velvet curtain and the house was filling she could hear the murmur of voices out there a kind of dull rumble in which individual voices were submerged into an oddly slumberous whole ninette of course was a sylph this was a very long ballet and it often seemed to ninette that it got longer every year with more and more solos duets trios pas de quatres and variations added to satisfy who presumably the rich old men in fur coats in the boxes who delighted in seeing their kept darlings flitting across the stage each of them watched with proprietary pride knowingor at least thinkingthat their pretty little thing was being ogled by all but like the white doe in the legend was not to be touched by any save the one whose collar they wore so prettily well ninette was going to be one of those kept darlings and when she was she was going to stop dancing or at least she was going to dance only what and as she wanted to perhaps she thought longingly perhaps in the style of la belle isadora isadora duncan with her bare feet and little greek tunics bare arms and freedom perhaps like loie fuller who had only to swirl enormous draperies around in colored lights but that day was not yet and this day was another skirmish in the war to win what her mother never had she missed her mother every night going home to the nowempty apartment every sunday visiting the unmarked paupers grave she missed maman dreadfully that might seem strange to someone who only saw the maria dupond who lectured and scolded her daughter always pushing pushing her but ninette knew the desperation that had been behind the scolding and felt that same desperation watching the pleasant spring and languid summer march towards fall towards winter when the little garret would have little or no heat and the wind would whistle through the cracks till the water would freeze solid in the pitcher and washbasin it had been hard enough to sustain life with both maries income and hers with the meager salary of a soloist ninette rose to her feet and began her warming up exercises she never put these off she had seen far too many girls hurt because they scanted their warmupsand an injured dancer is not a dancer at all and there were plenty more waiting to take her place if she faltered and fell stretches first toetouches plies in all five positions back and leg stretches along the backstage barre followed by similar exercises en pointe and limbering exercises for the arches this was only a matinee and the audience would mostly be children and their governesses old people who could not afford the evening pricesbut some of those rich old men still liked to fill the box stalls even at a matinee for some the reason was because the matinee was where the fresh young talent was trotted out and seasoned like young horses running local races before attempting the grand prix for others it was because their constitutions no longer permitted the late hours of a long production and who knew there might even be some ballet lovers among them as opposed to lovers of little ballerinas since it was only a matinee ninette had not even thought much about the fact that the sylphide herself mademoiselle jeanmarie augustine was nowhere to be seen the etoile was possessed by one of those rich old men performed her warmups in the privacy of her own little ballet studio in her luxurious flat and was rushed to the theater in her paramours own motorcar but an uncharacteristic stir backstage caught her attention as did the sound of raised voices signaling something was wrong and she looked up from her stretching among all the other little sylphs to see the ballet master the wardrobe mistress and the company manager hurrying towards her own little knot of girls carrying respectively a wreath of artificial orange blossoms of the sort that winter brides wore the slightly larger and more elaborate wings of la sylphide herself and a sheaf of papers and they were looking straight at her a thrill of excitement together with a chill of anxiety sent blood rushing to her cheeks and gooseflesh to crawl on her arms something must have happened to la augustine but surely they werent they were the other girls scampered awkwardly out of the way as the three approached the portly besuited manager with his little fringe of hair combed hopelessly over his bald pate looking particularly redfaced and outofsorts when they reached hearing distance they all started talking at once of all the wretched inconveniences ma belle we havent time to change petite i know you can enough roared the company manager getting complete silence look here girl he scanned the papers in his hand ninette la augustine managed to trip on the curb and sprained her ankle her understudy didnt come in the look on his face told what he thought was the reasona man too much wine and a big head after the second understudy is already in the harness the harness of course the harness that attached to the ropes that would make the sylphide fly through the air to tease james there were really two sylphides a dancing one and a flying one the harness was built into a costume that was impossible to actually dance in the dancing sylphide would flit offstage and the flying one would be pulled by three strong men out of the wings and through the air only to have the dancing one take her place again to flit with james in pursuit it was one of the tricks that made this ballet so popular that leaves you pierre says you can dance it the ancient ballet master grayhaired tall and leonine smiled encouragingly she wrapped her arms around herself suddenly elated and terrified all at once mais oui i have studied the part rehearsed it but i have seen you in rehearsal after rehearsal cherie and you will be admirable the ballet master patted her shoulder do not think just dance its only a matinee the company manager growled the balletomanes are always after us to put new young dancers on the stage ah but you know why we have the etoiles dance even the matinees the balletmaster interjected the balletomanes are few and the public many and the parisian audience is loyal to a fault they wish to see their etoiles and barring accident yes yes yes i know the manager growled well there was an accident get those wings on her he barked at the inoffensive wardrobe mistress unflappable as ever the competent old woman in her eternal rustyblack dress was already taking the smaller wings of a soloist off the small of ninettes back thank all the saints the costumes are so alike wed never have time for you to change the ballet master plucked the smaller scanter wreath from ninettes head and pinned the sylphides wreath in its place the stage manager evidently already apprised of the situation was mustering the chorus anton deauville the rather aging etoile in the part of james was arranging himself in the armchair onstage the orchestra had finished tuning and was falling silent so was the babble of sound from the other side of the curtain the company manager gave ninette a despairing look and stalked off to stage center front to part the curtains and walk through ladies and gentlemen she heard his voice muffled first by the heavy velvet then the fire curtains due to an accident the part of la sylphide will be danced this afternoon by mademoiselle ninette dupond thank you she went cold she had been in the theater so many times when it was someone elses name announced in place of the etoile there had been restlessness murmurs of discontentafter all one had paid to see the etoile and one should get what one had paid for sometimes there were whistles and catcalls more often cross murmurs as the members of the audience searched in their playbills for the unfamiliar name once in a great while people walked out were they walking out right now places called the stagemanager as the wardrobe mistress got the wings securely in place and ninette had a moment of panic do i enter stage left or stage right she froze but the ballet master had been anticipating this reaction he steered her to her mark and then it was too late to panic the curtain was rising she heard her cue lurched up onto pointe and blindly made her entrance into the glare of the stage lights the performance was a blur punctuated by moments of brilliant clarity anton his face made into an almost immovable mask with stage makeup looking encouragement at her with his expressive eyes a moment of fleeting ecstasy as a lift went so flawlessly it felt as if she were in the harness and flying another of joy as she finished a piece of excruciating footwork so beautifully that the audience broke into spontaneous applause feeling sweat run down her back having to keep it all look magical effortless and through it all mamans orders pick one side or the other left or right it doesnt matter so long as you keep looking to that same side during the whole performance look to the boxes in a moment of rest smile there pretend you can see past the footlights i know you cant and you know you cant but those rich old men up there dont know that and every one of them will be certain you are smiling at him finally james cast the poisoned scarf around her and her wings fell off and she died the other sylphs came and took her up and carried her offstage and onstage the flying sylphs rose into the sky with a lifesized sylph doll in their arms her part was at last done she was done before that though this was the one section where as in giselles mad scene there was a lot of room for interpretation la augustine made a long process of the dying often forcing the conductor to signal the orchestra to repeat bars of music as she staggered about the stage ninette was too drained the moment that her wings came off she came down offpointe stared at james blankly made a feeble motion of entreaty and dropped like a shot bird it was her fellow sylphs that followed the music then gathering around her carrying her off exhaustion struck her like a blow and once they put her down offstage she just sat there breathing hard onstage james wept watched as the wedding procession of his betrothed effie and her former suitor gurn went by railed at the witch madge tried to kill her and was killed in his turn madge did a little pantomime of triumph and the curtain came down offstage ninette finally got to her feet applause there was applause at least so she had not driven anyone out there were no hoots or whistles she must have done well enough first the scots coryphées and quadrilles took their curtain calls then the sylphs then the sujets thenfirst madge then effies mother then effie and gurn and then then anton was taking her hand and drawing her onto the stage and the applause rose and there were shouts of approval she made the bow she had practiced ever since she was a tiny tot deep and appreciative and smiled at the box seats on both sides of the stage and there were flowers bouquets brought on stage by the little pages she remembered to take a rose from hers and give it prettily to anton then the continuing applause reminded her to make another bow and wave graciously to the rest of the company and bow to them then they all came forward and bowed and the curtain came down then rose again this went on two more times before the applause finally died down and she went back to the dressing room in a daze and sat in her little seat in the crowded room shared by all the sujets and stared at herself in the mirror and didnt know if she was glad or disappointed that the evenings performance was not la sylphide but giselle and la augustines understudy for that was certainly pounding on the toes of her new shoes at that very moment in a fever of excitement a thin rangy tabbystriped tomcat surveyed the departing audience from his perch on the overhead scaffolding with satisfaction that went well the little brownie that kept the sujets dressingroom reasonably clean raised a skeptical eyebrow you really are an evil creature tripping a ballerina la augustine is furious la augustines patron will buy her an emerald bracelet and take her to maxims everyone there will make much of her and shell have enough champagne sent to her table to bathe in it she wont do badly out of this and if she is wise enough to do all of the exercises she can she wont lose anything just a few performances the tabby cats tail twitched she might even end up with a new patron the brownie smirked and so might ninette get a patron in the first place that is not get a new one the only betrayal of the tomcats sudden anger was the increased twitching of his tail she wont need a patron after this the brownie snorted shell get one like it or not shell get one she certainly wants one and this performance should net her one and as for her not needing one dont count your chickens before the eggs have hatched shes not an etoile yet she will be the tomcat said it with passion she will be the next morning at class as always everyone from the coryphées to the etoiles had their noses in the papers looking for a mention in the reviews the instructor had not yet arrived and girls were doing their warmups over spreadout newsprint chattering like a flock of sparrows the papers went from hand to hand ninette was certainly not immune and discovered that in most of them the matinee reports were mostly full of la augustines injury and her performance rated only sujet ninette dupond was called upon to replace the etoile and managed a creditable if sometimes naïve interpretation you are damned with faint praise ninette laughed jeanne lacroix another of the sujets it was not a nice laugh but jeanne was not a very nice person by hook or by crook seemed to be her motto for getting ahead one expected a certain amount of that backstage but jeanne seemed to take delight in it she never let an opportunity pass to make another feel small if she could help it oh cried madeline clenceau from the other side of the room listen to this its the reviewer for le figaro now everyone took notice for le figaro was universally thought to be the newspaper for artists and thinkers the matinee performance of la sylphide was notable for the substitution of the sujet ninette dupond for a suddenly injured la augustine and one can only applaud the stroke of fate mademoiselle dupond is far lighter on her feet than la augustine and brought to the part the proper air of fragility and otherworldliness that la augustine lacks her sylphide is innocent and unworldly as a butterfly she entreats the earthbound james to come play on the wind with her la augustines sylphide seems about to invite him to a montmarte bistro for wine and sausages of particular note is the death scene la augustine is well known for drawing this out until one is tempted to rise from the audience and give the sylphide a mercy stroke to put her out of her misery mademoiselle dupond however made the scene heartbreakingly brief one moment she is borne on the wings of the zephyr the next the cursed scarf has worked its sinister magic her wings fall away and she is stricken and drops lifeless to the ground before we or james have quite realized that anything is wrong the pathos then is all the clearer like a naughty boy with his first bow and arrow james has shot at a bird and brought it cold and dead to the earth destroying with his clumsy touch what he had only wanted to cherish this is not to say that la augustine is a poor dancer but let her be confined to the parts where sensuality is an assetla fille mal gardee for instance or corsair and let us hope that this will not be the last time mademoiselle dupond graces the stage as the tragic sylph the chatter in the rehearsal room had stopped dead ninette bit her lip the first thing that struck her was how very wrong the critic had beenhe had mistaken her own exhaustion for deliberate art but the second thing was this la augustine was probably reading the review at this very moment and she was not going to be pleased about it la augustine was furious ninette was in hiding one of the sympathetic teachers isabella rota a former premier danseur herself had hidden ninette in a tiny closet when la augustine came storming through the ballet school limping heavily and in the sort of rage where she would snatch objects up and throw themnot actually at anyone or at least not yet but certainly doing some damage to walls and the objects themselves la augustine was very popular with the audience the critic at le figaro undoubtedly knew this he also knew his review would provoke angry letters and angry letters sell newspapers the ballet company of the paris opera was an established organization and le figaro took the position that anything that had been established for more than a handful of years deserved skewering on a regular basis the critics of le figaro considered themselves far more intelligent than the general run of an audience and being mostly poor were openly contemptuous of the balletomanes the rich old men in the private boxes but the critic in le figaro would probably never have to face the wrath of la augustine himself he probably submitted his work under a nom de plume and thus was secure from retribution by means of the blanket of anonymity the only one who was going to suffer in this instance was ninette and she had known from the moment when la augustine began her rampage through the studios and classrooms that if a head had to go beneath the guillotine that head would not belong to the managers or the ballet master as she huddled in the small stuffy black closet among old rehearsal costumes brooms a mop and a bucket she tried to plan how she should deal with the managers should she weep that might be good after all she had done nothing wrong and none of this was her fault she expected to be demoted to the coryphées again and that would be hard she did not know how she could keep the little garret apartment on the salary of a coryphée without augmenting it somehow she might have to call upon her mothers artist friends and model for them and somehow manage to stay out of their beds if she could keep her head perhaps she could somehow fit in dancing elsewhere perhapsperhaps she should find another place to live a smaller room a cellar instead of a garret although the idea of the mice and rats and black beetles gave her horrors maybe she should but all these plans came crashing down when madame rota came for her ninette emerged blinking in the light from the closet the old womans face told her that it was worse than she had dreamed but even she could not have guessed what she had doneuntil madame rota told her oh petite you have done the unthinkable madame rota said sadly patting her hand la augustines patron was in the boxes for he was entertaining friends and once his paramour was safely bestowed on her maids saw no reason why he should not continue to do so she shook her white head in its little black lace cap you smiled at him cherie and worse he was taken with you and worse stillhe said as much to la augustine madame rota let go of her hand and sighed i am sorry little one was all she said in the managers eyes the good review would balance la augustines anger at the insults to her in that same review after all you scarcely put the critic up to it and not even she could claim that but when her patron expresses his admirationthat is never to be forgiven and not even the director of the company can save you numb now ninette followed the old woman to the office of the director of the company it was the first time she had entered those august precincts the office was a jewel box of red velvet and gilt much like the expensive private boxes in the theater itself it was as well that she was numb for the blow was a cruel one and a final one she was fired turned out ordered to collect her belongings and go not quite thrown out on her ear but the whispers followed her as she changed out of her rehearsal dress and into her street clothes and the looks followed her too some pitying some smug and at three oclock in the afternoon she found herself outside the building as the music from the rehearsal rooms rang out over the street a mishmash of five or six pianos all playing different pieces at once and she hadnt the least idea of what to do despair gave way to tears she hung her head to hide them and slowly made her way through the narrow streets to her building then up the three flights of stairs to her little apartment very soon not to be hers at all for the rent was due and she had no salary to pay it with three days was all she had three days in which to find work if she could a good review of a ballet matinee performance it seemed meant nothing whatsoever to the managers of the folies bergere the moulin rouge the comedie francais patiently or impatiently the company managers gave her the cold facts she learned that such a thing could have been a fluke her one good performance of a lifetime or it could merely have been spite on the part of the critic who used her as a vehicle to lambaste la augustine oh she could auditionbut there were no openings not for a mere chorus dancer and at any rate this was not ballet it was a very different style of dance had she danced in such performances before no thank you mademoiselle but your services will not be required the artists were sympathetic but penniless no one was buying paintings the philistines were on the ascendant they could not pay her to sit at the end of the third day of fruitlessly hunting for a position she returned to the garret knowing there was only one course left to her she would go back to the folies she had just enough time to alter her one good dress tighten the bodice drop the neckline she would go not to the stage but to the bar and she would linger and flirt sidle up to anyone who did not already have a grisette and hope she dropped her face into her hands and cried what a ghastly thing to hope for that some ordinary uncultured man would hand her enough money to pay the rent for another few days so he could take her into his bed and then she would have to do it all again the next night and the nextpossibly even more than once in the same night it had been one thing to hope for a rich old man well mannered dignified who would take care of her that would not have been so bad it might not have been bad at all it would certainly have been no worse than an arranged marriage she had seen some of the patrons and they seemed kind they often gave the little girls sweets and nosegays of violets there was some dignity to the idea courtesans were established they had a kind of respectand if the arrangement was not forever or the man was careless or cruel well that was not so bad as being tied in a lifelong loveless bond of drudgery to some old man for whom one was unpaid cook nurse housekeeper a poor man a legal spouse could be just as cruel and abusive as a rich one more actually the only people a poor man could take his frustrations and anger out on were his wife and children a courtesan at least had a gilded cage servants luxuries good food a soft bed and fine wine beautiful clothes and jewels would make up for a very great deal indeed but this this wassordid and once she started on this pathhow could she ever hope to rise higher many were the tales of courtesans who fell to the streets but few of those who managed the journey in reverse but what choice did she have tomorrow she would be in the street and even more vulnerable unless she got money tonight ninetteninette please do not cry a voice startled she choked off her sobs and looked wildly about the little room the golden light of the descending sun filtered through the parisian smoke filled the garret and there was no one there no one and nothing except for the rangy tomcat a brown tabby who sat on the windowsill he was no ones cat but he had been around and about for as long as ninette could rememberhim or at least one just like him in good times he got their scraps and in bad at least he was a warm companion in bed maria would never have allowed that but the cat had always insinuated himself inside somehow and out again before the morning fires were lit and as he never had fleas ninette had been happy to share her blankets so now she was hearing things you are not hearing things you are hearing me the voice said again she looked wildly about who is there she demanded her despair fueling her anger at this unasked for invasion show yourself you are looking at me ninette the tomcat jumped down off the sill and strolled up to her it is the cat call me thomas if you like her mouth dropped open as the cat jumped up onto the little table and sat down again curling his tail neatly about his feet she shook her head a little wildly no no this is impossible clearly not since you can hear me speaking to you so do not cry ninette i will make things right for you i should have spoken to you when maria died but i was afraid you would never believei have watched over you all your life she stared into the cats unblinking eyes oh and so fine a job you have made of it did you ever starve was there always money to pay the rent the cat retorted do you remember the sausages the cheese the fish that were left on the table that you thought were from your artist friends the little purses maria just found in the street when the rent came due maria would never have believed in any of the other things i could have done i had to confine myself to what she would believe in ninette bit her lip her mind a whirl she felt as if her entire existence had been turned upside down talking cats talking cats that claimed to have been taking care of them and yet and yet there had been those mysterious gifts of food when they needed them the most maria was incredibly lucky when it came to finding windfalls on the street even the artists had remarked on it saying that she must have a good fairy looking out for her a good fairy not exactly the cat said wryly but close enough ninette will you trust me will you put yourself in my hands paws she corrected absently still feeling her mind reeling if this was madness thenso be it she might as well be mad what did she have to lose if she was truly mad then none of this was happening and someone would find her wandering about and take her to an asylum where she would continue to live in her fancy or she would fall into the seine and drown and all her problems would be solved in that way all right then you have to say it out loud thats the way these things work its like a contract the end of the cats tail twitched restlessly i trust you so go and do whatever you want i wont go to the folies just yet i will give you your chance stay right here the cat said fiercely pack a small bag with anything you do not want to leave behind change into your good gown i will be right back abruptly he stood up and whisked out of the window so quickly he might have been enchanted she was left staring at the spot on the table where he had been sitting pack a bag with anything she did not want to leave behind she bit her lip and stared out at the evening sky what in the name of god could this all mean as sunset turned to lheure bleu and became dusk then dark she waited through her open window she could hear the sounds of the streetartists arguing at the little café someone with a guitar children released from whatever job they did during the day finding a little energy to play through the window came cooking smells cabbage the eternal cabbage the staple of the poor sausages frying her stomach growled and she finally got up lit a stub of a candle and rummaged the last of her bread from beneath the bowl where she had put it to keep it safe from mice chopped up the last of her cabbage and made a thin cabbage soup and ate it slowly dipping the hard bread into the broth there was nothing more in the flat which did not matter because if she had been imagining the talking cat she would be in the street tomorrow anyway and if she hadnt she would where would she be why would a cat tell her to pack a bag the last of the soup a memory the last crumb of bread gone she finally got up from the table and did pack that bag an ancient carpetbag worn to the weft she put it on the bed and when she was done it was scarcely half full there was not much to put in it a few bits of clothing mamans marriage license a little jewelry not even the pawnshop would take everything they had ever had of value had long since been pawned except for the furniture and she could not in any event strap a bed to her back and carry it off she packed her ballet shoes her rehearsal costume she put on her good dress as instructed tied her shawl about her waist and sat down to wait the candle slowly burned down to a small puddle of wax until it was just a bit of wick sporting a tiny flame finally as she began to doze at the table there was a thump at the window and a second as the cat leapt from the floor to the top of the table he had a square piece of pasteboard in his mouth take it he said insistently and dumbfounded she did i will be right back he said before she could ask any questions and leapt away and out the window like the spirit of the rose in the ballet sketch she held it sideways to the light to see what it was to her astonishment it was a railway ticket paris to calais common carriage the boattrain what on there was another thump and the cat returned this time with a purse in his mouth which he dropped at her feet put that in your pocket he said then get your bag we havent much time to get to the train he wandered over to the old worn carpetbag and swatted at it with a paw ah good there will be room in there for me that will make things easier she picked up the purse it was an ordinary little thing of leather and she felt and heard coins in it she opened the mouth and poured the money out into her hand it held twentythree francs a centime piece four centime pieces seven centime pieces three fives and nine single centimes which was nineteen francs more than she had seen of late and much more than her mother had ever had at one time there was nothing to identify the owner she looked up to see the cat insinuating himself into the bag you stole this she said aghast the purse the ticket and what if i did it was from no one who would be terribly harmed by the loss now hurry up you can buy dinner on the train or at a station you will have to catch the metro and then the train but why are we going to calais she asked there was no answer the cats tail disappeared into the bag with a feeling that things had spun completely out of control ninette picked up the bag now made heavier by the addition of the cat and hesitated again she looked around with the odd feeling that this would be the last time she ever saw this apartment this was where she had mostly grown up she had scarcely known any other home yet when she left no one would really miss her the rest of the dancers had probably forgotten her already as kindhearted as the artists were they were very much of the sort to put everything but their painting right out of their minds if she had been sitting for any of themif she vanished whoever she was sitting for would have been angry of course but as she wasnt well she was just another forgettable little dancer and model who went away somewhere and they would not trouble themselves too much over where that was so long as none of them were called to identify a sad little corpse at the morgue the place was clean but threadbare and rather dreary despite having so many artists in and out the only pictures on the wall were those cut out from discarded magazines and framed with little bits of wood from old crates even those tended to go for kindling in the winter the bed didnt even have proper blankets just ragblankets made of skirts too stained worn or torn to ever be worn again by anyone there was nothing in this room that had not been used and discarded by someone else even me the metro girl the candle guttered out she took that as a sign she stole down the dark stairs and into the night leaving nothing of herself behind the metro was crowded but not so overcrowded that she had to stand she had to run to catch the boattrain however and by that time the bread and cabbage had worn very thin she was in fact desperate for some food the bag was heavy she was tired and her mind was in a dazed state where all she could think about was her growling stomach and the ticket in her hands she took a seat the bag at her feet and as the train pulled out of the station and the conductor began his journey through the car collecting tickets she had a moment of panic what if he knew the ticket was stolen what if it wasnt a real ticket at all what if but he looked at it collected it and moved on without a second glance she sighed and when a vendor came along the aisle selling sweets and cones of nuts she fumbled in the stolen purse for coins and bought some then she tucked back into the shadows of her seat and ate slowly savoring each bite she had not had sweets or nuts since one of the patrons had brought some for all the girls and here she had a cone of nuts and a whole bar of chocolate to herself the cat in the bag at her feet was quiet but warm her shoes were so thin she could feel his warmth and the vibration of his purr she had never been on a train in her life the carriage seemed very grand with its scarlet upholstery and its brass fittings there were lovely lamps at intervals all along the car fitted in between the windows the windows were tightly closed but there was a smell of soot in the air some smoke from the engine escaped into the car she peered through the windows hoping to see something she had never been outside of paris either but it was too dark to see the best she got were glimpses of an occasional dim light in the distance from some farm or other the vague shapes of the towns the train passed through and the lit platforms they occasionally stopped at despite the clattering sootscented noisy reality of this journey ninette could not believe in it it had an air of unreality for her as surreal as any of the wildest canvases of the artists of montmartre she ninette dupond could not be doing this sitting in a boattrain on the way to calais this must be a dream a curiously vivid dream when the train pulled into the station she picked up the bag and the cat and drifted out onto the platform still wrapped in that unreality the cat slipped out of the bag and stood beside her on the platform looking about alertly go and sit over there he directed with a nod of his head dont move ill be back she looked down at him askance but got no further word from him the fact of his talking however only reinforced her feeling that this was all a dream that in a moment she would waken in her bed back in paris and try to think of some prospect she had not yet considered as the means of paying the rent but because it seemed the right thing to do in a dream she went and sat as directed and watched people stream by on their way to and from the ferries and thought about food the chocolate and nuts were long gone dared she see if there was a café somewhere near here just as she was thinking about looking for one she felt a nudge at her ankle it was the cat with a thick pasteboard rectangle held daintily in his teeth she knew without even looking at it what it must be a ferry ticket she could not even manage to protest that she didnt want to go to england because by this time aside from her hunger this was all too absurd to be real and in a way her hunger only enforced the absurdity if she were lying somewhere mad or delirious and dreaming all this well she would be hungry wouldnt she so she just reached down and took the ticket wordlessly the cat climbed into the bag again and she joined the stream of passengers heading towards the boat finally once aboard she found real food inside the ferry someone was selling sandwiches wrapped in paper and hot tea from a window she bought both carried them away to the warmest bench she could find and sat there eating in tiny bites she heard some complaints around her about the bread being stale the cheese inferior but she thought she had not tasted anything so good in a long time with a lurch the ferry pulled away from the dock and began the nearly threehour trip to dover ninette got another sandwich the crossing was smooth preternaturally smooth according to the comments as late as it was there was not much to see ninette amused herself by observing the passengers and trying to guess which of them was smuggling liquor into england to avoid the duties the man with the tall hat he could easily fit a bottle of brandy in there and that made her think suddenly that there would be a customs man examining her bag in dover the cat he would discover the cat and surely one was not allowed to bring a cat into england but then in the next moment she laughed at herself for being so absurd she had by now convinced herself that this was all an illusion a dream built of hunger and maybe fever or madness it wouldnt matter there wouldnt be a customs man or the cat would turn himself into a hairbrush or something in fact when the ferry docked and she joined the long crocodile of people leaving she realized that her bag was much lighter the cat had vanished and when she reached the examining counters the customs man poked through her meager belongings with utter indifference before waving her on and then she found herself staring at the trains waiting to take on passengers without the slightest idea of what to do next where was she to go was she supposed to catch another train find some place to stay in dover she only had french money where was she to get english money she felt herself on the verge of crying when there was a warm brush against her ankles and she looked down to see the catonce again with a pasteboard rectangle in his teethpoking his head from under her skirt she reached down and took it he got into the bag as she placed it on the ground clearly her next act would be to get on the train so lacking anything better to do she followed his directions still somehow coming into her mind to the one he wanted her to get on it looked very different from the french train less stylish more purposeful she got on and took a seat in the farthest darkest corner of the compartment at this point she was moving in a fog of exhaustion and as the sun came up and pierced the windows of her railway car she stopped thinking altogether they arrived at an enormous train station full of noise and smoke and bustle full of the sound of foreign words in foreign voices she got off and followed the cat when he jumped down out of the bag she sat on a bench at his command until he returned with first a new purse containing strangelooking money and then another railway ticket she followed him to the new train let him get into the bag and boarded it had all the characteristics of a dream she got off the train in a new city one that she quickly realized from the scent of the ocean and the chill damp wind was a seaside city the cat eeled out of the bag and looked up at her its not far now she heard him say just stay with me trust me well why not she had trusted him this far she followed the cat into a shabbygenteel neighborhood of small shops and tiny boarding houses the cat led her to one that displayed a french flag in the window the woman here is from lyon she is a widow and takes in holiday guests tell her you are here to visit your sister who married an englishman the cat said brusquely give her one of the small gold coins she will take you to a room and there you can sleep i will tell you what to do when you awaken numbly she did as the cat said at this point the dream had gone far beyond madness into something else the woman who answered her knock was thin worn tiredlooking but at least she spoke tolerable french she asked few questions when ninette timidly handed her the coin instead she merely led ninette up a set of very narrow stairs to an equally narrowbut cleanroom i serve breakfast at six which you are too late for the woman said luncheon is served at noon and from the look of you you will probably sleep through that so i will make an exception for you and serve you a good tea which i normally do not serveunless you also sleep through teatime in which case you may join us for supper at seven ninette nodded and set her bag down the woman took this as the signal to leave and did ninette managed to get her dress off and climb under the blankets for a moment she was very cold and thought that this surely was a sign that she was about to wake up but then a warm soft body slipped into the bed with her sliding his way up to nestle against her stomach where he began purring a moment later she was warm i cannot be falling asleep if i am already asleep or does this mean when i fall asleep i am going to wake up or am i never going to wake up and that is why i am dreaming of falling asleep the questions circled around and around until she couldnt sort them out anymore a moment after that she truly was asleep ninette woke to the sounds of voices and footsteps running up the stairs normally that would not have woken her but somewhere in the back of her dreams she realized that they were speaking a foreign tongue except somehow she could understand them imperfectly but she could understand them she came a little more awake clutched the bedclothes with her eyes still closed and listened to the young women trudge up the stairs to their rooms and chatter about their shopjobs the horrid customers by the voices there were five two of whom had french accents and who seemed to be working for a perfumer and a milliner how can i understand them she thought baffled and then she truly woke up she was in a strange room in a strange beda room and a bed much much nicer than any she had ever had before the smells were all wrong pleasant but wrong there was the faint scent of lavender the fainter scent of the sea and just a hint of baking bread the sounds were all wrong also the staircase was solid not creaky the voices in the street outside were nothing like as loud as in montmartre and were neither raised in argument nor song and it was raining this was not france it had not been a fever dream she was truly was in england and how was it she could understand those young women because i gave you the language the warm place at the small of her back moved and the cat insinuated himself out from under the bedclothes and sat on the pillow looking down at her how she whispered haltingly i put it into your head by magic but she didnt believe in you are speaking to a cat if you do not believe this is magic what do you think it is she blinked and blinked again she was awake in england possessed of two purses of money and speaking to a cat there really was no explanation other than madness and if she was mad then she wasnt here at all and it all certainly felt real but the whole situation was so impossible if you get up and get dressed you will be able to get supper with the rest trust me i know what i am doing i will help you make your fortune her stomach growled and that decided for her this might be madness this might be impossible but there was food down there and she had missed too many meals already in her life at the moment she did not care about fortunes she cared about a good dinner she spent a good long time brushing out her skirt and jacket then washing up in the basin on the dresser and combing out her hair unlike some of the other ballet girls her hair was not down to her waist it was only just long enough to be put up into the proper stiff little bun she pinned it up tidily donned her clothing and when she heard a bell ring and the sounds of footsteps and voices in the hall and on the stairs she joined the others the other young women glanced at her curiously but all were clearly hungry and in a great hurry to get to the table nor did she blame them the savory aromas nearly made her faint she followed the others to a dining room in the manner of the rest of the house it was very clean very neat but nothing in it was new a huge plain table with a white tablecloth could easily seat ten there were eight plain ladderbacked chairs around it now a little maidservant was bringing in the last of a set of platters this one holding a loaf of bread already sliced gaslights illuminated the table in the growing dusk it was all she could do to remember her manners remember that she was not supposed to be a starving little dancer nor a montmartre refugee but a respectable girl visiting her married sister she waited until the others were seated then took the only vacant chair she bowed her head over her clasped hands while madame spoke a brief blessing she looked up as madame finished despite longing to reach for the nearest plate she kept her hands in her lap this is miss ninette dupond madame said gravely she will be staying with us for a few days while she visits her sister before returning to the continent i trust you will make her welcome madame had a very strong accent but so far as ninette could tell her english was quite correct the others murmured welcomes and then the passing of dishes from hand to hand began the main course was a cassoulet of white beans with pork and mutton and a bit of bacon there was of course far less pork and mutton than there were beans but this was several steps above what ninette had been eating of late and there was plenty to go around with this were plenty of boiled potatoes and cabbage and that wonderful big crusty loaf of bread ninette ruled herself at that meal with a will of iron she did not grab she did not fill her dish to overflowing she did not take the last of anything she ate slowly with small bites she did not pour half the sugar in the bowl into her tea she knew as she ate that she could not possibly be mad not even in madness could she have imagined eating enough at a meal that she was actually full madame was not stingy with her guests though it was very clear that she made the most economical meals possible but she also made them well and filling mostly the other girls were involved in chatter about each other quiet wellmannered chatter but nonetheless it was simple gossip madame did not join in but neither did she make any gestures of disapproval now and again one of the girls remembered her manners and thought to ask ninette something about the supposed sister the questions were infrequent enough that ninette was able to concoct a plausible sounding story by the end of the meal her sister had met the man who was to be her husband when he traveled to paris as a salesman of steel cutlery she had been working in a shop at the time they were married in paris on becoming a husband and fathertobe he had taken another job with his firm as a clerk so that he did not have to travel this was their first child it had gone well but maria needed her sisters company the flat was too small for a visitor to stay in this was all accepted without anything other than a nod or two madame enquired as to whether she would be taking luncheon at the house ninette told her yes i do not want to be a burden on them she said in her new broken english they must watch their pennies madame nodded with approval and attention moved on to the new playbill at the alhambra music hall which seemed from what ninette could gather to be pretty much like the old playbill the comedian was said to be a little funnier the magician not so good as the last there were ragtime singers from america in place of rose and violet and three young men there were jugglers instead of acrobats and dogs instead of the sketch comic the young ladies voiced their discontent ninette concentrated on her dinner but it occurred to her at that moment that she might just might be able to leverage her cachet as a french dancer into a position at one of these music halls respectable shop girls and respectable boarding house owners went to these performances while not the paris opera in terms of artistic quality these places were at least attracting something other than the bohemians the grisettes the whores and apaches they might even have their own versions of the old men in fur coats who liked to make the lives of little ballet girls more comfortable she could not continue to live here of course she was rather sure that the salary of a dancer would not extend to a place like this and even if it would she doubted that madame would permit someone like a dancer to live among her shop girls but perhaps the cat could find her a place that catered to entertainers not an impossible idea dinner ended with something that madame called treacle pudding which ninette regarded with a dubious expression and which was rather more sticky sweet than she was used to still it was a luxury the last day had been full of luxuries she had actually had enough to eat for the first time in well certainly since maman had died she had sat in a railway carriage and then in a ferry she had slept in a bed between sheets that were not tearing apart with age and gray with washings beneath warm whole blankets it was like a miracle but it was not thank le bon dieu perfection she would have suspected perfection immediately perfection would have meant that she was lying delirious in a ditch somewhere or mad or even dead or at least dying but no this was reality the cassoulet was just a bit scorched on the bottom the mutton and pork in it were thrifty reuse of leftovers for she tasted a memory of mint on the mutton and of rosemary on the pork the treacle pudding was something she had never tasted or even heard of before and surely she could not have invented anything like it in her own mind so once again this was brought home to her she was in england and a talking cat had brought her here she had paid for lodgings for a week so for a week at least she would live like a decently paid shop girl at the moment that was more than enough the other girls began to push away from the table thanking madame as the little maidservant came to clear away the last of the plates some went into the drawing room pleading the long journey ninette excused herself and went back up to her room when she entered the room it was empty when she turned back from closing the door behind herself the cat was on her bed turn out the purse he said imperiously the english one not the french one obediently she did so the cat delicately separated the coins into neat little piles this is a sovereign he said pointing to the pile of the largest of the coins these are worth the most they are also called pounds you had two you gave madam one and she returned you the change these are shillings twenty of these make a pound you have seven now these are pennies or pence there are twelve of them in a shilling and you have fifteen these two here are three penny pieces and you have two they are also called thruppence these four are six penny pieces called sixpence you have eleven of these halfpenny pieces called hapence and eighteen of these little fellows each worth one fourth of a penny called farthings your rent and meals with the maid to do your laundry for one week came to fifteen shillings so i am going to drill you in this money and then i am going to drill you in how much is reasonable to pay for something but why she began because you need a few more items of clothing right now and because i am going to make it possible for you to live here and live well and i should be very much obliged if you didnt allow yourself to be cheated now what is this an imperious paw tapped one of the piles of coins it was a very good thing that she had gotten that sleep because her eyes were weary and sore by the time the cat allowed her to scoop the coins back into the purse change into her threadbare little spare shift blow out her candle and go back to sleep by this time she was well aware that she was possessed of more money than shed ever had in her life she knew exactly how much she should expect to pay for the pieces of clothing the cat insisted she get tomorrow but one of the expected purchases very much puzzled her she understood going to a secondhand shop for most of it but why would she be going to a ragman for a dress she went out early the next day ostensibly to visit her mythical sister it was still wetnot raining but a kind of heavy mist she headed purposefully down the street her shawl about her shoulders her hat pinned firmly on her head and her hair in the same tight little bun she wore when performing she looked as if she knew exactly where she was going in fact she was following the cat tall narrow houses mixed with shops along a street heavy with traffic horse cabs omnibuses wagons the occasional motor truck or motor car moved along slowly but steadily this was nothing like her street in montmartre there little cafes put their tables out on the sidewalk produce shops racked their wares in front to entice buyers street peddlers bawled out encouragement to buy from their carts and everywhere there were the bohemians sitting on steps on balconies hanging out of the windows dancing to a street organ making music of their own arguing brawling making love in public here there was none of that only the stiff rows of houses and shops and the stiff people moving purposefully to their destinations it will change with the holiday season then you will see this is the offseason when it is hard to let rooms and hard to fill theater seats the cat turned down a side street then another and another they grew progressively narrower with less traffic until at last at long last she found herself in a neighborhood that did remind her of home not that there were artists and musicians thronging the place but this was not a place where those good little shop girls would come to buy safe enough now it was not a place where she would care to be after dark there were no houses here only buildings full of cheap flats that must have been home to enormous families there was another accent in these streets not being a native speaker she couldnt place it but there was a veritable horde of redhaired children running about and though there may not have been artists and musicians there was music of drum and fiddle and tin whistle coming from a public house that was already open but the cat paused at a doorway and twitched his tail at her she pulled the door open to the ringing of a little bell and the cat slipped inside under her skirt it was a used clothing shop but the clothing here was more than a mere cut above the neighborhood it was remarkably good some of the gowns she sorted through were several social strata above the shop girls at the boarding house she confined herself at first however to the merely good clothing buying a skirt and jacket that were identical in color and style to her own but of much better materials and repair and three shirtwaists but then at the cats urging she bought beautiful underthings of the sort she had only seen on the kept etoiles she asked for and got permission to change into these things in a stall at the back of the shop discarding her old clothing she scarcely felt like herself in the soft delicate bloomers the finely crafted corset the dainty corsetcover and petticoat the silk stockings that were teastained but not where anyone would see them and the new outer clothing it was strange very strange because it looked the same butit was unmended and only a little worn it felt more substantial and at the cats prodding she bought a sturdy umbrella you will need it he told her laconically there are only two sorts of weather in blackpool raining and about to rain finally as a girl came in with a bundle while she was looking at cloaks it dawned on her what this was often part of a maidservants wages was the castoff clothing of her mistress this was where the superior maidservants came to sell their windfalls so it was with a little surprise as she waited for the shopkeeper to bundle up the items she wasnt wearing that she heard the cat say from under her skirt ask about the cutup dress too surprised in fact to do anything other than stammer and would you have a ruined day gown velvet perhaps or silk twill that has been cut up badly the shopkeeper looked at her in astonishment pausing for a moment before answering why as a matter of fact i do but why do you need such a thing fancywork hissed the cat shoes you are covering shoes i am recovering dancing slippers she said and the man nodded with understanding and pulled a basket from beneath the counter there were three gowns in there but the cat was only interested in the blue velvet one they were all in rags it looked as if someone had taken a knife to them and slashed them up the girl works for the most meanspirited woman i have ever heard of the shopkeeper said shaking his head over the ruins of what had once been a magnificent gown rather than let her maids have her old clothes because she cant bear the idea of someone of lower rank than she wearing what she once wore she slashes the things to rags before throwing them out the girl brings them here anyway i generally sell them to the rag and bone man my great fortune then that you had not yet smiled ninette as he added that to her purchases he did them all up in a brown paper parcel which she carried out wearing her new clothing and new cloak the cat led her onwards back to better neighborhoods where he directed her purchases of other small items and then it was time to return to the boarding house for luncheon she slipped carefully up the stairs keeping her parcel hidden as best she could in her cloak it wouldnt do for madame to suspect she had been doing anything other than dutifully visiting the supposed sister she quickly unwrapped her new things and put them away in her bag putting the brown paper into the fireplace where it burned nicely she made very certain that the ruined dress was hidden under the rest of her clothing and sat for a moment in quiet contemplation of her new wealth not since she was a little girl had she had a nightdress she and her mother had simply gone to sleep in their underthings in summer or fully clothed in the winter when you needed everything to keep warm she touched the soft linen the bit of lace with wondering fingers and as for the dress and jacket she was wearing perhaps they were plain by the standards of the woman who had discarded them but they were scarcely worn the skirt had never been turned the hems had not been taken up or let down there were no patches no darns no mended seams for the very first time in her life she had an almostnew gown to be sure she was very glad it had been gaslit night when she went down to dinner those girls would have known her for an imposter if they had clearly seen her clothing finally she closed the bag and left the window open for the cat to come in then she went down to the muchdiminished group for luncheon when she arrived at the table there were only three other girls here one of them was a darkhaired studiouslooking girl with very short hair and goldrimmed spectacles madame was not in evidence but luncheon was tea bread and butter currant jam cucumber sandwiches clearly there was only one sandwich apiece but as much bread and butter as a girl would want the two who were sitting together still wearing shopgirls aprons gave ninette a friendly nod but did not stop their gossip which was entirely in french they must have known she could understand them but since it was inconsequential stuff about other girls in the shop she ignored them the darkhaired one was engrossed in a book that did not look at all like a novel that left ninette alone with her meal this she did not at all mind plain as it might be she savored it at the same time trying not to let on she was very nearly in transports of joy over the fact that she was eating real butter and a piece of fresh bread she had herself just cut from the loaf and not salted lard or the grease carefully saved from cooking scraped thin over the top of old stale bread sold cheap at the corner bakery the two girls togethermarie and jeanneate quickly and were as quickly gone likely their time for luncheon was very short and allowed only because the english tended to scant luncheon and eat a large tea which meant they would be there to serve customers at an hour when the other girls would be gone the bookish girl ate slowly absently and methodically as if she were a steam engine and food was only fuel ninette was done before she was took her plates to the serving hatch as the others had and left them there then because she was supposed to be going back to this nonexistent sister she went out again the cat went with her of course she felt far less conspicuous in her new clothing she no longer looked like the scullery maid but as if she belonged on this street frankly she had to wonder if madame would have turned her away if she had spoken english instead of french but perhaps the gold sovereign had done the speaking for her for some time she just followed where the cat led finally he turned around and looked at her over his shoulder where do you want to go he asked sounding a bit baffled she thought about that it wasnt raining so there was no reason to seek shelter inside a shop or some public building finally after making sure there was no one near enough to hear her talking to a cat she replied actually just somewhere we can talk i want to know just what you plan i know you are planning something but i cant keep living at that house pretending to visit a sister that does not exist and are you going to keep stealing purses she stopped then because someone opened the shop door just behind her the cat flicked his tail and moved off follow me was all he said and so she did he led her to a pretty little park where there were young mothers with toddlers and babies in prams that is she assumed that the women were the childrens actual mothers this neighborhood did not look as if the people living here could afford nursemaids for their children like madame they probably had a cook and a maidofallwork but looked after their children themselves the grisettes of bohemia and the left bank of montmartre and garret or basement flats did not have servants at all and were unburdened with children or if they had children they were left at the door of an orphanage or the grisette abandoned her bohemian life to find some way to keep them little ballet girls did not have children either but that was because illegal as it was there were still ways to be rid of a child before it interfered with ones dancing perhaps that was why the artists had all made a pet of her she was a rare thing in their lives they would probably have made even more of a pet of her if she had ever been able to sit still long enough for them to paint her the cat found her a relatively secluded bench there he sat down at her feeton her feet actually and regarded the pigeons with a meditative expression i intend to make you an etoile he said here in the music halls it will not be like the ballet they are more like the follies i should not mind that at all she said instantly but i dont see how you are to do that if they have a steady chorus of dancers i might rise to be the soloist but i would never be an etoile in a place like that one must have an act costumes even scenery sometimes i have one pair of shoes and one rehearsal costume and no act or he replied one must have a name a reputation she rolled her eyes which i also do not have as i was told many times one good review in la figaro does not a reputation make i did not say we would use your name she stared down at him but he did not meet her eyes his were fixed on the pigeons whose name precisely did you intend to use and how do you expect me to get away with this impersonation how far from their companies do most dancers ever travel he countered with a question ballet dancers i mean and not the sort that have no company like isadora and loie fuller you do not want that sort of life you will need a setting a theater where you are the resident etoile not your own theater having ones own theater is foolishness and a waste of money you need an impresario who will set productions around you so that you are the etoile of that company andmore than just ordinary dancers how many etoiles ever travel none at all really she replied after a moment unless the company goes on tour but that is very expensive to mount and unless the company has a sensational reputation like ballet russe it is really folly to go on tour and the etoiles are almost never allowed to dance for other companies so we will borrow the name of someone unlikely to ever hear about your impersonation the cat said calmly so i am to walk up to an impresario and without any way of proving it nor worldly goods to back my claim tell him i am a great etoile from some far away place and expect him to believe me she laughed you are a very clever cat but you have a woeful understanding of humans i have a rather better idea than that the cat replied but for now i should like you to go to the imperial and see what it is you are going to be joining once again the cat led the way it was not a long walk as ninette was used to the imperial music hall was right on the seaside and it offered a continuous show of the sort where one could purchase a ticket walk in at any point and leave when the act you had first seen came on again the cat hid himself under her skirt ninette purchased the cheapest possible ticket and both of them ascended to the fourth balcony the place was rather fantastic she was used to the grandness of the theater but the paris opera though grand was old and showing its age a bit this was new and opulent even the least expensive balcony was lush with velvet and gilding at this hour it was mostly empty and she had her choice of seats not at all averse to heightsafter all she had spent a good many hours of her young life suspended by wires above the stage of the paris operashe took a seat near the middle of the first row and leaned over the railing the act at the moment was a tableaux vivants which at the follies would have consisted of several young ladies clothed in not very much at all posing as a classical painting botticellis venus was always a favorite in this case however the tableaux consisted of a herd of wretched little children in costume posing as a classical painting the ones at the back fidgeted the ones at the front seemed frozen with boredom rather than discipline the orchestra played the audience was supposed to note how perfect the imitation was and then the lights came down only to come up again on another tableaux needless to say none of these were botticellis venus three of these and the way was cleared for the next act performing dogs with one poor monkey in a jockey uniform after that a young lady in a mans suit sang a song the audience seemed to know most of the words and sang along ninette got the impression it was called champagne charlie she sang two more then made way for the ballet this at least was interesting for ninette although even the soloist would have been relegated to the front of the coryphées at the paris opera ballet it was definitely true that she could outdance these girls the question was if she would be allowed to prove it and how was she to become an etoile in such a place as this there was no underlying story to these performances no unifying whole there was no single principal performer who was brought out again and again to show some new variation on her skill this was something like the moulin rouge or the follies a variety performance and yes loie fuller performed at such places and only needed to do her act once at each performance but that was not the sort of thing that ninette was good at la loie had novelty and effect ninette had skill and grace and two feet nor did she think something like the cancan would make an etoile of her still the cat had said to study the acts and the theater so study them she did she spent the rest of the afternoon there in the balcony watching studying this was where she supposed she aspired to be this stage or one like it the only question was how was she to get there you must listen to me and do exactly as i say with no questions the cat said from his place under her skirt curled warmly around her ankles have i not brought you this far it will be hard it will take all your wits and the beginning of it at least will be very uncomfortable for you can you do that i dont see that i have a choice she whispered under cover of the orchestra playing you could go and be a shopgirl i dont know how to be a shopgirl and someone would find out that i dont belong here she thought a moment and firmed her chin stubbornly and besides i want to be an etoile i want to be made much of i want my own dressing room and flowers and champagne and chocolates in it i want young men to send me flowers and old men to send me jewelry i want a dresser and an apartment and a maid i want to find a wealthy man who will then listen to me and you will have all those things the cat said interrupting her now study this place a hall like this will soon be the place of your triumph study it study the acts and above all study the audience it is after all they you must win for the next four days ninette and the cat went out in the morning and returned in the evening every moment of those days she spent studying the music hall on the whole she was rather glad that she was doing that for the cat was correct it seemed to rain at least part of the day every day first she watched the acts and as much of the action behind scenes as she could see from the front of the house and then by cunningly pretending to have been sent to deliver things or otherwise slipping in backstage she studied the acts and the way that things were run from backstage it wasnt hard she knew where to go and how not to be noticed backstage in almost any theater she would bustle about head down carrying a bundle of cloth from one place to another everyone assumed she was someone elses dresser she would sit in a corner and pretend to sew everyone assumed she was someone elses costume girl the one thing that would have made even these pretenses difficult at the ballet where everyone knew everyone else and what their business was made it easy here no one really knew anything much about any of the other acts they rotated among the houses making the music hall circuit never spending more than a week at any one place half the people here were going on together into london to make the rounds of several music halls called one empire or another which were all owned by the same man but the rest were scattering to the four winds every direction but east all but the girl who sang champagne charlie she was going on to something called the panto as a principal boy whatever that was things were run in a very different fashion in this place where the acts never remained for more than two weeks the orchestra had to learn new music with each new act the acts had to rehearse on a new stage with new stagehands every time they migrated to a new booking it was ninette thought distinctly inferior to what she was used toa setting where the performances changed but the players the supporting members and the orchestra remained the same it was even distinctly different from the music halls of paris where there was a resident company of dancers who performed pieces that framed the performances of artists who would remain for long bookings six weeks to even a year or more the orchestra had no feeling of loyalty to the performers after all they would be gone in a week as a consequence they also had no particular interest in supporting them past the absolute minimum required the first morning rehearsals known as band calls could be terrible things taking far longer than they needed to performers supplied their own sheet music and this was often a cause for acrimony as the performers were not inclined to buy new music until they absolutely had to which meant musicians were often forced to deal with music that was just barely readable and when the performer was not in their favor well morning rehearsals could end up in shouting matches with both sides appealing to the stage manager and often threatening to escalate to the theater owner the only time this did not happen was in the case of the very popular performers the equivalent of the etoiles they might supply music fully as old as the most downatheels and outdated comic the most woefully inadequate singer but the most the musicians dared to do was grumble and send up the orchestra leader to the performeror more likely the performers assistantto urge that this time really he should buy some new music for these very prominent performers did not attend the morning walkthroughs themselves oh no they had assistants to do this for them and they might not put in more than a cursory appearance at the rehearsals just after lunch unless they were practicing a new turn this baffled ninette no matter how lofty the etoile he or she was there at every rehearsal warmups might be done in the luxury of ones little studio in ones grand flat but rehearsals rehearsals were sacred you did not go all out in them of course that would be absurd you would exhaust and possibly injure yourself to no purpose but you came and you practiced and you had better make sure that the ballet master did not get the impression that you were losing form but ninette watched and made mental notes she could not at all see how the cat was going to make her an etoile at this point possibly under the paris system yes if the theater owner the ballet master the stage manager could all somehow be persuaded that she was this mysterious dancer she was supposed to impersonate yes it could be done even if she came with nothing but the clothes on her back it could be done but here she had no assistants no scenery no music and even if she somehow conjured these things up like cinderellas fairy godmother out of backstage mice how could she survive the booking circuit she had no agent she knew no one and nothing had no idea what the next city was let alone how to get to it find a place to stay and begin all over again that cat only said wait and see she counted the money left in her purse and tried not to think too hard about the number of days it would last a barrage of thunder startled her awake and she sat straight up in bed her heart pounding she stared at the window clutching her blankets up to her throat seeing the cat sitting there silhouetted intermittently by the flashes of lightning it was a hideous storm she could not recall ever having seen one this bad in paris a violent wind lashed the windowpanes with rain and thunder grumbled in the distance or crashed near at hand perhaps it was that the sea was so near certainly all the operas and ballets she had been a part of over the years linked dreadful storms with the sea this said the cat could not be better satisfaction permeated every word why she asked youll see the cat could be absolutely maddening sometimes but at the moment silhouetted black against the lightningfilled sky with that sure tone to his words she felt her irritation slipping away replaced by a kind of superstitious fear what was he anyway this beast that spoke in her head that controlled her like a puppeteer that had taken her away to a strange land what did he want from her true he had been kind so far buthe couldnt want her body could he be after her soul les contes dhoffman in which she had danced the part of one of guilliettas attendants immediately sprang to her mind could this cat this creature be a servant of the devil oh dont be silly the cat said calmly whatever would i do with your soul i dont want it then why are you doing all this she whispered because i am interested in you because i take pleasure in clever tricks but above all it might just be only because i am a cat she could almost hear him laughing that alone is reason enough now go back to sleep i will be waking you about dawn well that was unlikely to bring her any sleep wake up ninette the voice penetrated the soft dreamless dark she tried to bat it away like an annoying fly but it persisted wake up it is time it couldnt possibly be time for anything important four sharp needles pierced her big toe and her slumbers with a gasp of outrage and pain she sat straight up in bed now quite well awake you bit me she hissed indignantly at the dark shape at the foot of the bed i scarcely broke the skin the cat replied you werent moving and we have very little time get up time for what she demanded but the cat wasnt answering put on that cutup dress over your best underthings he told her and your cloak over all dont bother taking anything else were going out in the darkness she gaped at him but when this has all settled you can send someone for your things or come for them yourself but right now all you need is that dress and your cloak its still raining she protested outside the storm had turned into a steady slow rain without any thunder or lightning but she had no doubt that it was terribly cold out thereand why was she going out in a gown slashed to ribbons i know i told you i was waiting for something this was it the storm now come on maybe if she hadnt been halfmuzzy with sleep or if she wasnt more than half convinced this was just a surreal dream she might have protested more instead she did as she was told and stole down the stairs letting herself out at the kitchen door following the silent cat of course the face full of wind and cold rain that she got woke her up thoroughly but by then it was too late and the cat was pushing against her ankles herding her down into the street what is this all about she gasped you are about to become the victim of a dreadful shipwreck can it be a shipwreck if it is only a yacht a yachtwreck doesnt sound quite right the cat ran on ahead pausing in a circle of lamplight to look back at her a what a shipwreck remember i told you that we were going to borrow someone elses reputation you will be nina tchereslavsky russian prima donna she has never performed further west than berlin you look enough like her photographs to pass she speaks french almost exclusively outside of russia although she does know some english and i will arrange for you to learn russian in the same way i arranged for you to learn english but how does this let me finish youthat is ninadecided to come to england on holiday possibly to arrange a tour as well possibly to stay you are certain there is no dancer half so good as you here a friend with a yacht arranged to bring you in last nights storm the boat was wrecked your friend is presumably drowned and you have lost all of your possessions but i cannot see i will arrange the rest you have only to remember your name and the storm and the wreck and act dazed speak french i will take care of the rest the cat herded her quickly down the street to the seashore by that time her hair was soaked the rags of her gown and her cloak were soaked and with her hair straggling into her eyes she was certainly going to present a convincing imitation of a shipwreck victim as she staggered along the sand the sky was just starting to lighten in the east and the piers of the boardwalk loomed darkly above her head she had not yet been down to the boardwalk although she gathered that there were all manner of places of amusement built on it out of the holiday season though most of them were fairly desolate here the cat said finally wait here try and keep warm when you hear me tell you to lie facedown on the sand remember you are nina tchereslavsky nothing else is of consequence and then the cat whisked away leaving her at the foot of the piers shivering in the dark was this scheme mad enough to actually work well she had no choice now the automobile chugged and rattled the headlights doing little to illuminate the cobblestonepaved street ahead fortunately the streetlamps were still well lit extravagant electrical things that they were nigel barrett gripped the steering wheel and was grateful that this was an enclosed auto and cursed the fact that the storm had chosen last night to break over their heads why you insisted on dragging us out this early in the morning nigel i do not know since this was roughly the tenth time nigel barretts traveling companion wolf had voiced this particular complaint nigel did not bother to repeat his answer but his other traveling companion arthur gilbert did so for him because if we are going to get to manchester in time to see this singer at the matinee we have to leave now wolf nigels only told you so a dozen times nine wolf replied with immense dignity from the rear seat of the enclosed motorcar and i dont know why i had to come along because you are the one writing the music for this extravaganza nigel replied carefully negotiating the narrow street in the semidarkness once again he asked himself why he lived in this part of blackpool where every time he wanted to take the motorcar out he had to negotiate a maze of medieval lanes you have the final word on whether i hire her or not arthur knows what i like wolf said tartly arthur is only the conductor of the orchestra arthur himself replied and you know your best work comes when youre inspired by a particular singer or dancer i cant possibly tell whether or not youd be inspired he reached around over the seat and gave the woolshrouded cage a pat dont worry we wont let you get into a draft i would be much more inspired if youd let me write an opera wolfgang amadeus said fretfully i am tired of those ridiculous tinkly ballads you like so much sweep scale a challenge thats what i need the african grey parrot pulled the wool covering of his cage aside with his beak and one beady black eye peered out at them accusingly and opera isnt going to fill the seats wolf you know that nigel responded without taking his eyes off the street and with these moving pictures coming on pretty soon variety wont either dont worry youll get spectacle and sweep to fill with music ive seen the future of the stage and its name is the ziegfield follies shows with a theme a regular bill of stars you can count on seeing thats what will keep the seats full even when motion pictures take over the music halls i know you keep saying that nigel but you havent really explained yourself arthur gilbert a slight fairhaired man with the build of a whippet and nerves of steel raised an eyebrow at his employer i should think people would get tired of seeing the same thing night after night do people get tired of seeing william gillette as sherlock holmes nigel demanded or henry irving as hamlet or ellen terry as portia and what about maude adams as peter pan well but those are plays arthur replied tucking the woolen blanket in around the cage again and thats in london wolf snorted or made a sound like a snort and thats the genius of the thing nigel said with enthusiasm we take everything that people like best about a playthat is a nice light storywe add in the kind of music they like which is where wolf comes in but without turning the damned thing into an opera because last of all we fit in the best sorts of acts from music hall we rehearse it all and open it in the slow season and thats when all the locals will come when they get tired of it well be in holidays and the holidaymakers will pack the hall by the time they leave the locals will be ready to see it again and when theyre gone it will be time for the christmas pantos thats when we put together the next show start rehearsals and open again after the end of panto season its brilliant i dont know nigel arthur began doubtfully when something dark and fast and seemingly as big as a panther dashed into the street in front of them arthur swore nigel swore and jerked the steering wheel narrowly missing the animal and wolf swore in german as he was knocked to the bottom of his cage the brakes shrieked as the motorcar slid to a stop and the thing leapt onto the hood of the car every hair bristling eyes like saucers full of fire help help the creature shouted into their minds my mistress is dying you must come save her which nigel because he was an elemental master arthur because he was an elemental magician and wolfgang because he was wolfgang all heard with perfect clarity where nigel shouted across the windscreen the shore follow me replied the cat it leapt down to the ground again and raced down the street nigel fed gas to the motor which fortunately had not stalled and raced after it they broke out of the maze of streets to the broader roads and followed the cat at last to the promenade that paralleled the seashore as the sun rose dimly behind the clouds and the rain slacked off to a thin drizzle the cat dashed across the promenade and down one of the wooden staircases that led from the boardwalk to the sands nigel slid the motorcar roughly to a halt and threw open the door dashing after it with arthur closely behind him hurry the cat screamed into their minds for a moment nigel couldnt see where the creature was but then he caught sight of a dark shape just under the pier at the waterline and he raced towards it grateful that the sand was wet and packed solid enough to run on the closer he got the clearer that shape becamea woman hair down and dark with seawater sprawled under what was left of a cloak as if she had crawled up on the sand exhausted a rough piece of broken timber a little way away from her he dropped down beside her and turned her over she was as cold as ice pale and her eyes fluttered open and looked at him dazedly miss can you speak he asked urgently patting her cheek with one hand to revive her a little she answered him in french which he spoke tolerably well where blackpool england who are you arthur asked as he pulled off his coat to wrap around her her velvet gown was in tatters nina nina tchereslavsky she murmured the yachtmy friend then her eyelids fluttered closed again she is a dancer a great dancer a genius the cat said dancing with anxiety she wanted to emigrate to england i tried to dissuade her but she thought she could be a greater star than she already is once she performed on your stage she sold everything and persuaded a friend with a yacht to bring her here you must save her her father was an elemental master he charged me with protecting her when he died ah that explained it then this was no cat it was an elemental spirit in feline form dont worry well take care of her nigel said lifting the slight girl in his arms well she was certainly built like a dancer she weighed hardly anything a dancer and russian she was cold certainly and exhausted and probably everything she owned had gone down with that ship but if he was any judge of such things and as an air master he was rather good at telling how healthy someone was she was in no danger of dying any time soon dancers in his experience were robust hardy they had to be life for a dancer was anything but easy as he carried her to the motorcar already his mind was racing russian dancers were very much in vogue ever since diaghilev had brought them to london in his ballet russes troupe this young woman would certainly be grateful to her rescuers and now she was stranded here with nothing whats happening wolf was shouting from the back seat as he approached the motorcar with his burden whats happening we seem to have rescued a young dancer wolfgang arthur replied pulling a warm laprobe out of the boot and wrapping it around the girl in place of his coat as nigel set her carefully down on the back seat and the cat jumped in beside her and i think that we wont need to go to manchester today after all ninette had not needed to feign confusion and weakness she had lain so long on the sand that all of the heat had leeched out of her body at first she had shivered and shook and her teeth had chattered so hard she thought they were going to break but then a kind of lethargy overtook her and she actually started to feel warm and sleepy dimly she knew that this was a bad sign but she just couldnt bring herself to care at that point fortunately that was the moment when she felt herself being turned over and something warm being wrapped around her when she managed to open her eyes she saw a blurred face a mans face looming over her she had just enough wit to remember her story and her new name to gasp out that name and a few more words and then the effort just became too much and she let her eyes fall shut again when she next came to herself she was in a huge bed engulfed in it in fact lying on what must have been a feather mattress and covered in eiderdowns with hot bricks all around her and the cat sitting smugly on a pillow next to her ah she is awake said a voice in english and another man this one an old one in a dark suit with a full white beard and moustache loomed over her drink this he ordered putting a glass to her lips as he raised her head with the other hand it proved to be hot brandy rather than some nasty medicine she sipped it cautiously then blinked at him as it went almost straight to her head youll do the man said with satisfaction and looked off to a part of the room she could not see without sitting up it is a good thing she is a dancer he said in that direction they may look fragile but in my experience theyre strong as horses i doubt anyone without that kind of strength could have survived a wreck in that storm last night but with some rest and good food shell be as right as rain in a few days glad to hear it doctor lambert said the voice she remembered from the sand and a moment later the man who owned the voice face no longer a blur came to the side of the bed do you know where you are he asked in french somewhere in england she replied you said your name was nina he prompted nina tchereslavsky yes i am a dancer a ballet dancer so many russian dancers have had great success in the west and i am tired of the snow of st petersburg i asked my friend nikolas it was the only russian name she could think of if he would take me on his pretty little boat to england i thought i could find a good company here my reputation here she raised her chin a little in haughty imitation of la augustine should more than suffice now she faltered but there was a terrible storm a terrible storm the boat began to break apart we went into the water and i lost nikolas unbidden the memory of her maman lying slowly dying wasting away with fever in the cold of the garret came to her mind and she burst into tears the man an earnest fellow with brown hair and eager eyes in a round face patted her hand awkwardly now dont give up hope yet he said even though his face told her that he didnt have any hope at all that the imaginary nikolas would have survived a tiny thing like you survived theres plenty of hope for him but i am all alone she wailed all alone and i have nothing and no one all of that was true enough and gave force to her fear and grief that will be enough of that for now mr barrett the doctor said with authority let her sleep the powder i put into her brandy should be working any moment now and indeed even as she raised her hand to wipe the tears away with a corner of the soft soft sheet she lay under the room did a kind of spin and she found her eyes closing all by themselves nigel barrett was in his element reporters clustered about him shouting questions at him this was a good setting for him too the opulent sitting room of his apartment fitted out in the latest and most expensive style he beamed at them all impartially not only were reporters from the blackpool liverpool and manchester papers here there was even a man come up from london london there was nothing nothing that he could have concocted that could have produced this windfall of publicity knowing a good yarn when he heard one nigel had rung up the papers once he knew the little dancer was going to be all right the story of the wreck and its lovely survivor had spread rapidly thanks to the telegraph and the telephone everyone wanted to hear the story first hand nigel and arthur had concocted something that they thought would suitbe romantic enough and plausible enough to pass muster because certainly they couldnt tell the truth instead the cat thomas had been much to his disgust imbued with all the qualities of the most devoted of dogs some of the reporters were even considering having their papers give him a lifesaving medal at least one probably would now the story ran that the cat had run up to them as they paused the auto for a moment near the piers to wait for someone to cross the street never mind that their real route would have taken them nowhere near the piers nigel had conveniently not mentioned why they were out at that hour in the first place the cat supposedly had jumped onto the hood of the motor and when nigel had gotten out to chase him off had jumped down and grabbed nigels trouserleg in his teeth then doglike he had tugged until nigel followed them leading them to the girl no the cat hadnt then been the girls petall of them had reckoned that having a cat swim to shore from a sinking yacht would be rather too much to be believed yes she was adopting her saviorthat was to forestall any newspaper scheme of having the cat adopted by a reader lottery yes he was watching over her now it was immensely touchingthat of course was to strike the proper note of sentiment yes they intended to offer miss tchereslavsky their hospitality until she was well enough to decide what she wanted to dotrue enough on all counts finally when he thought they had all heard enough he ushered the reporters out with orders to his butler to make sure they all got a good brandy before they left to ward off the cold only then did he return to his sitting room where arthur and wolf were waiting for him did it pass muster arthur asked anxiously as he closed the door behind him no reason why it shouldnt nigel replied settling into his favorite armchair and propping his feet on the fire grate he accepted a brandy from arthur with a sigh of satisfaction good gad old man americans couldnt have manufactured something this sensational wolf do you think you can write music for a dancer instead of a singer the parrot snorted and took a dainty bite out of a hothouse grape at least it will be slightly more of a challenge than writing music to fit charlie my charlie oh do tell me true am i still your sweetheart your dear alice blue will you take me to church will you take me to town in my dear little aliceblue aliceblue gown that was a hit nigel reminded him and the parrot groaned the costermongers and newsboys were whistling it in the street he continued you must have sold thousands of copies of the sheet music a bit a bit arthur said complacently kept you in fresh peas wolf but already nebulous plans were unfolding in nigels fertile imagination he remembered a production of shakespearethe tempest it wasand the sensational effects managed on the stage as the curtain rose he could do that they could do that well have to manage to get a shipwreck into the plot nigel said aloud causing both of them to stare at him whyever for arthur said after a moment that would be a dreadfully expensive set to create because were going to have the dancer that was saved from a shipwreck as our star turn nigel shook his head at their surprise couldnt they see it it was a fine thing to capitalize on saving her in the first place but better to remind the public of the great story in two or three months and capitalize on it all over again half of our publicity is already done for us and the locals and the holiday people alike will fill the stalls to see the shipwreck girl saved all over again you dont even know that shell stay with us arthur protested mildly nor that she will be in the least interested in performing in a mere musical show this is a ballet dancer nigel the parrot said drawing himself up with great dignity and looking down his beak at the musichall entrepreneur and a prima donna to boot an artiste shell be looking for a ballet company mark my words you mark mine first shes indebted to us second shes the daughter of an elemental masterwhere else would she go for people who wont think shes balmy for talking to a cat third he grinned ballet dancers like money too loie fuller wasnt too highnosed to appear at the moulin rouge shell make a lot more money with us than with some ballet company he stood up and began to pace elemental masterthat gives me an idea we need a story with magic in it that way we can hire old jonathon who has the kung chow actalways good to have another of the company about kung chow wolf said in dismay i am not going to substitute for one of his wretched doves again really nigel this is going too far no one is asking you to substitute for a dove wolf nigel said pacing faster we should make this a real arabian nights story shipwreck our girl in arabia have her taken to a harem that way we can bring in all the variety acts as things to entertain the sultan and have an excuse to put her in as little as we can convince her to wear and there are plenty of girls in our chorus who wouldnt blanch at doing a harem dance have her escape with the court magicians help oh good lord why dont you just steal the plot and music from my abduction from the seraglio and have done with it wolf said in disgust why dont iwolf thats brilliant nigel turned towards the parrot and conductor with a smile lighting up his face perfect you adapt the music for our show we can tout it as based on abduction from the seraglio by wolfgang amadeus mozart make the print just large enough that the punters wont notice and the highminded will the punters will get their nautch dances and the hightoned will tell each other how fine it is to listen to classical music while they gawk at the nautch dances from behind their pincenezes its brilliant i love you as wolf growled in startlement nigel swooped him up kissed his beak and put him back down on his stand again brilliant brilliant im going to go look up the libretto of this opera of yours and see what i can keep out of it arthur help wolf with some catchy lyrics well need at least one love song of course and one song about being homesick and one from the sultan about making the beauty his slave for all time nigel strode off heading for the music library behind him wolf sighed well the parrot said in resignation at least i wont have to make up any little tinkly tunes this time ninette sat up in the bed curled her arms around her knees and listened in astonishment to the cat thomas posed on the foot of the bed looking precisely as if he had always belonged there somehow over the last few hours he had transformed without essentially changing from the rakish alleyprowler to a creature of great elegance and he had been listening to her hosts while she had been sleeping then come back to report to her what was transpiring they are planning the production around me butbutbut they have not yet seen me dance you have seen what passes for a dancer in these music halls the cat said with a touch of arrogance did you not say yourself that you would make the best of them look like a pony doing tricks well yes but but these girls werent dancers not really oh they might have taken some lessons but they clearly had not been trained as ninette had been trained ballroom dancers with a few tricks and high kicks and one or two of them could teeter about on their toes but they were not trained dancers as she knew training and you know all of the applausegarnering turns the passages that make people leap to their feet yes ninette considered that yes she did the thirtytwo fouettepirouettes from the black swan pas de deux kitris exuberant solo full of leaps where her heel touches the back of her head from don quixote the mad scene from giselle the character solos from sleeping beauty le corsair swan lake all of these things she had rehearsed them over and over again against the day when she might actually be called upon to dance them these were the sorts of pieces that the great dancers dismissed as tricks or cursed the need to perform but that audiences adored i very much doubt that they will have a choreographer as such so you will be making up your own dances i would advise you to make them as showy as possible and steal liberally from anyone you think audiences would like loie fuller for instance the cat sniffed derisively by now so many have stolen from her that one more will not matter and everyone loves seeing yards of fabric being tossed about under colored lights and by now everyone in the dance world knew how fuller manipulated her lights and silks despite her attempts to keep such thing secret there was even a kind of name for it the serpentine dance or skirt dance by which such things were advertised on playbills that gave ninette some ideas the best thing she could do if she was going to have a show built around her would be to manage pieces that looked very impressive but involved short passages of flashy footwork interspersed with a great deal of stage effects a skirtdance would certainly fit that bill now she had seen some swiss and finnish girls in france performing a kind of dancinggymnastics with long ribbons balls hoops and clubs she could certainly do a piece with a ribbon and perhaps another with a hoop or a ball the rest she could certainly lift whole from the ballets she had learned if they are going to create a show around me she began eagerly stop right there the cat commanded fixing her with his gaze you are doing precisely the wrong thing you must not be the eager one think of la augustine would she fling herself at someone who was creating a show around her of course not she would be amused perhaps condescendingthis is only music hall after all then perhaps she would allow herself to be interested she would let herself be coaxed and courted and only gradually would she be persuaded once persuaded of course she would fling herself into it la augustine is nothing if not a professional but she would never give the impression that it was she who was the eager one ninette nodded slowly the cat was right of course as long as they believed she was what she said she wasand there was no reason not tothe coaxing should come from them she shivered a little this was heady stuff and she was not at all sure she was going to be able to deal with it that is why you have me the cat curled the tip of his tail around his feet and looked smug i shall be your impresario i brought you this far did i not that was certainly true and this far was impressive indeed she thought about her last few hours since waking after a refreshing sleep first there had been the long hot bath attended by a maid who washed dried and put up her hair for her before tucking her attentively back into bed now she looked about herself at the opulently appointed guestroom at finest bed she had ever seen at the gorgeous embroidered and ribboned and laced nightdress that the maid had helped her into at the remains of the wonderful breakfast on the tray beside the bed three kinds of eggs ham sausage grilled tomatoes beans toast oatmeal enough for three people she had left a great deal of it though it troubled her to do so she hoped it wouldnt go to waste all right then i should be distressed your imaginary friend with his mythical yacht is still missing you must ask after him first thing any time anyone comes in here i doubt very much that they will trouble you for a few days when it is clear that all is lost you must be sorrowful but not too sorrowful you must not let them think this imaginary fellow was more that just a casual friend tell them you need to work to get your mind off it and allow them to find you a rehearsal pianist and a studio space then work they plan to ask you if you wish to stay here in blackpool they mean here for now although trust me in a very short time propriety will ensure they get you an apartment of your own say yes immediately and burst into tears and say that you are all alone in the world and how kind they are that wouldnt be difficult they were kind and she was all alone except for the cat eventually about the same time that they will think you should be in your own establishment they will broach the subject of working for them i will be right with you i will tell you what to say she frowned a little at that because she rather thought she would not need the cat to put words in her mouth but let it pass so for right now she should simply lie back and be pampered that would not be bad she thought fleetingly of her belongings at the boarding house inventoried them in her mind and reluctantly decided they were not worth going back for though poor madame would wonder what had become of her i will get your keepsakes the cat promised she nodded that would do there wasnt a great deal she wanted a little left of her mothers jewelry consisting of a jet rosary a jet bangle and a silver locket a few letters and her mothers marriage license i can get those leave it to me you will have to find a place to hide them though that was easy enough it would be even easier once she had a private place of her own but for now thanks to any number of overheard conversations and the plots of any number of sensational operas and plays i will ask for a bible and paste the papers inside the cover she said the jewelry would probably escape notice the marriage license however would give her age away fortunately dancers tended to look ageless so long as they did not put on weight she should be able to pass easily for being ten years older than her real age old enough to be the real russian dancer how did you manage to talk to these men she asked finally i thought you could only talk to me the cat grew tense that is an excellent question she waited but the cat remained silent well you ought to answer it then she said impatiently i am thinking the cat washed an ear with one paw you believe in magic by now yes it was her turn to hesitate did she real magic not stage magic the thing of fairy tales how else could she be talking to a cat i suppose the two gentlemen that rescued you are magicians that is why i can talk to them too there is no need to go into much detail but talking cats are the least of the astonishing things in their world she stared at the cat who began washing his other ear but im not a magician she protested am i true you are not but your father was he charged me with taking care of you you know and some things like being able to talk to magical creatures come with the blood but i never did before for some reason she felt indignant as if this sudden ability was an imposition why is it that i have not been talking to magical creatures all my life they would have had to be willing to show themselves and talk to you first could a cat smirk it sounded like he was smirking they dont display themselves before just anyone if you are a magician you can coax or coerce them but if all the power you have is to speak to them they are likely to stay in hiding except for the ones you would not have wanted to see those i kept away that gave her pause and she bit back the irritated retort about snobbery she had been about to deliver there are bad creatures so bad you would have spent all your life in terror in that case she certainly did not want to see them so these men are magicians she thought about that the cat certainly had known well in advance what he was doing hed gotten her onto the ferry across the channel and across england to this specific town did you plan for this all along i have planned for this for months among other plans the cat hesitated a moment i have been planning for your future for most of your life i had hoped you would become an etoile at the paris opera but as that plan fell to pieces this was my second clearly this one is riskier resting as it does on deception and my ability to cozen these magicians if this had fallen to pieces i had a third and a fourth although neither of those were as desirable and they did not make as much use of your dancing i am more familiar with britain than i am with france so when the first plan fell apart it was here that we needed to come did you come to france with my father she asked now very interested in a sense that is not important now i am engaged in a deception with these men it will not hold forever i am certain that at some point they will learn the truth but at that point you will be their great star and it will not matter they are showmen first and foremost it is the show that matters do you take my meaning ninette nodded that was always true to a greater or lesser extent in the theater the great stars were as much publicity and showmanship as talent with the exception maybe of amazing talents like the divine sarah bernhardt and eleanor duse even then would they have been quite so acclaimed if they had not been so eccentric do i need to be eccentric she asked hmm a good question let me think about that the cat hunched down over his forepaws eyes half closed i think eccentric in simplicity elegant simplicity not all bare feet and scarves like isadora but we will have plenty of time to work on that first let me drill you on your mythical yachtperson needless to say ninette knew nothing about yachts but she did know a great deal about the rich old men in fur coats who would be expected to own a yacht together she and thomas concocted a plausible story for the apocryphal nikolas he could not be too rich or one would expect a hue and cry about his missing state he could not be titled either for the same reason so it was to be a very small yacht something a bourgeoisie merchant would have bought to impress young dancers and singers and nikolas would have been ninas friend but not her particular friend she would have been ready to accept favors but not yet ready to let him into her bed over the course of the day her two rescuers found many excuses to check on her progress soon she was calling the two of them by their first names and the cat drilled her mercilessly on her story in between times so when they finally asked her questions she was able to weep and cry poor nikolas poor old man in a way that left no doubt in the minds of her benefactors that she had very little emotional investment in nikolas and that in all probability he had offered this trip in order to impress her enough that she would take him as her protector this cheered both of them up immensely even as they tried to comfort the weeping nina this was understandable a dead lover was a terrible complication but she would probably be able to put nikolas behind her in fairly short order if he was only a friend from whom she had perhaps accepted a few gifts in the late afternoon someone from the royal lifeboat service arrived resplendent in a uniform to talk to her about the sinking she almost panicked but the cat soothed her and quietly coached her on what to say as she sat between her two benefactors wrapped in an elegant dressing gown the officer remained standing looking acutely uncomfortable it was not difficult at all to seem upset because she was upset but her visible efforts to calm herself seemed to earn her some respect from the lifesaving officer we are trying to learn where the ship might have gone down miss the officer said in english she blinked at him my eenglish not so good she said and gestured to him gracefully parlezvous francais i do arthur spoke up and turned to the officer ill be translating sir its not uncommon for russians artists to know french but not english the officer grumbled a little about foreigners but nodded all right then how many were on this yacht myself and nikolas and five others she said carefully coached by the cat it was a motor yacht two of the men took it in turns to steer it there was one man who was nikolas servant and the other two did things took care of the pretty boat cooked cleaned nikolas had just bought this yacht and he did not know much about these things i could tell but he pretended that he did i wanted to go to london but he said no no we must sail all around england that you can see all of it and then decide the officer groaned gentleman yachtsmen does she have any idea if he registered at any ports when arthur translated she shook her head probably not then the officer sighed the name of this vessel then yvgenia she replied promptly nikolas was alone in the world she added as the cat prompted her he did something with speculation she shrugged i never could understand it he laughed and said that yvgenia was the name of his mother who was always happy to see him leave and how is it that the young lady came to shore now that was a dangerous question and one that ninette had been hoping would not be asked she would have to tread very carefully here drop your head the cat ordered dont look them in the eyes and speak very slowly you dont remember a great deal she repeated that verbatim in a hesitant voice the storm came up suddenly the cat continued you were asleep one of the crew came to wake you and tell you to get dressed you had never been on a boat before and you were afraid of the violence of the storm you tried to make your way to the deck when there was a great crash and you were thrown into the water fortunately you are a strong swimmer but you could see nothing in the storm you found a plank to cling to for a while and you thought you saw lights and began to swim towards them you were determined to live and that was all you could think of you remember crawling onto the sand and that is all she must have wrecked just off the north pier the officer said and shook his head though why we werent alerted a yacht that small in a storm like that with an inexperienced owner arthur exclaimed the lifeboat service is hardly to blame sir no telling if she was even stormworthy well that does account for some flotsam that came ashore the officer muttered really i cannot imagine anyone holding the lifeboat service to account for this youll have to notify the russian ambassador of course nigel nodded sagely miss do you remember the names of the crew nikolas petrov vladisky murmured ninette as the cat dictated one pilot was sasha i do not know his last name the other was ivan bolodenka nikolass mans name was borya fedorovich i never knew what the rest were called except their first names dimitri and yuri now cry the cat ordered she was so nervous about being found out that it wasnt at all hard to do as he ordered and start to sob alarmed the officer patted her hand clumsily there there now miss youre a good brave girl ill let the embassy know these people were lost she looked up impulsively and he flinched let the maid take you back to bed nigel said beckoning the servant over she waved the maid away the girl curtsied and left the room no i shall be all right is there any sign of she looked up again at the lifesaving officer and he winced tell her that we probably cant hold out any hope at this point the officer said if they wrecked off the north pier we probably wont even find bodies theyll be taken out to sea by the tide and turn up in ireland if at all arthur translated the first part of that but not the last she dropped her eyes thank you miss the officer said ponderously merci mademoiselle he coughed ill be on my way then i doubt very much i will need to trouble the young lady any more shes been most helpful you expect to hear anything from the russians nigel asked in a low voice the officer shook his head one bourgeois speculator related to no one and a handful of sailors who might or might not have been no better than they should be probably not and this young lady might be a good dancer but i misdoubt anyone from the embassy will care unless she was the empresss particular pet im afraid youll have her on your hands unless you find someone else to hand her off to hand off my golden goose not likely nigel winked as the cat curled up around ninettes feet and purred ill show you out then sir care for a brandy against the cold shouldnt drink on duty nonsense its medicinal the two left the room as ninette wiped her eyes with a handkerchief as soon as they were out of earshot though she turned to arthur holding tightly to the scrap of cloth and lace and how is it she demanded in french that you can hear my cat ha i warned you came a third voice one she thought she remembered from the auto although she jumped when she heard it didnt i warn you i told you she would be a clever little thing all the dancers i ever knew were yes wolf you told us arthur said with resignation who is that ninette asked heart still in her mouth looking back over her shoulder and seeing nothing but a parrot in a cage sitting on a swing then the parrot reached over to the bars of the cage and to her astonishment unlatched the door and flew over to the back of the couch i am wolfgang amadeus who for my sins has found himself stuck in the body of a bird the parrot said mournfully it probably has something to do with the magic flute i was warned not to write a masonic opera i who once visited the courts of europe and wrote music for emperors am now reduced to sitting in a cage begging for green peas and writing tinkly little melodies for music hall performances he sighed and tilted his head down eyeing thomas evilly and dont get any clever notions cat you might be an elemental creature but my beak can still make an impression on your nose i wouldnt dream of it the cat said with immense dignity just what do you take me for hungry said the parrot and fluffed out all his feathers ninette stared at him and then looked at arthur is he really arthur shrugged hes my elemental familiar so only heaven knows im only a magician not a master so i cant tell these things even the master cannot tell if wolf is telling the truth or making up grand tales said nigel returning to the room all i can say is that those tinkly little melodies he hates are quite popular so i say it doesnt matter but you my dear are not a mage yourself but her father was and he left me in charge of her the cat replied tartly ninette eyed him in surprise i told you that already really if you are going to make me repeat things i beg your pardon monsieur chat most heartily nigel said with a bow well i expect well have to look out for you now miss tchereslavsky since those of us elemental magicians that actually get along without fighting each other tend to be a closeknit group here in britain mind there are far more who dont get along than those who do idiot lot that they are the parrot added sardonically imagine there are a goodly number that refuse to even speak with me just because im a bird intolerable the cat drawled the philistines wolf glared at him i am afraid i have nothing ninette said looking down at her hands all my fortune was in my jewels and those are at the bottom of the sea dont worry about that for now nigel replied leaning down to pat her hand you just think about getting your strength back so you can dance youll soon be on your feet again once that happens and im sure we can find a way to make that happen right fellows he winked at her but she didnt miss the glance that passed between him and arthur she glanced down at the cat who looked as smug as well he deserved to be what did i tell you the cat asked just do as i say and youll be so successful that la augustine will read about you in the papers and envy you there was something comforting and universal about a rehearsal room always the same broad expanses of glass on two wallswindows on one mirrors on the opposite practice barre stretching out along the mirrored wall piano in one corner dust always hanging in the air rosin dust and dust shaken out of cracks in the wooden floor by the pounding of countless feet depending on the time of day and whether or not it was raining again sunlight might or not be streaming in through the window filled with that dust which would then sparkle like fairy dust rehearsal pianists were always thin always earnest always homely usually bespectacled they always wore dusty black this one was thin earnest homely bespectacled and female her hair put up in a tight little arrangement of braids wrapped around her angular head she also spoke french an asset for the first time in her life ninette had a rehearsal room to herself for the first time in her life she was not being put through her drills by an instructor or a ballet master she had to remember it all herself she punctuated her requests for tempi with sil vous plais and merci after all rehearsal pianists might utterly forgettable and generally ignored as a kind of extension of the piano itself but they were still human beings but in between the please and thank you she concentrated on getting her body back into something capable of a performance despite all the exercise of walking she had done she had not been doing any dancing since she had left france and her muscles told her so everything had to be taken slowly each group of muscles must be warmed up stretched and tested then the entire body had to go through the same procedure only then was she prepared to try a solo and a not very demanding one either she wished she had a partner she wondered what the odds were of finding one la sylphide first solo merci she said and proceeded to work through that first piece where the mischievous sylph first invades james home and finds him sleeping in front of the fire she interrupted herself often asking the patient pianist to repeat a phrase drilling herself mercilessly until her forgetful body got it right again oddly enough there was peace in this she might have been in paris this might have been what she would have been doing had she been lifted to etoile status outside this room there were talking cats and men who claimed they were magicians a stolen name a life that was not hers and a fabrication she had to maintain in here there was only the music the relentless tyranny of the choreography and the discipline of shaping a reluctant body into the graceful movements of the dance without pause without faltering how strange that the one thing that she had thought she would like to escape was the thing she now fled to for comfort nigel nigel looked up from his desk this was the first day since they had rescued nina that he had spent a normal morning and there was a lot of work piled up at his desk here at the imperial music hall none of it was an emergency or someone would have made sure a messenger got to him at his flat but it took up all of his morning and looked as if it was going to stretch well into the afternoon hed gotten so deep into it that he had lost all track of time until that familiar voice at his door took him out of his trance of work as he dealt with letters from booking agents descriptions of acts complaints from the stagehands requests for materials he looked up and blinked at arthur bandcall over already yes and you should get some luncheon inside you the parrot said from his perch on arthurs shoulder weve made arrangements for miss tchereslavsky we checked around at the performers lodgings and found a full flat open over at breckenridges nigel brightened up at that alfie breckenridge owed him a favor and a big one nigel had loaned him the collateral to buy the set of lodgings in the first place when alfie had retired from the stage his wife sarah was a sharp one and they wouldnt give him the flat but whats the terms he asked theyll let her have itknowing its you thats paying for it for nowat a quarter the going rate until the show is in production and she can pay for it herself arthur looked understandably pleased at that alfie told me its too dear for most of our performers anyway and it went vacant half the time so he wont be losing that much by it he was thinking of cutting it up into rooms but if our scheme works nina will be there in permanent residence care to walk over and cast an eye on it after we eat anything to get from behind this desk nigel gratefully cleaned his pen and pushed his chair away arthur tucked wolf away inside his coat with the parrots head sticking out under his chin and off they went you should get a secretary to take care of that arthur observed as they left the building via the stage door turned up their collars against the drizzle and headed in the direction of the dial which was the name of the imperial music hall version of the pub that sprang up in the vicinity of every theater nigel had ever seen not for the benefit of theater patrons no for the benefit of the entertainers it generally would take a great deal of effort on the part of a casual theatergoer to find these pubs tucked in as they were in backstreet corners generally behind the theaters themselves and always no more than a few yards from the stage door they pushed open the doors to a place that had not significantly changed in decades except for electric lighting instead of gas a fire burned on the hearth and the air smelled of tobacco smoke woodsmoke and bacon wolf popped out of arthurs coat and took his usual place on arthurs shoulder yellowing playbills and fading autographed photos adorned the walls of pubs such as this the bill of fare was plain cheap and always available it was clean but it had seen better days probably its better days had been about a century ago it was generally run by someone who had once been in the theatrical trade himselfseldom long enough to have garnered a name of his own but long enough to have gotten a fair notion of what players and acts and musicians neededor would put up with in the case of the dial the proprietor was a benevolent sort the food was decent the service prompt the prices reasonable and people tended to look the other way if your trained animal came in with you as long as it was wellbehaved champagne was available something you didnt find in many pubs because theatrical folks had a taste for it the place was full since morning bandcall was over and everyone that didnt have another place to go had crowded in here to get a bite between bandcall and afternoon rehearsal most of the people in here were the stagehands who greeted nigel arthur and wolf with genial respect wolf generally took care to act like a bird around them and confined himself only to the very occasional clever comment audible to the room nigel knew that arthurs companion had an ongoing prank though at quiet moments the bird would lean down and mutter something in arthurs ear to try and get him to laugh not today though there was only so much time until the early afternoon rehearsals started arthur was needed there and nigel liked to watch the acts for signs of trouble performers were kittle cattle some were reliable stable and would go on until they dropped giving one solid performance after another but most werent there was always the ongoing curse of the showman to contend with the life of a performer gypsylike as it was was not a good one for making and keeping friends or lovers performers egos being what they were and then there was that ongoing curse of the showman the bottle performers being performers none of this would show when the time came for the curtain to go up but cracks would appear at afternoon rehearsals particularly if they werent going well nigel liked to slip into the back of a boxnever the same twiceand watch especially now when he had his prize his leading lady for this new kind of music hall idea now he wanted to get a solid lot of acts to fit into this show and he needed to know he would be able to depend on them for most of a year that meant no missed performances for being drunk no replacement of partners for infidelity no screaming fights backstage no trouble they would have to comport themselves like the big theatrical and operatic companies did in europe where everyone was permanent you knew who the stars were and everyone had to get along at least marginally music hall performers were hard workers but they werent used to that nigel and arthur ate quickly but quietly with wolf helping himself to what he liked off both their plates most of the stagehands were finishing up just as they did and there was a little awkwardness at the door quickly settled as arthur stepped aside so wolf could climb back into his coat like most music hallsexcept perhaps in londonthis one was also surrounded by buildings given over to theatrical lodgings these were as might be expected of variable quality some were actual boarding houses where the lodgers could expect at least two and sometimes three meals along with their room some provided little more than a cheerless shabby furnished room some had actual flats that included rudimentary kitchens the one thing they all had in common was that the landlords expected the tenants to be there for no less than the week of their engagement but not much more and anticipated they would have nothing more with them than would fit in a suitcase and proptrunk alfie breckenridge was unusual in that he and his wife had both been in the theater before retiring to run a theatrical lodging most of the house was a classical boardinghouse sarah kept a good table and their rooms were always full breckenridge was able to pick and choose his lodgers and as a consequence there were usually no unpleasant folks in his house two houses really he and sarah had done so well they had purchased the building next to theirs put in a passage between them and converted the second from flats to suites of two and three rooms arthur rang the bell of the first house alfie must have been expecting them since the door flew open and it was alfie himself standing there rather than the maid gents glad you could make it before rehearsals started nige sarahs been asking after you wonderin when you were comin for a good dinner she dont half fret about that cook of yours shes the one who recommended mrs graves you know nigel said with a grin surely she doesnt think so poorly of her own judgment oh you know sarah always secondguessing herself alfie chuckled made her a good partner for my comicpatter though well right lets show you these rooms an well see if you think theyre good enough for your ballydancer wench he led the way through the communal sittingroom to the passage that had been cut in the wall between the two houses when we got the place i had the notion i wanted to set things up for them as wanted a bit more privacy and a bit more space house was four flats i sectioned it up into bedsitters with one or two bedrooms so people that had an act with family could lodge together and couples here alfie winked and nigel smiled since he knew alfie was not in the least concerned if the couples in question were married or not could have a bit more privacy but we left the flat at the top alone thinkin mebbe we could let it out to them as stay longer than just a week or so he shook his head leading the way up the stairs happen you didnt book a lot of those and its a bit of a journey from here to say the opera house i was just about to call in the carpenters and give the orders to cut it up too when arthur rang me up and here we are he stopped at the top landing took out a key with a flourish and opened the door nigel stepped inside and looked around he nodded with approval the rosepapered sitting room had clearly been furnished by a woman sarah probably light airy and comfortable plain but good furniture upholstered in dark rose small fireplace with a wooden mantel and a mirror over the mantelpiece electric lighting which was far safer than gas not as ostentatious as his own flat but he was after all the theater owner lets see the rest of it got a small kitchen here bit of a pantry but sarah an me are figuring your gel will want us to cater her alfie explained throwing up the door on a dolls kitchen with a tiny stove and oven thiss enough for her maid to cook her up an egg and a bit of toast and the like or keep dinner warm in the oven for her thats what everyone else in this flat has done sent down to us for real meals and all some of them even come down to eat around the big table with the rest he opened the next door thisd be the maids room i reckon last person that let the place was a family act they had their daughter in here a small neat plain white bedroom with a thick blue coverlet and blanket on the bed blue china washbasin and pitcher on the stand with a bluecurtained window looking out on the backyard seemed adequate enough to nigel it didnt have a fire but maids rooms seldom did and it did share the wall with the kitchen which should keep it warm enough and then he got a glimpse of something out of the corner of his eye a small cleverfaced little gnome with a kindly sparkle to his eyes an earthelemental one of the benevolent ones a brownie interesting had it been here all along or had it come in response to the movement through the invisible workings of the elementals themselves who said nina was coming here he would have liked to question the creature but obviously he couldnt not with alfie there it saw him looking at it gave him a saucy wink and vanished pity as an air master he couldnt actually call the earth creatures they would only talk to him if they felt like it an hered be the gels little nest alfie said opening the final door again it was an airy bright room this time with a big fourpost bed of the old fashioned sort with curtains around it not a bad thing when the winter winds came roaring off the sea and to drive off the damp from the ubiquitous rain there was a good fireplace here and it was as clean and neat as anyone could want walls papered in cream rose and brown coverlets curtains and furnishings to match the room was warm without feeling stuffy nice little dressingroom and bath through there alfie continued pointing at a door in the far wall hot water up from a boiler in the basement modern as you please maid can use the bath on the second floor or this one if her mistress aint particular even put a telephone in reckon thisll suit if shes got any sense shell think shes in cream alfie nigel replied with satisfaction they concluded the bargain nigel sealed it with the first months rent and he and arthur and wolf headed back to the theater the street was quieter now people settling back into their businesses after the rush about for lunch nigel wolf said with uncharacteristic seriousness as they made their way on foot through the back streets i have a concern nigel glanced down at the little gray head peering out from arthurs coat then i would like to hear it do either of you have any attraction to this girl are you likely to wolfs shiny black eyes looked at him piercingly you know very well she is quite likely to have some sort of attraction to you one or both if only the attraction of a young woman to a man of means shes in shock now but when she gets over it she does not strike me as the sort to go without a gentleman for very long nigel laughed shell have plenty of those you know what i mean wolf said severely arthur sighed the bird has a good point nigel he said reluctantly we rescued her after all that tends to make a young lady look at you in a different sort of way it could be a complication unless we are careful about how we treat her hmm then the sooner we get her established in her own rooms the better nigel found the dancer attractive enough and had she been anyone other than one of his performers he would have had no qualms about pursuing whatever seemed appropriate but she was one of his performers and he had always had a strict rule for himself about that that is his female performers were not under any circumstances to be socialized with in that way invite them to parties yes have them at dinners yes but only in a party with other performers and nothing outside of the same sort of thing that he would offer to his male performers it was just too much of a risk hed seen this happen to owners in the past let a star performer become something more and the next thing you knew they thought they could dictate the running of the theater to you he was going to showcase this girl as his star turn he was not going to allow her to turn it into her theater wolf made the sound of a sigh of relief good as long as you keep that in mind oh i will nigel said fervently business and pleasure shouldnt be mixed ever besides the other considerations the last thing he needed or wanted was an entanglement at a time when he wanted to have the upper hand in negotiating with this young woman he would give her a fair offer but he was not about to treat her on the level of someone who could fill entire concert halls just on the basis of their name on a playbill she was an unknown here to an extent he could use her european reputation but english audiences would make up their own minds about her and he could certainly use the romantic circumstances of her shipwreck but none of these things were going to compensate for an outrageous salary especially not in the beginning he was taking a risk and he knew it on this new sort of musical performance what worked so brilliantly in america might not work here by this time they had reached the music hall and nigel made up his mind at that moment that he was going to do something a bit different today you and wolf keep an eye on the rehearsals would you please you have something in mind asked arthur nigel nodded i think its time that i talked to jonathon hightower kung chow arthur nodded the plot i have outlined for this production makes very heavy use of him i cant think of a stage magician better suited to this just as long as he doesnt want me in his act wolf added with a shudder really i dont like bird acts at all filthy things and no conversation now jonathon however he is excellent company good taste in music too nigel repressed a smile wolf would think that jonathon was a great aficionado of mozart i cant think of an elemental mage i would rather have here nigel responded thoughtfully something just occurred to me you see what if that storm and the yacht sinking werent an accident arthur paused just outside the stage door and two heads his and wolfs swiveled to look at nigel you think someone was trying to stop her from coming here or merely was getting revenge on her father nigel replied and opened the door for them he created that cat as a guardian for her you would assume he had a reason to think she would need one arthur let wolf out of his coat the parrot clambered up to his shoulder in that case there might be more such attacks wolf pointed out as arthur nodded agreement the three of them paused for a moment in the area just past the backstage porter where the mail was left for performers there was no one here at the moment although the sounds of the orchestra warming up for rehearsal were just beginning and from one of the practice studios came the sound of a piano if the sinking wasnt an accident yes i want jonathon here there is nothing like a fire master to discourage meddlers nigel shrugged i could be alarmist but i had rather not find out that i wasnt when the scenery collapses atop someone or a rope snaps and a sandbag breaks our star dancers neck arthur shuddered touch wood that you are being alarmist but jonathon can certainly tell us i think it is probably time for you to find him the fastest way possible nigel grinned i was hoping youd say that nigel locked the door to his officeanother reason not to have a secretaryand flexed his fingers the fastest way possible was very fast indeed for an elemental master whereas an ordinary theater manager would have to rely on a call to hightowers booking agent and then a telegram to whatever theater the magician was playing at nigel could be a great deal more direct he opened the eastern window to his office rolled back the persian rug laid over the carpet and exposed the very special design woven into the flatter carpet beneath it was an invocation circle for air specifically every elemental master had his own way of calling his elementals nigel just happened to have one that was uniquely suited to his profession and the reason why he and arthur had met in the first place in fact it was probably the reason why the grey parrot that claimed he was the incarnation of wolfgang amadeus mozart had flown in this same window ten years ago from a locked drawer in his desk nigel removed a glass flute from the time he was a boy nigel had used music to call and communicate with his elementals the patterns of the notes just seemed to fit the patterning of the magic he was not a brilliant musician not in the way that arthur was arthur could play virtually ever instrument in the orchestra and do it well enough to fill in any vacant position if he had to nigel had never been good enough to pretend to being a professional musician but he was more than good enough to master something like the flute for a long time hed used a metal instrument but that hadnt quite gotten the effect he had wanted finally on a whim he had asked a glassblower to make him a glass flute and the results had been everything he could have hoped for even better had been when wolf had arrived in their midst the parrot had volunteered to write little melodies for virtually every summoning purpose that the three of them had been able to think of this time when he raised the flute to his lips and felt the first stirrings of his magic in the tingling of his fingers he began the melody that wolf called the messenger the first soft breathy notes broke the silence of the office he felt power swirl around him in a cool crisp whirlwind of pale blue energies he hadnt played more than three bars when the curtains billowed inward and the transparent laughing face of a sexless child winked at him once from the zephyr that circled him riding the waves of power with a smile he put down the flute and the elemental spun into shape a fluttering translucent birdchild with big eyes and a knowing smile it waited for his request please go to jonathon hightower nigel told it giving it as he spoke the kind of mental signature of the fire master tell him that i want to speak with him immediately and to reward it he reached for the energies of the air and conjured up a sparkling dancing animated spark a kind of elemental toy that would last as long as the elemental he gave it to had interest in it with a crow of delight the creature seized the offering and with a shake of wings sped off through the window and out into the sun nigel closed the window rolled his rug back and went back to his desk nothing now but to wait so he might as well get some work done while he did nigel had not gotten a reply by the time the curtain rose on the first performance and by the time the curtain fell on the last act he was alternating between concern and irritation after all masters never used elementals as messengers frivolously and hightower of all people ought to know that if nigel had done so it meant there was some urgency to the request wolf who was always backstage during performances flew down from his perch in the flies and landed on nigels shoulder as the latter cursed the fire master mentally there could be a dozen reasons why hightower hasnt contacted you nigel the bird said quietly into his ear chief of which is that he is a performer with his own act to rehearse and perform unlike you he does not have the luxury of a private office in which to conduct rites theres nothing out of the ordinary about sending a telegram nigel replied with irritation nothing that difficult step around the corner to the post office and but why should i do that when i can come here in person said jonathon hightower stepping around a gaggle of little chorus dancers he grinned and they tittered nervously jonathon looked very much like a caricature of satan minus the horns and he played on the resemblance by cultivating a slim moustache and goatee and wearing a scarletlined black evening cape and top hat whenever possible amazingly this seemingly satanic appearance translated seamlessly into his stage persona of the mysterious chinese magician kung chow very few people outside the theatrical world connected the flamboyant hightower with the secretive kung chow and that was the way hightower liked it jonathon you wretch nigel exclaimed hightower laughed now how could i resist coming here myself after all the newspaper stories about the beautiful russian dancer you rescued from the briny deep he lifted an eyebrow significantly had to come see her for myself dont you know nigel looked at him with exasperation come back to the flat with me and you can meet her yourself oh really jonathon grinned nigel gritted his teeth obviously she had nowhere else to go jonathon he said shell be moving into her own establishment shortly jonathon kept grinning as nigel passed wolf over to arthur and made his round of the backstage before leading him out the stage door but once outside and away from anyone likely to overhear them he rounded on his friend first of all there is nothing going on with that young woman he said fiercely as they walked to where he had left his auto parked moving from patch of gaslight to patch of gaslight i have a new sort of musical theater i am planning i intend to make her the central figure in it and the last thing in the world i am ever going to do is mix my personal pleasures with the business of my theater jonathon sobered immediately look old man i and secondly nigel went on without losing a bit of his heat the girl is one of us or at least her father was enough of a mage that he was able to create a protector for her what else was i to do but take her in for heavens sake it was her cat that summoned us to aid her by that point they had reached the auto jonathon got in silently and remained quiet while nigel went through the complicated little ritual that the auto demanded to get it started only when they were well down the street did he speak again well i feel a right fool you should nigel snapped now the reasons i asked you to contact me in the first place are part of all that i want to engage you for a full year at the least and i want to make you the other star attraction of this production now here is what i have in mind he explained his plans for the new sort of musical theater as the auto chugged down the street jonathon said nothing only nodded from time to time but nigel could tell that he was interested well jonathon said as nigel pulled his auto into the carriage house that now served it as its garage im equally torn by two questions one mundane the other arcane the mundane one is rather simple would you rather cast me as the villain of the piece or sympathetic well i suppose that would depend on how sophisticated we think the audience will be wouldnt it nigel closed up and prudently locked the carriage house doors that was the grand thing about having an auto no horse to feed or stalls to clean out one could talk all one wanted about the romance of horseflesh but the amount of cleaning up and caring forhe had far rather pay the mechanic once in a while to fix the motorcar than keep a stableman day in day out if we thought they would be capable of it we could write something that casts you as the villain but redeems you in the end nigel suggested as they made their way into the foyer of the building brightly lit in the newest fashion with fine electric fixtures say your character has a change of heart and helps the girl escape staying to face the wrath of the sultan nigels flat was on the third floor of this rather posh establishment reached by a modern brasscaged elevator although stairs were available it was selfoperated although the owners of the other two flats in the building generally had their servants do the operating i must say i like that idea jonathon mused as they both strolled into the anteroom of nigels flat to be met by a servant who took their coats by the way i took the liberty of sending my things here i do have more than one guest room you know nigel pointed out he turned to his manservant who was bringing drinks for both of them knowing as he did what jonathons preference was asher i am perishing could something be arranged i anticipated your requirement sir and took the liberty of having a late supper prepared for you and mr hightower the manservant nodded in the direction of the dining room and nigel and his guest lost no time in settling themselves in there discussion of plots continued over the welsh rarebit eggs bacon crumpets and broiled tomatoes nigel secretly gloating the entire time for all that jonathon could be an irritating fellow he was also entertaining and the best illusionist that nigel had ever seen and he had a good sense of storytelling all his suggestions were sound ones am i missing something or have you neglected to cast a romantic male lead in this venture jonathon asked as they moved their discussion and their whiskeys back into the library where they each took one of the comfortable windsor chairs you are not missing anything i havent i am not sure that i want to nigel tapped the side of his glass thoughtfully there is the inevitable problem of finding a dancing partner for her if we do how many male dancers do you know that are in variety that were trained in ballet jonathon shook his head whereas if she doesnt have a male romantic lead as such we can just have some of the fellows do the lifts and maybe assist in her turns lads trained in the usual sort of stage dance can do that nigel pointed out jonathon laughed i can do that he replied well then im not at all sure we need a romantic lead for her might be more interesting if your magician character starts out being a villain and then gets won over and sacrifices himself so she can get away he pondered or at least it looks that way youve always wanted to do a spectacular escape trick how about if the sultan takes the magician prisoner and he makes a showy escape jonathon got a wicked gleam in his eye can i make the palace collapse on the sultan and all his evil minions or set it on fire if you can do it under budget that was arthur being shown in by the manservant a whiskey already in his hand ill set it on fire that will sell a lot of tickets jonathon decided besides leaving the ambiguity that maybe the magician was secretly something like mephistopheles all along and sent to bring his master the soul of the sultan good idea wolf exclaimed from arthurs shoulder makes the whole thing less stickysweet i could even write music for that no arias all three of the humans exclaimed at once wolf fluffed his feathers in indignation all right that takes care of that i think we have a pretty strong book for this and once we know what acts well be putting into it and how often our star can perform over the course of it well know exactly what music we need nigel tossed back the last of his drink and refilled it from the decanter himself now as for the other reason why you in particular are here jonathon let me tell you what we know about the young lady and her cat wolf added sourly lets not forget the cat he certainly wont let you cat jonathon looked at them all quizzically let me start at the beginning nigel replied with a laugh and did so when he was done jonathon was unexpectedly silent after waiting for some sort of reaction and getting nothing nigel finally asked what are you thinking that it is certainly interesting im not at all familiar with the russian masters actually i dont think much of anyone is we have a lot of contact with the french and italian ones a little less with the spanish but he shrugged it does sound as if her father must have come to an untimely end probably at the hands of another master and if he left such a guardian for his daughter that suggests he expected whoever his enemy was would come after her as well it wouldnt be the first time arthur said quietly both nigel and jonathon grimaced a little arthurs grandfather had run afoul of a badtempered scottish master who had pursued not only the old man but the mans son and grandson it was only at the death of the scottish magician that the persecution had ceased russians are notorious for temper jonathon tossed back his own drink on the other hand i am not exactly weak and fire magic is rather well suited to combat unlike air and no slur intended nigel no offense taken air is the weakest offensively and defensively but when it comes to gaining information he shrugged short of finding a way to live without breathing you cant shut air elementals out well dont underestimate your ability to add to my power air feeds fire and never forget it jonathon set his glass down and steepled his fingers together whatever might come after this young woman i think we will be prepared for it and that is exactly why i wanted you here nigel said with satisfaction well there it was the tacit agreement to make all of this a reality and to protect nina from whatever it was that threatened her if jonathon had not actually come out and said he was going to help out with this enterprise it was certainly written between the lines and he would not say not yet for a magicians words were binding he wanted to be sure and nigel could hardly blame him but i want to meet her before i make any decisions jonathon continued and measured nigel with a stern look no offense nigel but your weakness has always been a damsel in distress im not so easily gulled and my stockintrade is illusion i want to see her and this cat of hers i want your promise that you will hold by my decision as well do i have it nigel shrugged he knew jonathon was right and although he liked nina tchereslavsky quite a bit well he had to face the fact that if she was pulling some sort of deception there were other singers and dancers he could base his endeavor around and he had to keep reminding himself of that she might appear to need rescue he might want to rescue her but there was always the possibility that it was all part of some grand confidence game not everyone was worth rescuing they are talking about you said the cat he sat near the door of ninettes room with his head cocked to one side she put her book down in her lap and regarded him thoughtfully they nigel and arthur and wolf she had heard them come in but had thought it better not to intrude since it sounded as if they were having a discussion of business and someone new another elemental master the cat was very still staring at the door with his tail curled around his feet a fire master i think i know him or at least his reputation another magician why is he here she asked i gather nigel asked him to come hmm well it seems he is not only a magician he is an illusionist as well nigel wishes him for this theatrical production he is suspicious of you i suspect he is a very sharp gentleman she bit her lip that was the last thing she needed what if he finds out the cat shook his head he wont or at least he will not until it no longer matters what he expects is that you have some purpose other than dancing perhaps that you intend to get nigel to marry you she giggled nigel was not the sort of rich she expected for a protector he was very careful with his money and when she found someone to keep her she wanted it to be a gentleman who liked to show his appreciation lavishly but could he find out i am not who i say i am he is hardly an expert on either ballet or russians he admitted the latter and as for the former he seemed to be under the impression that just any ballroom dancer could partner with you for lifts and turns she snorted if that was what he thought should i go out she wondered face them now it would be a good idea they are not expecting you they think you are asleep she got up from the chair in which she had been sitting reading she did not read easilyit was not deemed necessary for the little ballerinas to be very proficient in ordinary school lessonsbut she enjoyed it even if it was very hard work for some reason nigel had a large collection of french novels and she was making her slow way through them when she was not practicing she set the book aside and smoothed down her skirt with a feeling of great satisfaction nigel had been more than generous in the way of clothing since she had none he had arranged for the costume mistress of the theater to take her measurements and get her a good wardrobe ninette doubted that the woman had sewn these garments herself but she undoubtedly had friends or relatives that were seamstresses themselves and could use the work and the work was very fine not the equivalent of a boulevard atelier much less a great fashion modiste of the sort that someone like nina tchereslavsky would patronize but it was finer than anything ninette had even seen much less worn even the underthings were exquisite with lace and ribbons and embroidery nor had the wardrobe mistress limited herself to ninettes ordinary clothing her practice skirts and tights were of silk tulle and knitted silk her pointe shoes were of the sort that the etoiles wore in short ever since the cat had come into her life things had taken such a turn for the better that she still woke up thinking it was all a dream and she did not want to lose this so if the cat said to face them then face them she would she raised her chin put on the mask of the great prima and sailed out into the hallway she followed the sound of voices to nigels library the door was ajar which she interpreted as meaning they did not mind being disturbed she took a deep breath looked down at the cat at her feet and pushed it open all the way nigel who had clearly been just about to say something looked at her with a startled expression his mouth hanging open for a moment he swiftly recovered though and stood up mademoiselle nina were we disturbing you he asked in french she shook her head not in the least she replied in the same language and then smiled i ave been studying zee english but it marches better when i am hearing it she looked around the room as if she were the one that owned this flat and not nigel you ave brought a friend from the theater oui this is jonathon hightower a great illusionist nigel said hastily hightower this is mademoiselle nina tchereslavsky the stranger rose took her hand and bowed over it she accepted the accolade with pleasure but also with an air that it was only to be expected exactly as la augustine would have and what am i an old boot and this is the cat thomas nigel added hastily hightower who looked altogether like a modern version of mephistopheles from the faust opera looked down at the cat who had sat down regally just to ninettes left maybe you should make him disappear wolf put in turning one evil yellow eye on the cat really now what have i done to deserve that suggestion the cat glared right back thats rather rude well you might stop looking at me as if you were deciding how many meals you were going to get out of me wolf retorted i am a cat i have certain instincts if you will insist on fluttering and setting off those instincts you have only yourself to blame while the parrot fluffed his feathers angrily and glared the cat turned his attention back to the newcomer greetings fire master am i to presume you are not here by chance possibly my friend nigel had a business proposition he wished to discuss with me hightowers expression was as bland as could be or rather he had no expression whatsoever that ninette could make out his faintly sinister yet decidedly handsome face made an excellent mask for whatever it was he was thinking ninette had seen many opera singers with superb stage presence who used their faces in exactly that way in fact they were never really offstage whenever they might be seen in public perhaps it ees about zis ohsomysterious theatrical venture he has hinted about she replied archly she took a seat remembering to do so as if she was center stage with all eyes on her perhaps you seem very much recovered from your tragedy mademoiselle the abrupt change of subject might have startled her if she had not already been wary of him she hesitated then sighed you will think very badly of me i suppose she said slowly as if the words were being drawn from her reluctantly and i feel very badly for poor nikolas but i did not know him perhaps as well as you presume i knew him he was an admirer yes and he wished to be more yes but many gentlemen are my admirers and many wish to be more i have not had she hesitated i have not had a particular friend for many months now i wished to go to england where the winters are not so cold as russia and not france where there are dancers in plenty nor italy where the audiences prefer opera i said as much where several of my admirers would hear me and nikolas had his new yacht and i allowed him to persuade me to let him take me here but i did not allow him to persuade me to do anything else i wished to see if his company would be something other than tedious she sighed and looked down at her hands and stole directly from la augustine i am an artist my friends are artists when they gather in my salon the talk is not of stocks and bonds and commodities i have had my fill of particular friends who cannot or will not understand this talk and demand that i give up my friends and my gatherings because such talk makes them feel stupid i did not know that poor nikolas was such a man i did not know that he was not one so taking this journey in his company was to discover if he was or was not because i would be overjoyed never to face another angry confrontation with a man who could not see the value in things he himself did not appreciate she made the corners of her mouth turn down for many of my admirers i am exactly like a painting if it is famous and if others will admire it and admire the owner for having it then it is worth collecting but they do not think that i am not like a painting that i have a mind and friends and i do not particularly wish to be collected and put on display to excite envy in others she looked up with a melancholy little smile i hope that does not make me less in your eyes the illusionist was unfazed well mademoiselle it does puzzle me that you should come from this wreck des destitute she gave a bitter little laugh monsieur illusionist you will think me foolish perhaps but one does not trust russian banks if one can help it all my life i have kept my fortune with me in the form of jewels and gold i take it with me wherever i go and now it has all sunk down to the bottom of the sea the cat had been drilling her in this role until there were times when she wasnt sure which of her was the real one nina or ninette she sometimes wondered if he was putting memories into her head the way he was putting languages because she could swear she had mental images of buildings in russia the imperial palace theater street the stage of the imperial ballet she had never even to her knowledge seen a sketch or a photograph of these places and yet they were as real to her as the eiffel tower and the paris opera for that matter was he slipping russian language into her mind too only today she had misstepped in practice and nearly twisted her ankle and had sworn not sacre bleu as she had thought she would but blin at any rate with these things these images and thoughts at the front of her mind it was a great deal easier to be nina the illusionist shook his head tell me that you will not be doing that anymore he halfscolded it was only a matter of time before something or someone robbed you of your fortune she hesitated it was not a very big fortune she said after a moment and laughed ruefully i am too fond of pretty gowns jewelry champagne and caviar and i am not so very famous that merchants will give these things to me in hopes that i will tell others where i got suchandso it is bad of me i know but but there will always be another particular friend who will buy you these things hmm the illusionist raised an eyebrow and she flushed but raised her chin defiantly it was nina and ninette together who answered him and who does that harm she asked rhetorically speaking of her imagined old man in a fur coat i make my friends happy they make me happy i deceive no one and no one is deceived by me i do not pretend to love monsieur love is not for my kind and i make sure my friends understand this the illusionist unexpectedly softened his voice and a hint of understanding faintly shadowed with cynicism colored his words then you are wise beyond your years mademoiselle and i am glad to hear your honesty i believe you so have you any notion just who or what your father sought to protect you from by giving you this guardian he nodded at the cat with true bewilderment she could only shake her head thomas has advised me and guided me and seldom has his advice miscarried it was he who urged the move to england upon me there was another prima ballerina at the company the cat said speaking up unexpectedly nina attracted attention from the wrong quarters shall we say imperial attention rather than end up with more than just an artistic rivalry i advised her to remove herself to somewhere far enough away that the ladys hand could not scratch her all three men chuckled and even wolf snorted our own prince has generated trouble of that sort himself nigel said with a shake of his head but that wasnt why your master created you no it isnt there was no specific threat at the time only the need to provide his daughter with guidance he would not be there to give so whoever did this to him did not survive the spellcasting the cat said abruptly so there is no immediate threat this is not to say that there may not be one in the future but there is not one now ninette looked from nigel to the illusionist and back again and bit her lip to keep from saying anything the cat it seemed had surprised them both that was interesting to say the least well in that case nigel said carefully with a glance at both the other men i think we are in a position to speak with youand your advisorabout a prolonged theatrical engagement ninette closed the door to the guest room quietly but once alone could hardly restrain her joy thomas she whispered taking a few dancing steps then whirling around in a pirouette i am an etoile i am a prima prima ballerina assoluta think of it the production to be built around me my own apartment and a maid and fifty pounds a week you should have gotten double that thomas grumbled that is more than la augustine but not more than nina tchereslavsky ah well when the receipts start coming in we will renegotiate and you knew all of this before i told you well not the apartment but that was only to be expected you told me but i did not believe it not really she sat down on the bed and examined the hem of her gown with deep satisfaction lace three inches deep and there would be more many more gowns like this to come i did not believe it until nigel himself said it and there were contract papers to sign this will be hard work the cat warned and what i have done up until now has not been she sniffed the difference between then and now will be that i will not have to rehearse on an empty stomach nor go home to a garret with no heat well take care that no one else ever hears you say that thomas the cat paced up and down her rug restlessly that fire master is altogether too sharp normally fire mages are the impulsive sort ruled by their emotions i suppose he must be the exception that proves the rule he is very sharp she replied sobering i will be careful around him he frightens me he should fire is the most powerful of the four elements in the material world it is also the most emotional it takes tremendous control to become a fire master and more still to regularly command the elementals they react poorly to coercion i know of this man he is very clever cleverer still to have come up with a way to make a living that enables him to work in plain sight and leave every ordinary person who sees him assuming he is working some sort of trickery will he use any of his real magic on stage she asked watching the cat pace up and down the rug i expect so nothing powerful or important justfireworks amusement for the audience pay attention and you might figure out which thing he does is illusion and which real magic well she would do that it would be fun you should sleep now the cat commanded she shivered with delicious anticipation then rang for the maid to help her undress the cat was right tomorrow she would be moving into her new apartment all her own she was going to need sleep elemental masters needed a very particular kind of servant to be precise they must either be elemental magicians themselves or have been aware that magic real magic was in the world for most of their lives often enough their servants came from a closeknit group of people who had been serving elemental mages for centuries or as now the servant came with a recommendation so nigel said looking up from the letter the girl had presented to him sean mcleod says here that you are a sensitive she was a pretty little thing was ailse mckenzie carrotred hair green eyes and clearly as tough as she was tiny she had good credentials though shed served as the ladies maid in the shooting season at seans hunting lodge his guests were all elemental masters and magicians and their offspring she had wide ambitions though and according to sean was not content with doing general servants work when there were no ladies present neither he nor nigel could blame her the privileges and pay of a ladys maid were considerably more elevated than that of a parlor maid if that means i see the wee cratures you gents can call up when yeve a mind to then aye the girls scottish accent was not so heavy he couldnt understand her though it might prove difficult for the other party in this equation nina might find it difficult to understand her and that could prove a great hindrance sadly that was a mark against hiring her on the other hand there were many more points in her favor nina needed a reliable maidservant and maids who had experience with magic were not all that thick on the ground while it was true that nina herself did no magic nina had a talking cat eventually a maidservant would notice something odd about the mistresss pet if she actually overheard what the cat had to say and believed her ears she would probably run screaming from the house if she did not actually hear it speaking herself sooner or later she would notice her mistress having onesided conversations with her pet then there was the matter of selfdefense this was something every elemental master needed to consider if he or she was wealthy enough to employ more than one or two servants when enemies came calling they generally did not offer advance warning nor did they scruple to ask whether or not anyone in the vicinity was an innocent bystander you could be killed just as dead by elemental magic that you could not see and probably would not believe in if you were told about it miss mckenzie would be able to see it and might have some defense against it when it came down to cases anything that had been sent after nina probably already had her scent if the storm that had wrecked her yacht had been sent after her mademoiselle tchereslavsky may be he paused delicately hunted we are not certain but the storm that sank the yacht she was on might have been sent to harm her not entirely to his surprise because the scots were a tough race miss mckenzie raised her head on her slim neck and looked defiantly down her nose at him an ye think acause i have never th magic of my own i canna hold my own her eyes blazed fiercely aye a horseshoe and a right pair of hobnailed boots will send most of those cratures packing miss tchereslavsky does not speak much english you know he said tentatively lor bless ye sir three years in a row now i tended a lady what never chattered in anything but french and we managed all right the girl said proudly ill find a way t understand her make no mistake one final thing she has a protector nigel said its her cat does it talk the girl wanted to know after a fashion an will it talk to me that i dont know he might well miss mckenzie said in triumph there you are then nigel blinked somewhere the conversation had just taken an abrupt turn and he had missed it i beg your pardon he ventured what exactly did you mean if it talks the girl explained patiently as if he was a very slow child then she can tell the cat what she needs and the cat can tell me ah that very practical application had not occurred to nigel very well then your services will be required he swiftly negotiated her wages and privileges and sent her on to the flat with instructions to have the landlord show her in and get everything in readiness for nina he then wrote a note to his man instructing him to pack up ninas things and send them to the flat as usual the dancer had gotten up at an hour that would have satisfied the harshest stage director and gone straight to the rehearsal hall there she would work until noon stop for a bite and a stroll in the sunshine then return to the rehearsal hall until dinnertime however he proposed to change that schedule today as the hour approached when she usually stopped for her midday meal he went upstairs to catch her before she left she was just going through some complicated faradiddle involving a lot of fast intricate steps and he paused in the doorway to watch and not because her short rehearsal skirt showed her legs either he saw more than enough of his fill of legs backstage no this was the first time he had actually watched her doing anything other than exercises and he indulged himself in a moment of selfcongratulation he was no judge of ballerinas but he knew his audiences and she was by far and away the best dancer that they would ever likely see she finished the sequence and came down flatfooted in that way that dancers had when they were practicing something and not actually in front of an audience and only as she was turning around did she catch sight of him in the mirror she jumped her hand going to her throat blin she exclaimed you startle me your pardon mademoiselle i certainly didnt mean to he began but she waved her hand impatiently it is good you are here she said in french there is something i wish you to see she ran to the corner and got what looked to nigel like a rod of some sort and nodded to the pianist spring song sil vous plais she said and as the pianist began what wolf would surely have snorted at as a tinkly little melody she unfurled a long ribbon from the rod and began to dance with it actually there was a great deal more twirling the ribbon in intricate patterns than there was dancing but nigel could easily see that this would be no great concern for his audiences the eye was drawn to the streamer of silk which was yards and yards long it seemed almost alive as she made it draw circles and spirals twine around her and create elaborate figures in the air and he could just imagine it with some special stage lighting on it too when the pianist ended with a flourish and so did she he applauded she caught up the ribbon and began carefully folding it looking both flushed and pleased bien she asked tres bien he assured her i dont think our people have ever seen anything done like that before oh it is nothing but a little trick and i could not do the throws and catches the ceiling here is not high enough but it looks grand from a distance she replied in french putting the ribbon and stick up carefully there was a troupe of girls from switzerland i think that performed these things there is also a hoop and a ball and i think both will serve in your production anything that looks good from the balcony will sell tickets mademoiselle he said with pleasure now i am going to ask you to please forgo your afternoon practice if you will id like to take you to luncheon and then to your new flat its all arranged ive had your things sent over and i just hired you a fine maid to take care of you shell have set everything to rights by the time we get there to his pleasure she clapped her hands like a child given a sweet monsieur you are too good to me she exclaimed he flushed but smiled save the praises for when you see it all he cautioned after all you might not like it the little scots maidservant answered the door already looking as if she had been in this place since it was built her crisp black and white uniform immaculate sir she said with a nod of respect to nigel this would be mlady then nigel nodded this is mademoiselle tchereslavsky mademoiselle this is the young lady i hired for you miss mckenzie ninette elected not to imitate la augustine this time the dancer was horrible to her servants instead she gave miss mckenzie a friendly smile as she stepped for the first time into her own parlor and made sure the door was not shut in thomass face then she looked around and felt a thrill of sheer delight in times of fanciful dreaming she had imagined living somewhere like this when she daydreamed about being the pet of a rich old man she had pictured herself in a place virtually identical in every way everything about it spoke comfort not just that the furnishings looked comfortable which they did but unlike the boarding house which was comfort attainable only so long as the money in her purse lasted or the luxury of nigels flat which was his not hers this place whispered a little message to her you will never be cold or hungry again beggin your pardon sir milady the maidservant said once the door was closed but theres a brownie in the pantry did ye wish me to do sommat about him awhat was ninettes reaction what was a brownie some sort of mouse or worse still a rat its quite all right mckenzie i invited him said the cat oh well its all right then your pardon for interrupting you she said without turning a hair your pardon but i was preparing mladys lunch i shall be in the kitchen if you require me and ill show you about said nigel looking just a trifle smug but ninette wasnt ready to be shown her new flat just yet she heard you she said in a tone of accusation of course monsieur nigel would not have hired an ordinary servant for you that could have been a problem correct monsieur very much so nigel replied and turned to ninette miss mckenzie is not a magician but she is able to see the same things that you are we refer to her abilities as being a sensitive you will not need to hide anything from her ninette nodded with some relief at least she was not going to have to explain the cat away buthow she asked in english our sort of folk need servants servants we can trust after all nigel chuckled i simply let it be known i needed a maidservant for my famous dancer and one was forthcoming somehow she doubted that it was quite that simple but she was willing to let that pass the tour of the flat took very little time although the enjoyment she knew she would have in a more leisurely examination of its delights would occupy her for a while to come when they were finished miss mckenzie had a really admirable luncheon laid out for them which they sat down to enjoy excellent mckenzie nigel said when she had cleared the last of it away och well that would be due to our landlord sir mckenzie replied twas he that brought it all up i just needed to keep it warm for you ah now that reminds me nigel said and began explaining the various meal arrangements she could make its all because this is theatrical lodgings you see he concluded players eat at odd times they generally dont know enough about the matter to keep a good cook and they dont stay long not as a rule anyway ninette shook her head it all seemed so irregular to her we change programme she said finally not theater a more sensible way to be sure nigel nodded at any rate if you want company you can go down and dine with the others if you dont theyll send it up or mckenzie there can arrange something the meals will be plain and simple so if youre longing for beefsteak or pheasant or anything of that sort youll have to send out for it she nodded it was definitely a sensible arrangement if a trifle peculiar but it made sense ill leave you to settle in nigel said genially you can skip practice for one afternoon i should think she nodded and mckenzie showed him out now the work began in earnest ninette spent all of one afternoon on a day when the theater had no matinee showing nigel arthur jonathon and wolf all of her little tricks these were of course the sort of things that dancers like la augustine despiseddancing with the ribbonwand the ball and the hoop skirt dancing with yards and yards and yards of the lightest silk fabric to make evermoving curtains that light could be played against and she showed her other tricks the showpieces that dancers like la augustine did not despise although they might pretend to the solos from swan lake and tales of hoffman from bayadere and giselle from don quixote and corsair all these things the men loved and when she was done exhausted and dripping with sweat she looked out into the empty theater to see the four of them chattering away like so many rooks planning what tricky bit should go where in their story wolf was now supposed to write musicor at least adapt itfor all of this but he seemed to be in a frenzy of delight and no one ventured to trouble him or arthur as they sat at the piano wolf dictating the music without a pause until they were both often found slumped over the keyboard the parrot standing with one foot up and head hunched down on the nape of arthurs neck nor was jonathon idle concocting a tremendous stagebusiness for the sultans burning palace as well as adapting or reviving several more of his feats of illusion nigel was busy filling in the spaces between ninettes performances and jonathons with other acts they had to be steady reliable and with a minimum of traits that might bring them into conflict with others this would not be a case where in two weeks each would go his separate ways these people like the theatrical and dance companies she knew would stay together for months little irritations could escalate into harassment into allout feuds it was nigels job to see to it that the people he invited to this production were not the kind to escalate the plot was a simple one in the prologue a ship would be caught in a storm they had determined that only a segment of this ship would appear on stage tossing on the artificial waves there would be cries of man overboard and a dummy of her would be tossed down into the waves this would not be the first nor the last appearance of the hapless dummy she would do a skirt dance among the waves to make it appear that she was drowning or at least swimming for her life she would clear the stage and then the ship would sink in the first act she would be lying on a beach unconscious and the sultans men would find her they would carry her off and the curtain would rise on the sultans palace this gave the opportunity for several acts to come on stage to entertain the sultan chief among them of course would be jonathon he would play the sultans vizier who enforced the sultans edicts with his magic he would make some poor wretch turn into a chicken or some such thingthey hadnt quite decided what animal they would use perhaps even a dogand then the new harem captives would be brought in nigel would have to hire dancers for this but he had some experience with hiring actors and dancers for something called the panto so she expected he could manage that then it would be her turn begging and pleading with the sultan to send her back to her people she would be refused and ordered to dance this is when she would do her hoop ribbon and ball dances there would be more entertainment for the sultan interspersed with a very clever idea on nigels part a scrim would drop down between the audience and the sultans court and everyone would freeze in place like a tableaux vivant then the lights would come down on the sultans court then two footlights would come up one on a ballad singer and one on her apparently gazing out of a window the ballad singer would perform a number about england or home while she sighed in her captivity then the lights out front would come down she and the singer would exit under cover of the darkness and the lights would come back up on the sultans palace the sultan would demand for her to dance again this time it would be one of the ballet solos she knew so well then the sultan would begin courting her now why wolf had demanded is he going to court her when logic says he could simply take her fairy tale logic old bird arthur had replied absently shes a virtuous english girl and therefore the only thoughts that enter the sultans head are those of honor and decency then he had made that little exclamation that meant he had puzzled out what he was working on try this out for your hoopdance he had said and began to play a melody as she went through her planned choreography in her mind everything else was forgotten after that she would stand up to the evil vizier who would have a change of heart and agree to get her out nigel had the notion for her to do a naturalistic dance portraying anger and defiance at that point in bare feet and legs and a little tunic as isadora duncan did next she and the chorus dancers would do a nautch dance in the harem she wasnt at all sure about this as she had never actually seen a nautch dance but she supposed she could adopt one of aspicas solos from the pharoahs daughter then back to the sultans court where growing weary of her refusal the sultan would attempt to force himself on her finally wolf had exclaimed at that point making them all laugh she would break away and perform a skirt dance with red and yellow lights on her for fire the sultan would be frightened call her an efrit and demand that the vizier do something about her the vizier would make her vanish from an open platform the last scene she would be in would be where she said farewell on a beach to the vizier who would send her away in the custody of a dozen british tars who would of course do a dance with her in the middle of them but the last scene would be all the viziers where he would be dragged up in front of the sultan for helping her to escape and he would bring the entire palace down in a barrage of fire and vanish out of the midst of it jonathon was quite excited about this for it meant not only a spectacular illusion but an escape from chains as well in general in fact everyone was enthused about the production it was at that moment that she had realized there were two things she needed a choreographer was one a teacher was another try as she might she was unable to put together sequences of steps that seemed at all interesting she understood this instinctively something in her compared say the petipa choreography from one of the sleeping beauty variations which were by no means his most inspired to what she was doing and she fell far far short and as for a teacher she understood that she needed correction and also understood that she was not going to get that correction working on her own finally she broached the subject to nigel whose brow furrowed at her request im not sure i understand correctly he said finally i thought it would be no problem for you to put together your little numbers and arent you beyond taking lessons a dancer is never beyond taking lessons she replied solemnly there is always something new to learn it is hard to practice and look for faults at the same time nigel nodded at that come to think of it im going to require someone to teach all those chorus dancers their parts and handle them as arthur handles the orchestra he pondered this for a moment let me see if the booking agents have anyone of this sort not three days later he turned up again at her rehearsal studio and with him was a man she did not recognize mademoiselle tchereslavsky this is monsieur ciccolini he will be your teacher hell be doing the choreography and hell be keeping the chorus under as much control as possible that will not be the easiest proposition the gentleman said with a smile he was a tall lean man hair once black now going gray but continuing to be handsome in that ageless way that only italians could manage this was not the romanitalian whose statues adorned theaters and government buildings everywhere he definitely had a dancers build and a dancers way of moving but she could tell that his knees pained him young ladies being what they are i can only promise that they will turn up to rehearsals and performances on time and come up to my standard or they will find themselves replaced he bowed a little mademoiselle if i may be so bold as to come back with you to your rehearsal hall i can then get some idea of what lessons you may need she was only too happy to take him there and was very glad that she was already warmed up he took over the room as if he had been there all his life addressing the pianist and taking charge of it all he instructed her to warm up anyway which she did while he scrutinized her then as he set the tempo of the pianist he called out steps for her to perform this was something she had sorely missed it was one thing to dance a sequence from one of the many ballets that you had memorized or a sequence that you tried to make up in your head to try and stretch your abilities and all the while watch yourself in the mirror for any flaws it was quite another to dance a sequence as it was called out by the teacher and to rely on the teacher to watch for flaws while you concentrated on the dancing he ran her through several such sequences at varied tempi his long face growing more and more thoughtful finally he waved her to the barre mademoiselle he said heavily i am only an old man from milano with two bad knees and some ability to teach little english chorus girls to stagger about on their toes and not disgrace themselves you are better than anyone i have ever taught you are better than anyone i have ever danced with you may be better than anyone i have ever seen there is nothing i can teach you ninette listened to this with growing astonishment true in the past several weeks she had completely forgotten about captivating rich old men and had concentrated on her dancing as never before but surely that had not made that much of an improvement surely he was mistaken or flattering her or perhaps testing her she raised her head monsieur whether or not any of that is true a dancer never stops learning you have learned at one school i at another another technique is always worth learning and you choreograph which is something i have never done true true he admitted she smiled well then pray help me with this first of my dances for this production for i confess i can think of nothing to make it particularly interesting she fetched the hoop from the corner it is to combine ballet with the hoopexercises of the swiss girls ah yes he exclaimed with recognition i saw them well then let us begin by the end of the afternoon he had turned a rather lackluster little piece into something amusing and interesting it was true that he was no petipa but he had a good eye and a sound instinct being able to make clear improvements in her dance raised his spirits as well by the end of the afternoon he was issuing orders and tapping out the tempo with his instruction wand and using it too to reposition a foot or a knee he was one of those teachers who used a long wand nearly as tall as he was to point out problems with the feet and legs she had only had one such teacher at the paris opera and he had been prone to using it to thwack little ballerinas across the back of the calf when he did not like what they were doing perhaps ciccolini was naturally more gentle than that or perhaps he simply deemed her too old for such correctionor maybe he feared that in a temper she would snatch his wand and break it over his head at any rate he did no such thing to her it was a relief to think about something besides magic to concentrate entirely on her dance it was very odd to think that a few weeks ago she would have been perfectly happy to find herself not dancing this was real solid something she had known all her life something she understood magic she did not understand how could a cat talk how could there be little creatures like the brownie living right under everyones noses dancing was better butthere was something lacking even with her dancing but she needed something more she needed mademoiselle the instructor began breaking her out of her reverie this looks very fine in this room but to judge whether or not it will serve on the stage you must take it on the stage and to judge whether or not it pleases an audience you must take it before an audience she thought about that for a moment and realized what it was that she had been feeling the lack of an audience she had not until that moment realized just how much she had missed that aspect of dancing the audience not just potential suitors but all of them from the little girls at their first ballet to the old balletomanes she wanted to hear applause feel their presence drink in their attention it was very strange when she had danced the sylphide she had not even considered the audience and yet now that applause had been like a drug and she wanted more of it i quite agree with you monsieur she said with a nod i will speak with the director there is no reason why i should not start performing same time tomorrow then he nodded i fear my mornings will be filled with teaching people who have perfect figures and an imperfect sense of where to put their feet or how to execute a few steps in other words i will be instructing the chorus very good monsieur she repliedthe old man bowed to her and took his leave the pianist began packing her music away and ninette retired to the little changing room just off the rehearsal room she changed into her street clothing and went straight to nigels office he looked up as she tapped on the doorframe for the door itself was open mademoiselle he said looking worried that italian chap not to your liking ill find you another teacher if you must no she said swiftly no he is excellent she took a deep breath however i grow uneasy that you support me and i do nothing nigel laughed you are in rehearsal you are earning your salary she shook her head i have never performed before an english audience i need to see what they are like now is the time to try some of my dances to see if they respond to me sir i would like to perform in your show not the one we are creating this music hall that you are presenting the look of surprise on his face made her smile if youre certain he said finally im sure we can fit a dance or two in i am certain she said firmly and monsieur ciccolini believes this is a good idea too in that case i would be the last person to argue nigel replied giving in with good grace well start you next week on the new playbill she smiled and thanked him the conviction that this was exactly what she needed remained with her all the way back to her flat nina tchereslavsky regarded the dead old man in her bed with a remote regret regret because he had after all offered so little sustenance and now she would have to find another admirer with a great deal of money but it was tempered with the knowledge that she really did look very chic in black it was a great pity but he had to be devoured he had been getting restless eyes beginning to rovewhich was how she had gotten him in the first place but nina left nothing for any other female creature human or otherwise when she was finished with a man that little palehaired girl in the back of the chorus would just have to go hunting elsewhere so farewell to herr klaus obervelten the farmtractor tycoon but it would not do for him to be found here with a twist of her mind she summoned a herd of the kobolds that were as much slaves to the power she granted them as they were her allies being very much part of the material world they came scampering through her open bedroom window rather than manifesting in any other way take that to its home she said pointing a languid finger at the corpse and wrapping her silkvelvet robe more tightly around herself put it in its bed with another twist of her mind she showed them where her benefactors home was and where his bedroom was in that house without a word the little mob of kobolds had hoisted the body onto their backs and a moment later were scampering out the window with it they would go over the rooftops of course it was night and the sun wouldnt hurt their eyes it certainly would not do for a policeman to see a dead rather naked body being carried through the streets by things invisible to his eyes that would be unfortunate nina closed the window and stretched that was that sadly no more presents and the heirs would likely very soon cut off the monthly rental payments for this very expensive flat no matter she had enough to live on for a while until she found another socalled protector it would not take long the magic and energy she took from her old men was sufficient to allow her to keep this form as it was when she had devoured it and moved into the girls life she looked not quite twenty in that ageless way of ballerinas everywhere she had chosen her victims very carefully not at all at random the original nina had been well on the way to becoming a great dancer and had attracted a great many followers at the point where the creature that became her had taken her but few of them had been the sort that would have done her any good she was forever attracting starving poets who would write wonderful things about her but did not pay the rent on a nice flat she had been very wild and rather wanton and threw herself away on these beautiful but impecunious fellows evidently she had not taken the lesson of la boheme to heart she had doted on la dame aux camellias instead her talent for dancing and her fine body had been wasted on her silly little soul the creature had swiftly changed all that it had been easy she simply assumed the form of one of her own victims who had been an exceedingly beautiful young man and nina had happily let the creature seduce her once in her bed it was only a moment until nina was absorbed and the creature became nina she had spent all the rest of that night getting used to the dancers body and memories in class the next day she had been clumsy at first occasioning some giggles from the other girls but she joked and laughed herself about a little too much champagne and they all put it off to a hangover but the creature had a great deal of practice in mastering forms and by midafternoon she was actually dancing better than the original this was not as hard as it might seem for one thing she was able to concentrate as nina had not been for another her body did not tire or hurt as ninas had the beautiful movements of ballet the creature now knew were performed more or less in pain well the creature did not generally experience that sort of pain as long as she could drain others to heal or sustain herself she would not ever suffer either by the evenings performance in which nina was a soloist the creature was ready backstage all the beautiful but impecunious boys found themselves relegated to the back of the crowd as nina concentrated on the old and rich and not at all beautiful by morning nina was wearing a fur coat a diamond bracelet and was about to be installed in a fine little flat complete with maid her benefactor had been an aging count well used to keeping pretty little ballerinas and if he had a taste for cruelty well he did not last long enough to indulge himself in it too much the next man a highly successful wine merchant was easier to deal with and just as generous for some reason dancers attracted old men some much older than the ones that pursued opera divas this was exactly as the creature that had taken the dancers form and place liked it old men were prone to dying from a thousand and one causes and ninas benefactors were all very old men and she was discreet most of the time unless the old gentleman himself wished to flaunt her as herr klaus had no one knew there was a liaison as for the ones who paraded her like a trophy no one thought twice about it when nina lost a few lovers in such a fashion since not a single death was directly connected with her herr klaus would be found in his own bed with no indication that he had been with her last night ninas servants who were rendered blind and deaf when she chose could not have told anyone otherwise even if they wanted to perhaps she should go to the bohemian quarter and find herself a starving artist or tortured poet or two or three and it was a very good thing that she was leaving to dance elsewhere she could take another old man or two there without the rumors of the previous ones following her she would choose ones who needed to be discreet that way no one would be the wiser when she consumed them the creature had taken the forms and shapes of many beings over the years an elemental creature of earth it had first been conjured and inexpertly bound some three hundred years ago by an earth master who relied on instinct rather than learning and whose selfconfidence was nothing short of hubris he was the first human that the creature had devoured up until then it had confined itself to lesser elemental beings and animals but once she had absorbed the magician that was when things began to change her talent which had caused the magician to try to bind her in the first place was that not only could she kill anything by absorbing its essence she could then imitate it flawlessly afterwards so once she discovered that having absorbed her erstwhile captor she was able to stay on the material plane there was no turning back for her she had taken on the form of that foolish elemental magician for quite some time before his life bored her and when she was ready to move on it hadnt taken a lot of effort to find someone else to be the creaturethe first mage had called her a trollwent back to bed when the body was found which it would be soon since the sky to the east was getting brighter nina needed to be in her bed alone she might not be sans peur et sans reproche at least in the eyes of the world but having him die in her bed might excite the suspicions of the wretched police there were elemental mages everywhere they could and would banish her back to her previous existence or worse she wrapped the silk sheets around herself and settled into the lovely soft bed it had been a good day when nina tchereslavsky decided she was going to use magic to get the attention of a certain beautiful young poet who was not interested in her the current nina judged that this was a very foolish thing to do not only would most love spells not have worked on someone who was devoted to someone else there had been a dozen equally beautiful young men clamoring for her as for the dancer she had been prepared to throw her entire life away on a succession of these beautiful young men none of whom would have done her a particle of good had any money or ever likely would have any money whereas the creature that had taken her place had made her great a much much better use of the gifts that had been given her with these thoughts in mind nina drifted back off to sleep fully expecting to be awakened by the maid bewailing the death of the old man instead she was awakened by the maid bewailing nothing only bringing her the morning pastry and chocolate and an envelope a letter from the impresario of the theater in salzburg at which she was expected to perform she frowned at it before opening it she really hoped he was not canceling her engagement she needed to move away from hungary altogether too many men had died around her and this last one might start some talk germany that was far enough she would be discreet it wasnt hard to be discreet when you knew what to look for provided this impresario wasnt having second thoughts but instead what fell out was a note and a newspaper clipping i trust this note will reach you where you should be the note read because you cannot perform in my theater and one in england at the same time swiftly she caught up the little cutout bit of paper it wasnt much only a note that nina tchereslavsky was performing at some music hall in blackpool and that she was to be the star of an upcoming and very ambitious project by the owner of that theater at first nina did not grasp what this meant then she flew into a rage when at last her initial anger was expended the bedroom was virtually destroyed the furniture was in splinters the bedclothes and curtains in rags the servants knew better than to approach her in this mood she likely would have killed them not that this would have mattered to the world in general her servants were not human she stood in the middle of the wreckage trying to think this girl was impersonating her it did not matter that she was off in some provincial little city in england where no one would see her but farmers in smocks and thick boots what mattered was that this girl was stealing the reputation that nina had built stealing her identity she had stolen from nina no one stole from nina her skin flushed with rage again just thinking about it she would go to england she would find this girl and kill her it could not possibly take any time and it should be pathetically easy she would do what she had done with the original nina she would take on the form of a beautiful young man or if that did not work a very rich old one she would seduce the girl and then kill her and leave it to look as if she had been murdered by her lover and of course that lover would no longer exist nina could change to another form and leave the country all in time to make her debut at salzburg she finally felt her anger cooling and even managed to smile amid the chaos she found the pull for the bell and rang for her maid the servant opened the door a crack timidly it was so frustrating that she was fettered to this solid form if she had not been she could have been in england within a day moving in the secret ways of the earth elementals swimming through the very crust of the earth itself she could change her form she could work earth magic herself but she was still as bound to the laws of the mortal world as if she was mortal herself clean up this mess she ordered then have the others pack my trunks tell yuri to order my car and get tickets to england how fortunate that the ballet season was over and you cancel all my engagements and send for some new furniture have this room repaired and refurnished while i am gone there is nothing here i need to deal with that cannot wait hold very still ordered jonathon as he closed ninette into the cabinet and dont be afraid nothing you see is going to harm you but she began as he closed the door he didnt open it again and she stood there in the dark in what felt very like a coffin wondering what it was she was going to see that might and then the entire box was engulfed in flames terror overwhelmed her she shrieked at the top of her lungs she tried to bring up her arms to beat on the door of the box but it was too narrow and she couldnt move there was no fastening on the inside of the box she tried to get up her foot to kick and couldnt even do that the flames were everywhere and suddenly she realized in midscream that she wasnt even warm that her clothing was not on fire that she didnt smell smoke that the inside of the box was not even warm to the touch whatever jonathon was doing this was not real fire and she was quite ready to kill him at that moment he might have said that was when the trap door beneath her that she had been told about opened and she dropped down onto a pair of soft mattresses her knees automatically flexed as soon as she was falling so she landed lightly but fuming she stormed across the space beneath the stage and up the stairs to the backstage her face must have looked like thunder because even the stagehands scuttled out of her way with hands balled into fists she stalked across the stage to where jonathon had just opened the cabinet with a flourish to show it was empty at the sound of her feet thumping across the stagefor a ballerina can walk very heavily if she chooseshe turned now that is the kind of scream iow she had kicked him in the shin before he could finish the sentence he looked at her in astonishment she kicked the other shin ow you might have said she shouted merzavets lopni tvoya selezenka i ospleni tvoy glaz nechistaya sila the russian simply poured from her lips without thinking and she would have been surprised if she had not been so furious you frightened me to death i am a magician you know it couldnt have been real oh yes and she very much doubted that this was any illusion or stage trick those flames had to have come from his powers as an elemental mage but she could not say that not in public so instead she kicked his shin again i would have known if you had warned me but you did not she retorted you close me in a coffin and then fire how was i to know it was not some terrible accident you would have heard someone shouting fire jonathon barked heatedly i would have heard nothing she shouted back i was screaming silence descended on the stage finally arthur chuckled from his position in the orchestra pit admit it jonathon you wanted her to scream you gave yourself away when you said that was the kind of scream you wanted jonathon flushed and looked away oh she spluttered and kicked his shin again before stomping off the stage behind her with some satisfaction she could hear him swearing the cat was waiting in the wings and walked back with her to her dressing room where she slammed the door closed sat down and looked at him that was very bad of him the cat observed its a naughty schoolboy trick he is quite old enough not to play such things she said severely i am doing my best to be a good assistant to him and he should not play such things on me stage fire is not funny especially not when you are trapped in a box the cat sighed he hasnt changed he drove off more young ladies with his pranks than you could imagine she looked at the cat oddly you know him his assistants the cat said hastily the stagehands talked about it ninette turned back to the mirror of her dressing table but considered and not for the first time that the cat sounded as if he knew or had known the fire master in the past but it could be when my father lived here she thought there was no reason why the cat should not have been with her father before he came to paris though why the cat should want to conceal this fact she could not imagine thomas was full of mysteries how had he known to come here to blackpool for instance how did he know that there was a theater owner here moreover one who was looking for someone very like her but she was not going to pose these questions to him if he had not told her these things before there was no reason to think he would do so now and she was not in a position to force him are you going to rejoin the rehearsal thomas asked when i think i have been away long enough to have made my feelings clear she said firmly that was not funny and i do not intend to put up with any more such pranks i am not an assistant that has no choice but to endure that sort of thing well put and about time someone taught him that schoolboy tricks are very unwelcome when played by an adult man she waited a few moments more then came out of her dressing room and returned to the stage where jonathon was fussing with his apparatus she cleared her throat and he jumped you arent going to kick me again are you he asked turning to her with a grimace i shall if you do any such thing again she said stiffly i am not your hired assistant who must endure cruelty in order to collect her pay and if you play more tricks on me i shall kick you somewhat higher than your shin his eyes widened youd do it too wouldnt you he said with grudging admiration yes i would she looked up at him defiantly now i believe we have an illusion to rehearse i take it you wish me to scream in a terrifying fashion when i see the flames he nodded speechlessly she returned to her spot and knelt arms behind her back as if tied there then nodded to arthur who took that as the cue it was and lifted his baton this time the illusion proceeded in a professional manner jonathon locked her in the cabinet when she saw the flames she shrieked and if she let out a bit more anger with her screams well no one was the wiser the trapdoor released she dropped onto the mattresses then made her way back up to the wings they ran through the trick three or four more times before jonathon pronounced himself satisfied you are a capital screamer though he said apologetically i should have told you what was coming since i can clearly see you would have done just right if i had warned you she raised her chin i am a professional she said i can see that he looked uneasy i am sorry i frightened you she sensed that was the closest she was going to get to a real apology and nodded she was not going to apologize for kicking him even though she was fairly certain that he now had four round little bruises on his shins i think that the illusion is ready to use tonight he continued i think so too i will have just enough time to change after my ribbon dance she couldnt help but smile at that the ribbon hoop and ball dances had with some more adjustment by monsieur ciccolini been quite popular with the audiences thats a nice bit of business that ribbon dance jonathon said awkwardly then paused you know i have an illusion that makes a handkerchief fly about the stage you might do a dance where you chase it or dance with it i would prefer a combination of the two she said after a moment i begin by chasing then stop and dance to see if it can be lured and lure it into dancing with me he laughed that is a good notion lets go talk to nigel and arthur about it she nodded and the two of them headed up to nigels office arthur was with him as they both expected going over some lastminute changes to the billjust a little rearranging of the acts since it was proving awkward to get the performing dogs off the stage in time for the ragtime dancers to enter since they had to come in from both wings the acrobats were going in after the dogs instead since they could enter from one side while the dogs left on the other jonathon explained the idea for the new illusion nigel approved it and arthur made several suggestions for music until they finally settled on a piece only then did ninette ask the question that had been in her mind since her shock what were those flames she asked they were not even warm but they looked so real jonathon chuckled pure illusion not stage magic but one that ordinary folks can see as a fire master i know everything there is to know about fire and its creatures and as a consequence i can call up real fires or summon up what is nothing more than the illusion of fire thats how i intend to burn down the sultans palace at the end of our production except the fires will be partly my illusion and partly stagecraft he held out his hand and a moment later there was a flame dancing on the palm dont touch that one thats real he said cautiously he held out the other and a second flame sprang up but with the two sidebyside she could see that there were differences the illusory one was paler and rather than flickering and moving randomly this flame kept the same sidetoside motion as if it was some sort of clockwork pendulum thats the problem with illusions jonathon continued turning both hands into fists to banish both flames unless you concentrate all you have on it you always wind up with a secondrate imitation of the real thing still it wouldnt do for me to burn down the stage or my apprentice either she smiled slightly as witticisms went it was rather feeble but she was determined to hold the high ground and not show any further displeasure with him by the way mademoiselle arthur said thoughtfully how did you know about jonathons regrettable tendency to make his assistants so angry at him that they leave his employ he must go through two or three in a year jonathon flushed and ninette restrained a smile she guessed that arthur was also tired of jonathons pranks and was using that question as a means to show the magician that his behavior had not gone unremarked the stage hands she said after thinking quickly about what the cat had said when he did not arrive with one they talked about it frankly they did not seem surprised only anxious that one of them not be dragooned to serve as his victim in the illusions jonathon flushed with embarrassment which well he should given the circumstances whether the cat had known about it from some previous acquaintance and had lied or it really had been the stagehands it was rather unpardonable behavior i well i suppose i am notorious he said with an artificial laugh do you think we can get a spot of something to eat before the performance she almost said something then changed her mind ill send one of the boys out for something nigel replied i wanted to talk with you both about whether or not youdnoticed anything or anyone that seemed too interested in mademoiselle nina they exchanged a glance i am not certain i would she said finally and shrugged you should ask thomas i did he looked inscrutable by which i think he means that he has sensed something but that it is nowhere near certainly not in blackpool probably not in the county possibly not in england but i suspect that whatever it is it will be here soon so i suggest we plan for its arrival ninette could only look baffled she could not imagine who among the circles of elemental masters good and bad could be holding a grudge against her all right i suggest that you and i nigel have our creatures watching for any other new master that enters the city jonathon said with a nod now the master might be able to conceal himself to a greater or lesser extent but elementals gossip and thats something no master has ever been able to break them of he grinned even if he has wardings on him hell still cause a ripple in his element just by existing and the other elementals will sense that nigel nodded then what arthur asked then we wait for him or her to do something nigel replied we cannot act against him there are rules about that and i dont want to face someone like the old lion for breaking the rules besides unlikely as it seems we might get another master in here just as a visitor to blackpool and it would be very unwise to launch an attack of some sort on some hapless stranger jonathon shuddered the old lion would fry us for that besides if you are clever he will not know that you are there or that you know what i am supposed to be ninette said after a moment of silence i think it would be wise to wait no yes all eyes turned to the window where the cat sat on the sill although he had not been there a moment before our enemy does not know about me either thomas pointed out laying low as our american cousins would say is the wise choice here but be prepared because it is possible an attack will not come from magic at least not at first ninette stared at him perhaps i should round up a solicitor then nigel replied half in jest that might be wise replied the cat not at all in jest ninette stopped in astonishment at the door of her dressing room it was full of flowers she had been dancing in the performances for two weeks now and had been acting as jonathons dancer and assistant for one last night she had added a fourth dance to her routines a skirt dance with special colored lights playing on it a la loie fuller sure that had not been the occasion for all of this there were bouquets of every size and color from a little nosegay of violets on her dressing table to an enormous creation that practically required a table of its own her maid ailse mckenzie had collected the cards and arranged them on her dressingtable she opened each one to see messages of admiration and five different names well it seemed she had a suite of admirers for a moment she felt a warm glow and a smile passed over her lips this was wonderful this was exactly the sort of adulation that the etoiles enjoyed and it was a harbinger of more substantial offerings to come from flowers the tributes usually rose to flowers and fruit then flowers and chocolates then flowers and jewelry or they did if several men were vying to become ones benefactor of course there was no telling how rich any of these men were it was nearly summer and flowers were not as dear now as they were in winter she didnt know enough to tell which were in season in england and thus inexpensive and which were not and thus expensive but these extravagant floral tributes could represent the limits of extravagance of any or all of them a starving poet could and would spend his last farthing on a bouquet for one whose looks excited his imagination poets and other artists were hardly the most practical of creatures still it would be wonderful to have the men that had given her all these flowers crowding her dressing room after the performances and even nicer if one of them took her out for dinner afterwards ill be accepting visitors after the show ailse she said slowly and carefully for ailse did not always understand her heavily accented english gemmun visitors too maamselle the girl asked she nodded the girl nodded though ninette thought her face showed a trace of disapproval that was only to be expected she had never served theater people before and likely had no idea that the dressing room of a principle served as a kind of drawing room for the etoile or perhaps she did not think that ninette should be encouraging so many men well she would have to get used to it ninette reckoned that if the maid could get so accustomed to a brownie living in the pantry that she put out a daily bowl of milk and plate of bread for it she could get used to ninettes admirers and perhaps a benefactor eventually not that ninette expected to find the sort of benefactor that la augustine enjoyed here in this city that was highly unlikely it did not seem to run to rich men or nobles with both titles and money nor did she expect to see such men in this sort of theater she had never yet seen the kind of men she hoped to attract the sort that became the protectors of etoiles or at least they would not come here until nigels real show began if there even were such in this city then well to be realistic the ones who came would probably not be the nobles with both titles and money nor the ones whose greatgrandfathers had been both wealthy and genteel rich men newly rich with fast motorcars who like jazz and ragtime yes perhaps that sort had come to the opera now and again but they tended to favor the dancers at the moulin rouge and then they did not keep any one woman for very long why should they dancers at the moulin rouge were not devotees of art and culture they had simple tastes and seldom took thought for the future a ballet dancer an opera singerthey knew that their days were numbered on the stage and they took thought for the future they looked for men who would give them presents that would support them when they could no longer dance or singthings like not just a flat but the entire building the flat was in or presents of money without asking where that money was going the great courtesans understood this as did their benefactors ninette had actually been present one day when some fanatic street preacher had accosted one of those great ladies outside the theater and chided her for her irregular life my good man the lady had said with a laugh my life is a great deal more regular than that of your wife and everyone had known that was true the street preachers wife could never be sure of what her household allowance would be nor when it would come the courtesan however had arranged for all such things to be negotiated ahead of time by her factoroften an older female relative she had a dress allowance her foodstuffs were charged her rent was paid she had an allowance for when she entertained her own friends or went out to the theater alone she knew that she would be taken once a year to monte carlo or some other holiday spot so many times to the races so many times to the theater and so forth all negotiated very carefully nothing left to chance the sort of men that ninette wanted understood all this the moulin rouge dancersand she was far closer in position to them right now than to la augustinenever thought of the future if they could help it when they got presents of money they spent it and they would not know what to do with a building of flats except to allow all their friends to move in and stay for nothing they were happy with the flashy jewels and champagne suppers of the bold rich men who drove big fast motorcars this was the way that such men liked things and those men were not old nor were they often very kind in fact from what little of those sorts of men ninette had seen she judged them to be very demanding very arrogant and often difficult to deal with they wanted and what they wanted they generally got they also had very little regard for wants or needs not their own they expected to be the ones being pleased and not the ones giving pleasure when they gave a gift it was with the expectation that it would be displayed so that everyone would know what a fine gift they could give they seldom took their kept women to the theater to the opera to places where the respectable might go the lives of their women were very irregular indeed she considered these things as she carefully and expertly applied her stage makeup and as ailse helped her into her costume all things considered she decided if these were that sort of young man she would not give any of them particular encouragement she would accept their flowers and other gifts but give them nothing other than the opportunity to display to each other how important they were and to vie for her undivided attention and it was always possible that these were merely romantic young men for whom sending several bouquets of flowers to a dancer was the acme of extravagance and since she had far more in common with manon than with mimi she did not propose to live on love in a garret so she would enjoy their attention and their flattery but give them nothing to hope for beyond that she would allow them to give her attention and flattery besides the audience gave her that and with that in mind she hurried off to the wings to give them every reason to grant it to her the house was full the holidaymakers season in full bloom and it was an audience that expected to be pleased was prepared to be pleased and was happy to show that it was pleased her dances with the props the huge skirt and the colored lights brought oohs and ahs from the audience then she changed from the skirt costume to the simple long grecianstyle dress she wore for the first of jonathons turns the trick with jonathon where she chased his dancing handkerchief it was never quite the same twice in a row she played the part of a young girl that jonathon was trying to make smile he would pull the handkerchief out of the air make a little puppet of it and make the puppet dance she would chase it and it would elude her popping in and out of a bottle to keep her from capturing it then she would decide to trick it go off to the other side of the stage and dance wonderfully intricate ballet passages cribbed from the solos from les sylphides the chopin ballet that had no plot as opposed to the la sylphide which had been her triumph and downfall the handkerchief would become curious come closer and closer and finally end up dancing with her that brought delighted laughter then she ran offstage and quickly changed into her captive slave costume for the trick where she appeared to be burned alive as ever even through her own screams she heard the gasps of horror it was a particularly good evening it almost seemed to her that she could feel the audiences pleasure as well as hear it she had actually shivered in the cabinet at their gasps of horror feeling some of that horror herself and when she returned to a dressing room full of more flowers she found it also full of both passionate and impoverished young men and brash and demanding wealthier middleaged men and as she had expected the older men were all the nouveau riche motorcardriving ragtimeloving sort not the sort from which one would get proper support for one moment she almost fled despite her earlier thoughts she was not the great dancer she pretended to be she was only a little creature from paris opera ballet not an etoile a bare step up from coryphée but then she steeled herself cast her mind back to la augustine and sailed into the dressing room with a smile and a tinkling laugh this too was a performance and she would give it her best nigel came by looked surprised and then pleased by all the attention she was getting then went on his way well he was surely counting his receipts with great pleasure tonight arthur waved and wolf flapped his wings at her from the door but they were clearly on their way somewhere elsehome perhaps then jonathon appeared and when he saw the crush he looked absolutely black but he did not stay either he looked daggers at the men then stalked off she wondered what reason he thought he had to look so evilly at her visitors surely none of these men not the shallow showy ones with money nor the young and romantic ones with nothing should give him any cause to be concerned the idea that any of these could be a magician with murderous intent was too laughable even to entertain for a moment in the end of course she sent them all away with laughter and flattering words that sounded like promises but were not and once she was sure they were gone she changed to her street clothes and set out with ailse on foot for her flat through the rain again did it never stop raining here at least the street lights were electrical and remained on during the rain blackpool was allegedly famous for them dinner had been left to stay warm in the oven for her she smelled it as soon as she opened the door the brownie of course could be counted upon to keep it from burning or drying out it was a lovely beef dinner the english seemed to eat a great deal of beef she and ailse shared it she savoring every single bite slowly and with infinite pleasure thinking how like paradise this was only a few weeks ago she was eating the last of her cabbage soup and stale bread now she feasted on roast beef new potatoes the first of the spring asparagus and a splendid chocolate cake to follow she would sleep in a bed with sheets and warm blankets and awake to tea and toast and wonderful currant jelly served to her in that same bed then she would stop downstairs for another breakfast of eggs and broiled tomatoes and a little sausage before going to the theater someone would surely take her out to luncheon or ailse would bring her something from the nearby theater pub she never went without a meal now and a good onejust as well because she was rehearsing morning and afternoon and performing every night master ciccolini was proving a better instructor than he thought he was for his eye was very good and caught all the little places where her balance could be improved a turn could be made more beautiful a line more gracefuland what was more he knew how to position her to get those things they were working on the choreography for the big production of escape from the harem in this way bar by bar trial and error what she could not lift wholesale from other ballets that is it was hard work and she needed the good food she had never felt better healthier happier in her life ailse glanced once or twice at her with curiosity but was too good a servant to ask anything food ninette said into the silence is a kind of art like all arts it can be simple or it can be complex but one always knows when the artist who created it is great and great art deserves respect and attention she smiled it goes without saying that our hostess is an artist in her own kitchen everything she makes is as perfect as it can be tis uncommon good aye mamselle ailse ventured winning another smile from ninette and there was another thing although she had a heavy accent and her conversation was unexpectedly sprinkled with russian phrases her english mysteriously improved each night was that the cats doing it must be she could not imagine any other way in which it could be happening so quickly in short life was wonderful even without a rich old man to shower gifts and fine living on her she was beginning to wonder if she really needed such a man after all but as ninette went to bed she wondered something else what about the crowd in her dressing room had made jonathon hightower look so annoyed nigels air sprites fled from his office without warning so he was not entirely surprised to see jonathon come in wearing an expression like a thunderstorm nigel went on counting the receipts good house tonight he remarked full of idiots jonathon growled but i suppose that is just as well easier to deceive idiots they seemed to appreciate your act jonathon frowned i wish she would show a little less leg it seemed a nonsequitur but nigel was tolerably familiar with the way that jonathon thought aha that is the way the wind blows is it nigel coughed if i recall correctly your last female assistant wore tights and a merry widowand not much more my last assistant was a trollop jonathon all but spat this dancer of yours needs to be more careful some people seem to think that showing your legs on the stage means theyll get to see more of those legs up close if they just bring enough flowers ah jonathonthe magician so far as nigel was aware had been notoriously indifferent to his assistants although it was quietly understood that being his assistant on stage meant sharing living quarters for the tour offstage and if they objected to that they were replaced to nigels knowledge only one or two ever had been at least in midtour and not for that reason jonathons relentless drive and his acid wit however had driven more than one of them to quit at the end of a season he was rather a hard taskmaster and his sense of humor as nina had discovered was just a trifle cruel nigel was actually proud that she had stood up to him over that one incident jonathon didnt care for shrinking violets he respected her now respects her enough to not care for a dressing room full of potential rivals shes a ballet dancer they spend most of their lives halfnaked i doubt she thinks anything of it no more than you think of spending half your life with false hair plastered on your face he decided to obliquely change the subject has anything turned up looking to harm her jonathon frowned at that thats the other thing i wanted to talk to you about my sentries are uneasy there is definitely something in the wind but whatever it is they havent been able to exactly find it you know they have some limited ability to see into the future nigel nodded fire spirits and water spirits were particularly good at that air spirits could but tended to be so flighty they had trouble concentrating and earth spirits were well very dense when it came to the future keeping all their attention solidly in the present there is threat to her and the origin of that threat is here in this country that is all they can say jonathons frown deepened do you suppose that whatever or whoever it is knows that she is being guarded wouldnt you nigel countered we darent underestimate this foe her father was powerful enough to create thomas and yet he lost out to this personor persons for all we know there could be more than one enemy and if there is and they have separated that could also cause confusion for your spirits curse it youre right jonathon growled and curse them too indeed nigel replied dryly how dare villainous cads be as clever as the heroes jonathon looked at him in shock for a moment and then they both laughed once her rage cooledand the journey to this blackpool place was accomplished not by uncomfortable train but by luxurious steam yacht giving her plenty of time for her temper to coolnina the real nina had gone from livid to calculating and she realized that there was a very good reason an excellent reason why the imposter had chosen her identity to steal in the girls place she might have done the same eastern europe and the russian empire were a very very long way from england the english knew only what came to them visiting their shores from out of those remote climespavlova nijinsky diaghilev stravinskyand did not care to learn anything more no one there had seen nina dance a few balletomanes would have heard of her name that she was a great prima with the imperial ballet but aside from a few sketches or blurred photographs which could have been of virtually any ballerina there was nothing to tell the imposter from the real thing nina tchereslavsky was the perfect person to impersonate and aside from those few balletomanes no one would know who or even what she was the imposter was already on the metaphorical high ground having established herself as nina tchereslavsky any challenger would have an uphill fight against someone who had fans adherents and the backing of an impresario claimants to a throne already being held usually did not fare well perhaps an oblique approach at least at first so rather than sail that very expensive steam yacht directly into the harbor at blackpool and excite all manner of interest among those who might wonder who was aboard nina ordered it put in to the harbor at southport then hired a motorcar and spent a leisurely and very private journey up the liverpool road to preston eating at the best establishments sleeping at the best hotels crossing a river known she thought rather hilariously as the ribble and from thence to blackpool itself she took lodgings in a fine little hotel under the name of anna vronsky another joke since she rather doubted any of the insular and culturally illiterate english would ever recognize the names of tolstoys famous hero and heroine of the great masterwork anna karenina nor did they and generous payment in advance practically guaranteed discreet silence about the mysterious russian lady though according to her servants rumors flew about the dining room that she was a duchess even a grand duchess or at least a countess having established a headquarters she went about obscuring her magical existence for a very brief foray into the elemental realms told her that the imposter was somehow involved with both a fire master and an air master discretion was definitely in order and caution and a great deal of covering her tracks she had plenty of practice in that there was not an elemental master on the planet that would be happy about one of the elementals achieving what she had done in escaping her bonds they would be even less happy if they knew how she was sustaining herself outside the earth realm dangerous very dangerous that took several days one more thing was needed knowledge this was not her land nor her language nor were any of those she had absorbed familiar with england much less this particular city she sent out her maid one night to find and bring back someone who would not be missed it took only a moment to absorb the ragged street urchin who gave her a streeturchins command of the english language and a streeturchins knowledge of the city only then was she prepared to go and have a look at her imposter and she did not do that as anna vronsky either it was a very good thing to have servants that were not humanand were totally under her control there was no curiosity to contend with when she sent out her maid to buy a secondhand mens suit nor when she assumed the face and figure of one of the poets she had consumed carrying a stack of empty boxes as if she had just made a delivery nina left the hotel by the service entrance without anyone looking at her twice then it was a simple matter to dispose of the boxes and make her way to the theater where her imposter was dancing she bought a cheap balcony seat and sat unsmiling and unmoving through the entire performance grudgingly she had to admit that the little trollop was good quite good and it was clear that she was an audience favorite of course the mobs of holiday goers in the theater were quite prepared to be pleased with just about anything they were given provided it was novel and amusing enough and it was quite clear just who and what the girl had purloined her dances from even if most if not all of the audience had never seen loie fuller or isadora duncan nor had they even heard of the dancers except as the subject of articles in newspapers after the performance nina went back to the stage door and loitered listening to the gossip among the stagehands here her knowledge of the language was perfect she fit right in and her knowledge of backstage life allowed her eventually to slip around to the theater pub pay for two bottles of cheap champagne and get in backstage by pretending she was a delivery person one bottle was destined to be delivered to a woman who sang popular songs and the other to a comedian both with notes of congratulation and an unreadable signature attached but having them gave her all the excuse she needed to linger backstage she learned that the imposter was very popular with the backstage workers that was awkward because by her nature she had a great many limitations as to what she could and could not do she could easily influence someone whose mind was already tending in a direction she wanted it to go but it was the next thing to impossible to influence them in the opposite direction there were also disadvantages to being tied up in very mortal form she could not manifest in the girls flat and simply absorb her she would have to somehow get within embracing range of her and remain private with her for as long as it took to absorb her there would be no finding allies back here and the girl was too wellguarded to think of a direct approach she also learned that the imposter had so thoroughly ingratiated herself with the theater management that an enormous production was being planned solely around her so there would be no hope in disenchanting the management with her either nina would have to think of an entirely different plan of attack with that in mind she left the bottles of champagne with their surprised and gratified recipients and returned to her hotel once there she got the boxes from where she had hidden them then applied at the service entrance for admission to her own suite the room was rung for permission the maid gave it and nina took herself back up to her quarters and assumed her rightful form once there she paced like a caged lion restlessly trying to think of a way to undermine the girl she could not do so on the basis of talent that much was clear the girl had made far too many friends in that theater to do so there too why could she not have been a scheming vituperative shrew why hadnt she been arrogant cold heartless why had she spent time and money distributing little favors to the stagehands why hadnt she had furious arguments with the orchestra furthermore there were not even rival lovers to set against each other nor was there a hint of scandal to excite the interest of the press and outrage the public why hadnt the girl had the decency to take up with a married man as his lover that sort of thing was shrugged at on the continent even expected but it could have brought her down completely in soproper england well there was no use in lamenting what had not happened nina needed to think of something that could well there was the possibility of creating a scandal out of nothing she could find someone utterly unsuitable who wanted to be the girls lover make him think that the girl reciprocated his feelings then inform the wife that would take time however and a great deal of effort well it would certainly do to at least start that project she could begin by finding such a man one of the imposters many admirers who crowded her dressing room no doubt was of the proper stuff to turn into a man obsessed but in the meantime she shook her head she was famished and not for mortal food she had not drained anyone since that street urchin and he had been relatively unsatisfactory there had not been a great deal of life in him it had gotten beaten and starved out of him by the streets there were two kinds of people that provided her with a satisfactory repast first and foremost were those rich old men who were fat with abundant living and experiences all those memories all the things they had accomplishedit was like a multicourse meal created by the finest of chefs and then there were the young men full of passion dreams hopes and desires everything about them was sharp new flavored with high emotion she could not have said which were her favorites but tonight on such short notice it would be much much easier to find a young man she summoned her manservant tonight she would be taking another long walk the show was coming together in fact it had progressed far enough that the entire score was complete and arthur was rehearsing the orchestra in their parts maestro ciccolini and ninette had finished their choreography and ninette was rehearsing her numbers as well as dancing in the evening at first ninette had been worried that her act would get stalemusic hall audiences were used to seeing a different bill every week after all but nigel assured her that blackpool at least in holiday season was very different the audience changed every week so to them the revue was entirely new and he was right ninettes admirers had gone from a handful to a young army none of them were what she was looking for but then she was no longer looking very hard it seemed that the more she danced and the more audience acclaim she had the more she craved the applause it was no longer thinkable that if she ever did find a protector she would give up dancing she might have felt alarm at this except that she came off the stage every night feeling invigorated rather than drained not that any of the gentlemen who filled her dressing room with flowers were the sort to offer the kind of arrangement that suited her still some pleasant things came from all these admirers not just flowers which were delightful and kept her flat scented sweetlythere were some more permanent presents nothing spectacular nothing so enormously expensive that accepting it would have implied certain expectations that would have to be fulfilled no these were pretty but more modest tokens a pair of garnet and tortoiseshell combs a handsome set of enameled gold necklace bracelet and earrings in the egyptian style any number of less remarkable pieces of jewelry pairs of gloves fans lace handkerchiefsall tokens of esteem mute pleas for preference but not demands for attention the one time a rather remarkable sapphire bracelet had appeared on her dressing table it had been very firmly given back to the one who had proffered it there were also many pleasant suppers and a few partiesall of them in the company of other members of the company of course usually nigel came along in fact and if she was not the first to leave these affairs she was certainly never the last certain members of the circle of admirers remained men who lived and worked in blackpool others appeared only to vanish those who were not residents the two sorts were easy to tell apart and ninette and ailse had a little game between them of how long it would take for these birdsofpassage to understand that money could not necessarily purchase everything their hearts desired she wasnt worried the one and only time a gentleman had gotten a little too demanding shed broken his instep for him ballet dancers might look fragile but dancing built muscles he had been the exception though and she had felt so little threatened at the time that she did not even bother to tell nigel and have him barred from the theater in the first place his broken foot was going to keep him safely confined to his hotel until it was time for him to depart back to whatever grim industrial town had spawned him for another he had learned his lesson rather sharply no need to get nigel involved but thomas the cat was not happy and neither was the magician jonathon hightower but thomas was someone she could actually talk to the magician would only look annoyed sullen or angry and tell her to leave the magical business in his hands what on earth is wrong she finally asked the cat after his prowling and peering out of windows on what should have been a quiet evening finally got on her nerves we had a delightful supper the house was almost full tomorrow the theater is dark and we have that dinner partyand i have not seen a sign of this inimical invisible enemy you think i have she didnt add an enemy that you made up in the first place because ailse was in the room but her brief glare at thomas said it for her but the cat had other ideas there is something out there and it is no friend to you i just cannot figure out who or what it is nor what it wants she blinked a little in surprise so this wasnt part of his elaborate ruse i cant imagine why she began thats the problem neither can i he sighed gustily i suppose i will have to investigate this jonathon she frowned i would not take anything master hightower says to be an indication of anything at all other than his overactive imagination he sees a bit of rope and sees a serpent a shadow and thinks it is a spirit he has reasons to sometimes a rope is a serpent in disguise she flung up her hands have it your own way then is there any reason why this mysterious something you both sense must be planning on me as its victim what about nigel arthur wolf you even jonathon all of you are far more likely to have collected magical enemies than i the cat hesitated i suppose that is possible i would say it was far more likely she sniffed the only enemy i am likely to have would be the sort that would put ground glass in the toes of my shoes or cut the shoulderstraps of my costumes she surprised herself with a yawn i am going to bed you may stay up and watch all night if you please hmm was all thomas would say after a great deal of thought and a great many discarded plans nina decided to attack obliquely by attacking not the girl herself but the theater if the physical building was gone she would have no place to perform if she had no place to perform she would be cast out on her own without a salary and be easier to get at at this point nina had decided that she would absorb the girl not just out of revenge but because it could be useful to have a second identity ready and waiting to step into which provided such fruitful rewards for her kind so that was her plan attack the theater destroy it and flush the quarry as for how that was to be done although fire obviously was not ninas element fire was the easiest and that was what she would try first jonathon hightower watched the salamander twine around the fingers of his left hand and frowned strictly speaking elementals could not see the future not as a human clairvoyant could at any rate but they could sense when something was going to happen a short time before it actually did and they reacted to that this one was agitated very agitated enough to make it come to jonathon without being invoked which was something fire elementals rarely did all he could discern from it was the sense of danger danger and destruction coming soon wait no he sensed something more the danger had to do with fire fire was always a theatrical nightmare everything about a theater was a fire hazard the scenery made of canvas painted with oils the curtains the dry wood it was worse in the days of limelight and gaslight of course there were terrible stories of performers getting too close to the lights and going up in flames that was why there were buckets of sand and sometimes water tucked unobtrusively away everywhere in the wings finally the salamander grew frantic and he decided he was going to take a walk his present lodgings were in fact the guest bedroom that the dancer had just vacated nigel saw no reason for him to take his own lodgings and every reason why he should not here among nigels trained servants accustomed to mages and magic he could do whatever he chose to do and not so much as a raised eyebrow would occur outside of these walls however was a land of nosy landladies curious fellow tenants and a wealth of horror stories about what had happened when an ordinary person stumbled into someone working magic and truth to tell for all his apparent misanthropy jonathon liked the company of others well enough if his companions were intelligent one certainly couldnt fault nigel arthur or even wolf on that score besides this saved him money power as a mage did not translate into wealth and not every or even most elemental masters were independently wealthy nigel had made his fortune honestly by gauging the publics tastes and meeting them but he was no more the norm among elemental masters than he was among ordinary folk jonathon had chosen a path that would probably never make him rich although if he was careful he could retire comfortably one day so living off nigel did not bother him one whit since it meant that much more of his salary could be tucked away towards that end staying here had other advantagesone of which was that he could stroll out of the flat at two in the morning without making an excuse to anyone and know that no one would be poking a nose out to find out where he was going more to the point he could return when he pleased and not have to answer to anyone nor face being locked out so off he went after choosing an inconspicuous coat and old cloth cap to wear in order to blend in with the locals the salamander vanished leaving a sense of relief in its wake as it did so whatever he was doing must have been right the streets were dark and quiet even here in the theater district they were however very well litit was bad for business if your customers fell and broke a limb on the way to the theater and worse for them to be the victim of a cutpurse or felon for once there was no rain at this time of night one of the most important things to do was to walk briskly and with purpose so that any policeman that spotted him would be certain that he was a man with a duty and a destination and would not hinder him he passed by two such on his way to the theater and only when he reached it did he pause slow down and drop into the shadows and chided himself for such a melodramatic action still he slipped around the side of the theater and paused still staying concealed in the shadows as he stood with his back against the wall considering what could and could not be seen trying to become invisible once he had regulated his breathing again he listened and that was when he heard it the unmistakable sound of someone striking a match in the darkness of the alley carefully slowly with his hand shielded by his arm and the breast of his coat he called up a tiny flame in the palm of his hand show me what you see he breathed the simple words calling up a spell of as much intricacy as a piece of fine lace he stared into the flame willing it to show what that fire struck in the alley was surrounded by as if reflected in a mirror he saw a shabby boy cap pulled down over his forehead he was striking a match the flame that jonathon was looking through was some little distance away a tiny fire of the spent sticks of the matches piled there the boy set fire to something something likea tail that was it he was lighting a bundle of straw and lint that was tied to a rats tail as the rat squealed in fear he opened the door to the cage and it dashed out and into the ally jonathon in his turn leaped around the corner only to see the bobbing ball of fire that was just out of reach duck down a grating into the sewer you he shouted you there the wrong thing of course though it had been a calculated riskwould the boy freeze in place or try to run he ran and he knew these streets better than jonathon within moments he was gone and jonathon was left staring into the darkness that had swallowed him up dammit had that been the only rat the urchin had turned loose he dared not take that chance he dashed back to where he had seen the boy crouched and to his dismay found a dozen empty wooden livetrapsit had been a livetrap that he had mistaken for a cage in a moment of rage he kicked them scattering them across the alley splintering several but temper was not going to fix what had been done he was going to have to work quickly there were an unknown number of rats scrambling about this area trailing fire behind them rats that could get into anywhere but most especially between walls and under floorboards quickly he summoned a circle of protection about himself it glowed on the slimy cobblestones of the alley with the deep redorange of coals in the heart of the fire once there he had his own little mantra for summoningwhere nigel used music he drew with a wand of fire pulled out of the element itself he drew in the air around himself sigils and symbols in what would look to an outsider like a hopeless jumble but which were in fact precisely placed they glowed yellowhot hanging in midair around him the boy had turned loose a dozen rats not less possibly more for good measure he scribed the desire for two dozen salamanders on the wall of air around him with a push of his power he set the final sigil then he sent his wand back to where it had come from opened his arms and called the symbols around him flared blurred pulsed with the power he gave them and then vanished in a blinding flash and jonathon swarmed with salamanders they danced all over him wreathing around his arms threading in and out of his jacket as he explained to them what they needed to do a boy was here he told them and showed them with his thoughts he set rats loose with fire tied to their tails i dont know where they all went you have to find them he got their answer more in impressions than words agreement fire that was what they were of course they could find the rats all of them of course that went without saying and then what you must follow and eat every bit of fire they leave behind them then when you find them you must eat the fire tied to their tails glee they were not often permitted to devour realworld fire this would be like candy to them but he did not expect them to eat the rats did he no that is not necessary but go those rats could be setting anything on fire agreement and then they were gone they flashed in a dozen different directions at once leaving him standing alone in the alley lit only by the light from his circle of protection wearily he dismissed it the salamanders had been alert and focused there were times when he had trouble with them but this evidently was not going to be one of those times they did naturally what he would have had to do magically and at greater physical expense they were tracking the rats by the scent of fire and their noses were better than a bloodhounds he knew he could leave them here to do their work when they were done they would simply go back to the elemental plane of fire sated and happy they had been paid twice once in the magical energy he had given them and once in the feeding they would have he wanted to lean against the wall in fatigue but it was cold and damp and very dark here and none of those conditions agreed well with a fire master instead he trudged back to nigels flat he knew the others were sound asleep by now and with the crisis averted he reckoned that morning would be soon enough for them to hear what had almost happened nina tore the vagrant she had found in the gutter limb from limb in her rage then sent the pieces off with her goblins to be dropped into the sewers all over the city and then she went back to her hotel climbed up the wall and in through the open window and shed her bloodstained clothing she set the maid to cleaning up the mess while she flung herself down into her bed and brooded what wretched luck that there was a fire master associated with the theater she wondered what had brought him there tonight was it only restlessness and an urge to walk or had he somehow been warned of what she was doing she was just glad she had been trying something without the taint of magic to it this trick had come out of the annals of ancient siegessending animals into a city or an armory to set it afire rats were the favored vehicle for thissmall and agile they could carry the fire into the heart of the building and she had paid the ratcatcher who served the building specifically for these rats and no others terrified in pain they would run to the place they thought of as home dash through their secret ways in a futile effort to lose the thing that was hurting them the fire tied to their tails it had been a good plan too bad the fire master had shown up to ruin it but she at least had gotten away and he had no idea she was anything other than a mad little street urchin with a penchant for setting fires one good thing had come out of this now she knew the face of the possible opposition or part of it anyway she would have to be cunning careful she settled herself in her bed and began to think he what nigel spluttered he was tying bundles to the rats tails setting them on fire and jonathon paused and turning them loose that is an ancient siege trick wolf said unexpectedly jonathon did not ask the bird how he knew that wolf was always coming up with unexpected bits of information well what are you waiting for nigel asked regarding him angrily is it nina is this someone attempting to attack her is this what we should be looking for and now jonathon had to hesitate i dont know he said finally there wasnt anything at all magical about what was going on it was just a streetboy and it wasnt as if he was actually trying to start fires that i could make outmore that he was just tormenting the rats for the fun of it but arthur asked watching him closely but i dont like it if ninas enemy is clever he could have paid the boy to do this there would be no telling that it was the work of a mage he got up all his interest in breakfast gone i just dont know it seems almost diabolically clever but the stormthat is the work of someone who just doesnt think and yet all right jonathon arthur said finally what we can do is to be on our guard the fact that your salamander came to you before we had a burning theater means that they seem to have rapport with you we can probably count on he nodded that was reasonable in that case we should assume it was the work of ninas enemy and that shes been discovered he replied whoever this is hes very subtle so we should assume spies attempts to lure her out somewhere alone and indirect attempts like on the theater humph nigel put his fork down and frowned i wonder if it is ninas enemy what hell come up with next clearly we have to think in terms of things that are not magical jonathon pointed out whoever this may be knows very well that there are masters here and he is not going to make it easy for us to find him or stop him all three of the others wolf included nodded we must think like a saboteur or an assassin arthur murmured and not just that jonathon replied grimly we must think like a clever one nina still thought that burning down the theater was the best plan the question was how to do so without showing her magical nature her second attempt was more straightforward in execution but devious in planning taking on the look of one of the ruffians she had absorbed she went in search of the sort of pub where unsavory deals could be made then once she found such a pub she let it be known that her employer had a building she wanted removed from the property it was on it was not long before she was sharing drinks with someone who thought that might be arranged he was a little surprised to discover the building in question but it was just a brief flash and then he was all business nina was relieved to discover that he did not want to know why the theater needed to be burned she did not offer said explanation she merely paid him what he asked and settled back in her suite to await the results but the results were disappointing there was no fire on the stipulated date and the next day the sensation of the morning paper was that a known arsonist had been caught redhanded and he was expected to be spending the rest of his life in prison credit for the discovery was given to a young police constable but nina cursed knowing in her heart it must have been that wretched fire master she made one more attempt but her heart wasnt in it like the first try she used an animal to try and carry fire into the building this time it was the starlings that nested in the top she gave them matches and twists of oiled paper which they carried up to the roof and tucked into their nests she intended to do just a tiny bit of magic to ignite the matches themselves that failed as the first had one of the wretched birds dropped its burden on a passerby and the next thing nina knew the building was being scoured and the poor starlings lost all the nests they had started she also looked for ways to lure the imposter out away from anyone else if she ever managed that the result would be that the imposter would be absorbed and nina would change into her clothing and take her place at least for a little bitjust long enough to have a great row with the theater owner and flounce out but the girl wouldnt accept invitations of that sort no i have something that might be to your advantage no supper invitations from handsome young men nonothing in fact the girl led a life so cloistered that it gave nina pause not the worknina herself did the work of a dancer and a good one toobut the sacrifice that was unprecedented no little téteatéte dinner parties with select gentlemen no afternoons off for a picnic no afternoons off shopping that was what truly astonished nina every other dancer she had ever known was an inveterate shopper it was a pity too since shopping would have been the ideal way to take her become a helpful shop girl suggest there were better things in a back room take her thereand become her no one the wiser there would be a complication of course because it was possible that she might just decide to stay here that impresario in germany she could cancel the appearances but then she would have to eliminate him too or return his money if she didnt he would probably sue for breach of contract all right it was time to play to her strong suit use her own element ninette limbered herself backstage at afternoon rehearsal she had taken the ball hoop and ribbon dances out and had put in two pure ballet solos both had she been asked were blatant copies of two of anna pavlovas danceswaterlily was a copy of her california poppy complete with bringing the petals of her skirt up around her at the finale when the stage went dark and fairy which was a copy of pavlovas dragonfly but anna pavlova was far away and unlikely to ever get to blackpool and people were actually coming to blackpool for their holidays to see her of course most of that was due to her miraculous rescue that spring but still those dances are rather good jonathon said from behind her she shrugged and bent over to touch her forehead to her knees and hold the position for a moment i copied them from pavlova she said frankly i know came the surprising reply i saw california poppy and dragonfly in monte carlo she straightened so fast she almost hurt herself what and you said nothing to nigel it was his turn to shrug he wouldnt care i know i dont a dance isnt like a magic trick i dont think you can ever say thats mine once youve done it in public i suppose so she said dubiously she hesitated but anything she was going to tell him was lost as the trained dog act suddenly saw thomas and idiotically forgot all of their tricks thomas headed straight for the dressing room with the pack in full cry behind him and the frantic trainer right behind them ninette let them all runshe knew very well that thomas was more than a match for a hundred dogsbut jonathon swore and raced after them all perhaps he was concerned for the dogs but that was the moment when things began to thaw between them ninette was keeping her muscles warm in the wings when the female half of the dogtraining act dashed up to her face white have you seen nigel she asked breathlessly ninette stared at her perplexed and alarmed all at once and pointed to stage left where nigels sleeve was just barely visible behind a piece of scenery the dog trainerninette strained to remember her name since the act went by the name of harrigans amazing houndsrushed across the stage in a blatant violation of all the rules of performance thou shalt not cross the stage during someone elses act in rehearsaldress rehearsal of course not bandcall the act she ran through was thank heavens that of the charactercomic who was a goodnatured old fellow even if he did partake of the bottle a bit more than he should have he kept right on like a trouper even as the female trainer seized nigelliterallyand began an urgent speech that started off quietly but very very rapidly ascended into the hysterical she spoke too rapidly for ninette to understand her given that for ninette english was still very hard to comprehend unless people spoke in a leisurely manner she got a few words here and thereaccident and broken legs she rushed back across the stage again her agitation visible her eyes seeing nothing but the way out ninette kept warming up no matter what the show went on it always went on only the death of a monarch would close down a show but in just exactly the time it took for someone to cross from stage left to stage right through the backstage area nigel appeared at her elbow harrigan somehow fell into a hole in the street and broke both legs he said grimly i hate to ask you to i will put back the ball ribbon and ring dances she said instantly it was not as if they were great effort to perform not like the black swan pasdedeux not like giselles mad scene not like the corsair solos they were in fact full of little pauses rests where she could catch her breath before going on to the next difficult passage and they were done on demipointe rather than full pointe she would have to change her shoes but that was no great difficulty and if worst came to worst and the ribbons wouldnt unknot she could cut them off and ailse could put new ribbons on while she danced en pointe nigel nodded with relief and gratitude ill be in my office i should have a replacement act by tomorrow she shrugged so long as the audience is not bored with me i can dance the extra solos for as long as you need me to he just said something that sounded like youre a brick and dashed off to his office she was left shaking her head it was going to be a long and strenuous night she went looking for her ball ring and ribbon music at least the band knew it and at least the hole she would be filling was in the middle of the bill shed be well rested by the time her skirt dance came up by band call the third day after harrigan broke his legs if nigel had been any other impresario he would have been tearing his hair out because by that time it was beginning to look as if the fates had targeted him for disaster this was a very desirable venue for most performers a sixweek engagement at minimum meant it was possible to relax unpack mend things take in the local sights it was after all the audience that changed during the season in blackpool virtually a new audience twice a week nigel usually had far more acts auditioning than he had slots for them but now first harrigan who had fallen into a hole that his wife swore literally opened up in front of them and broken both his legs it was a good thing for both of them that nigel knew a doctor who was also an elemental magician though not a master he did not care to think of what a butchers job an ordinary doctor would make of such a patient so harrigan was now splinted and resting comfortably surrounded by wife and dogs a stones throw from the doctors office nigel was keeping him on wages partly because it seemed the right thing to do and partly because he wanted the hounds for the big show and when harrigan was well again he would certainly feel a debt of gratitude to nigel but the next day brought another unpleasant surprise three of the acts just quit with four more weeks to run on their contracts they wouldnt tell him why nor would their agents but he suspected that a rumored australian impresario with a supposed golden tour was to blame on the one hand he viciously wished all of them to perdition on the other he knew how most of these things turned outwith performers stranded in the middle of nowhere with no money and no prospects of getting any sick with heat and tropical disease and bitterly regretting the decision that had brought them to that pass he had already made up his mind that he was not going to ask these acts to stick for the big show but still he needed them now he was not going to ask nina to put in another turn and anyway she could hardly make up for half the show missing as it happened though nigel was the rare sort who always assumed some disaster was going to overtake his shows his theater or the season and planned accordingly he regularly made forays into the countryside and as far as liverpool looking for people with talent who had not yet caught on two fast trips in his motorcar yielded him a perky little singer with a genuine gift for comic timing and a novelty juggler and his partner a fellow who impersonated a drunken toff with an impertinent maid who kept piling things into his arms when he came home after a night on the tiles he rushed them to the theater in time for a quick rehearsal to fill the last slot jonathon put in an act he seldom performed anymore a hindoo fireeater it was all real magic of course and as such it was something of a risk if there was an untrained elemental mage in the audience jonathons performance might wake him up and there were those who hunted masters as well though usually feuds were of a personal nature jonathon however swore that there were precautions he could take shields he could set up nigel was disposed to believe him but he wanted the act safely tucked away as soon as possible he simply did not want to take any chances when there might be someone hunting for ninawhy give a hunter an opening for an attack so a morning on the phone and running back and forth from the telegraph office to london netted him a brother and sister minstrel act from america the idea of a woman in blackface playing a banjo and tap dancing seemed to have put some booking agents off but on the basis of an enthusiastic report from one of his scouts which he trusted he pursued the lead he learned they were starving in london he engaged them on the spot and arranged for the agent to advance them money so that they could buy train tickets to blackpool all three of the new acts were enthusiastic and terribly grateful for the opportunity to play in one of the big halls all of the acts were solid if not brilliant by the weekend the programme was full again and jonathon and nina were able to drop their extra turns and not a moment too soon it was clear that the extra work had just begun to wear on them nigel watched the two of them from the wings as they ran smoothly through the evil magician turn feeling unspeakably grateful that they had both come through without a murmur of complaint no matter what else could be said about this russian girl there was no doubt in his mind that she was willing to work and work hard she was an imitator rather than an original but no one on holiday in blackpool and spending time in a music hall was likely to have seen the originals and the girl gave you a good show for your money who did it harm that she borrowed loie fullers serpentine skirt dance without a blush of shame how did it matter than she turned pavlovas california poppy into her own waterlily was pavlova losing money by it had pavlova ever even heard of blackpool would fuller ever set foot in this city since the answer to all of these questions was no nigel didnt see that anyone could have any quarrel with the girl in fact he thought she ought to be commended she was probably the first ballet dancer most of these people had ever seen and having seen the holidaymakers might choose to have a lookin on a real ballet corps who could tell they might even become regulars at the theater it wasnt as if she was claiming to be pavlova after all in the theater nothing was new and the only people that ever successfully kept the secrets of how they did things were magicians he watched her with the eye of a critic rather than a showman as she went through her paces in jonathons act she was certainly graceful but that went with being a dancer she wasnt much of an actress but then she wouldnt have studied acting nigel didnt know much about ballet but he had the vague notion that the dancers were far too busy keeping track of their steps to do much acting she didnt have to be much of an actress anyway the audience for music halls was not one for subtle nuances they liked showy tricks melodrama they wanted to be thrilled and amazed they wanted to laugh and be dazzled the divine sarah and eleanor duse had no place in the music hall little tich however dancing in boots that were as long as he was tall that was what they wanted he continued to watch she was good the audience liked her part of that was her youth part her apparent fragility part the romance of her rescue these several weeks ago she connected with the audience too she had an instinct for that performers had been a success on that alone one thing he didnt get from her was that spark that something special that he felt from people that really were geniuses he was hardly an ignoramus he made a point of going to london when he could to see what the world considered great and there was a magic a special something in those for whom the stage was a kind of home that the rest of theatrical humanity just did not possess ellen terry henry irving they had it and the audience reveled in seeing it displayed hed gone to ballets as well as the theater he had seen nijinsky pavlova and isadora duncan too they had it they had it and made the stage sing beneath their feet eleanor duse the divine sarah dear god she had it she could make you believe she was anything she chose to be and you would completely forget that she was not fourteen years old as she spoke tremulously from her balcony to romeo that she was not the courtesan marguerite gautier and dying of consumption that she was not even a woman as she donned the breeches of hamlet nina tchereslavsky did not have that gift she had another a gift for evoking emotion and for giving it back and she was good she would never be immortal on the other hand the people who had that spark often didnt do well in life it was almost as if having been granted this enormous gift the fates decided that you had to make up for it in other ways those who had it seldom prospered in love those who had it often drank to excess or dosed themselves with morphia or hashish or some other drug those that had it knew that their gift was a jealous mistress and would tolerate no others besides the people that came to music halls didnt want to see genius genius wasnt comfortable it didnt actually care about what an audience wanted genius didnt set out to entertain you if you were entertained by genius that was incidental genius burned and if you werent careful you burned with it genius didnt want you to forget your troubles make you laugh make you gasp genius wanted to take your troubles and make art out of them which was all very well but made it cursed uncomfortable to live around genius no for his purposes he didnt want genius he didnt want art and he certainly didnt want artists he wanted entertainers he wanted people who lived for the sound of applause and would turn themselves inside out to get it people like that tended to be troupers and when something bad happened they pulled together to make sure the show went on genius regarded an audience as a sometimesinconvenient thing that insisted it should be the judge of what it was shown genius only wanted to show the audience something that would make it go away and try very hard to think of course people who lived for audience approval could be trouble too craving that approval to the exclusion of everything else making a dreadful pother about themselves offstage and hogging the limelight when on in fact there didnt ever really seem to be an offstage for them they played to the people around them as if they were always in front of an audience in their own way they were going to always be lonely for there was no room in that place for anyone who was not audience but after all this time nigel was fairly good at recognizing that sort and he generally did not extend their contracts unless there was absolutely no helping it he knew jonathon jonathon craved that applause but was far too cynical about it to recognize it for anything other than what it wasthe momentary pleasure and approval of people who were prepared to like you so long as you werent appallingly bad jonathon enjoyed tricking themin the sense that he was at least once in his act performing real magic right in front of their noses and nina seemed to be level headed about it as well he was happy to see how much she desired that shortlived accolade though because it meant he wasnt going to lose her to one of those fellows who thronged her dressing room after the show that was always a worry with a pretty young girl a solo act after a while they got tired of moving from town to town never staying longer than six weeks in any one place they wanted to settle and he didnt blame them and if one of those fellows with their motorcars and champagne and jewelry offered to take her off the boards and set her up in a neat little nest with all the modern conveniences and all well you couldnt blame a girl for taking them up on it that was what the brilliant thing was from a players point of view about this scheme of his it was going to be exactly like one of those ballet or opera companies the players would stay it would be the production that changed everyone would get to have a home rather than lodgings people could stop living out of a suitcase could acquire things like furniture and dishes could sleep in a bed they could truly say was their own at night and then there was jonathon nigel smiled a little watching the magician once again flawlessly execute the finale of his act the part other magicians called the prestige jonathon did have that spark but it was not for stage magic sometimes nigel wondered if he knew his friend better than jonathon knew himself perhaps he did jonathon hightower unlike nina tchereslavsky did not live to hear the audience applaud for him in a way the audience was irrelevant he didnt want to amaze them he often remarked sarcastically how very easy it was to amaze them he was thoroughly devoted to seeing that they did not leave unsatisfied at the end of his act but after that he really didnt much care he said he was more interested in astonishing his fellow magicians but that was not it either nigel had been watching him for many years now and the conclusion he had come to was one that would probably shock jonathon jonathon was not a showman jonathon performed stage magic only so that he could make a living at a profession that permitted him to be what he was without having to answer too many questions if he could have done the same thing by being a farrier or an automobile mechanic he would have done so provided hed had the aptitude for either of those things he needed the sort of profession and living space where odd things could happen without anyone taking notice granted most people could not see the elementalsbut they could certainly see the effects of the elementals rains of fish and frogs crops flattened in patterns weird lights in the skytoo many of these occurrences and people started to talk accidents happened but when you were supposed to be an ordinary fellow a clerk or a carpenter fingers were much more likely to be pointed in your direction than if you were rich if you lived in the sort of place where everybody knew everybody elses business no stage magic was for jonathon only the means to an end what jonathon really waswas an elemental master nigel had seen it when jonathon talked about elemental magic about things he had learned about the creatures of fire of the things he had seen the spark had been there and no doubt about it other stage magicians that nigel had known over the years had been passionate about the tricks they invented but not jonathon he was careful and craftsmanlike about mastering the tricks he had purchased and he clearly enjoyed the acting part of his turn but it was only when he spoke of how he was integrating fire magic into things in a way that made it appear to be more stage effects that he really lit up with enthusiasm he had been born to wield the power to study the power to learn more about it but nigel very much doubted that his friend had figured this out for himself yet then again he hadnt had the leisure or the space to do any proper work with his power the designation of mage or master had to do with the amount of innate power and control you had not how well you had learned how to wield it in many ways arthur who was only a mage had more mastery over his element than jonathon had arthur had other things too for he was a sensitive as well as a mage and the need to control the one had brought discipline to the other but jonathon had been itinerant for almost as long as nigel had known him they had first met when nigel had been the proprietor of a much smaller music hall a place that was mostly intended for drinking with a nod to entertainment and a water master out in lancashire county had suggested he give the young stage magician a trial it was very hard setting up proper spellcasting when you were in lodgings and you could be interrupted at any moment by a landlord who wanted to know what all the funny sounds and lights were about and that was just for the magics that you could be taught or learn on your ownresearching new elemental spells took a deal more time space and effort and a traveling showman rarely had a lot of any of those of course once the big show was on and jonathon realized he had settled in a place would he realize that it was possible for him to start in serious study of his powers and abilities right now in this building nigel had a flat that covered all of the first floor and arthur had one of the two that took up the second floor as he watched jonathon work and thought about the kind of house guest he had been it occurred to nigel that he would not be at all averse to having jonathon as a neighbor that would mean the first and second floors were all taken up by elemental mages all in the business of entertainment no one would make any inquiries about strange lights odd sounds or unexpected smells in fact no one would think twice about it oh its the music hall people would be the general consensus and the neighbors would go about their own business as for nina star performers had been made of lesser stuff than she was now nigel did not know a great deal about ballet but there was one thing he could tell nina connected with her audience she made them want to like her that was a rare gift ninetynine performers out of a hundred couldnt do it in fact nigel had come to suspect that those who were able to enchant an audience in that way might just have some talent of a psychical nature about them now once they got this business of who was after her settledand he was sure that they wouldthen there was just one thing to worry about with miss nina how to make it worth it to her to stay with the company instead of finding a rich man to care for her he would have to think about that there was this much the girl had a talking cat and she had witnessed magic real magic no one who understood that magic actually existed could ever look at the world in the same way again she needed to be around people who had seen the sorts of things that she had seen knew the sorts of things she knew that just might be enough to hold her add to that a nice flat of her very own the accoutrements of a star performer even if she was only the star of one music hall in blackpool for some that might be enough and nina did not strike him as being greedy he needed to put his mind to it he knew what jonathon needed and soon enough jonathon himself would come to realize this too now he had to figure out just what it was that nina needed watching these two work together he could see that he could set any number of shows based around them they didnt have to be fairy tales either or at least not ones with working magic in them already an idea was forming in his mind there were all those popular operettas based around minor royalty from tiny little european monarchies that no one had ever heard of running away to pretend to be peasants and falling in love the person in question was generally a prince but what if it was a princess a princess who just wants to dance on the stage who runs away because shes about to be married off to some other minor prince she has never even met gets a job with a musical theater falls in love with the stage magician yes and when her parents come to collect her the stage magician reveals himself as the prince she was supposed to marry who also ran away because he couldnt bear to be shackled to some girl he had never met yes that would be an excellent plot for their second production it wouldnt do to get too bound to fairy tales variety that was the way to go now he just needed to deduce what would keep nina happy and contented the genuine nina knew the signs people were starting to eye the mysterious russian with a bit less awe and a bit more suspicion this was taking longer than she had thought it would sabotaging the theater had not worked it was impossible to get at the girl directly none of the men that flocked to her dressing room came up to the mark for causing scandal well she needed to find a place to live a place where there would be room enough to work some real magic and where no one would be looking askance at the comings and goings into the night a few moments with the concierge elicited regrets that she was leaving and the name of a reliable agent within half a day the agent had found and taken her to view three suitable flats she rented the first one which came furnished more importantly it was on the ground floor and had a separate servants entrance which was not overlooked by any of the other flats in the building she could come and go whenever she liked without being seen it also included the cellar which meant her elemental slaves could come and go without needing recourse to any outside entrances she wrote the impresario in germany canceling her appearances and sent payment to him for the cancellations without a qualm this was war now and she was not going to lose nina had made a major mistake when she first arrived in blackpool and now she knew it she had assumed that her imposter was just an ordinary greedy little human being now she knew better the girl had a protector an elemental master a firemaster to be precise she still didnt know which of the men around the girl was the magician humans were infernally good at hiding their powers if one was bent on hiding them and most of the clever ones would never come out in the open if they could help it if a mage was of her own element she would certainly sense him in the powers when he actually worked magic but if he was not of her element he could be conjuring away at removing mountains and she would never know it if he was shielded and if he was shielded all the time shed not be able to tell him from an ordinary sort of human she had made a grave mistake choosing to attack the building as she had she had used creatures of her own elementthe rats were of earth of courseto be the carriers of disaster but it had been his element fire which would have been the actual cause some of these blasted humans were on good terms with their elemental creatures good enough terms that the benighted things acted as watchdogs and that must have been the case here there was absolutely no doubt what had put out the fires salamanders dozens of them and that could only mark the work of a master all right this meant that she couldnt go after the girl directly she would have to be very careful how she did it indirectly that meant working entirely in her own element it was unlikely there was another earth mage anywhere in this city earth mages felt acutely uncomfortable in places where the ground was paved over where there were filthy slums and tenements and where the air and ground were poisoned by the smokes and effluvia of humans living in such crowded conditions these conditions did not trouble nina in the least on the contrary these were the sorts of things that trolls thrived in so it was unlikely that there would be a mage of her own element to sense when she was working and it was very unlikely that the fire master would sense it either he couldnt know who or what she was or he would have tracked her down by now so long as she stayed within her own element it was safe to use magic so what to do well the obvious thing was to try to get at her with one of the most powerful weapons in ninas arsenal illness there were all manner of things that nina could strike her with and now that she had an establishment of her own from which to operate she could investigate which might make the best weapon the vehicle would be another question entirely nina was not going to trust this to one of her dimwitted underlings oh no nor to any old rat or mouse that she might trap nina was going to make a homunculus a bit of magic for which the earth magicians were unusually apt and she moreso than a human magician she needed no implements no herbs in fact nothing but a shielding circleand herself she called in her maid is the cellar prepared she asked with an edge to her voice she had told the creature to have the cellar made ready as soon as she took possession of the housebut had her servant done so they could be astonishingly thick it was the problem with the creatures of earth they often moved slowly and they were not very clever nina had been an exception even among the trolls who were the cleverest of the sorts of elementals that wise magicians did not call up but that was probably because of the number of humans she had absorbed over the years it was not just their forms that stayed with her it seemed that some of their intelligence remained as well but fortunately the maid nodded and nina felt a moment of satisfaction they were learning it seemed good it was about time waving the maid away she descended into the cellar alone she did not need a lantern nor indeed any light trolls could see in the dark as well as any cat the steep wooden stairs were no trouble to navigate once she rid herself of her clumsy and encumbering human garments and continued on in her shift what foolishness it was to wear such things humans were so stupid sometimes she felt the cool and the damp on her skin with a sense of great relief it was at times like these that she almost regretted giving up her existence in the underground world of the darker earth elementals and yet the life she had now was so rich so varied so luxurious she could not even contemplate giving it up when she thought about how simpleminded and dull her own servants were no she was never ever giving up this life the cellar was paved with stone which fortunately was all native to the area that made it ideal in every possible way the preparations that nina required were simple a protective double circle had been deeply inscribed into the stone with words in the ancient language of the earth masters etched between the inner and outer circles nina inspected these carefully until she was satisfied that they had been written perfectly that there were no flaws in the words nor breaks in the circles it was not that she was in any danger of course these circles were not to keep anything out her human body with its trollish powers was more than enough to take care of anything that might come at her across these circles no this was to keep her power in to keep from betraying her presence to that accursed fire master and any other meddlesome human mages that might be alerted the fire master shouldnt be able to sense earth power but she preferred not to take any chances and anyway all the elementals gossiped especially the bright powers let a faun or dryad get a scent of her presence and the next thing you knew a sylph would find out about it and from there it was a short step to the ears of those salamanders that danced attendance on him she had not gotten as far as she had by being careless she crossed the lines of the circle knelt in the center and with a touch called earth magic into the carvings slowly gradually they began to glow a smoky and sullen ochre with a whispered word she raised the power into a dome arching above her head invisible to mortal eyes though visible to hers the corresponding half of the dome penetrated deep into the stone and earth of the cellar floor now she was walled shielded protected from every prying sense she was invisible in here even her own servants would not be able to sense her she cupped her hands over her belly feeling the power rise in her now she concentrated with all her might for what she was about to do was the closest her kind ever came to giving birth and it was just as much work although the time of labor was considerably shorter she pulled her own substance out of herself and into her waiting hands panting and sweating as she robbed herself of her own flesh and gave it shape and life she groaned not with pain but with effort and when she was done there it was in her hands about the size of a newborn human baby a faceless smooth little thing like a doughman or a wax doll waiting patiently for her to give it purpose it was the same color as the earth hereabouts and it was cool to the touch with a faint dusting of grit over the surface of it she would have liked to lie down at that point for the effort had been greater than she remembered but she did not have that leisure if she did not give this thing its purpose it would start to merge with her again and this would all have been for nothing so she called up more power with another whispered word invoked the particular form of pestilence she wished to visit upon the girl and gave the creature her scent with every layer of magic the homunculus glowed a little more a dark and angry glow like cooling lava finally when she was done she set it down on the floor in front of her feeling weary to death as she never felt after mere physical exertion like dancing the homunculus stood there on its own nearly vibrating with the need to be off about its purpose she dismissed the magic in the protective circles and the homunculus did not waste a single moment it sank into the floor of the cellar as easily as if the stone had been water and in a moment it was gone not even another earth mage was likely to be able to detect it only another elemental could that was the beauty of this since it had once been part of her it became its own little independent creature not quite a troll but close enough it should raise no alarms among the other elemental creatures hereabouts finally after a long long rest on the stones slowly drawing in earth energy to replace what she had lost she got to her feet and pulled herself up the stairs if all went well within the week her imposter would be dead and she would then be free to decide whether or not to take her place there was something going on that no one was talking to her about ninette could tell by the way that arthur nigel and jonathon would look at her when they thought she wouldnt notice and it wasnt the we are suspicious of you look it was the we are really worried for you look that made her uneasy and it made her even more uneasy to think that whatever was going on probably had a great deal to do with magic she really didnt want to think about magic despite that there was a very helpful brownie living in her flat despite that jonathon was producing all manner of magicalthe real sort not legerdemaineffects on stage despite the fact that she was half friend and half slave to a talking cat she just would rather not think about magic at all rather than growing easier about it over time knowing about it knowing it was real actually had the effect of unnerving her further it was as if the solid and understandable world she knew was just a thin shell over something impossible and deadly something she could not see nor guard against all her childhood fears of nighthags coming through the windows and demons up through the floor could be real and what was more she had no way to protect herself against these creatures it was horrible every moment of it and so she thought about it as little as possible ailse astonished her the little scots maid was as practical and levelheaded as any parisian landlady and yet she not only accepted all of this she seemed to have no particular difficulty in doing so she put out a little food and drink for the brownie every night and pretended to ignore the shy little creature whenever it happened to get caught in the open although she said she could not hear thomas unless he spoke to her directly she spoke to him at all times as if to a human being and wolf whom she certainly did hear she flirted with in a sort of dry ironic manner the practical and levelheaded nature would seem to preclude any belief in magic and yet all this glancing and looking worried had begun about a week ago ninette finally got fed up with it it was making her more nervous than thinking about magic so she decided to accost the one person of everyone in the group that was likeliest to give her the truth ailse she said that night as the maid was combing out her hair why is everyone so on edge this past week and why do they keep looking at me the maid was silent for a good long time her hands kept moving automatically but looking in the mirror ninette could see a very thoughtful expression on her face well maamselle the girl said thoughtfully they wouldna like my tellin ye but ive been thinkin tis a sin and a shame to be keepin ye in the dark i knew it ninette said fiercely i knew there was something amiss well its that summon tried to burn down the theater dye ken and they be thinkin it has sommat t do with you ailse said reluctantly me ninettes mouth fell open with surprise and she turned and took the brush from the maids unresisting hands how could that have anything to do with me because maamselle theyre thinkin its all of a piece that you have a strong enemy a magicianwell not you but your papa thats gone the girl nodded theyre thinking that the wreck of your friends wee boat the laddie that tried to set fire to the theater and the accidents are all at the hand of this magician dye ken because theyre unnatural for certain sure theres thousands as wouldna believe that tale yon harrigan told of the hole in the street opening up under his feet but i do and mores the point so do master nigel and master jonathon ninette listened to this with astonishment not the least because nigel and jonathon were hanging their theory on a slender thread indeed that their entire chain of events began with a shipwreck that never really happened she bit her lip and was about to turn away from the maid feeling a terrible load of guilt when suddenly from the direction of the kitchen a commotion erupted that sounded like a cross between a catfight and a drunken brawl punctuated by the crash of crockery both young women hesitated a moment then ninette leapt up from her seat and ran for the door she stopped long enough to grab a poker from the fireplace tools and flung open the door of her bedroom it was easy to see the cause of the noise thomas and the brownie tumbled together on the floor tangled up with something else both of them fighting both of them screeching the brownie was shouting something incomprehensible while thomas sounded like a perfectly ordinary cat in a towering rage the thing they were fighting strangely made no noise at all ailse went straight for the kitchen as ninette stood by looking for an opening in which she could bash the thing with her poker she couldnt tell what it was it was a sickly muddyearth color and had four limbs and a head and that was all she could tell for sure but as she set eyes on it she felt a creeping horror absolute revulsion and her hands shook as she clutched the poker ailse came back with a big iron pot and a lid before ninette could ask what that was for she shouted stand aside cold iron and in a flash both the cat and the brownie freed themselves ninette who had been waiting for just that took the opportunity to bash it with her poker incredibly she connected with it even more incredibly she stunned it and while it was stunned ailse clapped the pot down on top of it then slid the lid underneath and flipped pot and creature back over ninette slid her poker through the pots two handles locking the lid down tight and a good thing she did so too for a moment later the creature recovered and the pot began gyrating as it tried to batter its way out ninette went quickly to the fireplace then put one of the firedogs on top of it just to be sure this stopped the pot from bounding but a furious hammering came from inside as the creature beat on the lid and sides the brownie stood there panting staring at the pot damme wha be that he asked the first time that ninette had ever heard him speak that thomas replied grimly is an homunculus and it means us no good i promise you dont on your lives let it out i am going to get nigel and jonathon limping slightly the cat leaped out of the window leaving the two young women and the brownie staring at one another well ninette said finally do you think we ought to put more heavy things on top of the pot im thinkin it wouldna hurt ailse said and went in search of something heavier than a firedog an hour later ninette sat on the bed in her room seething it was quite bad enough that nigel arthur jonathon and wolf had all come rushing up the stairs to her flat acting as if she and ailse didnt have the sense the lord gave a goose but it was worse that they all but shoved her maid and herself into this room and barred the door with a chair to keep them in ailse sat primly in the chair staring a hole in the door when she glanced over at ninette and saw that the dancer was looking at her she grimaced you are thinking ninette said and marveled a little at how firm her own grasp of english had become then she shivered that was magic again creeping into her life little by little making such tiny helpful changesuntil the moment when some shapeless thing some awful monster that was terrible all out of proportion to its size got into your own flat and and what why was it here preying on the brownie she didnt think so something told her it had come for her thomas had said it meant them no good and she could well believe it had it come on its own had it been sent if it had been sent who had sent it was this somehow tied to the person who had tried to set fire to the theater i am thinkin maamselle but tisna my place tsay ailse said with great reluctance she grimaced oh please do speak your mind i think it will be the twin of my own thoughts ailse looked at the door again men she said slowly and with great deliberation now an then they be as amighty as they think but tisna often ninette was surprised into a giggle and some of her nervousness ebbed what do you suppose they are doing out there ailse shrugged some mess of magic do ye ken and we shouldna see it on account of we have no magic of our own and were puir weak women besides we shouldna fash ourseles let the braw laddies handle it ninette nodded flushing forgetting who it was caught it in the first place aye ailse looked back at the door but nivver mind id be guessin well find oot soon enoo and at that moment something indescribable happened if you could have a soundless explosion that was the closest that ninette could come to the experience she felt the concussive impact of something out in her sitting room even though not even her handkerchief fluttered she felt as if she should have been driven back against the counterpane she was left feeling slightly disoriented exactly as if she had been struck by something and from the look of her ailse felt the same out in the sitting room jonathon began to curse ninette was feeling too dazed to react but ailse shook off her shock and jumped up out of the chair she had been sitting on she stalked straight to the door and pounded on it ye might as well let us oot she said fiercely yes yes all right arthur said sounding distractedor maybe just as dizzy as ninette felt im coming there was a scraping sound as the chair was pulled away from the door ailse opened it and held it open for her mistress ninette got up slowly afraid to find her pleasant little sitting room in ruins but in fact the sitting room was fundamentally intact except for the few things the brownie and thomas had broken in their struggles with the homunculus but there was a very nasty stench in the air and the iron pot was empty i would be rid of that if i were you jonathon said seeing that her eyes were resting on the container it wont be fit to use for anything for a long time perhaps never why ninette began because this thing was a pestilencebringer nigel replied wearily anything you cook in that pot for a while will make people sick ailse peered closely at him as if to ascertain whether he was joking or not twill still work as a trap for the uncanny noo ailse persisted i suppose it will nigel began good then were keepin it ailse said in triumph ill be puttin it somewhere safe but its no bad thing havin a trap for uncanny evil wee things what was it here for not what jonathon corrected who it was here for nina and i would very much like to know how she managed to attract the attention of so practiced an elemental mage her father the cat began bosh humbug jonathon interrupted this was a very personal enmity as you very well know cat you felt it we all did that thing was pestilence and hate and whoever created it did so for the purpose of being rid of mademoiselle tchereslavsky who sent it ninette whispered a feeling of terrible dread coming over her well that would be the problem arthur put in scratching his head with one hand while with the other he scratched wolfs it fair disintegrated when we tried to find out violently so that is why we would like to know mademoiselle just how you managed to make a personal enemy of so powerful a mage jonathon went on particularly as you have no magic yourself and profess that you do not much care for it helplessly nina looked at the cat the cat shook his head as if to say be quiet say nothing but ninette was tired of the subterfugeand she greatly feared that if it went on for much longer it would get in the way ofwelleverything i have been deceiving you she said with a sigh as the cat looked frantic and i am very sorry but i do not know why a powerful mage would want me dead because until a few weeks ago i knew nothing of mages and masters and elementals that is because i am not nina tchereslavsky prima ballerina with the imperial ballet i am ninette dupond coryphée of the paris opera ballet there it was out in the open and all of them but the cat stared at her with their jaws dropping the cat only groaned and dropped down to the floor to cover his face with his paws jonathon took a slow deep breath his brow like thunder but before he could say anything the cat spoke up dont shout at her magician it was all my idea and i took advantage of the fact that she was lightheaded from hunger to persuade her too the cat stalked up to jonathon and looked up at him tail lashing back and forth defiantly i stole money and tickets to get her here from paris i told her what to do i concocted the shipwreck story it was all my doing ninette looked into their eyes arthur licked his lips shes still a firstrate dancer he said hesitantly its not as if she cheated us that way wolf made a tsking sound people create fantastical stories about performers all the time to puff them up the parrot said thoughtfully they always have i expect you should have heard some of the ones about me jonathon still looked wrathful ninette stared down at her hands my mother was abandoned by her husband when i was a baby she said softly and began the tedious recitation of her misfortunes in a flat voice she only looked up once when nigel laughed on hearing la augustines reaction to her grave error in smiling at the primas patron it was not funny she said flatly i knew at that instant that it was the worst possible thing that could have happened it was not that la augustine was jealousshe did not care a sous for whether the old man really loved her or not it was that in that moment i threatened her livelihood i threatened to take away his interest and thus the flat the luxuries the jewels and furs and beautiful gowns of course she was in a rage she was not ready to give him up yet in fact i am not sure she was ready to give him up at all he was an ideal patron old unmarried and no relations closer than a cousin if he died he could leave her very comfortable and a dancer does not have a long life on the stage nigel sobered immediately she continued with her story of being cast out of the opera ballet of trying to find a position elsewhere of determining finally that she was going to go to the moulin rouge to find someone who would give her money she did not say for what purpose she did not need to she looked up again to see that all three men had looks of embarrassment and chagrin on their faces she thought many things and with them came a flare of anger men never had to face these choices a man could always find work if he looked hard enough a man had so many more choices than any woman oh you do not think of this when you take girls into your beds or into a room at a nottoocareful hotel you do not think of them as real persons who are doing this not because they want to be in your bed but because they must go there or starve you give them money and they go away and you never think of them again they are the amusement of an hour maybe maybe you ask for them look for them again but not too often for then they might start to make demands of you but they think of you they look at the money you give them and they wish that all the men would be kind would not beat them or try to cheat them they count the money and wonder how long it will last them or they count the money and cry because they must give it all to their procurer and then give themselves to another stranger who might not be kind you do not think of these things yet in your hearts you know them in your hearts but your minds shove them away so they will not be disturbed the cat took this moment to jump into the conversation which was just as well seeing as she was on verge of saying these things out loud when she was all alone hungry and facing being put on the street i knew i must intervene that was when i stepped in and i took advantage of her he then took up the narrative describing exactly how and from whom he had stolen purses and tickets telling how he had herded her onto the metro then the boattrain to calais onto the ferry then to the train to blackpool how he had found her the boarding house and how he had devised the little charade of the shipwreck when he paused she spread her hands wide and there you have it for everything else you know what happened except that i am ninette not nina ninette the cat interjected who convinced your new balletmaster that she could not benefit from lessons given by him and you know his credentials are impeccable ninette who has been dancing every night sometimes taking two turns more than anyone else to increasing acclaim ninette who convinced all of you by her talent to base an entire show around her ninette whose dressing room is thronged every evening by fans and wellwishers and full of flowers who charms the gentlemen of the press and the little girls who give her sticky nosegays of violets out of the corner of her eye ninette noticed jonathon frown a bit at that but the magician said nothing nigel ran his hand over his hair you have me there he said it isnt nina tchereslavsky that our audiences are coming to see they come to see the dancer theyve all heard about from other people whove seen her good heavens i doubt if one in a thousand has ever seen a real balletdancer before much less an entire ballet and they dont give a farthing about some rooskie wench who danced in front of people they openly make fun of like the french and the germans and the russians it might be different if we were the royal opera company but we arent arthur said firmly we dont have a royal circle we dont have titles and famous writers and famous painters in our audiences were nothing but entertainment for the masses we have bertie and mary from worcester we have sally and tommy from liverpool on holiday looking for a good time and getting it they see the dancer up there and they know someone whos good even if they dont know a jette from a plie and if we throw mademoiselle ninette out on her ear theyd be tearing the curtains down to hang us with them he looked from nigel to jonathon and back again i dont see we have a choice and i dont see where anyone is being harmed by this i say let the charade go on ninette isnt taking a shilling out of miss tchereslavskys paypacket and no one east of london is ever going to know theres two of them nigel grinned im glad to hear you say that old lad because i was going to propose the same thing but tell me he continued turning to ninette how did you learn to speak russian for that matter how did a poor little ballet girl from the bohemian parts of paris learn how to speak english oh that was my doing thomas the cat said smugly i just found a bannik in the bathhouse of one alexei balonovich that had come over with his master he and i struck a bargain and i got him to whisper russian in her mind while she slept you might be amazed at all the russians who live here russia is not an hospitable place if you arent a friend of the tsar and as for the english there are plenty of brownies in england to teach her english the same way jonathon looked at the cat sharply that isnt supposed to work unless youve got some magery in you well she has her father was an earth master that part is true enough and she has a touch of it enough for her to hear me enough for her to learn languages the cat looked slyly at all of them and enough to enchant an audience and dont tell me you havent seen her do it charm charisma its magic right enough opens up a connection between her and them its all there what they used to call the glamourie and thats all of the magic there is in her huh said arthur and wolf chortled nigel just shook his head this still doesnt tell us why theres an earth master trying to kill her jonathon said sharply were no closer to unraveling that particular riddle than we were before but at least you wont go barking up any russian trees the cat replied nor i advise you any parisian ones either la augustine may be a witch but shes not the sort with magic and so far as i know theres not a soul ninette ever came across that has a jot of magic in himor herother than me i wont say that she never made an enemy though i dont know of any but i do know that there was no one around her that i ever sensed that had magic enough to light a candle the men exchanged looks of resignation finally nigel shook his head im curious about one thing cat nigel said slowly why blackpool why notbath or birmingham or plymouth i can understand not wanting to try your trick in london where someone might have seen the real nina tchereslavsky and there are a lot of people there who know about the famous ballet dancers in the rest of the world but why come all the way up into the north you thomas said instantly how many impresarios are there that are also elemental masters i had to find someone who could hear me didnt i that was the only way to make the trick work impeccable logic wolf said and chortled again keep on like this and i might even start to like you cat jonathon scowled shall we have done with this lovefest he asked we need to find out who is behind these attacks and put a stop to them before someoneprobably our star danceris murdered ninette shivered at this timelyand unwelcomereminder she kept shivering though feeling very cold and rather empty inside the secret was out and now now she did not really know what she should do and there was still someone some terrible magician out there who wanted her dead ailse got up and fetched a shawl and put it around her shoulders there noo maamselle the maid said in her nononsense tone yeve got tdance tomorrow an theres naught going to happen more tonight ailse looked at nigel arthur and jonathon sternly you lads be off with ye worrit yer heads about it all ye like but not here maamselle ninette needs to sleep gad nigel shook his head youre right as rain ailse curse it all though if only we could concentrate on either the magic or the theater one or the other and not have to deal with both at the same time if wishes were horses beggars would ride ailse quoted primly go along with you ninette stopped shivering but immediately felt as if she could not keep her eyes open anymore perhaps it was the unreality of the situation despite how she had felt when she first clapped eyes on the horrid little monster she could not seem to think of it as menacing much less lifethreatening now there had been a strange littlethingin her sitting room it hadnt even been as big as the cat ailse had clapped a cooking put over ithow absurd was that so absurd no one would even write a ballet about it she yawned stifling it behind her hand and ailse pounced on her that will be enough of that the maid said firmly to bed wi ye and oot with yon gents a word with you jonathon ninette vaguely heard the cat say as ailse hustled her back into the bedroom ill walk you home for a moment she was moved to protestshe needed thomas here who else would protect her if another of those things put in an appearance but then she realized that if thomas wasnt worried then there probably was no need to worry at all she followed ailse meekly into the bedroom quite as if it was ailse who was the mistress here and she the obedient maid the cat had had mixed feelings watching the fire masters expressions change over the course of ninettes confession at first jonathon had been angry at ninettes deception that much was clear thomas could only assume he was angry because he had been tricked and not for any moral outrage ninette had only been doing what jonathon did every night on the stagetricking people into thinking that what was in front of them was something other than what it was then had come grudging acceptance as first arthur and then nigel had voiced their own opinions on the subject then interestingly when the mention of ninettes many admirers came up the cat had seen acute annoyance flash across jonathons face in fact it was akin to the annoyance that thomas himself felt fascinating of course if jonathon was attracted to the dancer he would do his best not to show it not because he had any ridiculous ideas about the moral inferiority of his fellow entertainers but because he would know how often disastrous flirtations within a theatrical company could be and jonathon from all that thomas knew about himwhich was a great deal more than jonathon was awarethought of himself as a confirmed bachelor nor did thomas himself particularly want jonathon attracted to ninette on the other hand if the choice was jonathonor one of those fellows that filled her dressing roomwell then the cat would fervently welcome jonathon all of them made their way to the ground floor and out the private entrance without encountering anyone else it appeared that despite the row that had gone on in ninettes sitting room the other tenants had remained blissfully unaware of any unpleasantness that was good because otherwise the ruckus would have been very difficult to explain when they stepped out into the cool damp dark summer night with the scent of wet brick and growing things on the air thomas took the opportunity to glare up at nigel arthur and that wretched bird and then he coughed politely arthur and nigel took the hint and swiftly outdistanced the two of them rapidly moving through the patches of light where the streetlamps stood until they turned a corner and moved out of sight thomas could feel jonathons eyes on him and sensed the frown well get on with it the fire master said impatiently what is it you wanted to tell me that you couldnt say in front of the others without waiting for an answer the fire master strode out in the footsteps of his friends largelymy motives said thomas reluctantly let us start with the question why blackpool the reason is simple really i know blackpool i am a native of this area that was how i knew that an air master was the impresario of this particular music hall since i came from this part of england i made it my business to keep track of the elemental masters here youwhat the cat felt a certain smug satisfaction he had managed to surprise the magician well there were more surprises to come for jonathon hightower the magician wasnt the only one who was good at keeping things up his metaphorical sleeve i said i know the city because i lived here about twenty years ago more or less what a surprise you hardly look a day over ten came jonathons sarcastic reply you are a remarkably well preserved cat the cat bristled the hair on his tail poofing out a little like uncle like nephew were all the hightower men born with acid wit or did they learn it from one another do not mock me jemmie hightower he snapped and keep a civil tongue in your head i knew your uncle and i knew you when you were still in nappies the magician stopped dead in his tracks and swiveled to look down at the cat his voice shook a little no onehas called me jemmiesince precisely why i used that name with you you surely dont think i am an ordinary cat well of course not youre a magical jonathon stopped and a dumbfounded look came over his face no magical construction could be half as clever as you most of them could never even think for themselves much less some up with the wild plans you have what are you i am a cat replied thomas primly you are as much a cat as i am a bartholomew faire conjurer i say again what are you the cat looked up and saw jonathons eyes narrow or is the right question not what but who thomas sat down on his haunches and wrapped his tail tightly around his legs you must swear never to tell ninette if you do i swear i will scratch your eyes out and pee in all your stage props warily jonathon nodded all right the cat sighed he hated letting these secrets go he had hoped to carry them to the grave i was as human as you are and no i am not reincarnated in cat form as wolf claims to have been i was an earth master and this is a permanent transformation i lost a magicians duel and my opponent froze me in the last shape i took not surprising really she was a truly vindictive and jealous wench and she never forgave me for running away from herand even less was she inclined to forgive me when she tracked me down and discovered i had married someone else he still remembered the look on helens face when he told her the furyit had been enough to make him take a step back at the time and if he had thought for a moment that he might be able to run away from her again that expression had utterly disabused him of the notion they say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned i am inclined to think they are right kipling also says that the female is more deadly than the male i am in a position to corroborate that he could almost see the thoughts running through jonathons head as the fire master ran through all of the earth masters in the last forty or so years he had ever heard of that came from hereaboutssorted out all the ones that had gone missing or that could not possibly have known his uncle or clapped eyes on himself as a babythen eliminated all those too young to be the one in question thomas recognized the moment when jonathon put all the clues together his jaw dropped thomas dupond the mage gasped incredulously the cat sighed the same but another clue floated to the surface and jonathon almost reeled butyou must be ninettes missing father now you know why i did what i did the cats tail lashed angrily i did not abandon my wife and child i was ambushed and they were threatened helen waring tracked me to paris sent a private detective to find me and confronted me literally no more than a block from my home she threatened to make life unendurable for marie and ninette and you know very well that she could have and would have and she would never have had to use a bit of magic to do so the only way i could distract her was to call her out in a magicians duel which as you must have deduced i lost but now we know who the magician that is trying to kill ninette is jonathon crowed thomas sighed you are leaping to far too many conclusions the cat told him no in this case you are quite wrong helen waring is not the earth master we are looking for why do you say that jonathon demanded because she is dead thomas said flatly silence for a moment how can you be sure jonathon asked after a pause because i killed her more silence then jonathon cleared his throat awkwardly ah how did that come about she intended to go through with her threat to torment my wife and child i expect she had some idea of capturing me as well but i got over the shock of finding myself permanently a cat a great deal faster than she had thought i would i crept into the hotel where she had rented a room that same night thomas told him reining in the anger and hatred that still lashed him whenever he thought of that cruel cruel woman how he despised her still had she been a man her evil nature would have been uncovered and dealt with long before it had come to this pass by her fellow elemental masters but since she was a woman they had laughed at what they called her folly and had never taken her seriously perhaps that was why she had obsessed over thomas he had taken her seriously he had known she was or at least one day would be a menace he had realized that she was dangerous to him when he had begun finding her creatures spying on him and she had money a very great deal of it being the only child of a shipping magnate who had left her his entire fortune while he was as poor as a churchmouse she had assumed she could buy him as she had bought everything else she wanted including the best of tutors in her magic it must have come as a tremendous shock to her when she discovered he had fled i waited for her at the top of the stairs he continued reliving that night and when she stepped out of her room and was not looking i ran between her ankles and tripped her it was a new hotel in the latest fashion they called art nouveau there were terrible stairs in that place very steep beautiful marble with sinuously curving iron railings and treacherous she broke her damned neck exactly as i intended she should i was glad i did it and i would do it again another long pause but you lost the chance to have the transformation reversed which she swore that she would never do thomas said bitterly in fact her last words to me as she sealed the spell were i hope you enjoy mice for you will be living on them from now on at a stroke she doomed my poor marie and ninette to starvation or worse and me to a miserable existence either running from her or as her captive my only regret is that she did not suffer as poor marie and ninette suffered i did what i could for them but i was limited by well real life i stole purses and left them where marie would find them but i had to be careful and i had to make sure it was nothing too generous nor too often marie herself would have started to question where they came from and if she started looking too prosperous the gendarmes would start to ask questions to which she would have no answers how well he remembered his horror when marie decided that ninette would have to become a courtesan and to see his lovely wife trading her favors among the artists for the sake of a few sausages it made him angry ashamed and vengeful all at the same time it still did isee jonathon said slowly i mean i do see id have felt the same in your place i hated it and marietrained ninette to think that she must find a rich protector i hate that even worse if that were possible thomas paused to get a grip on himself but ninette is a good dancer and i was sure she would be able to make her way without needing to find aprotector in fact i had planned to help her rise in the ranks as soon as there was an opportunity figaro praised her that is no small matter in paris and when she found herself ejected from the opera ballet i did not want her to find a rich protector elsewhere i still do not his mental voice turned fierce i want her to never need any such thing so i waited until she was desperate and dizzy enough with hunger that she would accept such a thing as a talking cat and set my plan in motion and you must never ever tell her who and what i am i gave you my word pledged jonathon and i give it again good now i think we must part i am going to serve as nightwatch and you must go and try to discover who it is that wants my child dead and with that thomas stood up flicked his tail twice and leapt off into the shadows jonathon hightower had had a fair number of unpleasant surprises in his life but this evening certainly should be posted near the top of the list first there was the arrival of the cat and his frantic call for help then the discovery of just what the young ladies had caught then ninettes confession ninette he had to admit the name suited her much better than nina and now this it was as implausible a tale as anything in a shilling novel about ragstoriches newsboys or american cowboys and savage rustlers yesterday he would have called such a story sheer lunacy but that was before now well it was the spare unembroidered way in which thomas had told his tale that made it the more plausible he had to admit that his blood had run a little cold when the cat had described so matteroffactly how he had murdered his tormentor but then again she deserved it he remembered stories his uncle and some of the other elemental masters in that circle shared over beer or brandies helen waring was not remembered with anything other than distasteand curses and the general opinion that it was to be hoped that she got what was coming to her not that anyone suspected she had been murdered she had just gone to the continent and rumors had returned that she had died but no one ever was quite sure about helen waring and for all anyone knew she could appear again without warning it would be a profound relief to some people in magical circles to learn that she really had gone on to whatever reward she had earned and he certainly didnt blame thomas for doing his best to keep his child from prostituting herself in thomass shoesor furhed have done the same from the tone of the cats mental voice it had been agony to watch marie training the girl for such a position knowing he could do nothing about it but then there was the deception he hated being lied to above all things he walked back to the flat in a sort of smoldering temper which was rather the worse for the fact that he could not really fault her very much for doing so it was not as if she had somehow cheated them she had worked damned hard for them all in fact it was not as if she didnt have talent for she certainly did in fact he had no real reason to be angry with her are you angry with her because she lied about her identity or because you just learned she has been raised to be a courtesan and she is unlikely to give up that plan he gritted his teeth well at least he had an ally in hating that idea the cat thomas was entirely of the same mind about that and neither of you will have anything left to fret about if you dont put your mind to discovering who it is that wants to be rid of her and why the logical part of his mind protested really you had better set your priorities he stopped then looked up and blinked in shock no wonder the pavement had felt somehow familiar he had gotten from where he left thomas all the way to the building that contained nigels flat without having any memory of the intervening space well said nigel over breakfast what are we going to do about this situation no one had to ask what situation since none of them had slept particularly well last night after many attempts to trace the homunculus back to its source both nigel and arthur had to admit defeat jonathon had not even tried fire he had said distinctly is not an element conducive to bloodhound work nigel had hoped that the air elementals might have a memory of the creatures passage but evidently it had not come out into the open until it reached the building that housed ninettes flat guards for one thing jonathon said slowly chewing a mouthful of toast wards for another since i am not sure we can rely on air elementals to remember they are supposed to guard her nigel groaned wards do you know how much that is going to attract attention to her we might as well set a beacon on the top of her building better yet why dont we simply just send invitations to every dark mage we know of and let them all appear at once oh come now nigel it isnt that bad wolf said leaning down over arthurs shoulder and helping himself to a generous bite of arthurs scone after all i wrote an entire opera that revealed i was an elemental master and look how long it took the dark ones to puzzle it out he held the bite in one claw and ate neatly as arthur gazed ruefully at the place where all the jam had been until wolf took it poor salieri he went quite mad after that convinced himself that he was the one that killed me wolfit was a disease homunculus that did you in wasnt it nigel cast the parrot a sharp glance i dont suppose it would be the same mage after all this time wolf made a sound like a snort i think not besides the creature was clearly after our dancer not me nigel sighed and went back to contemplating his kipper well nothing is simple is it we could set a trap wolf continued wiping his jamsticky beak on arthurs dressinggown much to the latters exasperation not anything that would actually catch the next creature that attacks her but something that would allow us to trace it back jonathon shook his head if we were the same power yes but for an unlike and an antagonist power it would take us years to work out how i would rather know why nigel said thoughtfully the girl seems so inoffensive it doesnt make any sense then it has to tie back to her father somehow jonathon pursed his lips i believe i will send some messages out via elemental to the other fire masters that might remember helen waring and dupond nigel you do the same perhaps if we can unravel the mystery from that end well be in a position to do something for ninette it might turn out to be someone that miss waring scorned wolf said with relish someone who blamed dupond for it that could be very useful actually so long as he isnt utterly mad we might be able to show him that rather than being jilted he had a narrow escape nigel rolled his eyes trust you to think of that it sounds like a plot for one of your operas speaking of which the parrot said brightly i have the plot for ninas next vehicle its very ruritanian and if we can manage it i think we can even get a swordfight into it its about a princess who is engaged to marry a prince shes never seen and only wants to be a dancer instead so she disguises herself as a maid and runs away to london where she becomes a sensation and i suppose that the prince she was supposed to marry only wants to become a stage magician jonathon drawled sarcastically not at all the prince has been going to university here sees her on the stage and not knowing who she is falls instantly for her and begins wooing her she doesnt know who he is she only knows hes a very rich student and is probably noble and doesnt take him very seriously at first wolf looked triumphant then we can have an evil cousin who has plans to usurp the throne and kidnaps the princess to use her as bait for the prince we can have a grand melee sword fight and end with a triumphant wedding scene when they all realize who they all are i think you have been reading too many sensational novels said jonathon dryly bosh lets just make the kidnapping an attempted kidnapping so we dont have to change the scene nigel looked up a light that jonathon very well recognized in his eyes jonathon sighed shall we concentrate on protecting our leading lady and get her first show on the stage before we think about her next one he asked exasperated nigel shook his head as if to clear it youre right so wards nina woke from her deathlike sleep with a groan destroying her homunculus before those cursed masters could trace it back here to her had been destroying a part of herself doing so had left her prostrated on the floor too weak to move and shed just held onto consciousness long enough to get her servants to pick her up and carry her to her bed she had saved herself at the cost of a great deal of power at least now she knew what all her enemies looked like as seen through the eyes of the homunculus there were two not one masters an air master and the fire master she already knew about there was an additional air magician the wretched dancer who had only the power of glamorie and a girl that was sighted she did not have to ring for her servants as a human would they knew when she was aware and needed them again and they knew just what it was that she needed too two of the men each brought a struggling street urchin in both children so ragged and filthy it was impossible to say whether they were male or female not that it really mattered to nina she fell on them like a starving dog on a steak when she was like this there was no finesse involved only the hunger and the need to replenish herself literally in this case she had lost substance as well as energy and when she was done there was nothing left of the children but their rags feeling sated and reinvigorated she stretched and yawned the servants took that as their signal to remove the rags and send her maid in draw me a bath she said i need to think what she meant was that she needed to draw on the memories of all those she had absorbed on their collective intellects her old men might have been addled by her spells and her beauty but most of them were intelligent men who had not inherited their wealth they had earned it every penny of it and gotten it as ruthlessly as anyone could imagine they had been shrewd calculating and scheming all that was hers to call upon now as she sank into her hot bath with her hair piled high on her head and the scent of musk surrounding her from the perfume oils and special herbs she always put in the water the first thing that came into her mind was this they know you are here now and they know what you are they might not know who but they would know what or at least they would know that an earth master walking the dark path was hunting their precious dancer it is only a matter of time before they find another earth master to hunt you it was true that earth mastery tended to come to those who were reluctant to venture into cities and for good reason what human beings did to the earth in their cities left it fouled and poisoned and earth masters felt that acutely still given that there was an urgent need one could be persuaded in time it all depended on how organized the elemental masters were hereabouts if they were highly organized as they were in say germany it would not take long at all if however they were as chaotic and anarchistic as they were in russia it might take a year so assume that you have between two weeks and six months unless you find something else to distract them with thus came the advice of those shrewd old men from their decades of chicanery backstabbing machiavellian schemes find something else to distract them with they will have a hard time fighting a battle on two or even three fronts she frowned pursing her lips this could be a problem if she were back on her home ground she could have had a dozen distractions for them already and she had already tried making one of the dozens of admirers around the dancer besotted wait she nodded to herself yes that was one thing she had not tried she had been working with men who were already attracted to the girl what she had not tried was creating a crazed and infatuated admirer yes that would work but she needed another front to work on if only she was back east of germany then there would be people who knew she was the real nina tchereslavsky and wait of course she sank down into her bath with a smile of satisfaction there would be several cables to send today she would have to be sure to send them from different offices to avoid drawing attention to herself or to her servants this trap should come as a complete surprise and it should ideally ensure that all of her enemies would be so very busy that they would not see her real attack coming because i dont have any hands nor voice thats why the cat said with irritation to nigel if i could work most earth magic dont you think i would have done so to make sure my wife and child were taken care of maybe some of you can wield your power just by sitting down and thinking hard but i cant and i never could i needed physical implements and i needed the chants i was taught if he cant he cant jonathon wolf said with a deep sigh i must say i sympathize im rather in the same pickle he fanned his wings no thumbs doncha know heaven knows ive tried but when you cant pick up both the wand and the cup at the same time see even the bird understands wolf gave the cat an evil yellow eye and made sound like a rude little boy curse it jonathon said with passion i dont know any earth masters i was the only one in this part of the country old lad the cat said wearily i am afraid this is going to have to be done the hard way the lettertree wolf groaned jonathon nodded reluctantly all right ill do my lot wolf you get arthur to do yours i expect he and nigel know pretty much the same circle of magicians identical wolf replied and sighed bother this could take a month or more jonathons mouth was set in a grim line once we find an earth master we will have to persuade him this truly is an urgent situation in order to get him inside a city only the dark walkers like what happens to the earth inside a large city truer words wolf grumbled they were all sitting in ninettes dressing room waiting for ailse to escort her to the theater it had been agreed that she was not to go anywhere alone from now on not that she had done so very much before but it was even more imperative now jonathon had already set the fire wards around her flat nigel was setting the air wards now at that moment the subject of their concern arrived along with the little scots maid and ailse had a very determined expression on her face that made jonathons eyebrow rise his curiosity was further aroused by the expression of excitement on ninettes face he wasnt the only one to notice do i sense a conspiracy wolf exclaimed standing up straighter on his perch on the back of a folding chair summat ailse said shortly and turned to jonathon im thinkin sir that yell be havin more sense than master nigel and master arthur you too master wolf master thomas sense about what exactly jonathon asked warily she wants to teach me to shoot ninette burst out her cheeks very pink now i think this would be a very good idea shoot jonathon exclaimed startled you mean a firearm ailse glared at him no a knittin needle ye gurt booby she snapped clearly having lost her temper of course i mean a firearm she opened her purse and removed one of the biggest handguns that jonathon had ever seen wielding it with all the calm of an expert this lad t be precise or one like it me ald father taught me afore i left home she added with pride and me brother brought me this from america aye but twas me granny as told them tteach me theres nothin dark and fearsome can stand against cold iron silver or blessed lead she said and father allowed she was right to jonathons dumbfounded astonishment she expertly broke the revolver and spilled six cartridges into her hand two each she said with pride there be the cold iron she held up one with a businessend of a dull black tricksy those i mun be sure they dinna rust i the revolver an this near t sea that isna an easy thing here be the silver this time the bullets she held up were as shiny as a proud housewifes best cutlery an those i mun be polishin every day too an this is th blessed lead these looked ordinary enough at first cast from the lead from the roof of our own kirk with pastors own blessin on em and look she turned the bullet to face jonathon and he saw that the soft nose of it had been cut and cut again saint andrews own blessed cross on it dye ken jonathon knew a little about firearms as did most stage magicians and he knew about the practice of cutting a cross into the nose of a bullet to make the soft lead spread more when it hit a target he blinked saint andrews own blessed cross was likely to be hell on earth for anything those bullets struck shes very good ninette said her eyes shining really i would feel ever so much safer if i knew how to shoot and had a gun jonathon considered this carefully and it wasnt only supernatural entities that he was thinking about when he considered the dancer with a revolver in her hands earth magic was also the magic of animal instincts if he was an earth master and he wanted to eliminate a pretty young dancer one with many admirers i am going to argue in your favor he said carefully if you both promise me one thing he turned first to ailse i want you to make sure that she is deadly with this thing she cannot afford to miss and she cannot afford to have it taken from her do you understand me the scots girl pursed her lips grimly aye she replied an that i can do if tis in her t be a shot and you he rounded on ninette you must be ready to shoot to kill without pause without hesitation if you ever have to take that thing out there will be no time for second thoughts no squeamishness whoever this is might well use someone he thought for a moment then decided that being blunt was the only answer might well use one of those men that throng your dressing room as an instrument if that happens there will be no question of guilt or innocence no mercy you will have to kill or be killed or worse he added with conviction the object might be to carry you off to much worse than simply death and i do not mean mere rape ailse went scarlet with embarrassment at the word but he went ruthlessly on i mean dissolution terror horror such as you cannot imagine these magics that we use are primal forces and as such they have all the raw power of the tempest the volcano the earthquake he hopedin fact he prayedthat ninette child of montmarte as she was was near enough to the violence that could be in those streets that she would truly understand what he meant and would be willing able to be just as violent to ensure her own safety her eyes became very thoughtful and a bit distant he sensed she was looking deep into her memory her expression darkened and he felt hope i am no hothouse flower msieur she said quietly i am thethe cabbage grown on the windowsill of a garret so that one might eat there were apachegangs in my street i have sometimes had to run home very fast to avoid the absinthedrinkers the hashishsmokers the procurers with knives i know how evil can wear a friendly even a familiar face yes msieur jonathon i can shoot to kill the cat silent until now growled a little a few of those limped home when i got done savaging their ankles he added i may not be a mastiff but i can probably give her a moment or two more to aim all right jonathon said with a slow nod i will make sure nigel and arthur have no objections and i myself will go out and get you a revolver he eyed the monster in ailses hands but not quite that big you dont have the wrists for it ninette i wont get you a ridiculous little ladys gun but i will get you something you can handle an the bullets ailse said instantly cold iron silver and blessed lead he raised his eyebrow again and ailse blushed i am an elemental master he reminded her i think i can manage even in so seemingly hardheaded and ordinary a city as blackpool it took relatively little effort to get the silver and cold iron bullets it was the blessed lead that proved to be the sticking point there were not many churches even in wicked blackpool that were willing to part with a bit of their lead roofing material when someone looking like jonathon turned up and asked for it three times he tried under various pretenses and three times he was turned away with varying degrees of suspicion and hostility and there was no helpful padre well versed in the ways of elemental mages anywhere within the city limits hed have used ailses bullets except that he had already determined that ninette could not possibly shoot the monster pistol that ailse wielded with such dexterity her attempts at dryfiring the gun would have put bullets into the sky or the ground at her feet but never in an assailant and besides as the afternoon wore on he became more determined that he would solve this difficulty he had the gunsmith who would help them choose a weapon for ninette and was willing to cast him bullets of the size needed in whatever material he chose to present while not a mage himself he knew mages and ghosthunters and a variety of arcane folk odd requests like this were routine for him all he needed was the blessed lead finally at wits end he resorted to chicanery he found a church with a roof badly in need of repair hired an urchin to shinny up a drainpipe and steal him some then salved his conscience with a generous donation in the repair fund box by then it was time to rush back to the theater for the evening performance something which in the light of what else was going on had a distinct edge of unreality to it he found himself in the wings during ninettes turns and not at all by accident he watched her closely in the light of his new information but he could find nothing whatsoever lacking in her skill if anything she was better now than she had been when she first started dancing here that was undoubtedly partly practice but there was something else too there wasa sense of joy in her dancing that had not been there before a feeling that she was giving this performance to her audience generously and unstintingly and the audience was giving back to her there was absolutely no doubt of this if he could not actually see the energies he could sense their effect on the energies of his own magics it was not a parasitic relationship it was a symbiotic one the audience poured over her their pleasure their appreciation their support she gave back to them happiness exuberance joy it was perhaps the most remarkable thing he had ever seen on a stage theres her magic the cat said from his feet startling him theres dozens would give their souls for that sort of power i can imagine he murmured if she chose if she learns how to reach an entire hall how to do this when she isnt dancing she could have the world at her feet or at least london she could fill a lecture hall on whatever subject she wanted and get people to rush out and support it she could probably even get elected to parliament its a dangerous power terrifying when you think about it jonathon said darkly but shell never use it that way the cat countered firmly i know my girl none of that would make people happy jonathon snorted once she figures out that she can use this to get even better presents out of those fools that come backstage shes giving the presents back the cats words made him glance down incredulously bosh im telling you just you drop by and watch shes been giving the presents back keeping only the flowers see for yourself butwhy jonathon managed struth i dont care about her keeping the presents so long as she doesnt end up in the bed of some blackguardbut she started handing em back about the same time as she discovered this magic of hers jonathon shook his head he wasnt quite sure what to make of this bit of information he turned and left the wings before she finished the dance going back to his dressing room shared with the pattercomic and the male half of the sentimentalballad singers and stared at his own reflection in the dressingtable mirror for a while finally he shook himself out of his reverie and began carefully applying his makeup why should he care what she did or did not do with the presents those idiots pressed on her although he had to admit given everything that was going on now it was a wise decision on her part he didnt think now that they were all on the alert that anyone could slip anything magically dangerous past them and into ninettes hands but you never knew and gems and gold were the provenance of an earth mage too if anyone could exploit such a thing it would be an earth mage well if she had hit on that dangerous spot for a potential breech in their defenses good for her he ignored the fact that he felt like gloating or rather he ignored it until the moment that it was appropriate for his evil stageself to gloat and smirk over his captive he didnt quite realize how much he was enjoying himself until she whispered as she was being locked into the cabinet if you cackle i swear i will not be able to keep from laughing at you after a single glance of outrage he slammed the door shut with a bit more force than was strictly necessary and locked it up he wasnt that bad was he yes it turned out he was nigel intercepted him on his way back to the dressing room just a word a bit less of the villainy would you thats all right for the pantos but if you do that too often here theyll start laughing and shouting look behind you chagrined he savagely wiped his makeup off and headed for the stage door or at least that was his intention but his feet had a mind of their own and took him to the door of ninettes dressing room as usual it was thronged with lotharios as he had seen before they slipped little velvet boxes into her hand or onto the dressing table but this time he caught the byplay with a sense of astonishment as ailse collected each box and discreetly gave it back to the giver with a whispered mademoiselle cannot possibly accept this only once did she make an exception to this the giver was a little girl who solemnly presented her with a tinsel ring she must have gotten out of a cracker with equal solemnity ninette accepted it put it on admired it and directed the attention of everyone else in the room to it nor did she put it aside when the child had been taken off to an overdue bedtime jonathon slipped away before she could notice him nina had her fool and an excellent choice he was too terrance kendal had the acute misfortune of having ambitions that far far outstripped his abilities and an ego to match he had been the only child of a deliberately invalid mother who doted on him and a distant father who worked himself to death leaving terrance and said mother just enough money for pretensions of gentility but none of the substance like the protagonists in a satirical story by saki he had been given airs but no graces if hed had wit he might have found a place as a hangeron in the circles to which he aspired but sadly for him he had none terrance was sent away to school but alas it was not eton or harrow or even a secondtier school a fact which was to cause him embarrassment for the rest of his life he was encouraged by his mother to believe he was a budding genius and it came as an embittering experience for him to discover that no one else had this impression he was large enough and coordinated enough that he was not bullied but he was no ones friend either he was good enough at sports to survive but not good enough to prosper he thought too highly of himself and made no effort to hide the fact that he felt himself to be the social superior of the entire school to his face he was mockingly called your lordship and behind his back rather less flattering names he left school as alone as he had arrived university proved as great a disappointment his credentials were lackluster his antecedents plebian his wealth nonexistent his personality composed of nothing but affectation he managed to get into a college that housed members of the classes he thought he belonged in and he immediately set to work proving himself a nuisance he hung about trying to get himself invited to parties and when he could not whenever the chance arose he invited himself he tried to drink and he hadnt the head for it tried to gamble and hadnt the wealth he couldnt afford a horse or a motorcar and the only possibly route to the affections of those to whose ranks he longed to aspire that is the road of sport was a closed book to him he played neither cricket nor football well enough to make the teams and he could not even pull a decent oar the true wealthy and titled students were unimpressed with his scribblings and poetry those who had the wit and learning recognized it for the pathetic dross it was and the rest laughed to scorn the notion that a real man could find any interest in such nonsense when there were things to shoot and things to ride things to play and things to cheer on things to acquire and things to display thus disappointed terrance returned to the maternal bosom in blackpool to sulk on what he increasingly viewed as a pittance he had never felt affection for anyone not even his adoring mother his lovesonnets were as flat as uncorked champagne so when nina began her work on him it was to persuade him not that he was violently in love with the dancer but that she was violently in love with him nina began her campaign with excellent boxseat tickets to the performance and although under any other circumstance he would have scorned such entertainment as too common this time he was persuaded partly because the tickets were sent ostensibly as a belated birthday gift from one of the few cambridge men who had not utterly scorned him and partly because of a rumorentirely untruethat the hall was going to be graced that night with the presence of the crown prince so he went and seated in the next box nina went to work she took care to work her magic in a very subtle manner he was one of those sorts that could not go to a performance of any kind without nibbling and drinking throughout it and before his fashionably late arrival she had gotten into his private box and carefully laid out a little buffet in miniature for his pleasure all of it bearing the magic she intended to become a part of him the magic she wove was compounded of half lust and half hallucination it was easy enough to incite the lust the hallucination was subtle terrance was made to believe that the dancer spent the greater part of her performances looking at him winking at him smiling at him gazing coyly at him by the time the evening was over terrance had more than half convinced himself that the dancer would be his in a moment if he but raised his little finger and beckoned to her he congratulated himself on his conquest smugly not that he would have anything to do with so common a creature as a musichall dancer of course but this was not a real music hall dancer this was a ballerina and a russian to boot so it was all right her devotion was acceptable in fact he considered that it was his due by the end of the performance he was basking in the imagined attention he was getting and traveled homewards in a taxi in a state of selfcongratulatory satisfaction of course he did not deign to join the crowd attempting access to the dancers dressingroom not only was he above that sort of plebian behavior he had every expectation that the lady would come to him and not the other way around like charles the second he would summon like nell gwynne she would answer overawed with the honor he bestowed upon her if he chose to summon that is he had to be sure she was worthy of his attention and so for several nights running he made his observations he took care never to take the same box twice but always she somehow intuited where he was and bestowed her flirtations on him his mother complained mildly after the second week of this of the expense of box seats every night and could he at least share the box and the expense with some chums he stared at her in fury then the next day in a rage he went to the safedeposit box at the bank substituted her rather fine pearls for imitations and sold the former thereafter there seemed to be no expense so his mothers nagging tongue was stilled he told himself this was his right as the head of the household besides they were to come to him eventually and what need had she for pearls anyway she hadnt gone out in decades except to funerals and to those she properly wore jet not pearls but that awoke him to a possible difficulty he lived at home with his mother he could not bring a mistress there but a trifle of research on the part of the hallboy eased his mind the dancer had a flat of her own with an entrance both private and discreet so there would be no difficulty and thankfully no expense the most he would need to provide would be a pretty trinket now and again and the safe deposit box contained many tokens belonging to his mother than he imagined would be suitable with all these things settled in his mind he decided the moment had come for the summons he wrote it on a small card that he directed the hallboy to convey to the dancer at the theater one afternoon then he took himself to the establishment he had chosen for the first assignation a restaurant considered both smart and discreet suitable for a man of wealth and taste to meet his mistressor one who he was about to make his mistress he timed his arrival to a nicety it would not do for her to appear at a table littered with the evidence of a long wait he calculated how long it would take the boy to reach the theater how long before he could deliver the note and then because she would of course fly out with the greatest speed to answer his invitation how long it would take her to reach the establishment he arrived there about five minutes before he reckoned she would but of course he made sure to ask the headwaiter if she had possibly preceded him having determined to his satisfaction that she had not he had himself seated in the intimate and secluded corner he had reserved ordered a brandy and sat back to wait after some fifteen minutes he was concerned at half an hour he was irritated as the hands of his watch told him an hour had elapsed he began to grow angry by the time he left the place nothing in his stomach but overpriced brandy he was in a towering rage exactly as nina had desired what is that ninette asked ailse who had answered the tap at the door of the dressing room and come away with a single card in an envelope with nothing written on it i hope it is not another invitation to teach some poor child how to totter about on her toes monsieur ciccolini already has as many pupils as he cares to take for some reason the wealthy of blackpool seemed to think that she had so much time on her hands that she would be overjoyed to teach their children to dance not with an eye to going on the stage of course no the doting mothers in question had more of a vague notion of a dainty little tot in a fairy dress flitting about on the lawn to the strains of mendelssohn for the entertainment and admiration of gardenparty guests the normal sort of display that one trotted out on these occasions was a daughter singing or playing or more rarely the dramatic rendition of the lady of shallot a dancing daughter provided she was not yet nubile would be a novelty and it seemed that every good entertaining mama in blackpool had conceived of this same novelty all at once ninette must come and teach the ball dance or the ribbon dance the hoop dance or the skirt dance fortunately ninette had a stock answer for this ailse had written it up on cards so it was readymade and at hand and needed only to have name and address added dear blank i cannot tell you how honored i am by your invitation to teach your offspring alas i fear your confidence in my ability is not matched by my competence as a teacher i am myself still very much a pupil however i commend to your attention my own teacher monsieur ciccolini who has given me the skills you so admire sincerely nina tchereslavsky ciccolini now filled as many hours as he cared to teaching these poor things the discipline of the ballet of course it would do them a world of good knowing they would never get beyond flitting around a garden in a fairy dress monsieur ciccolini did not put them into pointe shoes or stretch the little muscles to the aching point instead he gave them exercises that would make them graceful taught them the demipointe steps of the white ballets before toework became commonplace and choreographed charming little diversions that would at least not cause gardenparty guests to have to stifle yawns and he did so with great and abiding patience patience that was justified by the very high fees he was charging nina found it all rather amusing these women saw nothing wrong with expecting her to do the same thing for free but monsieur ciccolini could command a handsome fee for his labor then again monsieur ciccolini did not stand to profit as highly as she did from the upcoming grand production escape from the harem there was no doubt in ninas mind that she was going to be worth every farthing but the total still dazzled tis not another one of those ailse replied her brow furrowed with puzzlement canna make out what exactly this laddie wants looks like he is inviting ye t tea nobbut he writes like hes invitin ye t royal audience ninette took it from her read it through and began to laugh oh my she chuckled that is exactly what it is have you ever heard of this fellow she asked handing the card back to ailse the maid shook her head what with all the cards and flowers and all a body would think ye knew every name that wasna already in the papers she said dubiously exactly ninette chuckled this is nobody but he thinks very highly of himself i expect that this is not tea he is inviting me to i think this is an audition to have the honor of being his mistress and if i pass he will permit me if you will ailse went scarlet although ninette could not tell if it was from outrage amusement embarrassment or a combination of all three although she suspected the latter now ninette continued thoughtfully it might barely be possible that this is someone of great importance masquerading behind an unknown name what ailse gasped the prince prince edward but but i think it highly unlikely ninette serenely counted off the reasons on her fingers first the royal yacht is nowhere to be seen nor the royal car on the rails here second prince edward was reported by the papers yesterday to be in monte carlo thirdly should the prince seek to hide behind an unknown name it would be the name of one of his gentlemen and he would not send a plainjacketed manservant with dusty shoes to deliver the note and what is more anyone he sent would stay for an answer because as royalty knows the answer might be no and it would not do for a prince to be loitering even in a private room of a common chophouse ailse breathed a sigh half of relief half of regret and i do not intend to answer the invitation of someone who clearly regards himself as no less than royalty who is in fact not royalty she turned to the dressing room mirror particularly not when we have so much work to do if this man had even the faintest idea of what my life is like he would issue an invitation for a late supper after the performance not an afternoon tea toss it away ailse we are shooting today mademoiselle ailse said firmly i know nigel is sending his automobile in an hour and in the meanwhile i intend to practice the solo from giselle monsieur ciccolini had the choreography from that ballet memorized so well that he probably could have taught it had he been blinded and although ninette was hardly performing the classical repertoire anymore she intended to continue to learn it one never knew perhaps one day if only to indulge her nigel would stage a real ballet she felt faintly guilty about claiming to be a ballerina and yet never actually doing real ballet with ailse keeping careful track of time she had just enough time to leave the studio garbed in a most peculiar costume and jump into the back of the auto before the driver became impatient hoy jonathon said looking at her in astonishment i thought i was taking mademoiselle ninette to shoot so you are ninette replied pushing back the boys cap on her head and this is a much more practical costume for shooting than any gown i own she had put her hair up in the ballerinas bun and clapped a tweed cap purchased from a shop that sold boys hats over the top of it she wore a shirt rather than a blouse of very severe cut this had been purchased from a shop that sold the sort of things that ladies who typed wore to their offices there were no lace cuffs or froufrous to get in the way on her legs ninette wore the contraption known as a bloomer skirt admittedly she could have gotten the sort of divided skirt some ladies wore to ride or play tennis in but from what she understood there was going to be a great deal of clambering over rocks and she wanted her legs as free of encumbrance as she could manage i wish i could have gotten boys trousers or even knickers to fit me she said wistfully but on such short notice it wasnt possible she was scarcely embarrassed seeing as she had worn far far less onstage for a very long time now jonathons lips quirked in a ghost of a smile allow me to congratulate you on your good sense mademoiselle he said there are females who would have expected me to carry them to where we are going to go ninette sniffed scornfully then you are accustomed to dealing with females who are fools she said nigel said it would be a wild part of the coast i took him at his word and i dressed to suit you and ailse are doing me the favor of teaching me this it would be sad if i were to play the fainting maiden now jonathon chuckled then turned his attention to putting the automobile in motion and sending it down the street the auto trundled its way parallel to the ocean passing the boardwalk the beaches with their holiday families and bathing machines all the little businesses that catered to the enterprise of seabathing and beachpicnicking it was a rare day without a cloud in the sky and without any prospect of rain the famous electric lights that had made blackpool a household name at the turn of the century were festooned everywhere they passed the famous tower and ninette made a private vow that when this was over she was going to see all of these things she was missing the tower the winter gardens the boardwalk the illuminations the opera house and all of the other theaters that nigel competed with the road narrowed and became more primitive the ride a bit rougher as the macadam turned to gravel and the beach on their left turned to rock flats finally at a place where the worn grass showed that other people had left vehicles jonathon turned the auto off the track and parked it nose facing the sea here we are he announced so it seems why here ninette asked chiefly because this is where a good many people already come to practice shooting jonathon said the local folk know this and stay well away to avoid the odd stray bullet by a beginning marksman this is far enough away that the sound of gunshots will not excite any interest in the holiday makers nor is there anything of interest here for the hiker or the seabather we shall be quite alone good ninette applauded i should not like to be responsible for shooting someones ear off by accident she hopped down out of the car without waiting for jonathons aid and walked as far as the edge of the grassy area looking down she saw why the local folk came here to shoot nature had provided a kind of perfect target range there was just enough of a dropoff down to a beach of pebbles and a mudflat that it was unlikely stray shots would go anywhere other than into the earth or out to sea the beach was not the sort to invite bathers even though it was secluded and the scramble down and back up again could only be attempted by the athletic of course all of them were athletic and as she was completely unhindered by skirts ninette scampered down the crude path as nimbly as a monkey the end of the beach most often used for targets was a stack of flattopped boulders thoroughly pockmarked and decorated with splashes of lead glass shards and pottery fragments showed what figured most often as the targets although three or four bulletridden rusted tin cans showed that there were others who preferred targets that did not break when your bullets struck them jonathon had come prepared with a sort of easel and some sturdy pasteboards with the crude outline of a man on them these he proceeded to set up without a word then came to join the two women at the opposite end of the shooting gallery he carefully explained the peculiarities of this pistol then left it up to ailse to get down to the particulars since there was no further call on his services he turned his attention and his mind back to the question of just who ninettes enemy might be thus far theyd had a singular lack of success in finding an earth master the few that he or nigel had found were all too old to come live in a theater in blackpool and even if they were so inclined they couldnt have borne the psychic stench of the city for very long he expected ninette to be fearful and she certainly screwed up her face and jumped the first few times that ailse fired the gun but then she stepped bravely up took the pistol in steady hands and patiently let ailse position her and show her how to squeeze off shots they went wide of the mark of course that was what he had expected but what he had not expected was how quickly she began to sight in on the target by the time they were halfway through the box of cartridges she was hitting the target more often than not by the time the box was empty she was confidently firing and hitting almost every time jonathon was honestly astonished youre certain youve never done anything like this before he ventured ninette looked at him with a twist of her lips i think that if i had i would surely remember she said wryly but recall what i am dancers must have very good control of their bodies well stand up he did so wondering what on earth she could be thinking she stood quite close to him for a moment measuring him with her eyes it was a very calculating look and he couldnt imagine what she was going to do that she was about to do something he had no doubt he had seen that look in her eyes before she settled her feet in their stout little walking shoes a moment and then like lightning she made a tremendous jump and high kick higher than he had ever seen her make before the sole of her foot flashed within a hair of his nose and hit the brim of his hat knocking it cleanly off his head he stared at her she shrugged a cabaret trick she said calmly the cancan dancers and washerwomen at the moulin rouge do it all the time usually when the gentleman is drunk the gentleman gets a look up her skirts and she keeps his hat until he ransoms it back but be sure if i had wanted to kick your nose and not the brim of your hat i could have he looked at her soberly without anger better still he suggested aim for the chin you could break a mans neck that way at the worst you would knock him flat she blinked mais oui that is something to remember then he licked his lips considering practice it he suggested its better than the pistol we cant explain away a bullet we can explain away an unfortunate fall she nodded and for a moment the sun seemed to fade then they all shook off the mood and scrambled back up the rocks to the auto this time ninette sat up front with him as he drove back to the theater i am thinking you like me a little better now she said over the noise of the motor i was disposed to be very angry with you when you told us how you had lied to us jonathon replied after a long moment of thought but she persisted he answered honestly but reluctantly well you are a good dancer a very good dancer there is no doubt that you are very popular with the audiences and there is also no doubt that you work as hard as any of us i dont think anyone gives a hang whether youre russian or red indian the point is you give them good entertainment but still you lied to us i dont like being lied to mais ouis but she looked out the windscreen her mouth in a small pout of melancholy would any of you have listened to me let me audition for you if i had not come with this story this lie jonathon grimaced to be honest no then i should have starved or jumped into the river or gone into many mens beds the matter of fact way she said it made him flush uncomfortably i did not want to do any of these things and actually i think i really did not know i wanted so badly to dance either until the people began to pay attention to me its a drug he said quietly that admiration its a drug like any other as bad as absinthe you want it you cant do without it and once youve had it youd rather die than give it up at least he added honestly its that way for some it could be for me i think she admitted i am taking care i hope you understand me i am trying not to believe that i am so wonderful but i feel something out there he debated a moment its magic you have a touch of it he told her deciding to make a clean breast of it youre not like me or even arthuryoure more like wolf youll never have more than that touch of it never work spells but this much is yours when you dance when you give yourself to the audience when you forget about everything and try to please them you feed them you make them happy your magic makes them forget that the tinsel isnt gold that the props and scenery are only painted canvas and wood and when you feed them they feed you dont you always feel stronger and better when you come off stage oui she exclaimed and i could not understand it i never used to feel this way when i danced i was exhausted and then after a while here i began to feel so full of energy when i came off the stage sometimes i need to settle and quiet myself for otherwise i could not sleep and you say this is my magic he nodded its you feeding them feeding them something to take their minds out of themselves for a little while and then they feed you it wouldnt be enough to keep you going for hours and hours he warned but i think that all the dancing that nigel has planned for you in his big production will ultimately be no problem for you but with that she laughed poo you have not seen a great ballet then the prima is onstage for almost all of it swan lake sacre bleu nearly every scene it would have been no problem without this magic but then she smiled still she added cheerfully with it things will be very good indeed but as he wound his way through the streets to the theater something occurred to him what if this was what her unknown enemy wanted this rare performance magic the attacks then would not be so much directed at her as they would be to take what she had away well it looked as if he had some research ahead of him it was going to be a long night but he hoped a fruitful one nina had wound up her first distraction and let him go now for the second they would be looking for earth mages her use of the homunculus betrayed her origin very well she would give them some or at least she would give them something that looked like an earth mage she chose her decoy candidates very very carefully for they had to appear to be earth mages of the vilest sort right up until their protections were exploded the more plausible they were the better she could of course find mortals that ardently desired the powers of an earth mage and who had just enough of the gift in them to counterfeit mastery without ever having anything more than what she granted them but firstly that would be wasteful and secondly she knew from past experience that such people were dangerous they got ambitions and they thought they could take what she would not give them such in fact had been her original summoner when mortals got ambitious things got messy and while she was not at all averse to mess she knew that in this case it could betray her so she would set up the unknowing as her decoys in a way that could not be traced back to her her first choice was a natural one a particularly nasty brothelkeeper of the lowest and most brutish sort his customers were the same and as for his wares well they were in no condition to think about much of anything his girls were all addicted to the drugs he gave them most were chinese and he kept them in nasty little cells lining the corridors of his building on the waterfront cells a mere six feet by eight with nothing more than a pallet and a blanket and a rag or two for clothing they plied their trade ate slept were drugged and eventually died in these little cribs as they were called for pure misery his establishment had to be high on the list of those creating negative energies and nina surprised by the amount she was able to make use of made a note to try this particular method at some time in the future but for nowall she needed was her decoy she set herself up in a dingy room in the building next door wearing the form of one of her vagrants in order to rent it and its noisome contents for a week there was no lock for the door she was forced to make do with a chair wedged beneath the knob she worked swiftly and without a protective circle but within shields a circle where none should be would only attract attention and besides there was not much in the earth realms that would dare take her on now she tapped into the energies boiling out of the brothel next door siphoned off a cornucopia of rage hate shame lust and pure despair and used it to create some of the most powerful earthshields she had ever built carefully she placed them around both the brothel and the building of flats she was in now this would further serve to confuse the matter it would not be clear whether the mage was to be found in the flats or in the brothel when she was done she was satisfied the shields were like stone walls if they had been the walls of a fortress not even the guns of a naval warship would be able to break them with a single shot she added a tap to keep those shields supplied from the neverending stream of soulsickening darkness anyone who saw shields that strong would assume that the mage inside them was stronger still unfortunately for them this was hardly the case she left the shields permeable to herself alone until she left the building then she closed them even to herself the perfectly ordinary nonmagical people who belonged there would have no difficulty in crossing but any creature of magic would be stopped dead in its tracks this of course now included her now what would happen when those shields were broken by a concerted unrelenting attack nina wasnt entirely certain perhaps nothing or perhaps the power would backlash on those who were supplying it in that case it would backlash on the girls in their weakened mental states that might drive them mad or it might kill them if the latterwell that would be delicious it would mean the ohsonoble fellows guarding the imposter would be personally responsible for the deaths of up to two dozen girls who at least in the sense of harming them were innocents she walked away from that place with a grin on her face that made people who saw it cross to the other side of the street nina liked this plan so much that she decided to repeat it a few hours worth of walking in similarly unsavory neighborhoods netted her more of what she was looking for by nightfall she had found two more establishments in which to do the same the first was a gin palace the second an opium den in both she was able to rent rooms in which to do her work undisturbed once she had purchased respectively two full bottles of blue ruin and a pipe and sticky ball of blacktar opium she used the gin palace first pouring the poisonous stuff out of the window then getting to work it was a trifle more difficult to set up a tap here since the people who were systematically destroying their health their lives and their brains with the stuff didnt actually live there but she got the notion of putting the energy sinks into the benches that they sat on and that worked admirably the next day it was the turn of the opium den she mashed the drug into a crack in the floor where it was indistinguishable from all the other muck collected there what had served her well in the gin palace served her equally well here this time she put the sinks into the bunks that those who could not afford a room stretched out on to fume their brains into drifting benumbed pleasure this was trickier than the brothel or the gin palace unlike alcohol the opium did not admit the mind to anger no the emotion she siphoned here was bleak despair beneath the drug there was the fear of not being able to raise the money for the next debauch there was selfloathing and more often than not the wish that this time the drug would end the struggle for existence then of course there were the addicts that appeared without money suffering the agonies of withdrawal from the drug so desperate for it and in such pain that they would do anything at all to get it anything she walked away from the opium den with a feeling of smug cleverness in order to return to her new home without exciting comment it was necessary to make a few stops and changes of clothing going from the povertystricken vagrant to a lowerclass workingman to a simple servant to a ladys maid and finally to herself the last two changes of clothing she had concealed in order to effect the change one in the backyard shed of a nearby house the second in the tiny carriagehouse of her own set of flats she walked straight in from there as casually as if she had merely gone for a stroll for the sake of the sea air as it happened there was no one there to note her coming in as there had been no one to note her leaving but she had learned over the years that remaining undetected and unmolested required the careful management of such details her maid let her in and she ordered several of her favorite foods at random and ate and drank hugely she was surfeited on the dark energies of misery but for the last four days her body had been subsisting on dubious sausages doubtful cockles and oysters and suspicious eel pies and it craved wholesome toothsome food with body and self satisfied she flung herself down on a settee and watched the plump redfaced throng parade under her windows it amused her no end to think how little these holidaymakers that flocked to blackpool in the season were aware that brothels opium dens and gin palaces existed mere streets away from where they were strolling these she could never feed on there was simply too little there one part ignorance three parts complaisance five parts smug selfcongratulation and a touch of anxiety that one day it might all go smash thin stuff and bitter and flimsy as the paper they wrote their letters home on to save on the postage no they had no idea that this pink pleasurepalace of a city had a dark and rotten heart they only saw the façade but of course only the middle class and upwards could afford to take a holiday at all much less one in another city the middle class preferred to keep these sordid things at a considerable distance the middle class did not want to know about what lay underneath the surface of anything and it particularly did not want to know about the impoverished and desperate it might be persuaded to part with the odd penny or two at christmas to supply christmas cheer for the deserving poor but on the whole these were things it was better not to think about too carefully the middle class liked their impoverished class to be in the newspapers not underfoot and particularly not underfoot when the middle class was bent on enjoying itself opium dens had their place in sensational literature and one could get a delicious thrill when a lecturer thundered sternly about the evils of white slavery but when one went on holiday one preferred to think of the city one visited as an endless panorama of delights and ignore the cockroaches that would appear if one took down a panel of the pretty scenery fools nina muttered and turned away from the window having constructed three of these decoys nina knew that her labors were not at an end oh my no the hunters might not be lured by something so obvious she turned her mind to more subtle decoys something that would serve exactly the same purpose as her blatant works but would not trumpet its existence for anyone with the eyes to see it even if they took the first bait she actually didnt think her targets would be fooled twice but you never knew and the hollow shields were in any event the easiest and fastest to create they bought her time let the enemies waste their time stalking the premises trying to determine who among all the vile inhabitants was the mage and then destroying the shields while they were distracted she would be stalking the dancer and when she finally struck they would never see her she brooded about what to do for three days then worked out something that would serve the next set of decoys was going to be a deception within a deception instead of creating obvious shields she used the same principle of using the energies of despair to fuel the magic only this time it was to hide rather than protect once again she stalked the streets of blackpool a nondescript ruffian looking for the best places to use for her loci after two days of testing the energies looking for sustainable concentrations of despair she found what she was looking for a workhouse provided the first source an orphanage the second the workhouse was fairly ordinary as such things went people only came there because they had been wrecked on the reef of debt and financial ruin and yet had some small hope that they could with hard work get themselves and their families out of it all they quickly found of course that they could not that the workhouse offered the barest of living on starvation rations but the only place you could go from the workhouse was into the street where there would be no food no roof and nowhere to go families were separated men from women children from parents despair there was in plenty but it was the dull despair of those who had been pounded on the rocks of life until there was little spirit left in them the orphanage however was actually very difficult for her to give over to her intended plan as it was such a huge generator of senseless death infants were swaddled and stacked like cordwood on beds in cheerless rooms to remain in their increasingly soiled wrappers until the scheduled time for feeding and changing never were they allowed to move freely and the thin skimmed milk they were fed was not enough to sustain the majority of them they were so starved and dull they failed even to crythis was pointed out to visitors as an example of how good they were they were not good of course they were dying most of them pneumonia and flu chicken pox and measles whooping cough and diphtheria these childhood ailments would carry off battalions of them at a time the infant wards could go from full to empty in a matter of days the death rate was nearly ninety percent children too old to be swaddled were left tied to bedsteads with no toys and little or no exercise and fed equally inferior food of more skimmed milk gruel and bread as soon as it was possible to put them to work they were rented out to mill owners not one in four lived it was delicious all those little lives cut short so soon every life fraught with unrealized potential she determined then and there that she was going to begin looking for an orphanage to patronize once all this was sorted out it would be delightfully ironic to be seen as the lady bountiful to the little orphans in public while in private she battened and prospered on their deaths all that took less than a week to set up and meanwhile she was carefully watching the progress of her toy terrance kendal he had come away from the failed assignation in a rage but rage cooled too quickly especially in a bloodless thing like him he had in all of his life never sustained anything like passion for very long passion required commitment to something other than ones own self because it required being focused on the object of passion rather than ones own self she needed to engender more than rage she needed him to tip over the edge of sanity into obsession if she had been forced to wait for it to happen naturally she might have been waiting long however she had a number of resources she could use to manipulate his mind to begin with dreams dreams were very useful they existed outside of logic outside of normal behavior and cut straight into emotion and instinct mortals did and experienced things in dreams that they would never think of doing much less actually do when awake now to give a human dreams was not as easy as it might seem the ordinary sort of human without any magic to speak of was singularly resistant to the any touch of the arcane the sheer power of his disbelief was astonishing to someone who had never come up against it the inability to see the creatures of other planes and other realms only reinforced that this disbelief created a wall between a human mind and anything that might try to force it via magic what a mage had to do in order to infiltrate a humans mindrather than just cracking it open which was rather damaging and not at all subtlewas to find out just what it was he did believe in fortunately in the case of terrance he believed in god and the church not of course the kind of honest and openhearted belief that would also have protected him no indeed he believed in the comfortable dozinginthepew sort of orthodoxy that promised him heaven in return for the weekly offering and an occasional high tea for the clergy he liked his clergymen modernthat is a fellow who would talk to him about hunting and dogs and fishing and not about uncomfortable things like the state of the poor and the exploitation of the millworker or abstract things like morals and conscience he certainly was not comfortable with those who took too close an interest in the state of his soul but preferred those who reassured him without actually saying anything that his soul was in good repair and a place waited for him in heavena heaven populated by cambridge men who would see his worth at a glance and give him the respect and deference he was simply was not getting here on earth that this heaven would also include plebeians who would fawn over his every word and beg to serve him went without saying so nina put on one of her male guises and went to visit him dressed in the clerical dog collar she appeared round about teatime knowing that if a clergyman presented himself at that hour it was a given that he would be invited to share it by terrances mother and so it was within two minutes of sending in a card father martin was seated on the best horsehair sofa across from mrs kendal and a rather boredlooking terrance nibbling on a watercress sandwich and drinking rather insipid tea it was such a typical example of a stolid middleclass sitting room that it could have been photographed and framed as a representative of its kind the wallpaper was mauve with great cabbageroses climbing all over it the woodwork was dark and shining with wax the furniture was covered in mauve plush there were small tables crowded with curiosities everywhere a table could be put handembroidered firescreens handembroidered cushions handembroidered footstoolsevidently mrs kendal had a great deal of time on her hands and from the paucity of books in the room did not care to pass it in reading mrs kendal was one of those blonde women who looked like roses in their youth but faded rather quickly like a printed chintz that has been washed too many times she was thinnina rather suspected she lived on tea and toast and the occasional bowl of brothher hair was now an indeterminate shade between silver and straw her eyes were the pale blue of a sky with a thin haze of high cloud over it and her voice was scarcely louder than a whisper even her gown seemed a faded black rather than the uncompromising color of full mourning if there had been any less of her she would have been a ghost herself nina had long experience of reading mortals and with the thoughts of those she absorbed and it was easy to categorize this woman very pretty by nature docile she had been taught that was all she had to be in order to achieve the acme of all possible goals a good marriage she had been schooled and catechized within an inch of her life in the most rigid form of religion and frightened by a nanny and teachers and clergymen into a petrified fear of ever being naughty and because of this she made a modest social success of herself her looks eclipsed her timidity and her fear of practically everything was interpreted as shyness and an attractive modesty she went where she was led did what she was told probably responded to her suitors proposal of marriage with all right once married she was bullied by husband parents siblings teachers and son and probably by her own servants she was as afraid of a social faux pas as she was of a sin and to feel anything at all strongly to break the surface serenity of the household was the worst of all social faux pas every household book every tome on proper wifely duties preached this this was at least partly where terrance got his own coldbloodedness she had never had a passion in her life or at least she had never dared to allow herself to feel one and life escaped her because she had never dared to grasp any of it not youth not joy not love or romance the only thing she had felt strongly enough about to try to hold it was her son and she clung to him like a strangling vine which made him all the more determined to shove her aside this of course she refused to see in her world of sentimental ballads and mottoes the few tomes of what passed for fiction that she got from the lending library this was how it was terrance was her darling boy who must of course be devoted to his invalid mother he would never do anything to upset her she had after all devoted her life to him delicate as she was she had no idea that every time she spoke those words she increased his distaste for her company this was not helped by her pathetic conversation the small gossip of the ladies of her charitysewing group timidly ventured opinions on the state of the world that she immediately discarded if terrance frowned complaints about all the foreigners in blackpool tales of woe about the servants as nina listened to her nervous chatter she thought to herself that there must be hundreds of women like her in blackpool alone and that they would be absurdly easy to exploit and devour a little kindness a bit of attention and the right word at the right time would turn women like her into devoted slaves who would passionately defend their chosen idol against anyone that criticized him or even failed to worship at his altar it would have to be a man that attracted their devotion of course that sort of interest in another woman was unhealthy and highly suspicious for no real woman could be so strong as to deserve the slavish devotion of others of her sex like the orphanage nina filed that away in the back of her mind as another rich source of sustenance the disadvantage would be that she would have to be a clergyman of course but a few complaints about the indifference of mrs kendals doctors made her revise that a doctor that had a number of advantages a doctor with a new scheme for invalid womensomething pleasant rather than extreme like vegetarianism or cold water baths or cereal flakes for every meal something involving a great deal of tea and sweets and perhaps opiumlaced cordials but for right now her attention was on terrance with patience and skill she insinuated into mrs kendals mind the idea that the men had important things to talk about things that she was neither clever enough to understand nor worldly enough to bear yet at the same time nina managed to insinuate that father martin did not feel these things though her son might father martin only feared that these matters were too weighty for a creature as delicate as she and actually considered her to be the wisest and most gracious of women so when it was clear that there would be no more afternoon visitors for tea mrs kendal pled her fragile health and left them alone that was when father martin heaved a sigh and leaned forward towards terrance in a confidential manner his expression turning earnest and grave i would not for all the world have wanted your dear mother to hear this he said quietly but i must ask you something man to man what do you know of that dancing woman the russian the one all the papers had stories aboutthe one in that shipwreck you know of whom i am speaking i know nina tchereslavsky terrance said automatically flushing nothing much ive seen her act at the music hall a few times i read the stories in the papers shes accounted to be a handsome enough woman i suppose but certainlyreally father martin she is a dancer in a musichall who shows her limbs to anyone with tuppance when it all comes down to it our paths are scarcely likely to cross and if they did i should hope she would know her place why father martin heaved a great sigh because mr kendal the woman is a jezebel and i have reason to believe she is interested in you terrances eyes lit up and his brow grew moist but he probably thought he had schooled his features into indifference he shrugged me i dont believe i have been to the musichall more than twice or thrice in my lifetime whatever do you mean he did not ask what a less selfcentered man would have asked which was how do you know that he did not ask what a cleverer man would have asked which was why should someone like that be interested in a man who has never so much as sent his card backstage and he did not ask what practically anyone else would have asked which was what business is it of yours he did not ask these things because he was under the impression that the comings and goings and doings of terrance kendal were naturally the interest of all the world he had a fine appreciation of himself and took it for granted that everyone else should if anything he took this as the signal that the world was finally paying him the sort of attention that it should father martin made a tsking sound i make it my business to keep an eye on the creature since she ruined a good young man of my parish i have learned her sordid history on the continent terrance made a kind of shrug that said without words well the continent what would you expect father martin nodded at the shrug you would think that someone as fairylike as she would have a kind heart a sweet nature but no she is steeped in black evil terrance laughed a bit uncomfortably and wiped his brow with his handkerchief oh come now padre i think that is coming a bit strong for what must be the paltry sins of a young lady no better than she should be oh no i use the phrase with full knowledge father martin assured him she makes it her business to find good young men of fine breeding like yourself she smiles at them from the stage lures them into coming to her dressingroom first in the crowd and then alone she makes them fall in love with her she exploits them for every blessed penny they have and when they have exhausted their resources and are one step away from the workhouse she casts them off oh surely not terrance replied looking guilty and sweating more heavily i have the proof father martin replied she has left a trail of tragedy behind her from russia to blackpool madness suicide poverty i attend her every performance now and i noted her interest in you i came to warn you shun her she will devour any young man that comes into contact with her as the spider devours a fly to terrances fascinated ears nina poured out a wealth of tales of the dancing jezebel the more she told him the more his anger grew especially as she waxed eloquent on the material possessions the dancer had seduced out of her suitors he said nothing but she read him like a book now he knew why she had never answered his note somehow she had discovered that he was not the possessor of such wealth as she required and had spurned his advances she deemed him not worthy of her attention the hussy the brazen slut when nina was certain that the fish had taken the bait and the hook was well and truly set she took her leave she had what she needed the entrée into his mind now for the dreams she left terrance with his rage newly roused he would go to bed tonight in a fever of indignation made stronger by the fact that he had no one to speak to about this if hed had a friend they could have commiserated over brandy in the library or even over a pint at the pub but he had no one and as a result he would stew over this and fall asleep after tossing and turning for at least an hour nina had come away with something from that house terrances handkerchief which he had patted across his flushing brow and left on the table now she had the link to him she needed as well as the way into his mind so she waited until well after midnight and then set up her preparations small ones so as not to cause any great ripples in the currents of magic just the handkerchief a mirror and herself full to repletion of power siphoned from another round of vagrants as before she worked without shields or containment circles putting out no more ripples to the currents of power than some servingmaid trying inexpertly to create a lovecharm in fact that was the genesis of this spell an earthmagic lovecharm she stared into the mirror holding the handkerchief and sent a tendril of magic across the city from herself to terrance when she saw his image in the mirror sleeping fitfully in his stuffy bedroom she knew she had him with a smile of satisfaction she began weaving her dreams sending them into his sleeping mind image piled upon fevered image all of them reaching deep into his mind past all of the conventions the manners the morals and into the deepest most primitive parts of his mind in them the dancer featured tantalizing tempting seductive the dreamnina did more than seem to smile at him from the stage she beckoned winked quirked an eyebrow this time terrance went backstage where the dancer no more than half clothed whispered promises and allowed him certain liberties she did not go too far into the realms of sex because she was quite sure terrance was still a virgin but she certainly made the dreamnina exercise all of her wiles on the dreamterrancein his dreams he grew heated restless and aroused yet the dreamnina never got beyond promises and poses while the dreamterrance sweated and lusted and then the rejection and worse the laughter the rejection took place at a grand party dreamterrance was treated with contempt and denied entrance to a gathering to which he had an invitation the invitation said fancy dress and yet everyone else was in evening dress further increasing his humiliation to hide his discomfiture he kept his dominomask on he pushed past the servants at the entrance who turned up their noses at him to find nina in a ballroom surrounded by attentive males they were all laughing uproariously about something as he neared them all too conscious of his inappropriate garments the stares of the other partygoers he overheard something his name followed by a roar of laughter and so i told him fancy dress she crowed and look there he is the pathetic fool what a guy it is then dreamnina turned and looked at him fearlessly you are useless to me little dog she said mockingly you are of less use to me than a pet monkey the monkey at least is amusing you have no money though you pretend to it you have no breeding though you would like us all to think you are loftier than the prince of persia you are stupid and never did more than middling well in any of your schools your head is stuffed with commonplaces you dont know music you dont know anything about art and you dont understand more than half of what is going on around you you are a bore with your middleclass ways and middleclass morals shoo find someone else to put to sleep you cease to amuse and with that she turned away leaving him the center of a circle of people pointing at him and howling with laughter in the mirror he woke up in a cold sweat and nina smiled she was rather fond of that dream and he would continue to have it once a night from this moment on if that didnt tilt him over the edge nothing would ninette sat sidesaddle on a chair and hooked her chin over the back of it her hands resting just underneath her chin she watched jonathon as he sat on the hearthrug of her bedroom carefully crafted a working circle and summoned the shields all without using anything other than a candle and his index finger and she could not see a thing well perhaps a little a kind of vague heatshimmer in the air maybe assuming that wasnt her eyes being very tired after a long morning rehearsal a short afterlunch revision of choreography and a matinee and two evening performances these bankholiday things were terrible everyone got a holiday it seemed except the poor performers and entertainers are there supposed to be flames she asked doubtfully not really no jonathon replied absently it is more the abstraction of fire the energy that is the plane of fire represented here he looked up at her and smiled suddenly i am boring you to sleep arent i no i am only dreadfully tired she replied and eyed jonathons work with longing please tell me you will be done soon very soon he promised but good shields take time and i have learned a trick or two over the years i dont think a creature of any element will be able to pass these if its one of the nasty sort i hope youre right lad because none of us have gotten much sleep lately the cat said from his perch on ninettes bed and if hes not the nasty sort the brownie suddenly appeared in the door arms folded looking daggers at jonathon oh its like you lot forever casting us out of our homes and no one is casting anyone out of his home jonathon snapped have done will you this is tricky enough without a lot of critics standing about the brownie snorted but the cat just curled his forepaws under his chest and half closed his eyes waiting he did not have long to wait no more than five minutes later jonathon grunted in satisfaction and then made a complicated gesture with his fingers for a momentso short a moment that ninette was not entirely certain she had actually seen anythingthe walls of faint heatshimmer flared a hot yellowred like the heart of a burning log then she felt something rush through her taking her breath away for a moment the brownies eyes were as big and dark as the bottom of a bottle of ink for a moment he took a deep breath in a gasp and in that moment ninette found she was holding her breath and did the same bollocks the brownie exclaimed i told you it would be strong and i told you that you would be all right jonathon said with a smug look of selfsatisfaction about him maybe youll believe me next time the brownie snorted and vanished into the kitchen jonathon stood up brushed off his trousers then picked up the candle and blew it out there he said that should take care of any magical intruders you may take your rest mademoiselle he bowed a little from the waist and she giggled a little tiredly and if they are not magical she asked in all seriousness then you may summon a policeman by screaming out a window the magician said carelessly and if they are magical and still pass your boundaries she demanded that he replied already on his way out the door is why you have the pistol it had been a very good day jonathon had gotten a very tricky piece of stage magic equipment that he had bought from an old and retiring performer to work properly at last of course hed been forced to replace every spring in the wretched thing and then work out what tension they should be set at but it had been worth it in the end the panels popped closed so fast that even if you were looking for it you wouldnt see it happen and the noise was easily covered by the band playing a crescendo people werent used to seeing mechanical things accomplish anything fast and in the uncertain stagelight he would have for this business and a burst of a flashpot theyd never realize what had happened even though they looked straight at it which they wouldnt of course hed have his distraction going though he had cursed himself many times for buying the wretched thing in the first place in the end it was worth it the audience would see a young lady vanish before their eyes and reappear across the stage and all without use of a trapdoor in the stage he hated trapdoors anyway unreliable things they were always sticking and you had to depend on stage hands to be sure the mattresses were in place under them and even then it was possible to fall wrong and break an ankle during his apprenticeship to a fine old stage magician the fellows young nephew had done just that and had gone on and walked his way through the rest of the act on an ankle that was months in healing and of course you werent just depending on the trap door to work you had to hope the lift at the other end was also working not to mention what a disaster it would be for ninette to break an ankle no this was better and now it was working he could hardly wait to try it out magicians assistants were always on the small and lean side but ninette was exceptionally small and lean even by those standards and agile he was so excited by the whole prospect it was all he could do to set the trick aside and not demand she cut short her morning lesson with maestro ciccolini to try it out he pondered what he should do to fill his time for a moment he toyed with the idea of calling up a few elementals and sending them out on a search for the person that had sent the homunculus after ninette buthed done that several times already and they had been unable to find a trace of the magician they still hadnt found an earthmaster who could do that sort of thingwhere the blazes were they all anyway was there some sort of official earth master holiday going on he had woken up this morning in a particularly frustrated state of mind for just that reason but nigel had had an idea over breakfast as the maid dished them up eggs and sausages and broiled tomatoes he had looked rather smug much longer and youll be licking the cream off your whiskers arthur had said finally what is it that has set your brains afire old chap is it another idea for the musical production no a new act youve hired not that either well what then i have a nephew of an old chum whos a watermaster whos going to join us hed said and im air and jonathon youre fire go on jonathon had urged youre stating the obvious and being obtuse old man dont torture us any more i beg you or well be forced to fling buns at your delicate cranium well look with three of the four elements all inside one work what we can do is we can pool our resources and look for places our magic is excluded from thats where well find earthbased power operating he looked at them all in triumph it will probably be shields that we see but thats fine well know where he is then jonathon had sat there blinking for a moment and nigel had gotten worried what is it the impresario finally asked what is it that i am missing only that i thought i was supposed to be the clever one hed said full of admiration it was a beautiful plan and had all the virtues of simplicity if they hadnt been needed for bandcall they probably would have still been at the table turning ideas over and over to see what the undersides looked like so as soon as this watermaster arrived theyd be trying to ferret out where this renegade earth master was and deal with him jonathon went to take a turn around backstage where he watched the brotherandsister dance act without really seeing it it would be a great relief all the way around to get this thing dealt with hopefully incarcerated somehow mind all this only fed the fire of a longheld conviction on his part that the elemental masters who were not actually gone to the bad ought to be organized enough to know each other from one end of the country to the other and be able to work together on a regular basis they certainly should be able to call upon one another for help at a moments notice good heavens there was a minister for practically everything else in the government there damned well ought to be a minister of magic even if it meant revealing to the government that magic was real and that terrible things could be done with it but of course trying to get the notoriously reclusive and fiercely independent elemental mages to agree to anything of the sort was rather like trying to in the immortal words of john donne get with child a mandrake root well as it happened that little poetic image donne used wasnt impossible not for an earth master with the right set of skills at least that was what some of the grimoires hed been reading over the years suggested so maybe it wasnt impossible for the elemental masters to get organized maybe if something threw a big enough alarm into them they finally would organize the right place to start might be with the london crowd oh yes they were all peers of the realm or most of them anyway and as a consequence they all chummed around together had hunting parties and concert parties and balls and all that social register folderol together anyway and they had the other sort of hunting party when they thought it was needed like the old medieval lords banding together to go slay a dragon or depose a king it was more or less in their blood maybe he could get them to step up and take charge of all of the elemental masters in the british empire not just their own set he could appeal to noblesse oblige he could suggest they reach out to the masters in london first just as an experiment then go further if the experiment proved fruitful but that would be later when all this was sorted out and in the meantime he could start writing to people and asking for addresses of their friends for the one thing he could do would be to make certain that the story of ninettes father got spread far and wide not that hed been turned into a cat of course that was a secret and he wouldnt betray it but all the rest of itthat much was important for other mages to know about they needed to realize that it didnt take invoking a greater demon on salisbury plain to make another elemental mage dangerous all it took was being ruthless bad and willing to do anything to have your way because once you started having your way what you wanted gradually became larger and larger and affected more and more people this little campaign would take time but moving slowly in this case was a great deal better than running about waving ones proverbial arms and shouting about a danger no one else could see better to just tell the story and let people figure it all out for themselves so that not only would his fellow mages begin to see how dangerous it was to keep on the solitary paths they had been but also how dangerous it was to disregard the power of one overlooked person when it became obvious that she was going to use that power wrongly and it was equally important for the good gentlemen to realize that their womenfolk had the potential to be even more dangerous than most of them imagined in their worst nightmares they were all the more dangerous because they werent taken seriously hell hath no fury indeed he realized with a start that the songanddance turn was over and the dumbshow comic was running through his paces the man himself was affable enough but jonathon didnt much care for that style of comedy shoving his hands into his trouser pockets he went off to the stage door thinking vaguely of some fresh air there was an odd sort of fellow lurking there not the sort one found at a stage door desperately middleclass and trying not to look it cambridge tie but one of the more obscure new colleges one of those that the fellows at trinity would say looking down their long noses oh theyre open to anybody as if that were a sort of veiled insult egalitarian they were not jonathon who had in fact gone to trinity and could if he chose hold his own with the best and worst of the bluebloods found himself both exasperated and in agreement with the attitude because often enough the anybody was someone like this chap who had not gotten a good education because he hadnt gone to cambridge to get one hed gone to get affectations and social connections and to collect reflected glory because for whatever reason he failed to produce any himself hoi he said as the fellow mopped his face with a handkerchief anything i can help you with the fellow started and turned piggy eyes on him ah er not really he said turning the good and useful word into rahlly as he aped the upperclass drawl just curious doncha know stage door is this jonathon knew very well that no one outside the company would recognize him for the sinister magician of his act so he slouched a bit and leaned up against the wall tis he said hands deep into his pockets as he felt for his matches this heres a musical variety hall very posh popular with the toffs the stagedoor porter who guarded the door like a mastiff looked as if he was going to laugh at jonathons act so jonathon continued guessing shrewdly what had brought the man here i ourta warn you theres no messin about with our starladies if thats what ocasioned you to be here inveetation only thats the word we dont allow no loiterin about in the halls in opes of getting into the dressing room neither this is a respectable house you go on down t shipleys if thats your game the fellow perspired more no no he stammered just passing by just curious no harm meant and with that he fled the scene the porter looked after him mouth a little open in surprise wot th hell was he on about the man finally gasped jonathon shook his head probably thinking hed wait until one of the girlacts came out and see what he could get i cant think of any other reason for someone like him to turn up here his sort generally dont take holidays at blackpool and they dont go wandering inquisitively down alleyways to see whats at the back of the buildings he knew what this was and he had something planned when he got here the porter turned redface a masher he said wrathfully bloody ell if he cooms here agin ill send im packin see if i dont jonathon chuckled you might just have a word with the reicher brothers instead he suggested naming the strongman act that used their two sisters as their props it made for a very interesting and surprisingly graceful act actually the young ladies took beautiful poses poised on tiptoe in the palm of one brothers hand then they would collapse bonelessly into his arms to be tossed to the other like a ball you might let it be known that the fellow was asking after their sisters the porter looked at him sideways then broke out into an enormous grin jonathon strolled away whistling nigel had not mentioned that the water master in question was one of the youngest masters in the country it usually took an elemental master decades to come into his full power alan grainger had done so before his twentyfirst birthday now partly that was because alan had applied himself to the study of his element and its magic with the devotion of any artist to the art that consumes him whether that be music painting or the crafting of words part of that was because he came early into his power calling and playing with undines before he could actually talk swimming before he could walk and part of that was to his teachers credit his parents were great water masters in their own right and two of the best teachers nigel had ever heard of alan was the rarest sort of bird there was raised by kind clever people he was kind and clever himself having seen that there were powers he would never command he was modest the pliant nature of water was his flowing around obstacles whenever possible but implacable in force when there was no other way he was also astonishingly good looking had he not been so modest nigel often thought he could have made a fortune on the stage but as selfeffacing as he was nothing would induce him to as he would say make a guy of himself in public it was a very good thing that he was clever but not brilliantly so he did modestly well in school then at university then again he didnt need to be a brilliant scholar his family owned a fine whiskey distillery in scotland he would in due course run it he enjoyed the work understood it and would be happy in it and his studies in history were something he had undertaken because he enjoyed history not because he expected to have to make a living as a teacher or a scholar it was the astonishingly goodlooking part that caused nigel the most amusement he expected that ninette would find him attractive he also expected that something would then occur with regards to jonathon either he would take the same interest as any friend wouldand if he had any sense and the attraction was mutual he would urge ninette to pursue that attractionor he would react with jealousy in either case this would be good for jonathon all this restless vacillation was distracting everyone at a time when they needed to be anything but distracted as for the little dancer well there was no telling what the girl would doexcept that nigel was fairly certain she wasnt the sort to deliberately break a fellows heart and lead him on plus she was french and french women in his experienceif they were the goodhearted sortwere honest in their affaires de couer mind he didnt think that she actually knew what she wanted yet she had plenty of life experience in seeing amour as a business transaction but was pretty heartwhole in that department herself women tended to be fascinated by jonathon the wretched dog it was the stage persona partially women were attracted to dangerous men and even though jonathon was no more dangerous than any other confirmed bachelor and rather less dangerous than confirmed womanizers he appeared dangerous partly it was the challenge here was a personable man welleducated wellspoken at the top of his trade who could not possibly care less about women several of his assistants had over the years fallen into an infatuation with him always he revealed something to them that made them decide that there were better prospects elsewhere on the other hand hed been treating ninette in a way he had never treated another woman before he gave her more respect than any nigel had seen with him before alans mere presence might wake him up to the fact that here was a rival that could compete with him on his own ground if there was a fault that this paragon had it was that alan was well mild he never became passionate about much of anything that might have been his youth but nigel suspected it was his nature this was no bad thing in a water master though nigel sincerely hoped that one day he would find something he cared deeply about be it a cause or another person nevertheless this was what they needed right now alan would not get upset or agitated he would simply apply his mind to the problem at hand and keep at it until they had solved it furthermore alan had the luxury of being able to devote his entire mind to the problem he did not have tricks to work out choreography to create dances and acts to practice a theater to run or an orchestra to keep under control last of all he had the advantage of coming to it with a fresh set of eyes and thoughts a tap at nigels office door caused him to look up and smile broadly alan my boy good to see you there was the young man himself lean and fit a good six feet tall he had a chiseled face with handsome angular features frank blue eyes and hair just a little untidy sir if i may interrupt your work alan began in that scots burr tamed and softened by his terms at university none of that nigel interrupted there will be no sirring here you are our peer in power and it is high time you got used to thinking that way the young mans mild blue eyes lit a little and he smiled very well nigel tis true enough my people at home treat me in that way but i never expect it outside our walls my uncle said only that you had a rather nasty problem and a dangerous one what can i do to help you close the door then come sit down this will take some explaining as nigel laid out the situation that faced them he noted with approval that alan was actually paying close attention he interrupted from time to time and asked nigel to explain some things further finally alan sat back in his chair and absently swept his sandy brown hair off his forehead with his thumb then rubbed his eyebrow a moment this is a puzzler he admitted youre all right though a good place to start would be to hunt for places where our elements are excluded and i have just the tools for that particular task i was hoping youd say that nigel said with relief just one more question and this one is personal so you can tell me im an impertinent brat if you like and that i should keep my nose out of your business alan paused a moment but on getting no reaction from nigel went on why are you spending all this time and effort to protect this girl shes nothing to you and from what youve been telling me she has scarcely enough magic to qualify as such she lied to you from the beginning so why are you repaying deception with trust and protection i tell you now my uncle would likely have turned her out the moment she revealed her falsehoods good questions nigel had been prepared for something of the sort for one thing we like mademoiselle dupond she might have begun with a lie but other than her wild tale of how she arrived on these shores she has been completely honest and aboveboard with us she says that this was all the idea of the cat the cat says the same and i for one believe them its not as if she were a princess caraboo alan the imposture harms no one so far as i can tell and she is a very fine dancer youll see that for yourself shes thrown herself wholeheartedly into this company and stepped into the breech when we lost a few acts earlier in the season thats one reason for another reason she is a legacy alan nodded at that a legacy was the offspring or spouse of an elemental master especially if they had been left without that magician for whatever reason the other mastersat least those in the circles that nigel traveled inregarded such people as the particular responsibility of all other masters this was doubly so if those left behind had no magic of their own granted few masters had any sort of feuds going that would extend to the next generationyet such a thing had been known to happen point taken alan agreed but nigel was not yet finished last of all i will admit to you that i have not only liking for her i have a very solid pecuniary interest in her she has talent she is probably not as good a dancer as the greatest of our time but she is a fine performer and she knows how to charm an audience well heaven knows loie fuller was no kind of dancer either and like loie fuller our ninette gives every bit of value with every atom of talent she has and she works hard performers are rather lazy dogs in my experiencethis girl is not i expect to build many shows with her as the star turn and i expect she will be grateful enough to remain here in blackpool take what i can give her and not what other more wealthy impresarios will offer he nodded at alans uplifted eyebrow oh yes i readily admit to you that i am prepared to exploit her as far as she will let me alan smiled crookedly you mean you will exploit her as far as your own good conscience and her good sense will allow but i can understand a motive like that i am a scot after all very well then i am prepared to accept her as you have and give her the benefit of my abilities well when can i meet the rest of our little group there was a flutter of wings that made alan start and wolf landed on the perch beside nigels desk you can meet two of us now the parrot said tilting his head over sideways so this is the water master a child prodigy i am told you should be familiar with that master wolfgang alan replied recovering quickly quite familiar in fact the bird clicked his beak delightedly so i am well do not emulate me by dying too young and here is arthur who hasnt got the benefit of wings to whisk him through the backstage alan stood up and turned around as the conductor entered the room and shook arthurs hand heartily a pleasure and i wish this were under better circumstances arthur said taking a seat of his own alan shook his head our kind always seems to be meeting under unfortunate circumstances he said sitting down again i met nigel when he was assisting my uncle with a bad bit of business about five years ago in scotland arthur asked and at alans nod continued yes he told me a bit about that very ugly doings someone should have done something about that old man long before he got to be a menace its deuced easier to prevent a disaster than it is to clean up after one well we like our freedom and our privacy north of the border and we dont care to meddle in a mans business if he wants to make a hermit of himself alan countered the worst that could be said of auld geordie was that he was a misanthropist and generally had a quarrel with anyone to cross his path but up until that last he had never done any soul any harm we had rather leave our eccentrics alone weve had more than enough of witch hunting in the bad old days its only when the eccentric goes and calls up ancient evils because his neighbors a better fisherman than he that we feel we need to do something about him dye ken yes but the general populace saw the damned thing and might well have gotten eaten by the damned thing if the masters hadnt acted arthur protested as it is loch ness is going to have a notoriety i much doubt the natives will care for nigel snorted having been up there he was well acquainted with the hardheaded nature of the natives as well as their sly sense of humor and the ability to wring a penny out of stones being scots theyll find a way to exploit it and make money off the sassenach he said without a doubt alan smiled crookedly i expect so he replied comfortably when a scotsman butchers a pig he uses everything but the squeal when presented with a monster hell find a way to make someone pay to strain his eyes looking for it id be very much surprised if this didnt make the papers or at least the pages of the annals of fantastic occurrences once that happens every landlady and publican will be rechalking the order boards with new prices for those who come to gawk then he laughed and every man jack of them will be lamenting that the little castle by the loch is too ruined to rent out and crying pity that you cant charge for taking or painting pictures of it nigel turned to his friend did you manage to pry jonathon and ninette away from the new trick arthur rolled his eyes pry is nearly the right word something or other got misaligned or malfunctioned or something and ninette was trapped in it for a bit nigel frowned that couldnt be no it was not caused by magical interference wolf assured him jonathon and arthur both made sure of that it was nothing more sinister than the usual business with one of jonathons contraptions evidently when he tested it he hadnt allowed for the weight of someone inside nigel shook his head poor ninette arthur shouted with laughter poor ninette poor jonathon rather he had every stagehand and half the acts clustered around him while he tried to get her out all of them offering advice we had to restrain bob anderson from hacking the thing open with a fireax i swear to you a vein was throbbing on jonathons temple by the time he got her out ninette wasnt helping either wolf said merrily well it is a very good thing that ninette is not afraid of the small places said the lady in question causing all the men to rise out of politeness it was not tres amusant but at least i was not feeling that my breath was being stolen she shook hands gravely with alan before taking a seat the cat promptly curled up at her feet and watched the newcomer with unblinking eyes i am mademoiselle dupond as you know and this is the cat thomas they had only just gotten settled when the last of the party showed up nigel immediately felt sorry for him poor jonathon indeed the magicians collar was half off and unfastened his shirt sleeves rolled up and the knuckles of his right hand were scraped and a little bloody damn genius mechanics to perdition he swore bitterly give me an honest craftsman who isnt too concerned with being clever he offered his right hand to alan forgive my shabby appearance but i have been wrestling with someone elses muse the muse almost won the cat remarked i was beginning to think bob was going to have to use that fireax after all if i hadnt got the catch to turn i would have been the one using the ax jonathon replied all is well as ends well nest ce pas ninette said calmly you have discovered the trick of it and i was able to abuse you most amusingly and you could not touch me jonathon shook his fist at her and scowled fiercely and she laughed you frighten me not at all magician where else would you find an assistant of my sort but we should not waste this good young mans time with our silliness she added pardon now you are the water master yes and good nigel has told you of the plague i have brought upon his house i am and he has alan nodded and ninette smiled warmly on him and i have some ideas i would like to share with you allbecause this will need you all before we are through then say on said wolf bobbing his head rapidly you will never have a more attentive audience nina reflected slyly that one of the many many advantages of being what she was and not a human dancer was that she never had to trouble herself with the tedious work of classes and rehearsal if she didnt care to of course when she was dancing with a ballet company she had to attend the company rehearsals it would have looked odd had she not she had not gotten as far as she had by slipping up in so careless a manner she faithfully attended all company rehearsals and all rehearsals with her partners but her mornings given by mortal girls to round after round of endless classes and exercises and the solitary practice of tricky parts in the ballets then being performed were entirely free ostensibly as the great prima she was taking very private lessons and doing her exercises in her own comfortable studio well lit well ventilated warmed by good stoves in the winter and catching cooling breezes through opened windows in the summer and of course she always took care to have such a studio with a gramophone in place of a pianist all very grand but of course she never used it and now thanks to the fact that she was not a frail little mortal she was able to devote all of her time to the battle with the imposter when a human would have been forced to continue those classes and lessons in order to stay at the top of her form but all nina had to do in order to restore muscle strength tone and flexibility was to assume the form she had stored in her memory of the ballet dancer she had taken when the girl was at the peak of her abilities and in the best of health in fact once on a lark when the season had concluded and other dancers were taking concert venues and tours she had decided to truly indulge herself after all she had been between benefactors and she had never yet tried the socalled sin of gluttony so during the glorious month of june she had spent the time getting enormously fat eating every good thing she ever cared to try and of course when the company gathered together again she was back instantly to her slim trim self with never a hint that she had ever so indulged gluttony she thought was overrated these things were pleasant to eat but they gave nothing like the rush of feeling and power when she absorbed a victim so it was without the need to dance or to attend rehearsals that nina assumed the schedule she preferred sleeping until noon rising late and going out to pursue her various tasks and needs by night she had chosen her dwelling with an eye to being able to get in and out without any of the neighbors noticing especially at night in a way this was turning out to be one of the most comfortable times of her life in all truth she was able to hunt and consume whenever she wantedwhich was nightlywithout worrying about a protector catching her away from the luxurious flat he was keeping her in or worse catching her at her feast she had no performances to concern herself with so she could hunt from sundown to sunup if she chose she had the wherewithal for the luxuries she had grown fond of and the leisure to enjoy them without rehearsals taking up her time or protectors hovering over her this was in many ways a glorious life of freedom that she was actually enjoying it occurred to her more than once that the girl had actually done her a favor waking her up shaking her out of herself reminding her of what she truly was it was so easy to get immersed in a human life to think of it as the beall and endall rather than the means to an end sometimes she too was very foolish and the truth was if the imposter had not stolen her identity she might well have had done with nina tchereslavsky in the not too distant future human lifespans were very short and the practical life of a dancer shorter still what injuries or illness did not cut short simple old age generally did she had already begun attracting a few comments mostly spiteful and from those who wished to take her place in the limelight about how well preserved she was it was very likely that within the next two or three years she would have been forced into counterfeiting her own death as she had so many times in the past and assuming a new persona that was the awkward part of this curse it she did not age naturally but mortals did the first and best way to be noticed in an unpleasant fashion was to seem not to age she had always been able to find a way to transfer her accumulated wealth and goods to the new persona before but well this time it was going to be awkward she was well known if she died and left her possessions to someone no one had ever heard of there would be questions worse if she died and the bulk of what she had owned turned up missing there would be even more questions she had been looking into the fabrication of a distant relative but now she would not have to no one knew her here in this country for all they knew she was no older than the twenty years she appeared to be rather than the forty that nina would have been if she were actually alive furthermore she had two strings to this bow if she could manage to get the girl alone for just long enough she could simply assume her appearance and identity that was the riskier of the two because the masters protecting her might be able to tell the difference before she killed them or she could do what she had come here to do in the first place expose the imposter for what she was and use the notoriety to engineer herself a brand new career in england where no one knew her history and where she could go on dancing and attracting wealthy old men for at least twenty or thirty more years by then she could establish a daughter and in due course the daughter would inherit her famous mothers estate a shy retiring daughter plain studious the sort that attracted no male attention of her own the sort that preferred to remain closeted up with her books and not be seen too often shortsighted with enormous glasses calfclumsy and ill at ease in company no one would wonder why she was so seldom seen there would have to be a husband of course that was easily arranged and the husbands tragic death soon after the birth how to arrange a baby buy one of course a fat bribe to an orphanage a false name and it would be done no need for messy things like a human birth then absorb it once the fiction had been established no one of any consequence wanted to see babies or infants they were messy noisy unregulated creatures best left to the attentions of wetnurses and nannies that would hold things for at least three or four years until the child would be presumed presentable for brief moments of time to adults at intervals then she would get one of those workhouse children trot it out for inspection and absorb it when she no longer needed it a teenager she could counterfeit herselfand easy enough to arrange rare appearances when her mother was supposed to be sleeping or dressing or otherwise not immediately available for company in fact the whole art would be to find a way to present herself that would not arouse sympathy but would at the same time make it clear just why her putative child was never seen in polite society rabbity little red eyes she decided big thick glasses and rabbity little redrimmed eyes she would say that the light bothered her always and gave her headaches no not say it she would whine it for a few moments more she found herself so immersed in the details of her next life that she forgot there were the details of this one to sort out before she could move onwards it was only when the maidcreature brought in the morning mail which included a large flattish box postmarked from her flat that she gave herself a mental shake and attended to the present the contents of this package were going to provide her with the makings of the last distraction and it would be one that they would never ever anticipate she smiled as she cut the string and opened it up to make sure that her servantcreatures had not left anything out michael peterson was not the sort of solicitor that was accustomed to seeing handsomely and expensively dressed women in his outer office and he could not account for the one that was there now his clients were more apt to be balding middleclass gentlemen with querulous dispositions and uncertain stomachs apt to take offense and equally apt to fire off a slander or libel suit or a breachofcontract case when sufficiently roused by real or imagined slights michael encouraged them in this after all he got paid whether or not the case had any merits such things could stretch on for some time particularly when he and his opposition were in collusion to make them stretch on it was not however the most rewarding of lawpractices there were times as now when he would look across the road through the window of his chambers to the chophouse with longing knowing that he would have to satisfy his hunger with the cheese sandwiches he had brought with him and furthermore was the penance that tonight he would either have to boil an egg and make toast in his room or manage to get through whatever glutinous stewlike creation his landlady had concocted greasy vegetables boiled to bits and with only a nodding acquaintance with meat his clients at the best of times would not bring in the sorts of fees that supported beefsteak dinners and tidy flats with a cook and a housekeeper now they were in a litigious lull and that was not good for him so when the lovely woman dressed in garnetcolored silk responded to his invitation to enter his office sans appointment he truly did not expect that she was going to offer him worktruth to tell he thought she was from some charity and looking to get a subscription from him he would not be rude to her no matter how insane her charity because some day she might be the cause of him getting more work no he would be polite let his barren office speak mutely for him and beg her forgiveness for not having brass to spare for her cause and at least he would have had the pleasure of the company of a stunning woman for half an hour so it was with growing astonishment that he listened to her outlining not the plight of abandoned orphans or sheepdogs or african savages but the whole of a fascinating and wildly unlikely tale she was so stunningly beautiful so he would have listened to her no matter what she said she was small dainty with a mass of dark hair done up in some complicated braided style that looked like a crown and penetrating eyes that seemed to change in color as her mood changed her nose was just a trifle too long but that made her face interesting rather than merely pretty if she was to be believed and was not wildly insane it was the most sensational case that he was likely to get his hands on for this woman claimedand the papers she brought with her seemed to bear her story outto be the real nina tchereslavsky and the one currently performing at the palais royale wasan imposter a fraud who had stolen this prima ballerinas name and reputation and was battening on both who was the fraud really this woman did not know michael vaguely recalled the stir when the girl was washed up after a shipwreck speaking nothing but russian and a bit of french so it did seem that these two dancers were in fact both russian and that seemed too much for mere coincidence this woman only asserted that her imposter was someone she did not know it seemed completely impossible for first of all how would an unknown russian dancer come to blackpool in the first place why not go somewhere that there were proper ballet troupes like london secondly why should she claim she was someone of whom blackpool knew nothing the cachet of being a russian ballerina was not that impressive particularly not in a music hall and in the third place why enter music hall at all why not attempt to get a part with a ballet or opera company there was an opera company at least in blackpool why hadnt she gone there and that brought them full circle again why here and why not london and yet because it seemed so outrageous so unlikely it conversely became to him the more believable but by itself it would hardly impress anyone much less a judge michael turned over the documents that had been presented one by one it was a fairly thick portfolio together they formed a curious collection the first lot were pressclippings interesting but not particularly useful in and of themselves since the photographs could have been of almost anyone and the sketches were of someone who had no real distinguishing features to say the least and how difficult would it be to assemble such a collection one could subscribe to bureaus that collected these things for you the documents in the second set were more useful personal letters from various men of wealth and rank the problem was though all of them began with nina and ended with the gentlemans name they were all in foreign tongues and where he was going to find someone in blackpool who could reliably translate russian he did not know there were plenty of russian exiles but whom could he trust to give him accurate translations and not merely write down what they were told to say and again how difficult a thing would these be to counterfeit if they were love letters it would be one thing it was unlikely that she would dare present such a thing and very likely they would be repudiated but a simple letter of admiration for her skill in dancing no man would really care and no gentleman was likely to make the long trip to blackpool england merely to verify that the letter was genuine so while interesting these were of no particular value the third set however it was the habit of people in these days to buy photographic portraits of particularly beautiful women to ornament their walls with now many of these were of young women who had no particular thing to recommend them except their beauty they were in fact known as pbs or professional beauties and all they were required to be was lovely amiable with impeccable manners and of at least moderate breeding enough so that they could reasonably be invited to elite social gatherings to add sparkle like a bouquet of exquisite flowers that the crown prince generally at least made the effort to add them to his evergrowing collection of mistresses went without saying though not all of them succumbed to him but others among the muchphotographed were professionals of the stage actresses mostly but dancers were included and even a few opera singers and the last set of these photographs were of the dancer nina tchereslavsky in costume as so far michael could tell various fairies harem girls spirits and princesses at least he guessed by the tiny crowns that they were princesses for all he knew they could have been aquatic waterfowl or flowers these photographs were plainly labeled some in the queer letters the russians used but most in good lettering readable by civilized people mlle nina tchereslavsky odette mlle nina tchereslavsky la sylphide mlle nina tchereslavsky raymonda now these could be counterfeited too but it was less likely those costumes had to be fitted to each dancer and it wasnt likely that someone would have all these things sitting about in a wardrobe somewhere so although the photographs were designed to show off the legs rather than the face still the face was clear so taken allinall the entire portfolio argued powerfully that the owner was in fact the real dancer i wouldnt advise you to take this into a court of law mademoiselle he said finally closing the portfolio she looked startled and a little angry but is that not what you do she snapped thisthis creature has taken my name my place my reputation i have been forced to cancel a contract because of this i had to pay an enormous sum is this not a thing for the courts i should have said not yet mademoiselle he soothed we will eventually of course but our first strategy should be to take this to another court entirely that of public opinion we should make a sensation of this so that when it does get into court it will be noticed and this would be good she asked doubtfully oh very good very good indeed he told her earnestly and i know just the newspaper too and in truth he did he had used them before on other cases but of course there was no competition between a case featuring a balding old man and one featuring not just one beautiful dancer but two and this will help me she persisted better than a trial her folded his hands atop the papers and peered earnestly at her she stared at him for a moment and for some reason suddenly her eyes seemed very cold very alien despite the fact that her eyes should have seemed lovely but they werent lovely they were cold ah but that did not matter what mattered was in this portfolio we will take your story to a newspaper he continued they will place the truth before the public and the public will see this imposter will be routed there may never need to be a trial but if there is many of the jurors will have seen these photographs and they will know the truth very well she said finally you may call your newspapers nina was not nearly as reluctant as she had seemed she was in fact not at all interested in going to court a lawsuit seemed to her to be an inordinate waste of time and effort although the threat of one would take little effort on her part yet would agitate her enemies no end but this the idea of using sensationcraving newspapers to hound her foesthis was sheer brilliance it was all she could do to keep from insisting the solicitor run straight out and bring in people from these newspapers on the spot instead she curbed her impulses and pretended reluctance this was not unlike allowing a protector to acquire her she would make them court her coax her she had ample practice in being the one sought after she allowed the solicitor to persuade her and to arrange a meeting with a newspaper reporter for the next day she reluctantly allowed him to keep her portfolio there was only one thing that she was annoyed about she had been certain she would be able to persuade one or more of her devoted adherents to make the journey to blackpool to verify her identity but they all sent regrets it seemed that her hold over them was not strong enough at a distance to cause them to abandon good sense and speed to her rescue it might not in fact hold them at all she had never really had occasion to test it it had always seemed to her that human mortals the men in particular were easily manipulated and entranced well it was an annoyance and something that could be worked around what she could do easily enough and in fact had was to order her servants at home to bribe and browbeat one of the stagehands into coming to stand surety for her identity it was difficult for a poor man especially one who was no longer young to look at more money than he could earn in twenty years and not turn it down so this man a common fellow named jannos durzek was already on his way here by train and boat she would have to find a translator of course she would have to find one anyway for the hungarian and russian and czech letters all this was running through her mind as she arrived at the solicitors office for her meeting with the newspaper man she had put forth a great deal of effort to look her best and at the same time to look every inch the prima there must be no doubt in this mans mind that he was in the presence of a great dancer even if he had never heard of her nor had any ideas about ballet the man in question was sitting in the solicitors office when she arrived he took his time about getting to his feet eyeing her with an insolence that made her seethe if she had not needed him she would have slapped that expression from his face then ambushed him in the night and absorbed him perhaps she would anyway when she no longer needed him he was a very unprepossessing man no longer young yet holding himself as if he felt he were much younger than his actual years his suit was slightly rumpled and though hardly of the best quality was definitely of the most modern cut most gentlemen would have considered it a touch too loud he did not remove his hat of the type known as a derby in her presence a fact that she resented perhaps he was ashamed to his mousey brown hair looked rather thin and needed a trim badly his face wore what looked to be a perpetual smirk as if he considered himself ever so much more intelligent than most of the people he encountered his complexion was starting to show the effects of hard drinking and his eyes narrow and shrewd were just a little bloodshot she allowed him reluctantly to shake her hand then took a seat immediately he began going over the papers in her file one by one asking her pointed and detailed questions about all of them some of his questions were impertinent and she felt her temper rising he seemed to be amused by this and the more amused he became the more she was determined to give him the punishment he so richly deserved when she no longer needed him finally he shoved her portfolio of papers aside i like this story he said bluntly ill take it on he would not be pinned down to how soon he intended to publish the storyor rather what would probably be the first of several stories this will be a fight he warned they are not simply going to say oh dear you caught us its a fair cop and reveal the girls true name they are going to demand proof what you have here he tapped the portfolio is good but hardly conclusive it could all be fabricated and i expect them to point that out but ill think of something you can do i am sure he was so arrogant assuming that she would not be able to think of anything for herself and how on earth was he remaining proof against her magicenhanced charm that baffled her as much as his attitude infuriated her she would kill him she would not merely absorb him as she did with most of her victims taking them unaware and rendering them unconscious first she would do it while he was aware and conscious and she would do it slowly oh how she wished she did not need him she parted company with him and with the solicitor once again leaving the portfolio this time in the reporters possession she was stiffly correct and as she shook hands coldly with the man he dared to grin at her you dont care for me miss he said baldly well i dont care much for you i expect youre accustomed to men dancing attendance on you and being your lapdogs youre told what a tremendous artist you are and all of that tommyrot well to me youre the same as that girl that you say is using your name and youre both of you no better and no worse than the cancan dancer on the boardwalk all three of you pull up your skirts and kick and show your legsyou and that girl just pretend its more refined which to my mind makes the cancan dancer the more honest of the three of you but i know a story when i see one and this one is worth chasing after you need me and i need you so you may glare all you like and ill sneer all i like but the story will still get printed and well see what kind of a dustup we can start rigid with anger she left the solicitor at her elbow apologizing for the reporter babbling almost about how his manner was rough but he was the best in the city how dogged he was in pursuing facts and how fair he was in laying them out the solicitor kept up this babble all the way to the street where he hailed a taxi for her as he handed her into it nina finally spoke if this were saint petersburg she said wrathfully i would horsewhip him until he bled from a hundred cuts he is an ignorant peasant but he has a peasants cunning and i believe you when you say he will write the stories to expose this imposter but keep him from me you deal with him i would rather feed pigs with my own hands than speak with him again notions of increased fees doubtlessly dancing in his head the solicitor hastily agreed and she directed the taxi back to her flat the first thing she did when the door was shut and locked tightly behind her was to transform to her true form with a roar of rage her garments did not so much tear as burst asunder with the sound of shredding silk her servants already knew what to do they had surely felt her anger for the last hour at least they performed exactly as she expected them to they had clearly prepared for her and now they fled before her and opened the door to the cellar with cringing deference she stood on the top step as they closed the door behind her and listened to the whimpering of terror from below the troll bared her teeth in a parody of a smile her servants had chosen well not one but three victims cowered in the corners of the cellar trying to somehow become one with the rough brick walls her eyes adjusted to the darkness and she assessed the two slatternly women and the man awaiting her pleasure by the tattered finery and the display of cleavage by the tooloud cheap suit and the air of a bully who finds himself in the power of someone unexpectedly stronger than he she had a good notion of who her servants had plucked off the street for her two prostitutes and she supposed the man was their procurer mistress one of the servants said through the door we brought the women here the man followed he broke in and threatened us and demanded money she smiled good she would take him first and she would make him last a long long time this was going to be no simple absorption tonight she was going to feed ninette was summoned in the middle of her exercises to nigels office puzzled because she could not imagine what could have warranted such an interruption she quickly toweled herself off and threw on her dress without bothering to tidy her hair or take off her rehearsal tights and demipointe shoes there she found nigel arthur wolf and jonathon all bent over something on nigels desk and the humans at least looking rather grim what is amiss she asked feeling uneasy as they all turned to look at her we have an unexpected problem arthur replied stabbing his finger down at what was now revealed to be a foldedback section of a newspaper there were several more like it on the desk arthur picked this one up and handed it to her the first thing she saw was her own publicity photograph taken in her costume of the tudor rose dance dancer revealed a fraud shouted the headline her heart in her mouth she skimmed through the article as best she could wrestling with the english quickly she got the gist of the matter the real nina tchereslavsky had turned upand how had that happenedand the reporter was trumpeting the fact that ninette was an imposter he did not quite go so far as to claim her shipwreck story was the fabrication they all knew it was but it would not take much for people to wonder about that too at the bottom of the article was the photograph of the real nina tchereslavsky in a costume of the rose fairy from sleeping beauty ninette stared at it numbly all right what are we going to do nigel demanded it is not exactly a front page matter at the moment but if there is a day that has not got a lot of news in it the story very well could soon be there should we you are going to brazen it out said thomas the cat strolling into the room in a leisurely manner eyeing the top of the desk for a moment before leaping up to it in a lithe bound take a look at those photographs do you think i chose that particular dancer at random for ninette to impersonate five heads bent over the newspapers all of them analyzing the two pictures as ninettes panic started to ebb she looked over the two side by side and after a moment she nodded she looked up to see the same conclusion in the faces of the rest all things considered there is not a great deal of difference between the two of them nigel admitted all ballerinas tend to look a great deal alike the cat pointed out thats out of necessity they have to be petite light boned thin they tend to have very large eyes and stage makeup exaggerates that that newspaper man made a grave mistake in choosing to echo ninettes rose costume with the other womans the pictures could easily be of the same dancer in different costumes so the obvious course here is to make the counterclaim that this woman is the imposter nigel stared at the cat youre not joking are you i never joke i sometimes make witty remarks often sarcastic ones but i never joke not where ninette is concerned no i think you should brazen it out claim that this woman is the imposter what possible motive could she have for impersonating ninette i mean nina arthur ran his hands through his hair this is very confusing the cat raised his chin ninette is very successful here she is one of the main attractions to this theater and when your new musical play is finally performed that popularity will only increase now remember if you will that people are insular it does not matter to a londoner that a performer is popular in new york he might go once to see the man but unless all london decides he is good the average londoner will not go a second time what are you saying arthur asked puzzled that we should forget entirely what anyone in berlin or new york or even paris thinks that we should forget what a balletomane thinks ninettes audience does not go to ballets and does not care what the rich people that do would have to say about this we need to concentrate on what blackpool thinks i see what you are saying nigel replied slowly blackpool thinks that what blackpool says and does and has opinions about is of the first importance in the world the cat nodded with satisfaction precisely so when we go and speak to your friends in the newspapers here we must be firm in saying that our nina is the real one and that this imposters attempt to take her place is motivated by the greed for the position ninette has achieved here what dancer would not wish to be in that position that any sensible person from outside blackpool or knowledgeable about ballet would find this laughable has no bearing this will not even be a ripple in the london papers but it might well move into greater importance here perhaps as you yourself pointed out even a front page story if there are no accidents fires murders or notorious robberies no i think that the best thing we can do is respond with affronted dignity and a touch of scorn the cat licked a paw thoughtfully and one never knows with dancers they often become hysterical over absolute nonsense she might indeed decide for herself that what you are building for ninette is of the primary importance to her hysterical over nonsense ninette looked incensedand then flushed ah mais oui the review in la figaro and who knows somehow the cat managed to shrug we do not know how her reputation is faring on the continent it might be sinking she cannot be young it might be that to become the star of a music hall in blackpool has become the height of desire for her in any event we very much need to make use of every chink in her armor including that the cat looked up at them all this does have the potential to do us a great deal of good if we can keep our heads about us and ninette can be kind and gracious and say very little about what her life in russia was like i can do that ninette said ruefully since i have no notion of what it could have been like you should describe what it was like in paris only dont mention any real names jonathon said firmly a dancers life is always the same no matter where she is from only in moscow the winters are very long there are heaps of snow and it is always terribly cold make much of that ninette and the cat both nodded jonathon that is an excellent suggestion she could contrast our lovely weather with that of moscow in the winter ninette above all you must make much of how happy you are what a fine place blackpool is and how much you love the audiences here that will be of no difficulty ninette replied it is all true she looked about her at the men who had become such supporters and friends in such a short time and unexpectedly her eyes filled with tears one could not ask for better friends than you i feel as if i have fallen into a fairy tale yes well fairy tales have ogres nigel grumbled we havent conquered ours yet we dont even know who it is all the more reason not to allow this to distract us think of it as a diversion and not any sort of serious difficulty they must have more evidence than just those photographs jonathon pointed out they may but they do not have me the cat looked uncommonly smug i will say no more jonathon gave him a measuring look you are altogether too sly master thomas he said severely i am a cat was the selfsatisfied reply i do not know why i ever listened to you wolf groaned from under arthurs coat because i am cleverer than you the cat replied all three of the coconspirators were in a pub opposite the building housing the flat of the fellow who had written the first article they had discovered by the simple expedient of buying a few drinks at the pub for his thirsty colleagues that the man never kept anything he considered to be important at his desk in the newspaper offices he was not well liked there he never shared sources and never put anyone else on to a good story even if he never intended to follow it up himself that meant that anything he had gotten from nina in the way of files and proof would be in his flat they were waiting until he left for the evening they had ensured that he would be gone long and not in very good condition when he returned simply by ensconcing jonathon there in one of his many disguises and with heavy pockets by simple expedient of seeming to be a fellow who had won a great deal of money and standing rounds for the entire pub jonathon should keep him there and drinking for a good long time without ever raising the mans suspicions by being singled out there he is muttered arthur as the fellow in question sauntered out into the fine spring evening looking oddly both satisfied and irritated but from all accounts he was a disagreeable man perhaps this irritation was his natural state they watched as he strode down the street heading right in the direction of his favorite wateringhole they waited a good long time just to make sure he wasnt coming back that he hadnt forgotten anything that he hadnt changed his mind as the dusk turned to darkness and the lamplighters came aroundthis part of the city hadnt been electrified yetarthur and the cat took advantage of the shadows to slip across the street and into the narrow passage between the two housesturnedflats wolf freed himself from arthurs coat and flew up to the third story to land on a ledge he left it open right enough wolf said softly and flew back down give me the string he ordered arthur in a peremptory tone wordlessly arthur handed the bird a bit of fishing line wolf flew up to the ledge disappeared inside then emerged again as the string ran out from the coil arthur held when the bird was perched again on his shoulder he took the string back its around the leg of the desk wolf said as soon as his beak was clear that ought to be enough to hold one small cat its salmon line it ought to hold two of me thomas replied he waited while arthur fastened the straps of a harness around him and wolf flew up to the ledge a third time vanishing inside with the harness fastened to the fishing line and gloves on arthurs hands to prevent it cutting into his fingers the musician hauled the cat jerkily up the side of the building with all four legs dangling limply they had all thought about having thomas try and help but then thought better of it only when the cat actually reached the ledge itself did he hook claws up onto it and haul himself up the line was easily bitten through by wolfs sharp beak after a moment the line came falling down and arthur coiled it up and put it in his pocket then he waited he could hear very faintly sounds from up above thomas and wolf had determined via trials in nigels office that there was very little short of a safe that a cat and a parrot could not get into what was more they had decided that they would rifle the entire flat to make it look as if someone had been searching for valuables those were probably the sounds he was hearing after a very long time or so it seemed in the darkened passageway arthur heard a whistle and immediately afterwards a piece of paper startlingly white in the shadows came drifting down from above now he was very busy indeed as a veritable shower of papers came down they had determined that they were not going to steal only the information about nina they were going to take everything that looked to be of any importance that way the man would not be aware that it was the ballerinas papers that they were after arthur had brought a briefcase with him and by the time the last of the papers was gathered up it was stuffed quite full indeed finally after some more sounds of implied mayhem from above including the tearing of cloth came what he had been waiting for ready for me came the question into his mind as ready as i am likely to be he whispered back mind your claws and he braced himself with an impact that made him stagger the cat landed on his shoulder he ended up against the wall breath driven a little out of him it isnt me that minds the claws it is you the cat replied with the sense that he was laughing i think that is the most fun i have ever had since i was a boy and stealing apples hes a hoodlum that one wolf said severely flying down to land on arthurs other shoulder it will be most of a day before that fellow can clean up enough to figure out just what is missing what did you two do arthur asked easing his way out of the passageway carefully making sure there was no one in the street to see him when he did so we tilted over and knocked to the floor every book and ornament we could move we spilled his inkwell i knocked over the pitcher of water at his washstand we pulled the covers off the bed we scattered all the papers that were not in the files and overturned a chair or two i uncovered all the food that i could in the pantry and the mice are already at it but that was not enough for thomas oh no thomas slashed every pillow and cushion in the flat tore open the featherbed and the eiderdown and then shook what he could lift like a terrier with a rat wolf said and as if that was not enough he asked me to flap as hard as i could the parrot could not smirk but he barked a sound like a laugh it looks like a snowstorm struck in there the man might find a way to clean it all up in a day or two but it will take a small army of maids to do it it took nigel some patient work to sort ninas papers out of the rest but when he was finished he had a very tidy stack all of them sat contemplating it this could be very useful the cat pointed out nigel frowned but if i use them theyll know we were the ones that took them he closed his eyes for a moment let me think about this if we use them it has to appear that we had them before the real nina appeared now how can i do this they all waited ninette holding her breath over the time that she had been here she had seen nigel say something about thinking watched him close his eyes then come up with something brilliant roughly three times it had become apparent after the second time that he was not a successful impresario by accident nor because he used his magic to make himself one he was a shrewd businessman with when he needed to invoke it the ability to see a way to do something that no one else would have thought ofor at least no one else would have thought of in as short a period of time the others all must have been used to this as well since everyone even wolf remained completely quiet traffic noise from the street below came in through the open windows filtered slightly by the gold gauze curtains there that kept the insects out a newsboy cried the latest edition from the corner and that was when nigel opened his eyes and smiled it was to jonathon he turned i need one of our smartest boys he said two if you can manage it they have to be clever a bit manipulative and sly baker street irregulars if you will jonathon grinned unexpectedly i know just the lads he said i use them myself as often as i can and i thoughtwell this is for later but i thought we might put them in the act i could do with a couple of apprentices nigel tilted his head to the side youve always said you didnt need that was when i was going to be traveling about all the time nigel interrupted flushing i didnt want to have to keep track of a damned boy on trains and boarding houses and strange theaters but when this scheme of yours blossoms well be a repertory company the whole theater will be keeping an eye on them never mind that now you want scott merry and stubbins theyre thick as thieves those two and smart as they come scottys the older by about a year whats the plan for them nigel was already separating out the material into four piles i am going to want them to somehow sneak these into the files at the four major newspapers i want it to look as if when we first engaged ninette that i sent these publicity materials to the newspapers by then the whole brouhaha of her being found on the shore had died down so this would have been by way of a reminder to them that she was a great dancer on the continent he removed folders from a drawer of his desk and wrote ninas name the name of the theater the words biographical material and a date on each of them then filled each folder from one of his piles jonathon shook his head in admiration and arthur beamed brilliant the musician crowed and when we go to those papers to say that we have no idea where this imposter came from they will go to their files find this and be convinced we gave it to them long before this woman appeared nigel beamed himself it was an infernally clever idea now ill want the boys to put these in almost the right place so that its logical to have been overlooked let me get them jonathon said and took off he returned with two boys somewhere between twelve and fourteen years old one taller with black hair was obviously scotty which meant the other a smaller darker boy with an innocent face until you saw the gleam of mischief in his eyes must be stubbins nigel explained what he wanted and to ninettes astonishment why he wanted it although he didnt reveal that ninette was the imposter herself nor that the materials were stolen now maybe this seems dishonest nigel concluded sounding doubtful scotty snorted bloody well it dont he replied no reason thev given em this stuff before the big show right guvnor cept now we gots this gel yappin bout how shes the real mamselle an if we gives em the papers now they says well ycoulda just got all this anywhere an were still lookin bad but if they gots the papers and thinks they gots em afore this gel shows up then bobs yer uncle aint dishonest stubbins mumbled jest puttin things roight he cast a sideling glance at ninette mamselle ninas one uv us aint she so we gotter take care uv er all right then nigel said brightly heres the papers and heres a few shillings for you twoit will probably take all day and youll need some luncheon and money for the bus off you go report directly to me soon as you get back ninette smiled to herself knowing that nigel had given the boys at least twice as much as they needed and had given them no deadline to meet he had in essence awarded them with a bit of a holiday and the money to make it a rather jolly one at that she felt terribly touched by stubbins mumbled assertion that she was one of them too do you think they can manage it she asked jonathon who rolled his eyes and laughed those two they mastered my cabinet in an hour and they know more sleightofhand tricks than any boys their age should command it is a good thing that they are fundamentally honest because they could pick a mans pocket while he stood there looking at them i expect the shillings will run out about dark nigel said comfortably expect them back then scotty scrupulously divided the coins between the two of them before they left by the stage door and they both took a moment to gloat over the windfall cor scotty stubbins said with enthusiasm think on it theres ices an bullseyes an kendal mint cake an catapults each an we kin go to th tower an job first scotty said solemnly we gotter do this fast an smart like sherlock holmes boys baker street regulars supplied stubbins who read as much or more than scotty did right so t be smart we shouldnt oughta do the same thing twice so how kin we do this four difrent ways all the way to the first newspaper office sitting up on the top of an omnibus the two plotted and planned like the pair of old campaigners they were both had come to the theater off the street as crossingsweepers a place like a theater always had need of honest and reliable errandrunners and the old fellow at the stage door had been directed to find a couple both took all their money home to share with enormous families both were acutely aware of how lucky they were to be where they were master nigel made sure everyone in the theater got fair wages he didnt demand a share of tips and he regularly put things in the way of those that needed them whether or not he realized it master nigel had engendered intense loyalty in his little fiefdom there was not a man or woman in that theater who would not have stood between master nigel and a runaway elephant having been singled out for particular service made the two boys feel rather like a pair of king arthurs knights right out of the panto this was made even more acute by the fact that the job was to be done for mamselle nina now there were plenty of acts that had passed through the imperial acting like they were royalty not mamselle she was as scotty put it a rightun treated everyone fair said if you please and thank you never looked down her nose at anyone and when she wanted something out of the ordinary you knew there was going to be an extra penny in it for you everyone knew she was going to be the star turn when the big show got trotted out but she never acted like she thought it was her due truth to tell both scotty and stubbins were just a little bit in love with her who wouldnt be she looked like a little china doll pretty as a fairy and nice as nice so both of them were going to put a lot of effort into making sure things went right for herand it made them feel even more knightly or maybe like sherlock holmes or a combination of sherlock holmes and raffles the first office they came to was so busy it had been easy for two boys who looked like they knew what they were doing to mingle with the rest of the crowd there were plenty of boys their age employed in such places messages needing taken things needing to be fetched careful listening led them to the desk of the fellow that wrote up reviews and other artistic stuff the boys waited until he left his desk for something then slipped their folder under a big pile of stuff that was already there they left that office no more than three quarters of an hour after they had arrived one down three to go at the second office scotty who was older engaged the little girl in charge of putting files away in a mild flirtation while stubbins slipped ninas file in among the rest of those she had waiting scotty broke off the conversation reluctantly when stubbins was finished and privately resolved to come back when he wasnt on a mission two down they were halfway done and it wasnt even luncheon yet office number three presented a bit of a challenge there was a man at the door and it was clear he was there to keep out interlopers they both eyed the fellow from a distance scotty frowning furiously i dunno he said finally this un got it stubbins crowed in triumph looking at something or someone just past scottys shoulder he darted out before scotty could say anything scotty turned to see a youngish man burdened with a huge pile of books and papers coming towards the guarded door in a flash scotty knew what was going to happen and it did stubbins rushed past the young man brushing up against him just closely enough to knock his burden out of his hands but not so closely that he ran into the fellow he kept going as the pile toppled to the floor as if he was in such a hurry he couldnt be bothered to look back scotty ran out to lend the man a hand they commiserated on the rudeness of some people scotty piled up his arms full of papers and files again and they parted except of course the young man now had the third copy of ninas file in the stack he was so carefully balancing number four was absurdly easy they arrived just about luncheontime and everyone that could was running out for a bite scotty merely walked up to the wall of file cabinets found the drawer for t and inserted ninas file between titian and toulouse their work done they escaped into the sunshine outside ambling away with their hands in their pockets as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened only when they were well away from the building did they look at one another and burst out laughing thenkee mr holmes scotty said doffing an imaginary hat thenkee mr raffles stubbins replied with glee now about them ices reckon we earned em dont you scotty replied stubbins nodded reckon we did i suppose youre wondering why i called you all here said alan grainger looking distinctly uncomfortable jonathon who knew exactly why the young water master had called them all togetherbecause the cat had told himdid his best to keep any tone of smugness out of his voice didnt find our earthmage eh he said instead in as neutral a tone as possible but he couldnt help but gloat inside so the young genius hadnt had any more luck than his elders hard not to feel a bit sorry for him especially when he looked at ninette and flushed poor lad wanted to impress the lovely little dancer and who could blame him im afraid not alan replied crestfallen whoever this is hes infernally clever and i mean that almost literally he set traps for us and they werent the things intended to catch and perhaps harm us either if we had been gulled by his deceptions what we did would have hurt perfectly innocent peoplewell not perfectly innocent they were actually rather vile he flushed a deeper crimson but they were innocent of any wrongdoing towards us a good job you were being cautious then arthur said in an attempt to console him at least we wont have that on our consciences yes but i didnt find him and mademoiselle is still in danger he rubbed one temple im not used to failing jonathon snorted then you arent trying things that are challenging enough to his surprise and alans obvious chagrin ninette nodded the more and harder things you attempt the more you will fail you are only guaranteed not to fail if you do not try cest las vie we have all failed at this one alan nigel pointed out whoever this is hes a step ahead of us he certainly was this time the young man said glumly and began to outline just what it was he had discovered that was when jonathons head literally came up like a dog catching a scent damnation he swore this is not just a trap hes misdirecting us like in one of your illusions ninette asked brows creased in a thoughtful frown exactly he wants us to look for him using magic he wants us to waste our time doing so and meanwhile he is doing something else but what jonathon grimaced what is it that he doesnt want us to see whatever it is wolf observed it cant be good he doesnt want us to see him or rather to find him nigel rose from his chair and began to pace the question is and then he stopped and a look of surprise mixed with annoyance spread over his face good gad weve been making a fundamental error here all along weve been operating on the assumption that whoever this is first attacked mademoiselle with a storm and sank her yacht nom du nom ninette exclaimed that was all a fabrication it is the red fish red herring arthur corrected absently exactly so when we remove that from our puzzle we need to know when the real attacks date from and are they centered on mademoiselle after all it could just be coincidence or it could be she was attacked just because she was vulnerable we might not be looking for an enemy of ninas we might just be looking for an enemy of nigels i havent stirred up any trouble that i know of nigel said slowly but then again neither has ninette any magically gifted enemies but at least we know where to start looking for mine and what to look for jonathon pursed his lips for that matter the first attack that we definitely know of came after i had arrived i might be the one that this magician seeks to ruin and i must say i have made a considerable number of enemies over the years i am not an easy man to get along with and i do not suffer fools surely not nigel interjected and then stopped no you are correct old friend he began paging through a little book he kept separate from the larger daybook in which he scheduled acts and noted things down about the days events in the theater he had the daybook open too he looked up do you supposewhen harrigan broke his leg do you think that could have been the first attack all of them stared at him it was jonathon that spoke first didnt mrs harrigan say that the street just opened up in front of him nigel nodded his lips pressed into a thin line well then that was the first attack and it not only came after you joined us it came after i began letting information on our planned productions get out it does seem to point to the notion that this is an enemy of yours nigel wolf put in thoughtfully but then jonathon saw alan brighten there is no reason to think that this enemy might have been covering his tracks quite so effectively that far back is there he asked eagerly perhaps perhaps not nigel regarded the young man shrewdly i take it you have a notion if you know where that hole was i can probably read what happened in the past alan said with a look of determination jonathon whistled i dont know of more than one or two masters that can do that he was impressed in spite of himself but alan only shrugged its usually more in the line of a clairvoyant rather than a magician but water is uniquely suited to scrying he replied diffidently its more the aptness of the element rather than any virtue on my part well i think you are very clever to have thought of it ninette said looking at the young man with admiration jonathon scowled a little will we have to go there the fire master demanded because that could be deuced awkward even at night when you start performing magic in the middle of a public thoroughfare people tend to look at you askance its not that obvious alan replied but i do need the exact spot jonathon rolled his eyes and growled a little but agreed to take him to the spot i will come too ninette insisted if need be i can make the distraction you are already a distraction jonathon grumbled but he knew better than to order her to stay behind she wouldnt obey him and it wasnt as if he had the right to issue commands to her anyway so the three of them went out into the afternoonwhich threatened rain againas jonathon led them to the place where the socalled sinkhole had been a wonder and a nuisance it was filled in now but that didnt seem to matter to alan who looked around to make sure no one was near enough to notice what he was about to do then pulled a watch out of his pocket along with a small flask opened the watch so that the coverplate was resting on his palm then poured a tiny bit of water into the little dish that the cover made ninette stationed herself in front of him looking up at him as if they were having a conversation seeing what she was doing as alan began to mutter to his little pool of water jonathon interposed himself between alan and the street his tall form making an effective screen anyone who saw them now would only think it was three friends having a peculiarly intense conversation jonathon of course could not see what it was that alan was doing but he caught some words in a variant of gaelic that sounded very old indeed alan made a small sound of triumph and spilled the water out of his watch onto the ground he watched it intensely for a moment then nodded feel up to a trek he asked the two of them raising his eyes i can follow the disturbance in the watermagic back to the source i think nothing ventured nothing gained jonathon observed but we should send mademoiselle back to the theater she opened her mouth to protest he gave her one of those looks that she had learned meant she was going to get nowhere in arguing with him then as he had learned to do around her he told her why mademoiselle he said in a quiet firm voice we do not know what sorts of neighborhoods we may be going through i am sure you can defend yourself against a single man or even two but we might be set upon by a gang and someone has to tell nigel that alan has succeeded in wringing something from the stones and is off on the hunt alan was casting entreating looks at her but she did not look away from jonathons eyes all right she replied those are good reasons she nodded agreement but before she could turn to go thomas had his own say i will be staying with you the cat put in you might need another messenger you might need for someone to get in at a secondstory window so that you can tear a room apart jonathon snorted i think you were an anarchist in a previous life not likely and i wouldnt have done that if we hadnt needed to cover what wed stolen i think there has been enough of arguing take thomas please jonathon ninette said firmly he gave her a firm look and what if you should run into difficulties she laughed going back to the theater in broad daylight really i am not so helpless as all that he considered how far she had come with that pistol of hers and nodded reluctantly just take care they parted at the corner and jonathon was relieved to see her summon a cab and step into it before he and alan had moved from their spot in fact he let out his breath in a sigh of relief he should have realized she would be sensible after all it was by no means clear that the enemy was actually after nigel and not her he turned to see that alan was watching him with a very odd expression as if the young man had only now realized somethingthought what that something could be jonathon had no idea that is a remarkable lady alan murmured remarkable in that she has more sense than most women jonathon replied wondering what had brought that remark on yes yes yes indeed ninette is a fine creature now shall we get on with what we came out here to do the cat asked in irritation this is going to be aggravating for both of you alan said sheepishly i have to follow the watercourses so i will have to go afoot and will probably lead you on a very meandering course indeed as long as you actually lead us on something i do not much care said jonathon then softened his tone he hadnt meant to sound so gruff every master works within the bounds of his own element and i would hardly expect you to conform to a fire masters ways lead on alan nodded and the odd little procession moved off alan had not exaggerated he did lead them on a course that was more akin to a cow wandering a pasture than anyone going directly towards something from time to time he stopped pulled out his watch and allowed a little weight attached to the chain to danglejonathon watched it though and watched alan watching it and knew within moments of the first pause what alan was doing he was dowsing that most ancient of means to find water the pendulum would swing in the direction that they needed to go and alan would put the watch in his vest pocket and set off again now normally one dowsed for water jonathon thought to himself that alan was actually dowsing for the direction of the absence of water or rather of water magic and he was doing it not in the present but in the past he had found the place in time when what was now a repaired sinkhole had been created with that mark to guide him he was following the path of that magic by tracing where it had in essence shoved everything out of its way in passing this was a tour de force that jonathon knew he would never have been able to duplicate hes good isnt he jonathon sensed that the cat was speaking for his ears only remarkably so jonathon thought back at the cat i was skepticalim not anymore even if but he did not finish that thought which would have been even if ninette does seem to enjoy his company more than i like well no one can be a young genius forever the cat said with amusement if nothing else young geniuses become old geniuses and a newer younger genius is always coming up nipping at his heels being in those shoes is somewhat less than comfortable their journey took them long enough that jonathons feet were beginning to hurt he was by no means used to walking great distances he was after all a city dweller and men of his class took cabs they would certainly need to take a cab back to the theater to be in time for the first performance but just when he was about to ask alan how much longer he thought this would be alan looked up and gave an exclamation of mingled triumph and disappointment jonathon looked in the direction he was gazing and saw a hotel oh curse it he said annoyed knowing exactly what alan was thinking i dont suppose with over a hundred people coming and going from there every day alan shook his head there is not a chance i could sort through all of that besides i much doubt that the magician confined his work to a single room he more than likely expanded it to the whole hotel i would have jonathon nodded all right then we are not completely helpless i can get a listing of all the people registered to that hotel on that day as well as the servants and employees that will narrow our search down from the entire city to at most two hundred people i call that progress alan reluctantly agreed now you may not need to hurry but i have an act to perform jonathon continued firmly so right at this moment we need nothing more magical than the ability to get a cab in front of a fine hotel ninette stepped out of the cab in front of the theater and immediately had the sense that she was being watched or to be precise she had the sense that there were two sorts of watchers the first sort were those who were watching her with admiration varying degrees of recognition and varying degrees of intent to find out if she could be enticed into a bed there was a warmth to that which was friendly even with those who dreamed of her being in their beds not even the ones who wanted her in that way had any intention of doing anything other than making her and themselves happy and for the rest she was something to be admired like a sunset or a lovely hat this she did not in the least mind it was the same sort of thing she got when she performed even on stage there were those who thought of her in their beds and that only made sense since her legs were clearly on display though her bosom was not exactly as generous as those of the lady that sang champagne charlie for the rest again she was like a fairy a magical little creature that they watched flit about the stage so lightly they were sometimes afraid to breathe lest she break that was the good sort of being watched no it was another sort of watcher a single one that startled her and sent a chill of fear down her back how she knew this she could not tell maybe thomas could maybe it was simply being around so much magic that it was rubbing off on her but she knew absolutely that someone in front of the theater wished her only ill that person whoever and wherever it was watched her with loathing was this their enemy was this the magician who had sent all those terrible things to plague them had jonathon and alan gone in search of him only to have him come here and which person in the crowd at the theater entrance was it her eyes flitted over the crowd lined up to buy tickets for the evening performances they were all sold out these days and even the standingroom sections in the backs of the galleries had plenty of occupants she simply could not tell who it was no one looked angry or affronted or even more annoyed than one could be with standing in a line on a warm evening there was nothing to give her so much as a clue only that aura of hate so with a shiver she hurried towards the stage door nigel was in there and so were arthur and wolf they would know what to do they would be able to tell if the person she sensed was the magician that they were all looking for she tried to look as if she was hurrying only because she was a little late and not because she knew he was there if he knew thatthere was no saying what he might do once inside that door she would be she had only a breath of warning before he was on her the feeling of rage and triumph the sound of a footstep in the alley behind her and the sense of presence looming behind her but that warning was enough not enough warning to fumble the revolver out of her pursebut she did have enough to react as a dancer would sure of foot and aware as if her skin had eyes knowing exactly where she was and where he was and where he was going there was just enough time to sidestep turn quickly and as the man sailed past her arms outstretched to kick him as hard as she could in the back of his trousers he had clearly expected to grab her was offbalance to begin with and the hard kick of a dancer a wellfed welltrained and thoroughly healthy dancer sent him crashing into the brick wall of the building opposite the theater he managed to get his arms up in time to protect his head but that was all she didnt hesitate for a second as he hit the bricks screaming for help she picked up her skirts over her knees and ran her mind on fire with fear as the loathing and hate and rage washed over her so thick it was a bitter taste in her mouth and a lash to her back with terror putting wings on her feet she didnt remember reaching the stage door only that she found herself babbling to the doorman and a crowd of people who had run to the door at the sound of her screams she thought she was saying something about a man attacking her but her mind was so filled with fear that she scarcely could put two sensible words together the doorman in his turn left her in the care of the wardrobe mistress and summoned four stagehands leading them out in a wrathfilled group into the alley while the wardrobe mistress plied her with brandy and water and sent one of the boys for nigel the wardrobe mistress under any other circumstances a crusty old dame with a formidable temper put an arm around her shoulders as motherly as her own maman could have been here sweetheart she soothed now drink this down did he hurt ye hit ye thank god it wasnt dark out there she shook her head and gulped down brandy that tasted salty from her own tears he wantedhe wantedto kill me she babbled as the terror slowly slowly ebbed i misdoubt it was killing he was after the woman murmured blackly but at that point nigel and arthur came pounding up with wolf clinging like a limpet to arthurs shoulder without a word nigel scooped her up as arthur gave the wardrobe mistress orders that sent her scurrying determinedly away on some errand things blurred for a moment and she found herself on the couch in nigels office with arthur peering into her eyes wolf still clinging to his shoulder and peering at her first with one eye then the other definitely psychic shock he pronounced as she gazed up at him in bewilderment honestly it is amazing she didnt just freeze there in the alley and let him dowhatever it was he was going to do whoever he was he got away she gasped panic rising in her again he got away ninette wolf barked and flew down and bit her little finger hard the physical pain snapped the panic and the fear ran out of her like water from a cracked pot she clasped her injured finger to her chest and stared at them all unable to think benumbed arthur put his hands on her shoulders and shook her gently ninette its all right at least it is for now whoever he is he cant get in here to harm you now tell us what happened she gulped reached for the glass of brandy that nigel held out wordlessly to her and in halting tones told what little she knew i cannot understand she faltered the horrorthe fear nigel patted her hand and wolf rubbed his head apologetically along her wrist but it was arthur that answered ninette there is magic and then there are the powers of the mind itself it seems you have something of the latter he smiled encouragingly i do too i am about half magician and half mentalist tell me have you been able to tell what the audience feels about you as if you were feeling what they feel she nodded slowly mais oui since i came here to england certainly i am not sure about before but now that she thought about it it did seem to her that she had always had a sense for who was friendly who was not and who might even be dangerous she had just never thought about it very much arthur nodded probably talking with thomas as you do has made all this stronger and this man whoever he is has a similar ability i dont know why he hates you so much but for you it was like someone with a megaphone shouting at you right into your ear all you could feel was the hate and anger oui she said slowly it felt likelike a blow it was a blow arthur replied and tapped her between her eyebrows on her forehead to your mind my head feels bruised inside she said feeling dazed in a way that mere brandy could not account for i am not surprised fortunately i have a remedy for that he smiled down at her you are going to take a refreshing little nap and when you wake up you will feel quite yourself again she felt his palm resting on her forehead and suddenly her eyelids were too heavy to keep open with a sigh she surrendered to his will after all this was arthur and she had nothing to fear from him nothing at all nigel stared down at the sleeping dancer i never want to hear you denigrate your powers ever again my friend he said soberly i certainly could not have done that just now arthur shrugged well now we know what it is that she has that holds an audience he said pragmatically and its not a bad thing not at all youll just have to teach her control and ethics nigel turned away and paced towards the window thats hardly relevant at the moment who in bloody blazes attacked her arthur picked up wolf and replaced the bird on his shoulder was it the earth master nigel shook his head no the sylphs are absolutely certain there is not a breath of earth magic inimical or otherwise around this building whoever it was has those mental powers and nothing else and for some reason he wants ninette dead he turned away from the window as a knock came at the office door it was the chief of the stagehands cap twisted between his hands looking hangdog sorry mister nigel sir he said unhappily we lost him he mustve been faster as a ferret an twice as twisty thats all right bob nigel replied though the man winced at the frustration in his voice its hardly your fault just tell the lads to be on the watch for him we will sir the stagehand replied and hastily made his escape nigel turned back to face arthur running his hand through his hair with agitation first the earthmage then the other dancer and now this he said with a touch of anger what next arthur could only shake his head not needing corsets nina never wore them if she could help it so while the women all around her looked like marble monuments she was able to undulate rather than walk and lounge luxuriously rather than sit this apparently was either very attractive to men or made them acutely uncomfortable sometimes both the reporter had turned up at her flatfortunately after she had awakened last night had been relatively good despite the idiocy of her tool she had decided that she would deal with him later she had fed though it was not what she would call a gourmet repast and she was looking forward to unleashing another round of harassment via the newspapers in the next few days she received her visitor leaning comfortably back in her velvet chaise leaving him to take the uncomfortable chair with the itchy horsehair upholstery she waved him languidly to it and waited for him to tell her what the next barrage from him against the imposter would be but the reporter put paid to that idea you lost it nina said incredulously sitting bolt upright with shock you lost it the reporter looked uncomfortable and indignant at the same time more like it was stolen he protested along with a lot of my other papers everything in my desk but my bills things i was looking into for other stories it took me this long to get my place cleaned up to figure out exactly what was taken the thieves tore the whole flat apart looking for something and it looks like in the end they settled for taking every scrap of paper that looked important he shrugged there are some stories i am pursuing that could cause scandal perhaps even divorce i expect that was what the thieves were looking for theyll most likely look through what they took and burn what they dont want why didnt you keep these things locked away she snarled her hands clenching and unclenching as she strove to control herself are you so completely a fool why were they not in a safe now he looked angry do i look like the sort of man that can afford a safe he snapped and even if i could the landlord is so cheeseparing it would probably fall through the floor besides what does it matter you can send for moreprobably betterbonafides he gave her a superior look i told you that we needed those anyway this time get something i can actually use something a bit more convincing than photographs and impersonal letters his eyes glittered letters from admirers would be the best especially things on letterhead with a crest you cant forge that she glared at him give him letters from admirers now and if she had been human that would have been playing right into his hands the opportunity for blackmail would be just too temptingif in fact he wasnt already planning on using what she gave him for blackmail she could easily send for things of a more personal nature of course but that would take time and in that time her enemies might come closer to unmasking her one thing had already gone wrong with these faroff affairs her witness had vanished he was supposed to be on the train now but her servant had arrived in paris without him she assumed he had been shrewder and more crooked than she had suspected he had taken her money and disappeared with it halfway between prague and paris it was so maddening having to rely on her servants so many miles away they seemed to get more thickheaded with every month that was a setback but she had told herself it was a minor one this was only a skirmish a feint not the real battle she could continue without a witnessand after all it had always been an uncertain thing whether a workingclass foreigner who had to speak through a translator would be believed last night had been more serious her stupid tool had taken matters into his own hands and attacked the girl in broad daylight now the question was would this be connected to her she thought not and the fool had gotten away butif they did then her position became much more precarious with the addition of a water master the elemental masters had enough accumulated magic to effectively prevent her creatures from getting into their homes and the theater and if they tracked down an earth master strong enough to hunt her out last night she had convinced herself these were only minor setbacks there had been no sign that the magicians actually had linked the attack to her but now to hear this was it common thieves after all she listened tightlipped to the description of how his flat had looked and to him swearing he had locked the door securely before going out it sounded as if it must have been common thievesshe didnt think any of the theater people would have been likely to ransack the place so crudely the stage magician could easily have picked the locks of course and relocked them too but she very much doubted that any of them would have torn open cushions and the mattress no that sounded like stupid petty criminals but still her pictures and other proofs of her identity were gone she realized at that moment that despite her own self confidence in short things were not going at all well and she needed to take it out on something before her temper snapped altogether and she did something stupid and irrevocable in public and then she eyed the man before her who had gone from being selfdefensive to bullying every word he spoke every line of his body said the same thing he was a man she was a woman he would therefore always know the right way to handle her story she should be properly grateful for his advice she should do as she was told and keep that temper of hers to herself he was more and more infuriating by the moment he had been injudicious enough this reporter and baldfaced enough to come to her flat he had been stupid enough to come alone and she had no further use for him she nodded once to her servant who took the silent order and left closing and locking the door behind her the man heard the click of the lock and at first it did not register with him then he turned to see that they were alone turned back to her smirking anticipating no doubt that she had finally realized what a masterful man he was and was going to yield to him in more ways than one she smiled sweetly at him then she shifted to her true and proper form the smirk froze into a rictus of incredulity and fear when he saw what was facing him his eyes bulged and he made a little mewling sound i have no further need of your services said the troll and slapped him to the floor with a single blow of her hand she made him last for a good long time after first choking off his voice by the simple expedient of stuffing his mouth full of clay he could still breathe through his nose her neighbors were awake and about and it would be awkward to have to explain the screams she absorbed him a little at a time taking time out to actually physically feed on his flesh just for the taste and the sensations it aroused in her and in him she did not of course detach the limbs that she fed on she wanted him to feel it feel the horror as he watched her feed and was helpless to do anything about it not a drop of blood was wasted she absorbed it as it dripped from the ruined flesh as she absorbed his energy little by little she savored all the complex flavors of his fear spiced with despair and hopelessness finally when she could wring nothing more from him when he was semiconscious at best numbed his mind hiding away from her from the horror of what she was doing to him she came to the point where it was time to end the game she killed him and absorbed the rest of his body when she was finished there was nothing left but a few bloody rags she reverted and signaled to her servants to return and clean up the mess she was not sated but her temper had been appeased now her mind was clear enough to think she flung herself down on the chaise again and allowed her servant to clean the blood out from under her fingernails before it dried there this was not going well she had only one advantage at this point that the elemental masters did not know that the real nina tchereslavsky and the earth master that was plaguing them were the same person they did not yet know who she was nor what she was and her location was still secure but that could all change in a moment briefly it occurred to her that the safest thing to do would be to abandon this project and go back she had not yet ruined her reputation as a dancer with that single canceled contract there were a thousand excuses she could plead she could manufacture a plausible even sympathetic reason for why she had not honored it or she could simply remain silent on the subject and allow people to gossip humans being what they were they would probably assume she was giving birth to a child out of wedlock and for a moment she toyed with that idea she could even admit to it and carry out the plan shed been intending to execute here she could purchase an infant virtually anywhere call it hers and bring it back to her home it was not as perfect as the plan she had made for taking over this girls place there would be no marriage which meant there would be scandal of course but that hardly mattered to her it wasnt as if she was hoping to make a good marriage on the contrary the more wouldbe lovers she had vying for her the better meanwhile she could carry out the rest of the plan display the brat at regular intervals absorb it when it was big enough that she could counterfeit it and then play the dual role of mother and child she would then be her own heir and nina tchereslavsky could disappear in some manner it could work it could easily work all she had to do would be to pack her things and simply leave then the thought of that wretched girl and her meddlesome friends enraged her all over again she would not leave this battle the wretched girl would have to pay for what she had done once again her hands clenched and unclenched and the fingernails grew just a little longer a little pointier a little sharper besides now that the masters knew that she was out there she could not imagine that they would rest until they identified her and when they did that her mind shied away from the thought but she could not escape it it was the one scenario that actually frightened her the masters simply could not permit something like her to exist an elemental creature as powerful as any of them who could and did walk among them wielding magic in their world with a skill the equal to any of them to them she was an abomination a blasphemy and they would not rest until she was not just banished but destroyed it was sheer folly to think that they would leave the hunt once they had started it she had inflicted too much damage on them already and they would not rest until they had gotten revenge it was time to end this end it while she still had all the advantages the imposter would die but her friends would precede her by the time jonathon alan and thomas returned to the theater ninette had awakened from her rest and was in a better state to tell them what had happened thanks to arthur the incident had lost its immediacy and she was able to recite those details that she remembered calmly none of them knew what to make of it all i can tell you is that he hated me with a terrible passion she said rubbing the bridge of her nose as the memory made her head ache a little i cannot tell you why and i do not ever recall having seen him before maybe we should see if the madhouse is missing an inmate nigel said half in jest but ninette and arthur both turned to look at him thoughtfully that might be no bad idea ninette replied slowly the strength of that hate the lack of anything but hateit indeed felt like that of a madman nigel regarded both of them soberly as arthur nodded i suppose there is no harm in making sure he said finally very well then ill send to the police and ask them to make inquiries as the humans discussed just how much it would be prudent to tell the police thomas slipped out there were a few advantages to being trapped in the body of a cat and this was one he might not have the nose of a hound but he could follow a scenttrail even one as muddled as this one was likely to be he felt a distinct sense of urgency in this he could not imagine that this was some random madman who had somehow fixated on ninette no this was linked to the other attacks and the only way to find out how it was linked was to find the attacker fortunately the attacker had been kind enough to leave a bloodtrail faint but it was there and it was just as fortunate that he had elected to stagger back to whatever place he deemed safe on foot since his trail took him down back streets and through alleys thomas presumed that whatever injuries he had gotten impacting the brick wall had been obvious enough that he did not want to show his damaged self in public but this was two long treks across blackpool in one day and he was getting very tired indeed by the time the trail ended at the back entrance of a little house with pretensions of grandeur where thomass sharp ears picked up the sound of a womans voice raised in a plaintive tone that was not quite a whine thomas quickly leapt the wall and positioned himself where he could hear every word dear i wish you would go tell the police about those footpads said the woman look at your poor face you might have been enough mother the male voice that answered her was rough with anger i am not going to the police and that is an end to it the scent that wafted from the window matched the one thomas had been following washed over with the scent of disinfectant there is nothing i can tell them i never saw those ruffians faces they simply manhandled me into a wall and fled when they heard someone coming i am not inclined to open myself to ridicule because i allowed myself to be caught offguard by a couple of rough laborers but dear i have made my decision mother kindly do not fret me with it any further now i am going out thank you for your ministrations and do not trouble yourself to wait up for me for one brief moment thomas panicked when he realized that the man was going to be opening the door only a scant foot or two away from his hiding place but then he shook his head because he knew this fellow wasnt going to do anything except shy a stone at him perhaps he was a cat if a cat could look at a king then it could certainly lurk with impunity in the shrubbery the man opened his own front door and stalked stiffly out into the street thomas gave him a few paces then followed but it was with a powerful internal struggle when he saw the marks on the mans face that so clearly told that he had slammed into the wall thomas had no doubt at all that this was his quarry and it had taken every bit of his self control to keep from leaping on the man in a fury and making a total ruin of his head with teeth and claws he hoped that he would gain some clue as to why the man had attacked ninette but all the fellow did was to go to a secondclass club and proceed to get drunk he went at it methodically as thomas could tell by watching from the vantage point of a hiding place under a sofa and he went about it silently he was scarcely popular that much was painfully clear no one greeted him and he greeted no one eventually he passed out in a stupor empty glass falling to the rug beside him one of the club servants picked up the glass but left him where he was evidently he was no favorite with them either finally thomas left and made his way back to the theater stealing rides on the backs of cabs now that it was dark he could do so without fear of being chased off or exciting any comment he was experiencing very mixed feelings at the moment but uppermost was unease this man was a prig a buffoon and a fool but he was not mad nor did he correspond to the enraged creature that had attacked ninette yet the scent was the same there must be more much more than met the eye here he thought about it all the way across town but could come to no conclusions even as he slipped into the theater and arrived just in time to see the end of jonathons act ninette performed flawlessly certainly no one out there in the audience had an inkling that she had been attacked earlier that day he sensed something more from her as well an awareness of her relationship with the audience that had not been there before that awareness seemed to spur her to overcome what had happened that afternoon to transcend it to perform a kind of alchemy that turned the experience into something good that she could give them she wasnt quite managing thatbut she was trying and for that alone she more than deserved the hearty applause she got thomas felt irrationally proud when she came off the stage some of the performers and stagehands that knew about the afternoons attack came up to her to tell her she had done well unspoken were the words are you all right she must have known this for she thanked them and took the time to make sure they saw her looking completely normal thomas gave her extra scrutiny during this she seemed to be fine in fact he sensed that from being frightened she had gone to being angry this was good anger was a potent weapon and by now she should have learned something of control he would of course make sure of that he followed her back to her dressing room and sensed at that moment a hesitation and a weariness in her when she saw the usual crowd waiting but he watched as she straightened her back put on a smile and went in to deal with her admirers but she did not have to deal with them for long it could not have been a quarter hour later that one of the boys came with a summons from nigel since even her admirers could not take precedence over the theater owner they let her go with reluctance and cries of protest and she made a graceful exit thomas followed he was debating whether he should say something to nigel about his discovery butsomething stopped him from doing so that made him pause and sit for a moment with his tail wrapped around his paws while he considered his reaction as the rest of the group in their turn discussed their own results jonathon had his list of hotel guests on the date in question and had already compared that to the current register he already planned to investigate those that were still in residence as well as the employees and see what his two imps could find out about those who were gone very methodical but this also seemed to thomas to be perilously slow nigel was tracking down appropriately powerful earth masters he already had the addresses and letters of introduction to three of them also productiveand also slow he regarded them all through slitted eyes and took some careful thought as he weighed them in his mind that was when it occurred to him while they all took this seriously none of the men not even nigel regarded this as a contest they might lose none of them has ever lost before he thought nigel and jonathon i know have faced very perilous creatures but they have never lost it has never occurred to them that they can in their world the good and chivalrous man always prevails looking at ninettes sober face however he knew that she at least was quite well aware that things could go horribly wrong probably ailse was too both of them had come from very different backgrounds than any of the men both had been poor and in ninettes case she was quite well aware always that had things gone otherwise she might well have ended up worse than dead in a terrible existence as a parisian prostitute but the men had all gone to public schools university and if their parents had not been wealthy they had at least been comfortable by their own efforts they had achieved respect and prosperity and no one had ever seriously given them many moments of concern when nigel had faced down the worst of the magical creatures hed dealt with in the past it had been when he was much younger and young men are always viscerally convinced of their own immortality so there it was the reason why thomass own instincts were telling him to keep his information to himself for now there was certainly more to this extraordinarily sane madman than met the eye if he was dangerous thomas wanted to find out in a way that would threaten none of them even if he could convince all of them that direct confrontation was a very bad idea they would still want to spy on the man and they were simply not going to be very successful at that humans were large and none of these friends was skilled at being unobtrusive a cat could go anywhere tonight the men put ninette and ailse into a cab for the short trip home and made it clear that ninette was to take taxis anywhere she needed to go if nigel was not available to drive her in his motor sensible precaution and ninette took it so then again her energy was starting to run low thomas could tell from the way she was starting to droop just a little he jumped up inside and settled at her feet and again the silence between her and ailse told him a very great deal she was exhausted and that was hardly surprising it was only when she was tucked into bed and ailse was out of the room that thomas jumped up and sat on the foot of it to speak with her she was trying to read a book and making heavy going of it at one and the same time too tired in body and too active in mind to stay focused i found your attacker he said without preamble she sat straight up you did but shh i did not want to tell the others there is something exceedingly odd about him i need to investigate this further which means i will be out all night you will be all right yes for answer she reached under the corner of her mattress and pulled out her revolver good i very much doubt that anything will happen but i need to know you are prepared to defend yourself i intend to share everything i learn with you ninette i do not believe that allowing you to remain ignorant will make you any safer she nodded her expression grimly determined i am going to try to find out why he is so deathly enraged with you why he is obsessed with you and once we know these things we can formulate a plan to deal with him that seems a great deal wiser than stalking up to him and asking him why he attacked me she said dryly i never really saw his face so i cannot even be a witness as to who it is police would take a dim view of a witness that never saw her attackers face he agreed very well then lock the doors and windows and when i return i will simply find a comfortable place to wait downstairs until you awaken a cat after all can sleep virtually anywhere and our landlords know i belong to you and will give me a handsome breakfast of kippers he jumped down off her bed and up onto the windowsill and from there out onto the roof he waited until he saw she had locked the window as he asked then flicked his tail once in the moonlight au revior cherie he said and began making his way back to street level he had a taxiseveral taxisto catch the way that the clubs servants treated the man that thomas was following said volumes about his unusual behavior servants could be dismissed on the basis of a single complaint very often the level of their personal comfort depended on the generosity of the patrons at holidays or when special requests were supplied so to be bundled into the cheapest possible cab with no concern for his dignity and comfort to have his pockets gone through and used to pay the hack driver in advance argued for someone who had sunk so low that the servants expected nothing out of him and treated him accordingly it also argued that even the ruling members of his own club would take the word of a servant over his rather pathetic and it made his attack on ninette all the more puzzling it was as if this was a reallife doctor jekyll though one without the fictional doctors better qualities thomas got himself a ride easily enough the man didnt even notice a cat getting in with him thomas tucked himself up as small as he could though because the jolting of the poorly sprung cab was slowly knocking him out of his stupor by the time the cab arrived at his home he was conscious enough to clamber out curse the driver and stagger up to his door thomas followed a prudent distance behind and watched to see which lights came on upstairs he noted as he had expected the lightsgaslight he thought by the way it increased rather than coming onin the front upstairs bedroom the back would overlook the tiny scrap of paved yard suitable only for the maid to do the laundry in and other similar household chores neither the lady of the house nor the master would care to have that view out their window the maidor maids if there was more than onewould have the attic it appeared that the man occupied the room of choice leaving his mother to climb two sets of stairs instead of one how chivalrous thomas noted with pleasure that the passage from ground to windowsill was an easy one for a cat plenty of places to climb led to a fauxbalcony below the windows and the night was warm enough that there the maid opened the window for the man her expression of weary resignation clear from here all thomas needed to do was to wait wait he did as the lights were turned down and then off as the neighborhood quieted further until he was fairly certain the man was asleep then he scrambled nimbly up to the balcony squeezed through the railing and leapt up to the windowsill and there he was thomas expected sottish snoring but the sound that came from the man made all the hair on his back stand up and his tail puff out like a bottlebrush he was whimpering pleading then in the next moment the pleading turned to an animalistic growling so full of hate that thomas very nearly leaped down to the street again thomas could not make out exactly what the man was saying but there was something about it that sounded like half of a conversation and he would dearly dearly like to have heard the other half then something else put up the hair on his back the faint scent of magic but not just any magic this was not the magic of an elemental master no oh indeed not this was the raw halftamed power of an elemental itself and it had the scent of blood to it this man wasnt in the throes of a nightmare he was caught up in a sending thomas didnt recognize the scent so it could have been any of the three elements not his own nevertheless anyone capable of reasoning would reason it was damned unlikely to be anything other than earth then the man spoke his first intelligible words i am coming he moved then threw off the bedclothes reached for his clothing his eyes were still closed he was obeying his masters command in his sleep for a moment and a long one thomas fought the urge to flee he wasnt an elemental master anymore he wasnt any kind of a magician he wasnt even human he was a cat what could he do but he knew very well what he could do it was something none of the humans he was in league with could do he could take his courage in all paws follow this man and do it without being seen just so long as he could avoid being detected by other means he jumped down to the street to wait one shadow among many ninette awoke suddenly her mind preternaturally clear every sense alert thomas was in trouble how she knew this she could not say perhaps that encounter with that horrible man had done something to her mind made it more sensitive or something of the sort she had noticed it last night when she had awakened in time to warm up for her performance she had felt things more clearly than ever before from the stagehands the other performers and then most strongly from her audience at first she had been a bit upset and angry but then she realized that it was not so bad feeling how much the audience was enjoying what she did made her think that perhaps this could be useful and now she knew without a doubt that thomas was in trouble she felt his fear and she knew that she could use that to find him it pulled her like the north pole pulled a compass needle she pulled on clothing the bloomers outfit she wore to go shooting with her hair under a cap she would look like a boy and that should keep her safe enough she stuffed her pistol into one pocket bullets into another money into a third she went to wake ailse only to discover that ailse wasnt in her own bed that made her pause then she racked her brain trying to think of where her maid could be and came up with nothing shes walkin out with that lad from the hotel band ninette turned to see the creature that nigel called a brownie looking sideways at her she didnt see much of the little fellow he was shy by nature and she wasnt a magician after all but it made her obscurely ashamed that this fellow knew more about what ailse was doing and who she was seeing than she did i think they went to th pub he continued flushing though i couldnt tell ye which one well there was nothing to be done about it ailse was gone thomas was in trouble and from the growing urgency she felt there was no time to try and rouse nigel arthur jonathon and alan the best she could do was this thomas is in danger she told the brownie urgently dont ask me how i know i just do when ailse gets back tell her that and tell her to get the rest thomas was following the man who attacked me i do not know what kind of trouble he is in and it could be something i can solve by walking in and claiming him for mine i know only that he is frightened and i must go to him the brownie nodded aye i can do that miss then he looked pained wisht i could come with you but brownies so nigel had told her were very tied to a place once they settled into it literally tied in many ways unless ailse or ninette were to do something that would offend it the brownie was unable to physically leave the building just tell her im sure shell be back soon she wouldnt have gone far not after that madman had attacked ninette but she must be thinking that thomas was still here and that it would be safe enough to leave ninette with him standing guard she didnt know that thomas was gone ailse could be gone for as much as an hour or even more and there was not enough time to search through all the pubs within walking distance this was after all an area of boarding houses that catered to entertainers and even when the barmen had to call time they stayed open serving food and tea while people sipped from their own flasks or made the beer they had bought before time was called last for an hour a jolt of fear passed through her thomas was definitely in trouble there was no time to lose she snatched up her keys and ran you are a curious creature said the troll thomas knew it was a troll because he could tell by scent that it was not human the moment he had surreptitiously entered the house here in proximity to it inside barriers and shielding things were very clear the dampsoil scent of earth power was everywhere overlaid with the corruption that was the hallmark of the dark element and the unmistakable signs of something very large and very powerful besides the lesser boggles and simulacra meant that the powerful one must be a troll the first thing that had occurred to him and with a jolt was that he had all unaware been the one to find their elusive earth master for only an earth master would have an earth elemental in thrall there could not be two such in the city the second thing that occurred to him was to run unfortunately he discovered that he could not the whole house was bespelled things could get in easily but once inside the only way to get out was to be let out he had slipped blithely inside following his quarry only to discover that he was trapped all right put a good face on it since he could not go back he decided to go forward he followed the man who whimpered a little as he stumbled along the passageway and up the stairs heading for the next floor the entire scene was surreal outwardly this was the entry hall and staircase of a very wellappointed moderately luxurious and utterly respectable home it had all the right touches from the scenic photographs and paintings on the walls to the turkey carpet on the floor from the elaborately carved balustrade to the latest in electrical lighting but the aura of dark corruption that hung over everything and the tortured face of the man climbing the stairs as if he was ascending the matterhorn made it feel more like something out of a nightmare thomas followed knowing that there was no way he could have escaped detection even if the master of this place hadnt done anything about him yet so he acted as if he had intended to be in this position all along when all else fails try a bluff mind that particular philosophy had not worked all that well for him in the past then again that could mean the odds were good for it finally working right the man paused at an open doorway then thomas got a second shock when the voice that called out to them was female come in said the voice and paused both of you the man shambled in thomas followed and got the third shock although part of his mind was saying smugly this should have occurred to you you know he knew the woman lounging like an odalisque on her sumptuous chaise it was the real nina tchereslavsky or rather a troll wearing her shape the troll made a contemptuous gesture at him and he found himself frozen in place which was not quite as bad as it could have been however because the trolls primary attention was on the man you have failed me the troll said looking down her pert nose at the man you stupid ass what sort of an idiot attacks someone in broad daylight with witnesses within reach of help the mans mouth worked but no sound came out the trolls words curiously enough were in good english with a slightly upperclass accent thomas wondered how that came about if she was supposed to be russian then again she was a troll and magic was a part of them he supposed but wait there was something else wrong here where exactly was this creatures master never mind that i will tell you the woman continued with contempt a brainless overeducated underschooled fool who has been certain all of his life that he is entitled to the finer things yet has never worked to achieve them this did not sound like any troll that thomas had ever heard of most of them could scarcely manage more than a grunt so given that you are a brainless overeducated underschooled fool who has just ruined any chance he had of getting near that imposter what do you think i should do with you she continued the man stared at her dumbly and tried to mouth words but nothing came out fortunately for all of us your dear mother does not know you are here in fact she does not even know you have left the house no one knows you are here she looked down at thomas except this cat and i doubt he will be able to go running to the police or anyone else so really there is nothing to prevent me from doing exactly as i please with you she smiled it was a smile that made thomass tail brush out again that was when she changed into her normal form yes she was indeed a troll her head brushed the ceiling she looked now like a crude doll made of gray clay and she smelled like a combination of sour earth and rotting flesh she reached forward and embraced the man it would have been funny if his face had not been contorted into a silent scream of anguish then came the horrible part when he had been human and a magician thomas had read about trolls doing this but he had never thought he was going to see the absorption process up close certainly not this close with the victim paralyzed and able to move only his eyes the troll pressed him into her chest into it little by little he sank into the clay and in a way it was a relief that his face went in first because at least thomas didnt have to look at his expression anymore and this could have been still worse really in some accounts a troll would dismember and partly eat a victim rather than merely absorbing him it was said that they grew to like the taste but where was the trolls master thomas curled his tail tightly around his feet and pretended to watch with interest all the while trying to detect a human any human anywhere in this house well other than the victim nothing no he thought aghast but the conclusion was inescapable there was no elemental master here there was onlythis thing a horror a blasphemy something that should never have been an elemental that had been given form and substance on the material plane and gotten loose a creature that did not belong here turned loose and left to work its will on humans any humans he thought he knew now where it had gotten its relatively high intelligence and cunning it must have begun absorbing humans right away and with that had come more wit more ability to think with that too had come enough memory to tell her of the dangers of living among humans so now there was a troll that could think plan and carry out those plans a troll that could keep its identity hidden a troll with patience that last might have been the worst thomas thought quickly because in a few more moments the troll was going to finish absorbing her prey and then she was going to turn her attention to him he cleared his throat as the last of her victim vanished with a little dry cough of the sort that sometimes preceded a hairball very good he said gravely he couldnt manage approval but at least he could sound serious no point in wasting him but no point in allowing him to continue wasting air either the troll reverted to the form of the dancer had there even been a real nina tchereslavsky probably but judging by the trolls looks she hadnt been very old when she fell afoul of the creature for a moment she looked puzzled then her lips curved in a cruel smile wasting air i like that you seem very calm for someone who has just discovered that what he walked into he cannot again walk out of but what if i dont want to walk out thomas asked calmly what if i intended to meet and speak with you the trolls mouth gaped speak with me why thomas sniffed i should think that would be obvious you are clearly more clever than the theater people you are obviously stronger you know who they are but they still do not know where you are much less what so you i came intending to negotiate with you yes it is prudent but you would be deserting your mistress her friends i am a cat thomas replied hoping against hope that the creature would not look past his words cats are by nature selfish because if the troll had any inkling that he was something more than he seemed a good point the troll replied thoughtfully so you think to join the winning side i know the winning side when i see it thomas replied fortunately walking around blackpool so much had given ninette a good sense of the city so she didnt walk blindly into troublespots those were not just places where hooligans and thieves lurked hoping for some drunken toff that could stagger by be coshed on the head and robbed and what would happen to a lone girl would be worse still she took cabs where she could ran where she couldnt until her sense of dangerfeardanger brought her to a rather posh neighborhood indeed no flats here these were all fine townhouses all built of identical stone all with identical front façades from the street in fact it could look like one long building exactly like the front of a government building for instance only when one looked closely could one see the narrow passages dividing building from building her sense of trouble took her to the third from the corner after a quick look up and down the street she slipped around to the back and tried her hand at the door it opened at her touch saying a silent prayer that ailse had returned home at last that the brownie had told her that ninette had gone after thomas that ailse had in turn gone for the men ninette slipped inside she waited while her eyes adjusted to the light this should be a kitchen areaand at this time of night there should be no one in it after a moment she saw that she was right on both counts that was a relief she fumbled the revolver out of her pocket she had not dared to take it out in public or in the street she was fairly certain she would have gotten into immense amounts of trouble if anyone had seen it she crept across the floor revolver in hand and peered through the doorway while allowing the emotions to come to her thomas was definitely hereupstairs somewhere and afraid for his life but there were other things too things that had the same sense to them that the little homunculus had hadnot quite living in fact with less actual life in them than a housesparrow and nothing in the way of emotionsand one thing that actually did have thoughts feelings emotions very strong ones too and all nasty just brushing against them made her want to throw up thomas was in the same room with the thing i must say thomas said looking up at the thing that was calling itself nina tchereslavsky i have heard about you earth elementals but i never heard of one as powerful or as clever as you he considered that he was very lucky that cats had no expressions to read and that the troll could not actually read thoughts either nor will you the troll said puffing up a little i am unique i can see that is it true that you can change shape i mean change it to something other than your native form and this one i had heard that some of the most powerful of elementals can do that but i have never seen it he paused truly i was thinking it must be some kind of myth i can take any form i care to as long as i have absorbed the original the troll boasted straightening the pride evident in its voice watch in truth thomas would rather not have watched but he didnt have much choice watching the troll shift forms was a very uncomfortable experience its body rippled in a stomachchurning manner and the way the skin and hair seemed to crawlit was entirely unnerving and thomas would have sworn until now that he had unshakeable nerves the troll went through the forms of a dozen different people all of whom must have been its victims before thomas shook his head in mockadmiration he wasnt admiring her of course what he was doing after he got a grip on his own discomfort and mastered it was studying her when she changed shapes she changed the clothing as well so the clothing was a part of her if you ripped it would she bleed feel pain he could see how she could counterfeit the living flesh but how had she managed to learn to duplicate the clothing did she always wear this sort of clothing or did she make use of an ordinary persons wardrobe as well then he realized that she must because she was a real dancer she would have changed costumes changed into practice clothing how had she counterfeited being a real human all this time elementals generally did not understand humans if she hadnt been so evil he would have been lost in real not counterfeit admiration that is amazing he said can you take on the form of anything other than a human if i choose the troll replied smugly thomas blinked and the trolls form writhed thickened and instead of a human looming over him there was a bear it was a black bear of the sort that often was taken from town to town by traveling entertainers and made to dance for thrown coins in england they were usually not seen outside circuses but on the continent such creatures were sometimes kept by gypsies it balanced adroitly on its hind legs looming over him staring down at him from its tiny shiny eyes and growled then it went to all fours and writhed again this time taking on the shape of a tiger easily the size of the sofa behind it thomas got up and prowled around the beast as if he was astonished by it amazing he repeated and you are for all intents and purposes the beast correct the tiger nodded i can see where these forms would be useful the cat said thoughtfully if you wanted to hunt someone but did not want to chance the blame falling on you all you would need to do would be to get him alone take on the animal and the tiger made a snickering sound nodded and the shape writhed again and thomas found himself staring up into the long tusks and whiskered cheeks of a walrus i cannot imagine how that shape would be useful he said doubtfully the troll returned to the shape of nina then you have never fallen off a ship in winter she said with an air of superiority he wondered about that statement had she fallenor had she been pushed hed have bet on the latter i will take your word for it can you become a bird of course but she frowned more deeply i do not care to do so for long there is only so much thinking so little a head can do she made gesture of impatience so why is it you have come to me cat have you no loyalty to your mistress thomas snorted i am a cat when is a cat loyal to anything but his own best interest the feral smile that greeted that statement made him shudder ha well said and you wish to be on the winning side in this he looked at her sideways let us say that i know where my own best interest lies and what is it that you can do for me cat nina asked taking her place on her chaise longue again and curling up in a rather catlike pose herself i have servants in fact i have more than i need you do not have hands you cannot even do what they do but i can go where they cannot his keen hearing had detected something a familiar footstep coming slowly cautiously forward ninette he very nearly leapt to his feet and ran out of the room then and it was all he could do to keep himself from calling out ninettes name the troll clearly had no difficulty hearing and understanding his projected thoughts and he was afraid to warn ninette lest it should hear how had she found him why was she here how could he get her to escape could she escape say you want to know what your lover is saying about you when you are on stage i can creep under the seats or into the private boxes and listen he began speaking rapidly hoping to hold the trolls attention i can spy on him or anyone else as they sleep i can find out the secrets of your rivals i can learn anything you wish to have found out a cat can go almost anywhere she laughed so you say but i can become a cat too or better still a rat or a mouse you say that a cat can go anywhere but if i need to learn something all that badly i can go where even a cat cannot between the walls where no one would even suspect my existence the footsteps had ceased thomas could tell that ninette had stopped just out of sight at the side of the doorway was she listening did she understand what she was hearing had she thought to summon help before she came after him oh come now thomas reproved all these other things you have turned yourself into were quite large it is one thing to make yourself into something humansized or larger but to make yourself into a mouse i believe you are telling me a tale nina reddened slightly with anger you doubt my abilities oh i am sure you can make yourself into the form of a mouse but it would have to be a mouse the size of a tiger he licked his paw and rubbed it nonchalantly across his whiskers it takes real skill in magic to be able to shrink yourself that way and i have never actually seen anyone that could do thatoutside of a spirit since they dont have any material body to begin with and can look like whatever they like you think i dont have the skill nina shouted she jumped up from the chaise longue i will show you skill cat i will show you skill such as you have never seen there came one of those moments in magic when the world seems to turn itself inside out this is because in many ways it is doing just that no human could have done what the troll did because no human had control over earth magic energies and the element of earth that the greater elementals themselves did few humans could travel to any of the elemental planes and fewer still returned to tell their story and to tell the truth thomas had not really expected that the troll had that level of skill he had mostly been taunting it to keep it from noticing ninette the room suddenly seemed simultaneously far too small and as large as a cathedral the air thickened and grew deserthot thomas could not look at the trollnot because he didnt want to he literally could not look at it it had become some strange amorphous conglomeration of swirling energy clouds that wrenched at the eyes and felt all wrong with something vaguely humanshaped in the middle of it all the senses revolted at what was going on it was impossible it should not be the eyes refused to believe what they were seeing and then mind shied away from contemplating how the laws of physics were being shattered the cloud of energies pulsed and vibrated and shuddered and the human shape was shrinking the more it shrank the more things felt wrong the air throbbed with power power that tasted foul and made thomass stomach heave there were no names for the colors in that swirling cloud no names for the fetid scents that wreathed around him and above all no names for what the troll was doing thomas wasnt entirely sure himself in theory what the troll was doing was dividing himself some of himself going back to wherever it was earth elementals came from the rest slowly forming itself into a mouse finally with a whuff of displaced air the energies dissipated the air cleared a trifle and thomas looked down i told you the mouse said smugly ninette froze for a moment at the sound of a voice then moved forward inch by cautious inch sliding her feet along the carpet so as not to make any noise at all she identified the right door partly from the fact that it was half open and partly from the voice a female voice oddly without any accent at all andspeaking only one side of a conversation then she edged a little nearer and suddenly the second voice faded into her head thomas what was being said still made no sense to her though i must say i have heard about you earth elementals but i never heard of one as powerful or as clever as you nor will you i am unique i can see that is it true that you can change shape i mean change it to something other than your native form and this one i had heard that some of the most powerful of elementals can do that but i have never seen it truly i was thinking it must be some kind of myth i can take any form i care to as long as i have absorbed the original watch thomas was talking to an earth elemental but what kind the brownie couldnt change shape and what did this have to do with the man who had attacked her surelysurely that man was not somehow connected to the mage that was trying to hurt her and her friends but his attack had been completely ordinary the assault on her mind she was sure a matter of mere accident why suddenly switch from magic to a completely mundane attack to throw us off the track to distract us but this elemental why was thomas talking to it she felt something a kind of airquake and then there was the sound of completely animalistic growling she pressed her back flat against the wall her skin crawling with primitive fear at the sound whatever was in there it was no dog it said it was changing forminto what she lost the next bit of exchange as she fought the urge to turn and run thomas was still in there still frightened and she could not leave him she would not leave him help would be coming soon she still had her revolver jonathon and nigel could find her by that for they had handled it and could track her by it then you have never fallen off a ship in winter the woman said when the growls faded and the air quaked a few more times ninette blinked what form had she taken the whole conversation had an unreal air to it the same chaotic disjointed air of a nightmare i will take your word for it can you become a bird of course buti do not care to do so for long there is only so much thinking so little a head can do so why is it you have come to me cat have you no loyalty to your mistress why was he talking to her for a moment there was doubt then her own good sense told her why thomas had thought to spy on this creature whatever she was and she had caught him he was buying time trying to find a way out of his predicament by getting her to talk i am a cat when is a cat loyal to anything but his own best interest ha well said and you wish to be on the winning side in this she felt his revulsion that alone told her that he was trying to bluff his way out let us say that i know where my own best interest lies and what is it that you can do for me cat i have servants in fact i have more than i need you do not have hands you cannot even do what they do ninette frowned an earth elemental had servants that made no senseelementals did not have servants did they but i can go where they cannot at that moment she felt a surge of excitement from him excitement and recognition he knew she was here say you want to know what your lover is saying about you when you are on stage i can creep under the seats or into the private boxes and listen i can spy on him or anyone else as they sleep i can find out the secrets of your rivals i can learn anything you wish to have found out a cat can go almost anywhere she laughed so you say but i can become a cat too or better still a rat or a mouse you say that a cat can go anywhere but if i need to learn something all that badly i can go where even a cat cannot between the walls where no one would even suspect my existence oh come now thomas reproved all these other things you have turned yourself into were quite large it is one thing to make yourself into something humansized or larger but to make yourself into a mouse i believe you are telling me a tale she sensed something from him that she could not read she concentrated what was he getting at andhow could anyone turn into a mouse dont question it she scolded herself feeling the air of danger behind the words just listen and be prepared to act you doubt my abilities oh i am sure you can make yourself into the form of a mouse but it would have to be a mouse the size of a tiger it takes real skill in magic to be able to shrink yourself that way and i have never actually seen anyone that could do thatoutside of a spirit since they dont have any material body to begin with and can look like whatever they like you think i dont have the skill the words were shouted and angry thomas was getting her angry maybe to keep her from thinking a mouse a mousehad she somehow forgotten that he was a cat i will show you skill cat i will show you skill such as you have never seen if the magic before had made an airquake this made a kind of realityquake ninette closed her eyes tried to make herself one with the wall behind her as the world took itself apart and put itself back together again all in a moment and then did it all over again and again she was finding it hard to breathe whatever was going on in there it was like nothing she had ever experienced before terror closed in all around her she went hot then cold and she wanted nothing more to do than to flee in a panic death was all around her and she could feel it breathing down her neck she had never in all her life been so certain that in the next moment she might very well die she fought the terror and slowly with infinite care pulled the gun from her pocket and cocked the trigger thomas was counting on her she could not let him down finally with a whuff of displaced air it stopped the air cleared a trifle ninette sucked in the first full breath in several minutes i told you a new mental voice said smugly and at that moment ninette knew what thomas had been trying for yes he had wanted the woman to become a mouse if she could he had thought he could trick her then kill her but she even in her anger had called him cat she had not forgotten what he was ninette stifled the warning shriek in her throat and whipped around the corner of the door shoving it open with her shoulder revolver at the ready as she had been taught she saw thomas in midleap on what seemed to be a helpless mouse except the mouse wasnt so helpless and whatever it really was had been expecting him to do just that there was another silent explosion of energies and thomas was caught by the neck by something strange doughlike smelling of rotting loam and ninette did not even think as she had been taught she squeezed off the trigger in quick succession aiming for the center ofwhatever it was six explosions shattered the air in the room six bullets just as she and ailse had loaded them blessed lead cold iron silver the gun bucked in her hand but she brought it back to the target each time each bullet impacting the thing in front of her a mere eight feet from her with a force that drove it back a little six bullets blessed lead cold iron silver it dropped thomas who wheezed as he scrambled out of the way and then scuttled behind her andwhatever it wasbegan to scream and dissolve she couldnt tell which of her bullets had that effect but when the gun was empty she backed up as far as she could and fumbled more bullets out of her pocket inserting them into the mechanism without taking her eyes off the thing the reek of gunpowder filled the room and a waft of smoke made her eyes water it was trying to change shape only it couldnt settle on onehorribly the mass was producing an arm three legs half a womans face in one spot a mans eyes in another and several mouths all of them open all of them screaming keep shooting thomas shrieked terror filling him filling heras if she wasnt panicked enough on her own but her hands knew what to do even if her mind was gibbering in inchoate fear she got the bullets into the chamber dropping two she raised the gun she took aim and squeezed the trigger and six more explosions shattered the gurgling screams blessed lead cold iron silver wheres the head she screamed herself as her hands fumbled more bullets into the hot chambers wheres the heart therethere thomas exclaimed somehow forcing her to see where he was looking the spot was between two of the mouths where the dirtcolored skin seemed thicker and smoother she took aim fired five of the six hit the sixth went wild as the thing convulsed and the room somehow rocked without moving at all a thick wave of fetid air hit her in the chest and knocked her backwards through the door and into the wall of the hallway thomas with her the thing somehow the mind couldnt grasp what it becameit was simultaneously twenty thirty maybe fifty different people and animals and at the same time it was a towering muddoll that was all malice all malignance all hatred she cried out and brought up her arm to shield her face then flung herself sideways somehow scooping up thomas and taking him with her the wall where she had been was caved in by the force of the silent explosion channeled through the doorway for one moment it became very very quiet thenthe howling the mindless wordless baying began she rolled over dazed what get up get up thomas shrieked in her mind his words like icepicks jabbed into her brain its not over yet its servants are loose and without the troll to control them all they want is prey preyand were the prey she struggled to her feet and lurched down the hall after thomas she stopped at the foot of the stairs as he scrambled upwards but they have us cut off from going down up he urged she followed after him revolver still clutched in her hand the other feeling in her pocket for more cartridges will bullets do any good she shouted after him as from below she heard the howling come nearer and felt the staircase shake under the pounding of feet theyd better came the grim reply they reached the top floor where the servants would have sleptif the servants had been human and needed sleep dust was half an inch thick here and rose in clouds as they ran for the farthest room they darted inside the door the howling continued from the stairwell the bedstead thomas shouted make a barricade across the door fear gave her strength she hadnt realized that she had she slammed the door shut then dragged the iron bedframe across the tiny room jamming it in place across the door the howling was on their floor now and the floor itself shook with the pounding of feet she reloaded the gun please tell me you sent for help thomas begged i sent for help i just hope the young man ailse is seeing is not very fascinating then there was no time they were at the door without any preamble they began pounding on it trying to break it down the sturdy old oak resisted their efforts for a long time and ninette resisted the temptation to either fire through the door or burst into tears and throw the gun away finally with a splintering sound a great fist crashed through a door panel ninette began firing her back to the window its too high thomas said in despair behind her its straight down to the street i cant make a drop like that if he couldnt neither could she she fired and reloaded fired and reloaded there seemed no end to the things or else her bullets were having no effect other than to make them angry then her hand closed on the last two bullets she swore and loaded them took careful aim feeling a helpless despair that made her want to howl this was it this was there was a human shout from the hall some incomprehensible tangle of syllables as ninette was again knocked off her feet something opened in front of her on the other side of what was left of the door it was a good thing that she was on the floor because otherwise she would have been sucked into the yawning black vortex rimmed with fire that pulled in what was left of the door pulled in the splintered fragments from the floor tore the ragged curtains from the window and created a hurricane in the room as it devoured the very air thomas yowled like a common cat claws gouging the floor as the vortex sucked at him too she grabbed him before he lost his grip and rolled over with him tucked into the hollow of her stomach curled around him covered her head with her arms and waited for it all to end she thought it would never end that she would go mad or all the air would be sucked out of the world or that they would both die and then it ended there was silence ninette ninette she rolled over in time to see jonathon vaulting the iron bedstead running for her imwereall right she said dazed she looked around for the gun but it was gone gone into the void i lost the gun jonathon said something unrepeatable about the gun and scooped her up and thomas with her if you ever run off like that again he threatened nigel and alan shoving the bedstead out of the way so he could get through the door i willi will spank you i swear it she began to giggle first weakly then hysterically she hid her head in the folds of his jacket to smother her giggles as he glared down at her and so thomas leapt on the mouse and killed it she finished only that let loose all of the things that pursued us though i am not sure how once again she was tucked up on the chaise longue in nigels office with a blanket around her feet and a glass of brandy and water in her hand once again they were all gathered around her listening to her narrative and once again now that the terror was drained out of her so was the energy all she really wanted to do was to close her eyes this is all conjecture on my partthomas began wearily conjecture away nigel replied as ninette rubbed her aching head and wished her ears would stop popping that creature was an earth elemental a troll now i know for a fact it looked like nina tchereslavsky and it was able to take on the shapes of at least a dozen other people as well i think that it must have been summoned byand destroyedan incompetent elemental mage once it was loose in the world it decided that it liked living here it began killing and absorbing people and with every new person it absorbed it got a little smarter the others all nodded the rest follows from that nigel agreed and swore but why we never thought to connect all three enemies and realize they were a single one it had gotten very clever nigel the cat said wearily clever enough that it almost outwitted me you are hardly to be faulted the men continued to discuss and dissect what had happened as ninette leaned her head against the cushions closed her eyes and just wished they would leave finally they all stopped she opened her eyes they were looking at her i just need some rest she said faintly they took the hint awkwardly apologizing getting up and scuttling out the door jonathon was the last to leave with a single meaningful look deep into her eyes finally blessed silenceor as silent as it ever got in a theaterreigned she sighed and closed her eyes but she was not going to get any peace quite yet why did you tell them that i was the one that killed the troll thomas demanded she opened her eyes to see thomass yellow ones staring at her with accusation she groaned killing thatthingdemanded good aim steady nerves and a lot of courage no she asked true thomas agreed but what knight in shining armor likes to turn up to discover the princess has rescued herself and slain the dragon she asked but we didnt we onlyi mean i onlyi was nearly killed if you hadnt nearly does not count she replied and closed her eyes again besides it was a good plan it should have worked it might just as well have and i wish monsieur jonathon to continue to look at me as if i were la augustine and not as if i were jeanne darc ncest pas she yawned therefore i have lost my sword for now she barely heard thomas say for now epilogue the production of escape from the harem was an enormous success tickets were sold out for the next two months and it appeared very much as if they would continue to be sold out well into the next season the little dancer around whom the production had been staged seemed to have a magical way with her audience even grown men wept at her solo of despair and were more than half in love with her as she entreated the wicked sorcerer to help her and melted his heart no one left the theater without a smile therefore it was with extreme disappointment that two of blackpools leading lights the very wealthy financier bascombe devons and hiswell she was not his wife but no one was likely to tell his wife that she was with himcompanion then discovered that they were to be crowded into a box with three other couples none of whom they knew or particularly wanted to know see here the man complained to the usher what about that box i know for a fact no one is in it weve been watching the door for a quarter hour now and not one person has gone into or out of it ah im sorry sir but that box is taken the usher said apologetically nonsense the nameplate says sir the usher bent a look of reproach on him what would you put on it if the party that was taking it didnt want to be known the financier paused for a moment in his bluster then grew thoughtful you dont mean to sayroyalty so to speak i shouldnt say any more the usher led them past the unopened door both the man and his lovely friend much more content now with the knowledge that they would be seated a mere partition away from a crown as to which crown it might beenglish some visiting prince it hardly mattered behind that closed door thomas the cat pushed the dish of sardines over to his lovely companion whose white coat gleamed in the dim light from the theater beyond please help yourself my dear the white cat purred and accepted the token i am so glad you invited me here i have never seen a performance from a proper seat before thomas smirked strangely enough the troll had done him a very great favor it had never occurred to him until that moment that there might be other shapeshifters out there but once he knew a quiet word with the brownie a hint to nigels sylphs a latenight talk with one of the salamanders when jonathon was engaged in trying to master the art of flirtation with ninettethe elementals were on the whole favorably inclined and a week after the premier of the production this proud beauty had turned up she was she coyly informed him the offspring of a werecat and the afrit who loved her an injudicious move on her part had locked her into this form or so she said the masters at least vouched for her intent which was benign and her magics which were as white as her coat that was enough for thomas then i am happy to share this box with you whenever you wish to grace it with your presence o orient pearl thomas said with supreme satisfaction and you can rest assured that no one will disturb us here once we have settled in ohreally she replied archly purring with promise oh yes really thomas settled himself more comfortably didnt you see the plate on the door i cannot read the writing of your people o trollslayer what does it say thomas smiled why o cloud of whiteness i believe you must approve it says reserved for the cat
