sara paretsky hardball book in the vi warshawski series for judy finer and kate jones the world and my words in it are poorer for your leaving thanks i first came to chicago in the summer of to do community service for the chicago presbyterys summer of service i was assigned to a white neighborhood on chicagos southwest side not far from where martin luther king had been living since january my job that summer was to work with kids six to ten years old my coworkers and i tried to educate them and support them during a frightening time my summer in the city was the defining time of my life my immediate boss the rev thomas phillips saw that my coworkers and i were immersed in every aspect of the city and neighborhood life from local white citizens council meetings the catholic youth group and other neighborhood groups to broader city political and social events the white sox who were in our backyard wouldnt return our phone calls but the cubs gave our kids free tickets every thursday so i became a cubs fana heavy price to pay for a summer of service we also watched shaws st joan performed under moonlight at the university of chicago which made the universitymy current homeseem like a magical place dr king joined local civil rights leaders like al raby in a series of marches designed to protest the citys pernicious realestate policies the idea of open housing in chicago spawned riots all over the city marquette park eight blocks west of where i was living and working was the scene of an eighthour riot as the neighborhood attacked police for protecting dr king and his associates slogans with the vilest imaginable epithets were displayed in the park and around town many of our neighbors especially in the local churches stepped up to the challenge of the times with courage openness and charity sadly some of our neighbors were the bottle and rockthrowing hatespewing rioters of marquette park the intensity of that summer the pleasure i had in working with the children the engagement with the city despite its flaws made chicago a part of me or me part of it and it has been my home ever since hardball takes place in the present but the heart of the story has its roots in that summer as always many people helped make this book possible my old coworker barbara perkins wright shared her own perspective on that summer and helped piece together my memories barbara and i heard king speak at soldier field then marched with him to city hall where he taped his demands to the mayors doorwhat an exhilarating time we thought change for good was not only possible but near at hand lately my longdormant sense of hope has come back to life i have relied on taylor branchs at canaans edge for some details of chicago in jean maclean snyder helped with information about the illinois prison system and the politics of cook countys criminal justice system james chapman who teaches at the stateville correctional facility provided many details of daytoday prison life there linda sutherland who corrected some of my us army mistakes in bleeding kansas kindly advised me on the medals mr contreras would have earned from his world war ii service dave case a chicago police officer and fellow crime writer gave me helpful details about storage of departmental files the sisters at the eighth day justice center in chicago inspired me greatly sonia settler and jo fasen made it possible for me to return to a more normal writing life the senior cdog was helpful as always the novel is a work of fiction i have taken liberties with chicago police badges i have tried not to take liberties with chicago geography but of course every now and then mistakes creep in and i rely on alert readers to point them out but most of what takes place between these covers is a work of the imagination as free and unfettered as is in my power to make it anaconda fury johnny merton was playing with me and we both knew it it was a fun game for him he was doing endless years for crimes ranging from murder and extortion to excessive litigation he had a lot of time on his hands we were sitting in the room at stateville reserved for lawyers and their clients i couldnt believe johnny was stringing me along thinking id get him out early it had been too many years since id practiced criminal law for me to be a good bet for any convict let alone someone who needed clarence darrow and johnnie cochran working double shifts before he had a prayer i want the innocence project working for me warshawski he announced that afternoon and you are innocent of exactly what i pretended to make a note on my legal pad whatever theyre charging me with he grinned inviting me to think he was clowning but i didnt smile back whatever else he might be johnny merton was no buffoon johnny was past sixty during my brief stint as his lawyer when id been with the public defenders office hed been an angry man whose rage at being assigned yet another newminted attorney made it almost impossible to stay in the bull pen with him hed earned his nickname the hammer because he could bludgeon anyone with anything including his emotions the twentyfive intervening yearsmany behind barshadnt exactly mellowed him but he had learned better ways of working the system compared to you my wants are so simple i said lamont gadsden you know warshawski life in prison it takes away so much from you and one of the things ive lost is my memory name does not ring a bell he leaned back in his chair arms crossed the snakes coiling around his biceps looping down so that the heads rested on his wrists seemed to writhe against his dark skin word is you know where every anaconda past and present is even to their final resting places if theyve left the planet people do exaggerate dont they warshawski especially when theyre in front of a cop or a states attorney im not looking for lamont gadsden for my health johnny but his mama and his aunt want him found before they die even though he hung with you his auntie continues to think of him as a good christian boy yeah every time you mention miss claudia i start to cry when im by myself and no one can see me of course you cant afford to get a reputation for softness in the joint i doubt your tender heart will ever be your downfall i said you remember sister frances i heard about her warshawski now there truly was a fine christian woman and i hear you was with her when jesus took her home you hear a lot i put just the right amount of admiration into the sentence and johnny preened but he didnt say anything you dont care what she said to me before she died i prodded you can make up anything a dead person said its a good angle but im not biting what about the living then you care about what your kid has to say about you you been talking to my girl this was news to him and rage swept him off his feet making the veins in his throat bulge you been harassing my family and i hear about it from you in here first you stay away from my girl shes living a life any fatherd be proud of and i wont have scum like you bring her down you hear the guard came over from the corner and tapped his arm johnny take it easy man take it easy take it easy you take it easy when this bitch this cunt comes after your family i wouldnt run you as a whore warshawski you stink so bad the guard was summoning help someone came in with manacles for johnny the innocence project huh i pulled my papers together about the only thing youre innocent of is the smarts to keep your sorry ass out of jail i went through the search even lawyers undergo on their way out of stateville i hadnt brought anything in with me and i was leaving emptyhanded too johnny and i certainly hadnt exchanged anything in our fortyfive minutes together just to be on the safe side the guards searched the trunk of my car as soon as i was clear of the prison grounds i pulled off the road to stretch my arms tension builds in the calmest muscles when those gates close on you and nothing about time in the big house made me calm joliet where the prison stands lies on the far side of chicagos heaviest exurban sprawl and id be hitting the road at the same time everyone in the western suburbs was going home the thought of the traffic knotted my shoulders even more as i crept forward i jotted a note in my time log fortyfive minutes on the lamont gadsden inquiry id long passed the point where i was making money on the case but i couldnt let the inquiry go not as deeply mired in it as id become i oozed through the ipass lane at country club plaza and finally found myself near streets i recognized where i could take shortcuts around the expressways it was almost seven and the september sun was close to the horizon blinding me every time the road curved west i needed to run in the fresh air with my dogs i wanted to blow stateville out of my lungs and hair then curl up with a drink and the cubscardinals game but i had two reports to finish for my most important breadandbutter client best swing by my office and get them done so i could enjoy the game nothing warned me that my drive from joliet was as relaxed as i was going to be for some time when i tapped in the code at the entrance to my building everything looked normal the lock mechanism released with a wheeze like a dying goose nothing unusual about that i had to use my shoulder to shove the door open also normal it wasnt until i opened my own door that trouble hit me i switched on the overhead lights and saw every paper i owned on the floor the file cabinets had been dumped the drawers flung aside so that they perched at crazy angles my ordnance maps dangled from the lips of their shelves no i heard myself whisper who hated me so much theyd wreak this kind of fury against me i shivered wrapping my arms across my chest my office is a big barn with little rooms planted in it little dollhouse rooms lots of places for someone to hide i backed into the hall and carefully set down my briefcase as if it were a carton of eggs that needed protecting i pulled my cellphone out of my jacket pocket and dialed phone in hand i tiptoed around the partitions the invaders had fled but theyd vented their rage everywhere i sidled into the back saw my daybed had been tossed the copy machine disassembled i skirted the upended drawers and went behind the partition where my desk stood those drawers had been flung to the floor hard enough to crack the wood the same violent hands had dismembered my reference manuals pages of the illinois criminal code were strewn like remains of a victory parade the frames of my mothers engraving of the uffizi and my nell choate jones print had been pried apart and splintered the pictures lying under the shards of glass i squatted on my haunches and picked up the uffizi cradling it like a child after a time my frozen brain started to work dont touch stuff just in case an evidence team takes it seriously and what about tessa my leasemate i crossed to the studio where tessa welds big metal chunks into spaceage sculptures but everything there was in order she must have been here this afternoona faint soursharp smell of solder lingered in the air i sat at her drafting table hands sweaty heart pounding all those signs of fear and anger and waited there for the cops when i heard the siren i went out front to meet them a squad car pulled up its strobes staining the twilit streets a ghostly blue two cops bounced out a young woman and a middleaged guy with a gut i stopped them at the entrance to show them the keypad someone who knew the combination had been here or someone with a sophisticated bypass device the guy with the gut made a note he asked how many people knew the code my leasemate a couple of people who work for me i dont know who ms reynoldsmy leasematehas given the combination what about the rear exit the woman asked i led them down the hall to the back door it was selflocking with no exterior keyhole or pad the woman shone her flashlight around the concrete slab outside the door i saw a white band on the slabone of those rubber bracelets that the kids wear these days to show their support of everything from breastcancer research to their college fieldhockey teams i knelt to pick it up but i knew before i looked at it what it would say one when you looked at it you were supposed to want to work for a planet unified in love fighting aids and poverty as one my cousin petra owned a bracelet like this it was big on her and when she was excited it flew off her arm petra petra here in this office while the tornado from hell whirled through it my vision blurred and i found myself sprawling on the concrete slab the two cops got me back on my feet back inside and asked me what id found my cousin my mouth was dry my voice a squawk my cousin petra this is hers young confident beautiful petra had come to chicago fresh out of college to work as an intern on brian krumass senate campaign for another moment my brain stayed frozen then i remembered my video monitor i have one because the front door is remote from my office and invisible from the hallway my fingers trembled as i tried to boot up my computer the modem had been yanked free from the port the middleaged cop stood over me while i found the wires and got my system hooked back together i pushed the on button the apple gave its opening chord and i breathed a little prayer to the god i dont believe in saint michael patron of police and private eyes get me my video files while the cops watched i pulled up the images my leasemate had come in at and left at fourseventeen while i was walking away from johnny merton three people showed up hats pulled low over their heads coat collars hiked well up faces and sexes both unrecognizable they were all roughly the same height in their bulky coats it was hard to tell if they were all the same girth i thought the one on the left was the stockiest the one in the middle the thinnest but i couldnt be sure we could hear the buzzing as they rang the front door and then one of them tapped in the door code who else knows that code the male cop demanded who besides the people you mentioned imy cousin knew it i could hardly get the words out i let her use my machine one night when she lost her internet access is she in this picture the woman asked i froze the image on the screen a professional might be able to decode race or sex from these grainy pictures but i couldnt make them out i shrugged helplessly i called petras cellphone but only got her voice mail i tried the krumas campaign but theyd shut down for the night the cops sprang into action calling codes in possible kidnapping possible assault possible aggravated burglary the possibilities were endless and chilling squad and tac cars began pouring in while i made the hardest of all the phone calls the one to my uncle peter and his wife rachel to tell them their oldest child had disappeared wild parent what did you do to her peter grabbed my shoulders and shook me let go i snapped this isnt the way answer me damn you he was hoarse his face swollen with fury i tried twisting from his graspi didnt want to fight himbut he dug his hands deeper into my back i kicked him on the shin hard he yelped more from surprise than pain his hold on me loosened and i backed away he lunged for me but i ducked and moved farther back rubbing my shoulders my uncle was almost seventy but his fingers still held the strength hed gotten on the slaughterhouse floor in his teens the two dogs were making ominous noises in the back of their throats still gasping for breath i put a hand on their shoulders easy mitch easy peppy sit they had caught my anxiety and were yawning and mewling in worry theres no call for you to carry on like that mr contreras had risen to his feet when peter attacked me he was an old man himself close to ninety but he was ready to fling himself into battle vic here would never put your gal in harms way you can take it from me considering that mr contreras had flung accusations of his own at me when i reported petras disappearance i was grateful that he was willing to support me in front of her parents you whoever you are mind your own damned business my uncle was happy to have a fresh target to attack peter yelling this anger it isnt going to help rachel spoke from the shadows behind the piano peter and mr contreras and i were all startled in the rage of the moment wed forgotten my aunt was there when i finally tracked her and peter down the previous night they were at a campsite in the laurentian mountains with their four younger daughters it was peters secretary in kansas city who got me the relevant phone numbers and arranged for the corporate jet to fly into quebec city to pick up the family peter and rachel drove all night to get to the airport ashland meats jet dropped rachel and peter at ohare and went on to kansas city with the other daughters where they would stay with rachels mother petra was pretty nervous the last few days i said to rachel she said nothing was bothering her but im thinking now maybe this was weighing on her this plan to let these thugs into my office damn you peter roared petra does not know thugs you do youre the one fucking around with the anacondas going out to stateville to see johnny merton behind bars how do you know about merton i was startled rachel gave a strained apologetic smile petra and i talk every day sometimes three times a day she told us about your meetings with this man in prison it was interesting news to her and i heard about it from harvey too peter snapped he says vic here disobeyed a direct order from a local judge to stop looking into the affairs of these old gangbangers if i hadnt been so distraught myself i would have laughed disobeyed a direct order im not in the army peter that judge used to be my boss at the pd hes afraid im going to make him look bad because he did a terrible job on an old case involving one of johnny mertons street soldiers so what if he did one less gang member on the street for any reason is all to the good but vic how can you be sure it was petra in your office last night rachel said shed asked the question before but she was so worried she kept forgetting the answer i explained again about finding her daughters bracelet outside the back door and yes it could have belonged to someone else but i dont think so even if it was hers what makes you think she opened the door peter demanded maybe it was that sculptor who shares the building how do you know she isnt connected to some mob operation i opened and shut my mouth several times but didnt speak tessa reynolds is africanamerican and i didnt want to find out that her race was driving my uncles wild suggestion shes also africanamerican aristocracy her mother a famous lawyer her father a highly successful engineer they worry that im dragging tessa down into the mud the cases i get and the people who show up at the building id already had an anxious call from tessas mother after last nights breakin made the late news i was too tired and too confused to pursue that line of thinking instead i booted up my laptop id emailed myself the camera footage that showed the trio whod come into my office yesterday afternoon now i showed the images to rachel and peter does any of them look like petra to you of course not peter stomped away from the machine and pulled out his cellphone this is a fucking waste of time why are we even sitting here for letting vic spin us around in circles shes just trying to get off the hook for putting petey in harms way rachel shook her head tears were slowly welling and falling along her nose thats petra in the middle how can you be sure of all the peter its the crocodile dundee hat and outback oilcloth coat she got in melbourne she was so proud of them even in this picture i can tell she looked at me through her wet lashes vic someone must have forced her to do this were meeting with special agent hatfield at the fbi in an hour give me some names some people the fbi can talk to yeah cookie mr contreras put in this aint the time to hold your cards close to your chest the way you like to do have you talked to her college roommate to kelsey i asked i dont know her last name but shes the person petra talks about most kelsey ingalls she called me when she saw the news online this morning she said shed tried calling petrawe all have and we keep getting rolled over to her voice mail rachels voice quavered vic there must be someone youve talked to who can lead the fbi or the police to petra please please tell me their names i shook my head helplessly my apartment was trashed a few nights ago and i did wonder if a cop excop named alito had been involved but i dont have any real reason to suspect him other than that johnny merton the head of the anacondas if he was mad enough at me he might do anything but i was talking to him when this was going on he didnt lose his cool with me until the end of the meeting peter seized on johnny and the anacondas if peter had known i was working with violent criminals hed never have let petra come within twenty miles of me i understand i said when hed shouted himself hoarse but look at the times recorded on my door monitor it looks as though petra was waiting for tessamy leasemate the sculptor you knowfor her to leave theres a tenminute gap tessa leaves petra types in the code and goes in with those two punks vic coincidences happen rachel said trying to stay calm how would petra know people like that she just graduated from college in may shes never lived in chicago shes been working in an office downtown with a bunch of other twentysomethings shes just a suburban midwest girl whos never seen a criminal in her life and wouldnt recognize one if she did im not saying its your fault but youre the one who knows gangsters and people like that not petra please please turn your files over to the fbi or to bobby mallory they can look into everyone youve been talking to bobby came to my office last night i said he had pushed his way past the cops filling the entryway and found me underneath my desk trying to see if anything else of my cousin had been discarded there along with her bracelet despite the many good women who have worked for him in the last fifteen years my presence at a crime scene still gives him heartburn there you are vicki one of the boys whos smarter than he looks saw your last name on a sheet and brought it to me whos petra peters kid what insane business did you involve her in does peter know hell turn your guts into sausage casing if you hurt his kid not guilty bobby i said wearily crawling out shes working on the krumas campaign i dont know why she came here or who she let in i showed him the video footage and explained how shed happened to have my frontdoor combination he frowned over the photos then demanded of the patrol units if theyd done anything to get the footage over to a videotechnology team once bobby showed up the tempo of the investigation accelerated aggressive cops became subdued and helpful lethargic ones became energetic and an evidence team magically appeared and began dusting the whole mess for prints blood any trace of anything bobby called the fbi in case it was a kidnapping they sent a special agent over around eleven and i had to answer useless questions all over again in the middle of it all i started getting calls from reporters and a television crew parked outside my office brian krumas himself called while i was talking to the fbis special agent the candidate was at a highend fundraiser in hollywood but of course his staff had heard about petras disappearance krumas talked to bobby and then to me youre petras cousin right we met at the navy pier event didnt we im giving you my private number vic and i want you to call me the instant you have any news of her okay i copied the number into my pda and went back to the fbi no matter how mediagenic you are yourselfand brian krumas was being touted as a glamorous new bobby kennedydisappearing blond twentysomethings are national news and you need to do damage control when i finally got home i didnt sleep much i kept jolting awake trying not to imagine what could be happening to petra trying instead to think of places i should look for her and wondering who she had invited into my office you shouldnt be talking to a lowlife like johnny merton anyway mr contreras said i been telling you that since the first time you drove out there but no one except you ever knows right from wrong the rest of us are too ignorant to have opinions and now youve got petra in trouble i know just how many counts merton was charged with it wouldnt surprise me one bit to know he had my girl kidnapped and forced her to open your office peter roared swinging around the room to put his nose almost against mine if any harm comes to her because of you whatever it is i will inflict it on you tenfold do you hear me i stood very still not speaking if harm came to petra because of me i didnt think i could live with myself anyway but her fathers wild rage was impossible to respond to his phone rang and he finally backed away from me to answer it i turned to face rachel you go see derek hatfield hes a good field agent what will you do she asked im putting my own best agent on the case i said bleakly my best agent had been unable to find lamont gadsden my best agent had left a trail of desolation at the mighty waters freedom center i hoped she could do a better job looking for petra no good deed remains unpunished lamont gadsden and my cousin petra it was hard to imagine two people with less in common an old buddy of hammer mertons from chicagos south side a millennium gen text messager from an upscale kansas city suburb if it hadnt been for me and some terrible luck their lives would never have collided petra being my cousin it wasnt surprising that she looked for me when she showed up in chicago at the start of the summer a freshminted college graduate with an internship in her daddys hometown it was sheer luck the bad kind that i agreed to look for lamont gadsden sometimes when i want someone to blame someone outside my family i snarl unfairly at a homeless guy named elton grainger elton was the unwitting deus ex machina who led me into the gadsden morass elton had been working my street off and on for several years i knew him to say hey to i bought streetwise from him bought coffee or sandwiches for him from time to time once during a blizzard id offered him shelter in my office but he turned me down then one golden june afternoon he collapsed in front of my office if id let him lie maybe petra would never have vanished maybe sister frankie would still be alive theres a lesson in that about the fate that awaits the good samaritan it happened as i was tapping in the code to my office building vic where you been i havent seen you in weeks youre looking good he flourished a copy of streetwise new issue today ive been in italy i fumbled in my wallet for the us money that still looked weird to me my first true vacation in fifteen years its hard to be back foreign travel i got all that out of my system at nineteen when uncle sam paid my airfare to saigon i pulled out a five and elton fell to the sidewalk i dropped keys and papers and knelt next to him hed hit his head as he went down and was bleeding in an ugly way but he was breathing and i could feel his pulse in an irregular feathery beat like some fragile ballerina dancing against the music the next few hours were a blur of ambulance emergency room hospital admissions they wanted a lot of details but i didnt know him except as the homeless guy whod worked this stretch of west town the last several years about the only personal thing hed told me was that hed lost his wife as his drinking got heavier hed never mentioned children today was the first time id heard about vietnam hed been a carpenter and sometimes still got daywork as for health care i couldnt help the hospital with their paperwork he was homeless i hoped he had a green card for city health services but i had no way of knowing i wanted to get back to my officeid been away ten weeks and had an entire himalayan range of paper waiting for mebut i didnt feel easy leaving elton until there was some kind of prognosis or resolution in his care in the end it took two hours before an intern who was stretched to the breaking point came in and that was only because i kept going to the triage nurse and pushing eltons case his crisis asking for oxygen heart monitoring something he had regained consciousness while lying on the gurney but his skin was cold and waxy and his pulse was still very weak a white woman in her early thirties who seemed to be caring for an elderly black man gave me a wry smile the third time i went up to the counter its hard isnt it the staffing cutbacks have been too steep they just cant keep up with the patient load i nodded i just got back from a long stay in europe yesterday i havent adjustedto the time zone or our healthcare system is he your brother she pointed toward eltons gurney hes a homeless guy who collapsed in front of my building the woman pursed her soft rosebud mouth would you like me to look in on him if they manage to stabilize him i have friends at some of the homeless agencies here in town i agreed thankfully finally the intern who didnt look old enough for high school let alone an innercity hospital came over to the gurney he asked elton some questions about his drinking and smoking and sleeping he listened to eltons heart and called for an ekg an eeg and an echocardiogram and oxygen hes got some arrhythmia going on the intern told me well see how serious it is if hes homeless and drinking it takes a toll elton smiled at me and pressed my fingers weakly with nicotinestained fingers you run on vic ill be okay here thanks foryou know god bless all that he produced a grubby green card from an inner pocket so i knew they wouldnt put him straight out on the street i caught a cab back to my office and put eltonnot out of my mind but to the bottom of it i was exhausted from travel but id been away too long to give myself decompression time before returning to work id been in italy with morrell where wed rented a cottage in umbria in the hill country near my mothers childhood home morrell had finally recovered from the bullets that almost killed him in the khyber pass two years earlier he wanted to test his legs see if he was ready for journalisms front lineshe was aching to return to afghanistandespite the death of some three hundred journalists in iraq and afghanistan since we began our endless war my needs were even more personal id grown up speaking italian with my mother but id never visited her home i wanted to meet relatives i wanted to listen to music where gabriella had learned it see paintings in their umbrian and tuscan light drink torgiano in the hills where the grapes grew morrell and i visited the remnants of gabriellas family elderly catholic cousins who exclaimed how much like gabriella i looked but who wouldnt talk about the years shed had to live in hiding with her father an italian jew they claimed not to remember my grandfather who had been denounced and sent to auschwitz the day after someone smuggled gabriella to the coast and a cubabound freighter no one knew what had become of gabriellas younger brother moselio gabriella herself hadnt heard from him since he joined the partisans in and i hadnt been optimistic my mothers been dead a long time but i still miss her i was hoping for too much from her pitigliano family morrell and i toured the siena opera house where gabriella had performed her only professional singing role iphigenia in jommellis opera thanks to which i have the most insane middle name in chicago we even met a frail diva now almost ninety who remembered gabriella from their student days together in the conservatory una voce comuna campana dorata a voice like a golden bell as i knew gabriella used to fill our fiveroom bungalow in south chicago to the bursting point when she sang when she arrived in chicago a poor clueless immigrant gabriella answered an advertisement for a singer in a milwaukee avenue bar where the backroom boys tried to take off her clothes while she sang non mi dir bellidol mio my dad had rescued her from that my dad wandering in for a beer in the middle of a scorching july afternoon and pulling her away from the groping hands of the bar manager my father had been a chicago cop a kind and gentle man who adored my mother from that day forward looking at the baroque cupids holding up a plaster banner in the siena opera i felt the gulf between the stage and the music where gabriella began her life and the bungalow in the middle of the steel mills where she ended it how could my father and i have ever been enough to make up for all that italys racial laws forced her to renounce that part of the trip had been difficult but when we left siena and pitigliano morrell and i spent a pleasant two months together it became clear to us both though that this trip marked the farewell tour of our affair we had thought when we planned this vacation that it would deepen our relationship since we worked at unusual jobs that kept us from home for long stretches wed never spent concentrated time together as the time came for morrell to catch his train to rome and the direct flight to islamabad we both realized we were ready to say goodbye i flew home from milan a few days later sad wondering what it was that had kept morrell and me from a deeper tighter bond was i too messy or morrell too compulsively tidy maybe i was too prickly as some of my friends suggested for anyone to get close to me or maybe ultimately each of us reserved our deepest commitments for work morrells career as a journalist covering international humanrights issues looked so much more glamorous than my own so much more deserving of a deep commitment after all i spend my time looking at frauds and sleazy con artists that thought depressed me too as i left elton at the hospital and rode a cab back to my office when the cab reached the rehabbed warehouse i share with my sculpting friend i had to remind myself again that i was back in americathis time over the issue of tips which are never as big in europe as they need to be here i took a breath and typed in the code on the keypad at the door eltons crisis was over my vacation was over i unlocked my inneroffice door amy blount a young history phd whos done research projects for me in the past had organized my documents so rigorously that they just about saluted when i opened the door the trouble was there were too damned many of them my whole worktable was covered with neatly labeled papers while my desk held a stack of the most urgent papers while i was away i only went to an internet café twice a week to check for messages amy held down the fort for me handling small projects and responding to routine inquiries we spoke only when something came up that she couldnt handle right before i came home amy suddenly found an academic position shed been looking for three years she had to leave for buffalo in a hurry to start the summer term shed organized my papers and left a pot of crimson gerbera daisies a little wilted from their time alone but a gallant splash of color in my cavernous space this afternoon i poured water into the daisies and pretended to be interested in the mountain range of files on my big long worktable unfortunately on top of the highest peak stood my creditcard bills pay within ten days to avoid loss of credit rating a kidney or any hope of filling your car again i looked at the amex bill out of the corner of my eye as if that would make it smaller the dying us dollar meant i definitely should not have cheered myself with those lario boots the day before i left milan or that antonella mason acrylic morrell and i found on a side trip to treviso i made a face and forced myself to start digging fast turnaround on my own pastdue invoices had to be my first priority i put in a call to a temporary agency to find someone to help and started returning the stack of my most crucial phone calls those from clients with real money to spend a little before five i had to stop my body thought it was midnight and i was starting to forget who i was talking to or what language i was speaking in the middle of complicated sentences i was putting a few files in my briefcasethe pessimist says the case is half full the optimist that shell read them over supperwhen the outer bell rang i have a surveillance camera at the door so that i dont have to run down the hall every time the ups man is delivering a ton of steel to my leasemate i looked at the image on my computer screen its not a sophisticated system but i thought i recognized the young woman id seen at the hospital earlier today with elton elton id completely forgotten him my stomach tightened had she come to deliver bad news in person i pushed the lock release and moved hurriedly down the hall to greet her when i asked about elton she took my hand reassuringly no no he seems to be okay i talked to him for a bit this afternoon hes a vet vietnam so he can be moved to the va hell get better care there i thanked her for coming around in person to tell me assuming elton had given her my office address she smiled in embarrassment i didnt come on his account im afraid but he told me youre a detective and you seem like the kind of person i need oh boy i do a good deed and i get a client who says we have to wait for our reward in heaven when i ushered her into my office she stood hesitantly in the doorway looking around the way people do whose ideas of private eyes are taken from humphrey bogart and james ellroy movies what is it you need detecting ms lennon karen lennon it isnt for me but one of my old ladies she sat on the couch and clasped her hands together on one plump knee im a chaplain i work in the beth israel system and am assigned to lionsgate manorits an assistedliving facility that beth israel runsand my clients are mostly old and mostly women one of my ladies her son is missing she and her sister theyre the ones who raised him they need to find him its the only way they can be at peace before they die ive been trying to figure out what i could do to help them when i saw how compassionate you were with that homeless man and found out you were a detective i thought i could probably trust you to treat my ladies right you know not to turn down work but the police have a whole department devoted to missing persons my ladies are africanamerican and very old karen said they have bad memories of the police a private detective wouldnt carry all that baggage in their eyes i dont work for free the way the cops would i said or the salvation armythey have a service the army says miss ellas sons been missing too long for them to do much for her although they did file a report she hesitated shes living on her small social security check didnt get a pension after all her years screwing gizmos together for the phone company i looked you up online and saw the voluntary organizations you servewomens shelters rape crisis reproductive rightsi thought you probably would do pro bono work if the people were in dire need my lips tightened i sometimes do pro bono work but not on missing persons especially not a person whos been missing for a long time how long has it been anyway that the salvation army balked at searching i dont know the details karen lennon looked at her hands she wasnt a skilled liar she knew and she thought i wouldnt take the case if she told me anyway miss ella can explain it to you better than me her lifes been so hard and it would ease the last stage of her journey if she saw someone was willing to help her out someone will have to come up with money for my fee i said firmly even if i dont charge my full rate which is a hundred fifty an hour i cannot afford to pour time and money down a sinkhole in this economy does lionsgate manor have any kind of discretionary funds you can draw on my old friend lotty herschel is the leading perinatologist at beth israel we were having dinner later this evening i could ask her both about karen lennon and this lionsgate manor and whether beth israel might cough up money for a good cause if it was in fact a good cause maybe if you have a conversation with miss ella you can steer her toward a place she could afford karen sidestepped my suggestion what harm can one meeting do you helluva client over dinner with lotty i told her about my rescue of elton and karen lennons appearance in my life max knows more about the hospitals subsidiaries and their staffs than i do she said when i asked what she knew about karen lennon and lionsgate max loewenthal lottys longtime friend and lover was executive director of beth israel hospital and on the board of their holding company lotty called me the next day with his response lennon sits on beth israels ethics committee max says shes very young but he thinks she has good judgment as for your other question do we have a discretionary fund we have all kinds of odd funds for odd purposes but none to pay for private detectives to find the missing children of residents in our facilities youll have to decide on your own what to do about that my dear i could haveshould havelet karen lennon and her old ladies lie but after all lennon had stepped in to help with elton three days later when i found a free hole in my schedule i drove out roosevelt road past the gargantuan buildings the south side hospital behe moths were erecting to lionsgates tired manor it was a fifteenstory building with a locked ward on the top two floors for alzheimers and dementia patients and a variety of apartments and nursing wards underneath what a grim way to live knowing the elevator might one day loft you skyward and only bring you down again in a box the security guard at the entrance directed me to karen lennons office the place was so labyrinthine that i got lost a couple of times and had to stop for directions at least everyone i asked seemed to know who the chaplain was which meant she was doing a good job of covering her parish lionsgate manor was clean but its last overhaul lay a long way in the past the paint on the walls was chipped and you could see where walkers and canes had pounded dents in the cracked linoleum flooring only a few hall lights were burned out or missing but management used the lowest wattage possible so even on a bright summer day the air was a dingy green making me feel as though i were at the bottom of a dirty ocean when i finally reached lennons office she was talking to an older woman a staff member but she finished the conversation quickly and got up to escort me to ella gadsdens apartment i mentioned max loewenthals name to the chaplain as we rode the elevator and her face brightened so many executive directors are too focused on profit max remembers that the hospital only exists because it has a mission to care for human suffering we got off on the ninth floor lennon led me briskly down the hall as we went the pastor warned me that miss ellas manner could seem brusque dont let that put you off shes been through a lot as i said at your office and she puts on a tough veneer for protection karen lennon knocked on the apartment door after several minutes after we heard the heavy thumping of someone who walked with a cane and the scrape of locks being undone the door opened miss ella was a tall woman and despite the cane she held herself ramrod straight home alone in the middle of the afternoon she still wore stockings and a severely cut navy dress this is ms warshawski miss ella shes here to talk with you about your son miss ella inclined her head a fraction of an inch but ignored my outstretched hand call and let me know how you get on karen lennon let the comment float between miss ella and me after a few questions about miss claudias condition the chaplain trotted back down the hall i got off to a rocky start as soon as i walked in the room was tiny and crammed with the mementos of miss ellas lifetables and shelves stuffed with hummel figurines china vases glass animals a large bronze head of martin luther king jr i knocked against a teetery table and rattled a tableau of china gazelles and zebras nothing fell but miss ella muttered hmmpf adding bull in a china shop in a loud undervoice only a small round table near the kitchenette was free of breakables but it held miss ellas workbasket an enormous wicker affair that sprouted knitting needles like porcupine quills martin luther king jrs and barack obamas portraits hung on either side of the wallmounted television framed religious texts stood among the figurines during your times of suffering and trial when you see only one set of footprints it was then i carried you i read and try to live each day he sends to serve my gracious masters ends the messages seemed incongruous with miss ellas bitter mouth and harsh tone but maybe when she was home alone she was softer more malleable she motioned me to a wooden chair next to the porcupine quills and pulled up a second hard chair to face me when i tried to help her she gave me a look that could have slit upholstery and told me to sit the first few minutes she only offered the briefest answers to my questions i hear youre looking for your son yes what is his name lamont emmanuel gadsden how old is he sixtyone when did you last see him ms gadsden january twentyfifth i was startled into silence no wonder karen lennon hadnt wanted to tell me that was more than a long time to be missing it was two lifetimes finally i asked if miss ella had looked for him at the time he went missing she nodded grimly but didnt volunteer anything further i tried not to sigh out loud how did you search for him then we talked to his friends they said he just disappeared her jaws clamped shut but she pried them open after a moment to add i didnt approve of those friends it was a hard job to go to them and they werent respectful but i dont think they were lying and you filed a missing persons report in we went to the police she pronounced the word to emphasize the first syllable pohleese there we were two christians in our sunday best and they treated us like we were darkies in a minstrel show my dad was a cop i blurted out whats that supposed to mean miss ellas jaws worked around her false teeth as if they were cud that the police are fine honest men who stand up and say yes maam when a black woman comes into the station looking for help no maam of course not i said quietly i suppose i thought you should know up front in case you found out later and thought i was hiding something from you miss ellas lips tightened into wellrehearsed lines of bitterness not that she didnt have reason i could imagine the scene the south side district station in when crude racial slurs were part of life and most of the cops were white but my dad hadnt been like that it always gets my hackles up when people dismiss all cops as pigs or brutes still its not a good policy to argue with the client you say we was that you and your husband my sister and me she came to live with me after my husband passed when lamont was thirteen and ive always said that was when lamont started to strayshe indulged the boy so much that he lost his sense of direction but thats water over the dam my sister is ill now too ill to live long and its a wish dear to her to know what happened to lamont thats the only reason im opening that box after all this time pastor karen said you come highly recommended nothing in miss ellas voice betrayed that she placed any confidence in karen lennons words very kind of her did she tell you about my fee structure miss ella pushed herself to her feet she moved slowly through the maze of furniture to a sideboard with an audible groan she bent to open a door and pulled out a small lockbox she extracted a key from a chain around her neck and unlocked the box my sisters life insurance it has a face value of ten thousand dollars when she passes i will pay you out of what doesnt get spent on her funeral unless of course you find lamont then the money is his to do with what he wishes she held the policy out for me to read the declarations page ajax insurance had issued it to claudia marie ardenne lamont emmanuel gadsden was her legatee and ella anastasia ardenne gadsden his successor it was a horrible moment the sense of being a ghoul waiting to feast on her sisters remains i almost turned around and walked out but something in my prospective clients face made me think she was hoping for such a reaction or at least hoping to make me uncomfortable enough to waive my fee i pulled out a notebook and started taking down such skimpy details as she could offer the name of the pastor at her church when lamont was a child his high school physics teacher who thought lamont had promise and ought to go to college what about his friends i asked the ones you didnt approve of i dont remember their names its been forty years you know how it is miss ella these things sometimes come back to us in the middle of the night i smiled limpidly to show that i knew she was lying in case they do you can write them down and call me and the day you last saw him what was he doing where was he going it was at the dinner table he didnt often come home at dinnertime but there he was eating bean soup and reading the paper we got an evening paper then and he was reading through it while my sister and i were talking and suddenly he flung down the paper and headed for the door without a byyourleave is that what you do eat and not even say thank you for the meal i asked claudia always thought i was too harsh with lamont but i didnt see why a boy couldnt learn manners in this life he didnt have a job and there claudia and i were me screwing parts together at the phone plant claudia cleaning up after spoiled white folks and lamont thinking we lived to wait on him she paused breathing hard reliving the resentments that hadnt eased for being forty years old so that night when i said what i said he kissed his fingers to me and passed some sarcastic comment on the delightful repast before going out the door just wearing that thin jacket the kind all those hotshot boys sported in those days the next day was the big storm you know when he didnt come home i thought he must have taken shelter somewhere that jacket wasnt enough to carry him through a blizzard oh yes the big storm of sixtyseven id been ten then and it seemed like a winter fairyland to me two feet of snow fell drifts rose to the height of buildings the blizzard briefly covered the yellow stains that the steel mills left on our car and house painting everything a dazzling white for adults it had been a nightmare my dad was stuck at the station for the better part of two days while my mother and i struggled to clean the walks and get to a grocery store of course the mills didnt shut down and within a day the mounds of snow looked dirty old dreary it was only later we got worried miss ellas harsh voice brought me back to her living room later when we could get out and about and by then we couldnt find anyone who had seen him it was when i asked for a photograph that miss ella seemed startled i was surprised actually that among all the framed slogans and pictures of dr king malcolm x and other black leaders that i hadnt seen any family pictures at all why do you need one if im going to look for him i need to know what he looked like forty years ago i can scan it and age it see what he might look like at sixty miss ella returned to the sideboard and fumbled inside for a photo album she looked through it slowly and finally took out a shot of a young black man in yellow graduation robes his hair was cropped close to his head in the style of those preafro days he stared seriously at the camera his eyes hard and bleak that was when he graduated high school even though hed started down a wrong road i made him stay in school until he was done the rest are all just baby pictures and such i want this back and i want it back in the same condition it is today i slipped it into a plastic sleeve and put it in a file folder i told her id return it at the end of the week after id made some copies and preliminary inquiries but i dont want your sister to imagine this will be easy i never guarantee results and in this case we may end up with too many dead ends for you to want to continue but you expect me to pay you even if you dont find him i smiled brightly just as your pastor expects to be paid even if she cant save your soul she eyed me narrowly and how will i know youre not cheating her my sister i mean and me i nodded she had a right to know ill give you a written report you or pastor karen can do some spotchecking to see if ive done what i claim i did but until you give me the names of your sons friends theres very little i can do when i left a minute later i heard all the bolts on the door snap shut in reverse order i stood in the hallway already depressed by the inquiry in the detectives absence i hi miss ella your sister spent an hour in her chair today were going to see if she can get to her feet tomorrow the nurses aide said brightly have you come to give her her supper shes tired after working so hard on her therapies today miss ella nodded but didnt answer claudia the family beauty it was harsh to see her like this was it a judgment on them claudia lying in bed hardly able to move or talk wearing diapers like a great big baby pastor hebert would have said so but pastor karen didnt agree pastor karen said god wasnt an angry old man handing out punishments like an overseer or a prison warden but it feels like it lord miss ella murmured not realizing she had spoken aloud until the aide said what was that miss ella it seemed to happen more and more these days that she spoke out loud without realizing it not a crime or even a sin just a nuisance one of the many of growing old the aide carried a tray of mushy food into claudias room the television was on as if grown women needed to have babble shouted at them twentyfour hours a day the woman who shared the room with claudia was rubbing the end of her blanket between her fingers staring vacantly ahead claudia herself was asleep her breath coming out in fast little snorts her hair hadnt been washed miss ella noted grimly preparing her list of complaints for the head of the ward that black hair how it bounced and flipped when claudia was young all the way into middle age really before it started to go gray and shed cut it short shed let it turn into an afro a crown of soft gray curls while ella adhered to a life of iron discipline giving her head over to chemicals and hot irons every month ella sat on her sisters left side where she still had feeling and movement claudias right hand looked soft young the hand of the beautiful girl ella had been so jealous of all those years back but her left hand was as knotted and gnarled with age as ellas own the detective came today ella said she took a picture of lamont away with her shell talk to people shell ask questions does that make you happy claudia squeezed ellas hand yes thank you that makes me happy maybe shell even find our boy and then what ate n ear claudia spoke with difficulty ate n ear alays wron ellie ill edestroy ou she had trouble making her lips move to form consonants the speech therapist made her work on them during the day but alone with her sister at night she relaxed and did what came easiest hate and fear always wrong will destroy you ella knew she was saying that because shed said it so many times in the eightyfive years of their life together pastor karen thought some special gift of empathy lay between ella and claudia that helped ella understand her sister but it was only habit she cranked claudia up in bed and helped her eat a little meatloaf a few spoonfuls of mashed potatoes a bite of garish jello ank ou ellie claudia lay down and ella sat with her until her sister slid away from her into sleep its a bird its a plane no its supercousin traffics become like mark twains old bromide we all whine about it but no one tries to fix it even me i complain about the congestion and then keep driving myself everywhere trouble is chicagos public transportation is so abysmal id never have time to sleep if i tried to cover my client base by bus and el as it was my trip home took over forty minutes not counting a stop for groceries and i only had to go seven miles when id squeezed my car in between a shiny nissan pathfinder and a boxy toyota scion i couldnt summon the energy to get out as soon as i went inside my downstairs neighbor and the two dogs would leap on me all eager for company and two of them eager for exercise a run will do me good i repeated the mantra but couldnt persuade myself to move instead i stared at the trees through the mustangs open sunroof in june summer comes even to the heart of a great city even to the world of the steel mills where i grew up the light and warmth of spring always fill me with nostalgia perhaps more this year because id been immersed so recently in my mothers childhood after seeing the rich green hills in umbria i understood why my mother kept trying to create a mediterranean garden under the grit of the mills by july the leaves including her camellia would be deadlooking coated with sulfur and smoke but each spring the trees put out hopeful tendrils this year it will be different maybe the same would be true of my forebodings about my new client this time events would prove my pessimism false when id left miss ellas apartment i stopped at karen lennons office miss ella had signed a contract agreeing to a thousand dollars worth of investigationessentially two full days at half priceto be paid in installments with seventyfive dollars in cash in advance as a retainer a passing nurses aide told me karen was making pastoral calls in new manors skillednursing wing i sat on a scarred plastic chair in her office for almost an hour my other choice was an armchair whose springs sank almost to the floor i wasnt idle i studied pastor karens books pastoral theology in africanamerican context feminist womanist pastoral theology i read a few pages but when karen still hadnt shown up i answered phone calls and did an internet search for a different client a highpaying law firm i hate cruising the net on a handheldthe screens too small and it takes forever to load textbut karen lennons computer needed a password to get online when karen finally returned she was in a hurry ready to pack up and get out of the building she tried to give me a welcoming pastoral smile but she clearly wasnt ecstatic at my demands for time and information so i said id follow her to the parking garage did you know that lamont gadsden hasnt been seen for forty years when you asked me out here i asked as she locked her office door was that why you were so cagey with me karen lennon was still very young her soft cheeks flushed and she bit her lips i was afraid youd say no outright its so long ago my own mother was only a teenager then it rattled me to realize her mother and i were almost the same age why did miss ella wait so long to make inquiries she didnt karen stopped in the middle of the buildings lobby her hazel eyes large and earnest they asked questions of lamonts friends at the time they went to the police who treated them with total racist contempt they figured there was nothing else they could do they i said that was miss ella and her sister claudia right i told miss ella i needed to see her sister and she refused she grudged every sentence she spoke to me what is she trying to hide oh vic i dont know why miss ella didnt tell you but miss claudia had a stroke right at easter its hard for her to talk and when she does get some words out her speech is terribly slurry miss ellas the only person who can understand her completely although im getting better at it its been since her stroke that miss claudias become obsessed with this search miss ella tried to talk her out of it because of how long its been and how little hope there is of learning anything but miss claudia wouldnt rest until her sister promised to find lamont try to find him anyway are you going to look for him i pursed my lips ill do what i can but there arent many avenues to follow and miss ella isnt helping by refusing to give me any names of people who knew her son i can help with that lennon said eagerly she isnt very trustful with strangers but ive been here fourteen months now and shes come to realize she can rely on me then maybe youre the one who should try to find lamont i said nastily her rosebud mouth opened in dismay but she said quietly i would if i had your skills i told you i googled you after we met at the hospital your press makes you sound more progressive than maybe you really are its why i went out of my way to help your friend elton without any expectation of getting paid i was sure youd be eager to reciprocate and help someone in miss ellas situation i dont know what her situation is i said maybe you think of her as an old woman worn out by a life of hard work and injustice but to me shes a woman so bitter and withholding i cant trust anything she says even forty years after she last saw him she is still so angry with her son that she practically chokes talking about him what if she killed him all those years ago or what if he hasnt been missing and shes ashamed of and angry at the life hes been leading so shes told everyone hes gone karens jaw dropped with shock vic you cant think not miss ella why shes a deaconess in her church oh please i said the news is full of stories of pastors and priests whove stolen money or molested children im not saying i think miss ella did any of those things not even that i think she killed her son but i am saying shes hiding something shes angry and that she doesnt get a free ride are you going to help her at all we agreed id do some preliminary work and im cutting my fees for her but i am not going to go on if she doesnt keep up her payments pastor karen laughed perhaps relieved that i was going to carry some of the load i think shes scrupulous about money and remember to ask her for names of lamonts friends thats going to be where ill have to start when karen said shed talk to miss ella in the morning i added it would help if i could see miss claudia do you know where shes living shes here at lionsgate manor in our rehabilitation wing although its hard for me to be hopeful she and miss ella shared a bed in that little apartment until miss claudia had her stroke karen shook her head mournfully all those years of working their fingers to the bone both of them and they couldnt afford two bedrooms even at lionsgate manor it doesnt seem fair maybe that was what lay behind miss ellas hostility the rank unfairness of life life is unfair of course it is when it snows the rich ski downhill and the poor shovel their sidewalks my mother used to say but gabriella loved life me musicabove all music when she sang especially mozart she moved to a different world where rich and poor fair and unfair didnt matter only sound what did miss ella have that brought her to such a place what did i have come to think of it a heartstopping thud on my car window brought me back to racine avenue it was mr contreras my downstairs neighbor mitch the giant labgolden jumped up on the car his paws on the mustangs roof and began to bark i got out of the car pushing him out of the way we began to wonder if maybe you had a stroke out here doll you was sitting so long and you got company cute young gal says shes a cousin although shes so young i thought maybe she was a niece or something but then families do stretch out both ways dont they shes on your pops side i guess since she says shes a warshawski i didnt know you had any relatives mitch punctuated the old mans flood of words with hysterical barks he and peppy his mother had both been clinging to me since my return home in my absence a dog service had run them twice a day but they needed the reassurance that i wasnt going to abandon them again mitch ignored my commands to be quiet and to sit by the time id wrestled him out of the street and into position on the sidewalk i was panting peppy whod sat through the whole proceeding with the saintly expression that makes other dogs hate golden retrievers now started threading herself through my legs giving little whimpers of greeting could you start at the beginning i asked my neighbor my hand on mitchs collar like my cousin who is she where is she and so on mr contreras beamed he loves familymy family anyway he seldom sees his married daughter ruthie or his two grandchildren didnt you know your own cousin didnt her ma tell you shes come to work in chicago and shes renting a place in bucktown bucktown was chicagos newest yuppieville about a mile south of us ten years ago it was a quiet workingclass neighborhood mostly polish and mexican when the ominous happened young artists looking for cheap studio space moved in now the artists cant afford the rents and are moving farther west while the natives are long gone to the depressed fringe neighborhoods on the far south side i took my groceries out of the trunk and walked up the sidewalk with my neighbor if this was a warshawski cousin it had to be one of my uncle peters kids hed been a lot younger than my dad and had started his family late in life after he left chicago for kansas city so i didnt know him or my cousins at all id gotten birth announcements over the years one daughter after another petra kimberly and then a blur of stephanie alison jordan something like that as we got to the door a young woman bounced down the steps with all of mitchs enthusiasm she was tall and blond and her lowcut skimpy peasant blouse with vest skirt leggings and highheeled boots proclaimed her a serious millennium gen fashionista but her wide smile was genuine it made her look so much like a vibrant feminine version of my father that i put down my groceries and held out my arms petra i ventured i am i am she hugged me back bending over my fivefooteight frame and squeezing hard sorry to drop in uninvited but i just got settled this afternoon and daddy told me you lived here near me and i didnt have any appointments so i came scurrying up to see you uncle salisnt he sweet he told me to call him thathes been feeding me tea in the garden and telling me all the cases hes worked on with you youre awesome tori tori my family nickname since my cousin boombooms death twelve years ago no one had used it and it was startling to hear it on this strangers lips and now mr contreras was her uncle sal and mitch was slobbering over her we were just one big happy family mr contreras said he knew you gals had a lot of catching up to do so why didnt we go on up to my place and he could make us spaghetti later if we wanted with the dogs racing ahead of us stopping at each landing to see if we were following i led petra to the third floor you should have let me know you were coming to town i said id have been glad to put you up while you got settled it happened so fast i didnt even know i was coming myself until a week ago see i graduated from college in may and then me and my roomie went to africa for four weeks we bought a used land rover we drove all over then we sold the rover in cape town and flew to australia anyway when i got off the plane in kansas city daddy was like do you have a job and im like no of course not and he says how harvey krumass son is running for the senate daddy and harvey grew up together back in the stone age so of course theyre still best buds and if harveys kid needs help then peters kid will pitch in so here i am my poor body still cant figure out what time zone im in she laughed again a loud husky peal harvey krumas huh i didnt know he and your dad were friends do you know him petras cellphone rang she looked at the screen and put it back in her pocket no sweetie i dont swim in those rarefied waters krumas the name in chicago meant everything from pork bellies to pension funds when a new highrise broke ground here or in any of a dozen other great cities around the world you could count on seeing krumas capital management listed among the financial backers i thought maybe since daddy and uncle harvey are such good buds your dad mustve known him too my dad was twenty when your father was born i explained i dont know if peter even remembers the row house in back of the yards by the time he started school grandma warshawski had bought a bungalow in gage park then she moved to norwood up on the northwest side thats where she lived when i was a teenager your dad took indoor plumbing for granted when he was growing up but my father and your uncle berniethey were the two oldestthey had to empty the slop buckets every morning when they were boys between them grandma and grandpa warshawski didnt make fifteen dollars a week during the great depression its not daddys fault his parents had a hard life petra protested oh honey i wasnt trying to imply that just explaining what different worlds our two fathers inhabited even though they were brothers my dad joined the police because it offered a steady paycheck but daddy worked hard petra cried he earned every nickel he ever made down in the yards i know he did our grandmother could never understand why peter went to work in the stockyards when there were so many better jobs around but harvey krumass dad offered peter a job because he and harvey were friends and peter made the most of it if my uncle hadnt become wealthy on a grand scale he had done wellway better than anyone else remotely connected to my family when the stockyards left chicago in the sixties peter had followed ashland meats to kansas city by the time my dad died in ashland was a fivehundredmilliondollar concern and peter was a senior officer id always been a little bitter that he didnt do anything to help out with my dads medical bills when tony was dying but as id just explained to petra tony of course was essentially a stranger to him it seemed unbelievable to look at this twentysomething kid and realize she and i shared a grandmother i didnt know krumass son wanted to run for office what are you doing for him with the primary still ten months away her phone rang again this time she answered with a quick im busy im with my cousin ill call you later she turned back to me sorry my roomie wants to know how i am kelsey my college roommate i mean in my new place here im on my own which feels really weird after sharing a sorority house and a tent and everything with kelsey for four years shes back in raleigh and shes bored to death after going all over africa and australia what were you saying oh what am i doing for the campaign i dont know they dont even know i showed up to work yesterday for the first time and they asked me what i was good at and i said being energetic which i am totally and i majored in communications and spanish so they thought maybe id do something in the pressroom but right now its pretty much just wandering around seeing whos where and running out to the corner to get people fancy coffee drinks they could save a bundle of money by buying a cappuccino machine for the office but i like the excuse to be outdoors what kind of platform is krumas running on i asked i dont know petra widened her eyes in mock embarrassment i think hes greenat least i hope he isand i guess hes against the war in iraq and hes good for illinois sounds like a winner i grinned at her he is he is especially in his tennis shorts women my moms age get weak in the knees when they see him like my folks took him out for dinner when he came to kansas city last year and all the ladies at the country club sashayed over and practically stroked him id seen plenty of photos on television and in the papers brian krumas was as photogenic as johnjohn or barack still a bachelor at fortyone he generated plenty of copy in the gossip rags which way did he swing and who did he swing with were perennial favorite points of speculation the dogs were starting to whine and paw at me they needed exercise i asked my cousin if she wanted to run with us and have dinner after but she said she had a date with a couple of young women from the campaign it was a chance to start making friends in her new home her phone rang again when i went into my bedroom to change in the five minutes it took me to get into my shorts and running shoes she took three more calls oh youth and the cellphoneinseparable in sickness and in health she ran downstairs with the dogs as i locked my apartment when i got to the door she was kissing mr contreras goodbye thanking him for tea it was totally fab meeting him come over on sunday contreras suggested ill barbecue ribs out back or are you one of those vegetarians petra laughed again my dads in the meat business hed disown me and my sisters if any of us stopped eating meat she flew down the walk hers was the shiny nissan pathfinder id squeezed in front of she bumped my rear fender twice clearing the curb when i winced my neighbor said its just paint after all cookie and familys family and shes a wellbehaved kid pretty too dropdead gorgeous dont you mean shell be brushing em off with a flyswatter and ill be there to help he laughed so hard he started to wheeze the dogs and i left him coughing in the middle of the sidewalk something about all that young energy made me lighthearted too fit for your hoof i woke next morning at five i was over my jet lag but since getting back i couldnt seem to sleep normally i made an espresso and went out on the little back porch with peppy whod spent the night with me the sky was bright with the midsummer sunrise ten days ago id been watching the sun rise over the umbrian hills with morrell yet both he and italy felt so remote that they didnt seem to have been part of my life at all the back door on the apartment next to mine opened and my new neighbor emerged the unit had stood empty for several months mr contreras told me a man who played in a band had bought it while i was away and that the medical resident on the ground floor had worried about whether he would keep everyone up all night with loud music he was dressed in the quintessential artists costume faded black tshirt and jeans he went to the railing to look at the little gardens the korean family on the second floor and mr contreras both grew a few vegetables the rest of us didnt have the time or patience for yard work peppy went over to greet him and i got up to haul her away not everyone is as eager to see her as she is to see them its okay he scratched her ears im jake thibaut i dont think you were here when i moved in v i warshawski i was in europe and cant seem to adjust to the time change im not usually up this early im definitely not up this early i just got in from portland on the redeye i asked if his band had been playing out there and he made an odd face its a chamber music group but i guess you could call it a band we were touring the west coast i laughed and told him what id heard from mr contreras poor dr dankin she worries so much about the noise i make that im tempted sometimes to park my bass outside her front door and serenade her of course your dogs and your criminal associates worry her most my most criminal associate is this gals son i said petting peppy close up i could see he was older than id first thought perhaps in his forties i offered him an espresso but he shook his head i have students in five hours i need to try to sleep i let myself into mr contrerass kitchen to collect mitch and ran over to the lake with him and peppy mr contreras was puttering around his kitchen when we got back but i turned down breakfast i wanted to get a head start on lamont gadsden i had a full calendar this afternoon including a job for my most important client the one whose fees would pay for those lario boots and a few other expensive unnecessities a fortyyearold trail is a cold one and miss ella hadnt given me much in the way of bread crumbs to follow in my office i ran through the databases that make the modern detectives life so easy these days lamont gadsden hadnt changed his name at least not since those records were automated as lamont gadsden he didnt own a car in any of the fifty states he wasnt being sued for child support or alimony no department of corrections housed him i turned to other work and was in the middle of a report for another client when karen lennon called she had visited miss ella this morning we talked for a bit and she finally was able to remember the names of some of the people who knew her son it was a meager list but it was better than nothing miss ella had provided the names of lamonts high school physics teacher and a pastor hebert from her church karen lennon had somehow persuaded miss ella to divulge the names of three of her sons adolescent friends interrogation is all about knowing how to ask your question so the subject will answer karen lennon clearly had a touch with miss ella that i lacked what about my talking to miss claudia the pastor hesitated i think it would be a good idea if she starts feeling a little stronger shes been pretty frail the last few weeks and strangers would be hard on her and miss ella holds miss claudias power of attorney so that may be an obstacle as well when wed hung up i did a search on the list of people whod known lamont four of the five men were still alive which wasnt as big a help as the optimistic detective needs one of the friends from lamonts youth had died of pancreatic cancer when he was thirtyseven a second friend had disappeared as thoroughly as lamont himself the physics teacher had retired to mississippi fifteen years ago and pastor hebert at ninetythree apparently wasnt quite the ball of fire hed been in his prime oh pastor hebert such a shame the woman who returned the message i left on his churchs answering machine said the holy spirit inhabited that mans body i asked if he was dead no no hes still with us but not quite with us if you understand he brought me to jesus me and my two boys and my sisters and we need that saintly mans saving voice here now but the lord does as he will in his own time and we must pray to jesus pray for pastor heberts healing and pray for a prophet to lead us out of our wilderness yes maam i said weakly i called the physics teacher who remembered lamont but hadnt seen him since his high school graduation he was a bright boy a good student i wanted him to go on to college but hed turned into such an angry young man you couldnt talk to him about anything in the white mans world anymore i suggested howard or grambling but he still wouldnt listen i didnt even know hed disappeared the teacher promised to call if he heard anything which was as likely as seeing the cubs in the world series that left me with a man named curtis rivers who still lived in west englewood a few blocks from where he and lamont gadsden had grown up like the other people on miss ellas list rivers had done very little that showed up on the web he didnt vote he hadnt been in prison or run for public office i couldnt tell if hed ever been married but he did own fit for your hoof a shoerepair shop on seventieth place just west of ashland it wasnt until midafternoon that i had time to go to riverss shop i spent the bulk of the day cleaning up my job for darraugh graham i was tracing the engineering credentials of a woman darraugh wanted to head his aerospace division and my inquiry took me to northwest ern universitys engineering school when i finished my querieslearning sadly that darraughs candidate looked too good to be true because she was too good to be truemy feeling of unreality intensified i seem to be finding more and more job candidates these days who dont care what lies they tell maybe politicians and television have so blurred the lines between entertainment and truth that people think no one knows or cares about the difference between a clever story and real experience on a summer day with the lake in the background and the trees around the fakegothic buildings a greeny gold the campus itself didnt look quite real i walked down to the water tempted to join the students who were lounging on the beach behind the engineering building and lose myself in the dreamworld my cellphone rang darraughs personal assistant i sighed and returned to reality and told caroline that darraugh would have to start a new search that id give him full details from a landline the call broke my mood i knew it was time to devote myself to miss ella and her son prickly unpleasant woman with her grim fortyyearold past i didnt want to touch her problems but id agreed to work for her and that meant she deserved my best efforts no matter what i thought i could hear my mother standing behind me while i practiced the piano yes i know you resent this victoria but you make it harder for yourself by refusing to put your best work into it engage with the music it needs you even if you dont think you need it i pulled back onto lake shore drive whipping around the curves ignoring the lake i exited downtown and crossed the loop to pick up the southbound dan ryan expressway i hate the ryan not just because of the traffic although there isnt an hour of the night or day when all fourteen lanes arent heavy with trucks and cars i hate the way it was built and everything about how it got built the road is dug deep into the earth all you see as you drive are high concrete walls theyre full of cracks with ragweed and crabgrass poking through if you look up you get a glimpse of scraggly trees and the occasional rundown tire warehouse or apartment building since money for the expressway came from the cronyism in the democratic machine they called it dan ryan after the chairman of the cook county board who anted up the bucks for it in when i left the ryan at seventyfirst street i got an even more depressing look at reality if thats what it was too many of the houses in west englewood leaned drunkenly away from their foundations too many of them had sheets or cardboard filling in for missing windowpanes and most of the doors would give way to a brisk kick vacant lots filled with urban flotsam and overgrown with weeds were almost as common as the houses the only food stores were the kind that prey on the urban poor hiding a little highpriced rotting produce behind the shelves of liquor and chips few people were on the streets i passed a woman clutching an overgrown toddler under one arm a plastic shopping bag under the other a couple of men perched on the curb at the corner of ashland were passing a paper bag from hand to hand a radio on the sidewalk behind them blared loudly enough to shake my mustang while i waited for the light to change when i pulled up across the street from fit for your hoof i sat for a minute trying to dispel the depression id let build in me during the drive a man was sweeping the sidewalk talking loudly to himself when he realized i was watching the store he shook his broom at me yelling something unintelligible before scooting backward crablike into the shop he almost collided with a woman carrying a scuffed pair of white nurses shoes by the heels who was leaving the shop but he circled around her in the nick of time i stopped to look in the window where rivers was displaying goods to help your feet feel pretty neat when they hit that concrete toe pads arch supports gel inserts above them hung a clotheslineful of dog leashes and collars and on the shelves at the back bright headbands sashes handbags and even a little cache of toys the tidy cheery window did its own work for change in a hard world when i opened the door i found myself in a thicket of leather ropes hanging from the ceiling displayed more purses briefcases harnesses berets even work boots and cowboy boots behind the ropes a radio was tuned to talk of the nation and i could hear the whine of a belt sander when i pushed the ropes apart a steam whistle blew and a voice cried welcome to chicago i stopped startled two men in front of a chessboard looked up at me and laughed the counter was behind them a man working on a pair of shoes his back to the room didnt turn around but kept sanding the edges on a new heel i didnt see the man whod flourished his broom at me whistle always makes people jump when they dont know its coming one of the chess players said he was a balding man with a paunch that pressed against an old tshirt with the machinists union logo on it you lost his partner was skinnier and older with skin the color of dusty ebony often im looking for curtis rivers the man behind the counter picked up the second shoe still not looking at me irs or paternity suit the first chess player said the savage tone underlying the jokey comment was directed at me not the man at the belt sander what are you doing down here anyway my father isnt present but hes accounted for i said ditto my children miss ella gadsden is the reason im looking for him the sander fell silent the only noise in the room came from a woman on the radio asking how consumers could ever be sure they were buying clothes made in a factory that respected the workers the chess players didnt seem to know miss ellas name but the man behind the counter finally turned around he placed the shoe he was working on an old brown florsheim in the middle of the counter and leaned over to look at me thats a name i havent heard for a while he said but i dont think ive heard yours at all v i warshawski im a private investigator miss ella hired me to look for lamont gadsden she said curtis rivers was one of his friends another long pause before the man behind the counter said we knew each other a long time back miss ella what is she grief struck after all these years she rented out his bedroom five months after he left didnt seem as though she was expecting to see him again did you know her sister too miss claudia i havent met her shes very ill they tell me but i understand its miss claudia who actually wants to find him you got some kind of identification ms investigator curtis rivers asked i showed him the laminated copy of my license warshawski warshawski now why do i know that name hockey i suggested a lot of people remember my cousin boomboom all three men laughed at that as if the idea of hockey itself was a joke a simple no would do i said nettled boomboom had been more than my cousin wed been best friends growing up proud of our reputation as the wildest kids in south chicago besides even though hes been dead a dozen years now they still talk about boomboom in the same breath as bobby hull in that mausoleum on washington street miss ella couldnt remember many people who might have known her son you mr rivers two other friends one dead the other steve sawyer i cant find i paused but rivers didnt fill in the blank a science teacher pastor hebert from her church i heard he passed one of the chess players said no hes living in pullman with his daughter i said but people at the church are saying hes not too fit mentally so i dont know what he can tell me and what can i tell you curtis rivers asked anything you can remember about lamont gadsden anyone else he hung out with anyplace he talked about going when you last saw him what his mood was all those things if you know where steve sawyer is you could get me out of here so i could ask him those questions and what will you do if i tell you those things talk to more people try to find someone who could give me a lead on where he went when he disappeared do you remember the last time you saw him rivers picked up the shoe again its been a lot of years ms warshawski miss ella says lamont left her house the day before the big snow of sixtyseven she says that she and miss claudia never saw him again but did you the day the hour and the minutetrust miss ella for that my memories arent lined up in formation like that but if anything comes to me ill call you he turned around and flipped the belt sander back on i laid one of my cards on the counter put two more next to the chessboard if its any help im not going to faint or run to the states attorneys office if i hear about some old gang connections i used to represent some anacondas and lions when i was with the public defenders office i raised my voice to carry over the belt sander but none of the men responded i pushed through the display ropes to the front door wincing when the steam whistle blew and the recording announced central station chicago leaving now for new orleans and all stops in between the city of new orleans bad boy lamont i scowled at the dashboard did curtis rivers know something about lamont that he didnt want to tell me or was it just that the gleam had worn off my winning smile even when i was fresh out of law school in the public defenders office i hadnt been able to use my assets as my supervisor put it not too subtly urging me to show cleavage and smirk my way into the good graces of judges and cops still i thought i had been considerate and caring as well as responsible in what i said and all those other girl scout things in talking to rivers he hadnt needed to stiff me quite so hard i hadnt had high hopes when i started this investigation but somehow i didnt expect to hit so many dead ends this fast pastor hebert who lived with his daughter in pullman five miles farther down the ryan from fit for your hoof was the last person on my list given his questionable mental state i didnt expect to learn anything startling but it would wrap up this part of the inquiry i could go to miss ella tomorrow and tell her she either needed to give me more background or end the investigation i turned on the ignition but phoned pastor heberts daughter before taking off i started to explain who i was but she already knew whoever i had spoken to at the saving word gospel church this morning had been on the phone to rose hebert within seconds rose supposed i could come down now although what anyone could tell me after all this time she couldnt imagine you never know i said with determined cheerfulness as i pulled away from the curb the leashes in fit for your hoof s window display twitched someone was watching me but what did that prove rivers knew something about lamont or he didnt trust a white woman on the black south side just as i thought i floored the mustang so abruptly it fishtailed into a pothole that would definitely be the last straw if i broke an axle or blew a tire down here i couldnt go fast very far anyway it was fivethirty the heart of the evening rush the line at the entrance ramp to the ryan took six lights to clear traffic stayed bumper to bumper until i oozed off again at th street as soon as i left the expressway i entered a quiet orderly world that doesnt quite belong to chicago pullmans quiet treelined streets with their federalstyle row houses painted in greens and reds stand in sharp contrast to the brokendown tenements just to the north and east maybe its feeling of separateness from the big city is because pullman started as a company town a monument to railway magnate george pullmans ego the inventor built everythingcompany stores houses for his managers tenements for his workerswho staged a bloody strike over the prices pullman charged in his stores coupled with the fact that his houses cost more than they could ever dream of paying pullman finally had to give up on his town but most of the houses remain theyd been built from bricks made of the durable lake calumet clay which is so highly prized that thieves have dismantled whole garages if the owners are away and carted off the bricks for resale elsewhere in the city as i continued west i saw the hotel florence on my right its turrets and spires had made it seem like a fairytale castle when i was little its been closed for decades now but my parents used to eat there to mark special occasions i stopped looking at the blank windows remembering the family lunch on my tenth birthday right before the city exploded in riots from one end to another my mother tried to enforce a gay party atmosphere but none of her attempts at charm or conversation could override my aunt maries sour racist harangues i hadnt wanted to include marie but gabriella said i couldnt invite boomboom without his parents afterward back in our tiny south chicago living room i shouted at my mother that it served her right that aunt marie had ruined the party my father jumped up from the tv where he was watching the cubs grabbed my arm and hustled me out back victoria every day i have to go out on the streets and face people who think their anger counts more than anyone elses feelings or needs i dont want to see that anger on your face or listen to it in your voice especially not when you talk to your mother my father never scolded me and for him to do so on my birthday i burst into tears i created a scene but he stood by his arms crossed on his chest no special treatment for me i had to calm myself down apologize to my mother the memory still burned in me my dads injustice to me on my birthday the force of the fortyyearold emotion embarrassed me staring blindly at the hotel it dawned on me for the first time that his anger hadnt been solely about me but his fears about what lay ahead catholic parishioners defying the cardinals pleas for charity and peace taking to the streets with every kind of homemade missileaunt maries own priest father gribac essentially inciting his parish to riotmy dad probably was frightened about gabriellas and my safety that tenth birthday was the last time tony was home in the middle of the day for two months a horn sounded loudly behind me i moved forward threading my way through a patchwork of short deadend streets to langley where rose hebert lived knots of commuters were walking home from the train station most attached to their cellphones one man was mowing his tiny lawn while across the street a woman was washing her front windows where the street ended at th a clutch of girls was jumping double dutch beyond them boys were playing baseball in a rubblefilled vacant lot the girls slid their eyes my waystrange white woman on the blockbut didnt interrupt the rhythm of their ropes the heberts lived in one of the original pullman homes flat front to the street red brick with black arches over the windows that looked like surprised eyebrows rose hebert answered the door almost as soon as i rang the bell she was a tired woman about ten years my senior her closecut hair full of gray her muscular shoulders slumped inside a thin lavenderprint dress i told father you were coming but im not sure he understood me she said by way of greeting its so hard to believe sister ella finally decided to look for lamont that i called over to lionsgate manor to ask her if it was true people try so many scams against the elderly these days you have to be careful all the time it didnt seem like a belligerent comment just the notion at the front of her mind i am a licensed investigator i pulled out my identification but ms hebert didnt look at it miss ella got my name from the pastor at lionsgate karen lennon maybe youve met her miss ella told me she was hiring me for her sisters sake more than her own poor sister claudia rose hebert murmured its hard to see her like she is now she was so lively and graceful as a young woman daddy was always having to remind her about modest christian deportment but my friends and i we secretly copied how she dressed and how she walked miss ella didnt want me visiting her sister but it sounds as though youve seen miss claudia since her stroke yes oh yes i drive the van on sundays and collect our people who cant walk to church anymore so i bring sister ella and some of the other folks from lionsgate and i try to visit with sister claudia but shes so weak i cant tell if she even knows who i am some days so strangers are hard on her ms hebert was blocking the doorway to the house loud voices drifted down the dark hall i tried to peer behind her and your father is he strong enough that i can talk to him oh yes of course thats why youre here but my father he isnt easy you mustnt mind hes not always she kept murmuring flustered comments as she backed away from the door and let me into the house a table at the entrance was piled with papers as i walked past i saw church bulletins mixed with bills and magazinessort of like my own entryway except for the bulletins we followed the loud voices to the living room they came from a television where a minister was exhorting us to send him money for letting us know how very sinful we are the light from the screen flickered on the bald head of a man in a wheelchair he didnt turn his head when we came in nor move when his daughter took the controls from his fingers and pressed the mute button daddy this lady here is the one i told you about the one sister ella and sister claudia sent they want her to find lamont i knelt next to the chair and put my hand next to his on the armrest im v i warshawski pastor hebert im trying to find people who knew lamont people who might know what happened to him a thread of saliva dribbled from the side of his mouth lamont trouble he means lamont was a troubled young man rose said softly made the pastor mouthed the word with difficulty daddy he didnt make trouble rose cried he had good reason to be angry when you think of the terrible injustices we suffer pastor hebert tried to speak but only produced a kind of gargling finally he choked out the word snake snake i repeated doubtfully wondering if he meant lamont was a snake in the grass he didnt belong to the anacondas daddy he helped them protect dr king father and daughter had clearly had this argument many times his face didnt move but her lips were trembling as if she were six not sixty and finding it hard to stand up to an unyielding parent i sat back on my heels lamont gadsden with the anacondasno wonder miss ella hadnt approved of her sons friends in their day theyd been as notorious as the el rukns weapons murder drugs prostitution whatever crime was happening in a broad swatch of the south side they could claim credit for it in my three years with the public defenders office maybe thirty percent of my clients had run with the anacondas id even drawn their chief once when johnny merton couldnt come up with cash one weekend for his own highpriced mouth merton had been furious that he had to rely on an inexperienced pd hed tried to intimidate me into crumpling in his presence you the new snake charmer girl you dont have the talent to charm johnny merton hed grown coarser in his insults when i refused to flinch i was green but id grown up in the steel mills i might not be willing to sidetrack a judge with my cleavage but i knew about insults and in timidation id kept my legal pad in front of me writing down everything merton said and when he paused for breath id say let me read your comments back to you mr merton and you tell me if this is what you want me to present to judge mcmanus if lamont gadsden had been an anaconda anything could have happened to him they didnt like members walking away from the gang leaving meant you left an ear behind as a token no one will hear you on the street now when you call for help i looked up at heberts unblinking eyes what i really am hoping pastor is that you can give me some names people who knew lamont anyone he might have been in touch with after he walked out of miss ellas house in or if you know anyone ms hebert ive been to see curtis rivers and he didnt have anything to say again came the gargling sound and then the words choked out with difficulty dead bury dead do you know hes dead or are you just hoping no one will stir an old pot i asked he didnt say anything when did you yourself last see lamont gadsden pastor he gasped taking in air still without moving his head he said stopped church said hell bound no heed baptized no listening yes you baptized him we took him into christs body together all of us so how could you say he was hell bound and why should he talk to you when that was all you would say to him drugs never listen me daughter but drugs saw know you woman no pants with an effort he moved his hand to the television control and turned the sound back on the preacher in the glass box was revealing the true meaning of pauls letter to the romans no pants i asked rose pushing myself to my feet my thighs were sore from squatting he doesnt approveour church doesnt approveof women wearing mens clothes she said listlessly in bible pictures men are always wearing robes i wondered if that meant women at saving word couldnt wear bathrobes but i decided it wouldnt help my inquiry if i asked instead i followed rose back along the narrow hall to the front door i stopped next to the papercovered table do you think your father knows something about lamont that hed have told me if id worn a dress she looked down the hall as if the old man could hear us over the televised preacher hes convinced lamont sold drugs for the anacondas but i never thought so you said lamont was angry over the injustices in your lives what did he do about them or how did he show he was angry he was part of the group that helped look after dr king you know during the marches that summer she eyed me doubtfully wondering if i came from one of the white south side families who created the need for a protective force i squinted trying to remember what i knew about the history of the summer didnt the gangs declare a truce a moratorium against fighting among themselves she was still eyeing me warily but she nodded johnny merton from the anacondas and fred hampton from the panthers and them they all met with dr king and al raby to discuss strategy my father he felt our church didnt belong in the streets he didnt like it when lamont and some of his friends took part curtis rivers i said his name involuntarily thinking about his hostility when i was in his shop this afternoon curtis was there some of the other boys from the neighborhood and lamont they all belonged to saving word and my father denounced them from the pulpit because they wouldnt listen to his authority but it was six months later that lamont disappeared its hard to think that was connected with the marches something in her face made me add when did you last see him yourself she looked down the hall again a choir on tv was singing with great gusto daddy forbade it once he denounced lamont he said if i went out with him id be endangering my own soul but you saw him anyway her mouth twisted in a painful smile i didnt have the nerve lamont he stopped me when i was leaving school i was over at kennedykingwe still called it woodrow wilson thenstudying nursing and lamont he waited for me after school he talked to me about the panthers and black pride i made the mistake of thinking i could explain it to daddy she looked down at her hands maybe my life would have been differentcould have been different i got my nursing degree and i could only get lpn jobs it was years before i could get hired as a registered nurse i used to think about that when i saw white women hired over me and me with just as much schooling and good job reviews and everything and still emptying bedpans i used to think about lamont i mean and wish id paid him more mind but a bell rang clear even above the sound of the televised choir thats daddy he needs me i have to go are you still working as a nurse oh yes i used to be an oncology nurse but i had to give that up when daddy turned so poorly now i do the night shift in the er i put him to bed before i go on duty get him up in the morning before i go to bed and if youd listened to lamont what would you have done different or what would he have done different would he have stayed around to be close to you in the dimly lit hall i thought i saw her cheeks darken with embarrassment but maybe that was my imagination the bell sounded again a longer ringing and she pushed me through the open door i pulled a card from my bag and thrust it into the hand that was holding the door youre an adult rose hebert you couldnt talk to lamont forty years ago but that doesnt mean you cant talk to me now her lips moved soundlessly she looked from me to the living room habit ruled shoulders stooped she turned back down the hall to her father a very latenight call that night over dinner at lottys i described my frustrating day after listening to my description of pastor hebert lotty said it sounded as though he had parkinsons disease the fixed staring trouble talking those you often see in an advanced stage of the illness he must be ninety wouldnt you guess we dont know enough about how to manage the disease and these symptoms are hard to control especially in a man whos that old presumably he has other problems or his daughter wouldnt be afraid of him i said shes sixtyish hes dependent on her but she lets him run her around as if she were a robot yes brainwashing also leaves symptoms that are hard to manage lotty gave a wry smile i saw karen lennon at a staff meeting this afternoon shes worried that she might have made a mistake in introducing you to her patienther client i suppose i should say its a little late for karen to be secondguessing herself not when ive spent a day stirring the pot and getting the phone tree shaking among all the women at pastor heberts church lotty laughed i think thats what has her worried karens very young she doesnt know how much excitement a detective can bring to a closed community she should call me not try to get you to do it for her but ill talk to her in the morning i grumbled dont take her head off as well as mine lotty said if you worked with other people all day long instead of in a hole by yourself youd understand how natural it was for her to talk to me during a meeting after spending a day with people who twitch when they see me coming id be happier in a hole by myself as long as it had a cappuccino machine yes well decorate it and make it gemütlich a cozy hole ill send a courier in every day with a fresh bottle of milk and a basket of fruit and cheese she squeezed my hand youre still in mourning for morrell arent you not mourning exactly i fiddled with the heavy silver more questioning myself to be my age and not able to keep a stable relationship going in the back of my mind i always imagined a child a family at this point in my life lotty raised her brows im not criticizing you victoriagod knows i have no rightbut you havent lived like someone who wanted a child no ive lived like the pepperpot my father always called me throwing dust up the nose of any man who came close to me is that what you mean no my dear so youre irascible well so am i so are many people but you put the community ahead of yourself its a different form of the female disease the one you just lamented in rose hebert your clients need you the women at the shelter need you even i need you men can put the community first and come home to domestic life but women were still like nuns in a way if we have a strong vocation its hard to meet our private needs her words made me feel unbearably lonely so im a noncelibate nun i tried to turn it into a joke but my voice cracked youve worked things out without max though she smiled sadly after many years as lonely as yours my dear the curved windows reflected the candles on her diningroom table i watched the multiple flames the glass created some of the tension of the day eased out of my shoulders we moved the conversation to lighter topics our planned picnic to ravinia to hear denyce graves sing lottys new perinatology fellow who had cried out that she loved jane austen she was the one who went to africa to study the monkeys right around nine lotty sent me home since she had an early call she doesnt do much surgery anymore but she still goes early to the hospital to monitor her fellows work i checked my messages on my way home karen lennon had called to say shed stopped at the va and given elton grainger the name and address of an sro which had rooms for homeless vets she was a conscientious young pastor no doubt about it when i got home mr contreras erupted from his apartment there you are doll i couldnt remember your cellphone number and you never gave it to your cousin so we been sitting here hoping youd get home before midnight vic petra bounced out behind him mitch wrapping himself around her legs i feel like such an idiot but i lost my keys and didnt know what to do so i thought maybe you could put me up for the night but uncle sal said you could probably get into the building that you knew how to open anything that isnt electronic so here i am her cellphone rang in the middle of her hearty peal of laughter she looked at the screen then answered it with a breathless account of her life to date or at least her lost keys her visit to uncle sal and me and where she planned to meet everybody once she got back into her own home you ever hear of a locksmith either of you i bent to stroke peppy who was whining for attention yes but they wanted like hundreds of dollars to come after hours and i dont have hundreds of dollars they hardly pay me anything at the campaign you know her phone rang again and she repeated her story i thought your dad had the odd dollar lying around i objected when shed hung up not that you arent welcome to sleep on my couch tonight if daddy finds out ive been this stupid hell never stop lecturing me on how im too immature to be alone in the big bad city didnt peter get you the job on brian krumass campaign oh he did he did but he expected me to live like in a convent or at least share an apartment he pulled a vesuvius when he found out id rented my own place she answered another call at that point i decided it would be easier to get her back into her own home than listen to her phone all night long mr contreras mitch and peppy announced theyd all like to see where petra lived too i bundled the dogs into the mustang the old man was delighted to accept petras invitation to ride with her in her pathfinder petras place was in a loft building at the tony end of bucktown about ten blocks from my office parking was at a premium and i had to cover part of a yellow hydrant line and hope for the best petra held a flashlight on her front door for me as i knelt on the sidewalk wiggling my picklocks inside the lock she answered another phone call my cousin is like this detective and shes breaking into my building she shouted to anyone on wolcott street who might be listening no really shes like ncis or saving grace or something she solves murders she has a gun everything i took the phone from her and stuffed it into my back pocket petra darling not while im out here doing something highly illegal any cop whos cruising around can listen in on your frequency and anyway youre talking loudly enough for everyone on the block to hear you she pouted an exaggerated selfspoof of a crybaby but she held the flashlight steady until the tumblers clicked back we climbed three flights to her place where i repeated the maneuver in my hip pocket her phone rang two more times before i got her front door opened her keys were on the floor just inside she gave another husky laugh look at that i dropped them on my way out i was so late i guess i grabbed them with my coffee and my phone and didnt see they werent in my hand when i left oh vic you are a genius thank you thank you thank you what can i do for you would you like a free invite to our fundraiser out on navy pier its twentyfive hundred a head brians going to be there wouldnt you love to meet him the president may stop in although weve been told not to count on it weve rented the whole east end of the pier itll be so cool and uncle sal you should come too ive been to too many fundraisers for my heart to skip a beat at the prospect but the invitation thrilled mr contreras an inside seat at a highend event it would raise his prestige at his weekly trips to the lodge where his old union buddies meet to shoot pool along with the breeze do i need a tuxedo or something the old man worried as we turned to leave wear your overalls and your union badge krumas probably wants to look like hes the peoples candidate i advised vic dont be so cynical petra scolded although do you have a union badge uncle sal no but i got me a bronze star you know from getting nicked at anzio her eyes shone oh wear your medals thatll be so fab ill come over and trim your hair kelsey and me we got pretty good with the shears primping each other in africa as we drove home mr contreras chuckled to himself shes quite a gal your cousin she could charm the socks off a rock you could learn a thing or two from her you know like how to charm socks off a rock my memory from this afternoon my old supervisor telling me to flash my assets came to mind you think im too surly wouldnt hurt you to smile more at people you know what they say doll you catch more flies with honey assuming you want a whole bunch of flies filling up the place i waited while he opened the front door then took the dogs for a final skip around the block would petra have charmed curtis riverss socks off gotten him to tell her all he knew about lamont gadsden i tried to imagine myself skipping into fit for your hoof a jolly laugh bubbling out of my throat it was easier to imagine myself tapdancing backward in high heels i poured a glass of whisky and watched a few innings of the cubs san francisco game pitching the perennial cubs weakness reared its ugly head again i went to bed with the good guys down by three runs in the fifth i was in the middle of a terrifying dream petra laughing heartily as a swarm of flies crawled down my cleavage when the phone rescued me i sat up heart pounding from the horrific image and grabbed the phone is this the detective it was a woman her voice soft and deep but in my groggy state i couldnt place it i looked at the clock it was three in the morning im sorry if i woke you but ive been thinking and thinking about lamont if i let it go another day maybe i wont have the nerve to pick up the phone a second time rose hebert i said her name aloud as i realized who she was yes what about lamont a pause a sucking in of breath preparing for the high dive i saw him that night which night i leaned back against the headboard knees drawn up to my chin trying to wake up when he left home january twentyfifth you mean lamont came to you after he left his mothers house he didnt come to me she was speaking hurriedly behind her i could hear the sounds of the hospital the incessant pages an ambulance siren i was i was out after church wednesday night you know midweek church daddy was meeting with the deacons after the service so i left alone i went for a walk it was so warm you remember the record heat for january before the big snow began everyone who lived through it still marvels at it i went looking for lamont i was so confused i wanted to see him and i was pretending it was church business pretending in my head the way you do that i wanted him to come to the youth group and tell us what it was like to work near dr king although daddy didnt approve of churches getting involved in social action she drew a shuddering breath half a sob then whispered i just needed to see him try to get him to touch me again the way he had that summer but like i said i was pretending i had some bigger purer reason once shed let her shameful memory out her breathing came more easily and her voice returned to a deeper pitch i found him or anyway i saw him at the corner of sixtythird and morgan he was with johnny merton going into the waltz right innyou know the old blues joint there its been gone twenty years now but back then it was the center of entertainment in my part of town not for me not for pastor heberts girl but for all the kids i went to high school with so what were johnny and lamont doing i asked when she broke off oh i couldnt follow them daddy would have heard faster than you can spit i just sat across the street watching the door watching kids id known my whole life passing in and out wednesday was church night but it was also jam night alberta hunter came sometimes tampa red all the big names along with guys starting out you dont know how much i wanted to be there instead of at church the phone vibrated from the passion in her voice did you see them come out again johnny merton and lamont daddy found me before lamont came out i was sitting across the street in my coat even though it was still warm i couldnt go outdoors in january without my winter coat not in my family i remember thinking how stupid it was sixty degrees and me in that heavy wool thing and then daddy came along he hit me told me what a common girl i was what a sinner what a bringer of shame to jesus and to him lingering outside a bar like a street girl the words tumbled out like water from a fire hydrant spraying me with their force the next day was the snow i went on down to school in the morning even though my face was all purple and swollen from where daddy hit me and i was so thankful for the blizzard i had to spend two nights there at the college sleeping on the floor with all the other girls it was the only time in my life where i got to be just one of the girls white girls black girls we all just lay there in the dark talking about our families and our boyfriends and i even acted like lamont was my boy well anyway when the snow ended and i got back home lamont was gone no one ever saw him again not that i knew and i couldnt go to johnny merton someone would have told daddy and i couldnt take another another beating i filled in silently when she clipped off the sentence did you ask any of lamonts friends about him anyone who might have known why he was talking to merton i did but not till later at first when i didnt see him around i thought lamont was avoiding me i thought god was punishing me i was so confused in my head i couldnt decide if god was punishing me for not going off with lamont when he asked me that past september or if he was punishing me for letting lamont touch me she gave an embarrassed snort of laughter i finally asked curtis rivers but that wasnt until maybe a month or six weeks went by and he was just as puzzled as me was curtis rivers with the anacondas too i asked i never did know for sure who was who wasnt i was the preachers kid i was the stuckup girl they didnt talk to me the way they did the other girls in the neighborhood i dont think curtis washe shipped out to vietnam anyway round about may of sixtysevenhe was just the boy everyone trusted gang straight whatever curtis he didnt play sides should have been him i broke my heart over not a nogood street boy like lamont she laughed again less bitterly this time so is miss ella right was lamont dealing drugs not the way she meant i mean she makes it sound like the south side was floating on lamont gadsdens heroin sales but shes like my daddy you move a quarter inch off the straight and narrow youre satans child for sure and after lamont disappeared sister ella she carried on as if nothing had happened just held herself straighter if any back not made out of cast iron could be held so straight but sister claudia lamonts going just about broke her heart miss ella says she and miss claudia went to the police did you ever hear anything about that oh they went but the cops they were so ugly it was like they did this work they hated looking after dr king that summer i meanand then couldnt wait to take it out on any black person who crossed their path i went with sister ella and claudia to the station house and the way those cops acted youd think those two women had shot the president pigs my yes they were pigs i felt the jolt that the insult always gave me you think theres any hope any chance you might find him she spoke in a soft shy voice as if afraid i might mock her deepest feelings i wanted to tell her something heartening hope filled something that would put life back in her voice i wanted to spread some honey out for her but i could only tell the truth the fact that i thought lamont gadsden was either dead or so deeply hidden that no one would ever find him unless he chose to come forward himself ill talk to johnny merton i found myself promising its been forty years but maybe johnny remembers what they talked about dont use my name she begged if daddy hears about it or the ladies at church you dont have to go home to him you know i said quietly even now its not too late for you to start your own life i have the phone number for oh once your spirit gets broke it doesnt matter where you lay your head at night her voice had grown low again with weariness but if you learn anything call me here at the hospital my shift runs eleven to seven thursday through monday uncovering history after she hung up i tried to go back to sleep but the conversation had been too unsettling i lay on the bed my body so rigid i couldnt even keep my eyes closed i walked out to the living room and sat crosslegged in my armchair peppy who was spending the night in my apartment got up from her post by the front door to join me rose hebert and petra both adult women referred to their fathers as daddy when daddys in your head hes the biggest thing there he doesnt have a first name or a smaller identity like my dad you think everyone knows who daddy is did that mean my uncle was himself a bullying presence in petras life or just that she was still very young rose hebert certainly wasnt young maybe she never had been i could see her nineteen years old sitting in the shadows outside the waltz right inn wanting to be part of the group having fun longing for love and spending the rest of her life with daddy who beat her purple when he thought she was sinning she never mentioned her mother when had pastor heberts wife stopped being part of the equation the bigger question at least for the job id agreed to do dealt with johnny the hammer lamont gadsden last seen entering a blues bar in johnnys company the night of january had he crossed johnny on some drug deal a fight a deathkilled by johnny or some handpicked anaconda deputyand then the blizzard a wonderful cover for any traces of where lamont had been shot or stabbed curtis rivers was at that bar too i told peppy why did he stiff me today she thumped her tail softly i sifted her silky ears with my fingers you never knew johnny merton which makes you a lucky girl hed have cut off your beautiful tail for earmuffs as soon as look at you but could he scare curtis rivers so badly that the man wont talk to me forty years later i could imagine the waltz right inn that january night openmike night local blues greats stopping by hilarity running high because of the boon of summer in january everyone happy but the preachers daughter sweating in her heavy wool coat and lamont gadsden whod left his mothers dinner table to talk to the hammer over the sound of alberta hunter at the piano rivers overhears lamont and merton the phone call later that night or week the hammer to rivers if you say word one about what you know youll follow lamont into the river or quarry or wherever lamont gadsdens body has landed i could imagine it but that didnt mean it happened and anyway what hold could merton have on curtis rivers that would keep rivers silent after all this time besides rivers didnt strike me as a guy who would faint just because the bogeyman was rattling a chain i made a face pastor hebert hammer merton the enforcers of west englewood both of them beat their followers for infractions against a code only they were entitled to define come to think of it id never checked to see if there were unidentified dead bodies lying around after the big snow it was close to five now and the library at my old school wouldnt open for another three hours i went back to bed peppy followed me and curled her soft gold body against my side she fell instantly into the sweet dreams of the virtuous but at six i was still lying there eyelids scratchy from missing sleep churning over my past encounters with johnny merton he had scared me when i was with the public defenders even though i was supposed to be on his side it was because of him id gotten an unlisted phone number you dont do your best for me on this rap bitch ill make sure your mama wont recognize your face when they pull you out of the water is that why you dont have any lasalle street lawyers left mr merton are they all in the chicago river wearing cement booties id been amazed at the time that i could utter those words without my voice quavering but id had to clutch my legal pad to control the trembling in my hands even now the memory of the hammers venom could keep me from sleeping maybe he could have intimidated rivers at that i sat up if i wasnt going to sleep i might as well get going i let peppy out the back door and stood on the small porch stretching my hamstrings and shoulders while my stovetop espresso maker heated up the midsummer sky was already a deep blue i drank a coffee collected mitch from mr contrerass kitchenhed been whining behind the door indignant at being locked inside while peppy got to playand ran the dogs to the lake the water was still so cold i gasped when i jumped in but i swam with them to the first buoy maybe if i got my blood flowing fast enough id feel as though id spent eight hours asleep it didnt exactly work i was still grittyeyed and grumpy as i drove south but i reached the university of chicago library just as the doors opened id picked up a cappuccino and a croissant at one of the little neighborhood coffee bars and against all library etiquette smuggled them into the microform room i pulled reels for all the major chicago newspapers in there had been eight dailies morning and evening editions of four different papers i started with the daily news my dads paper he liked royko january the day before the big snow its strange how little you remember of events you lived through yourself scrolling through the pages i wasnt surprised that i didnt know the national news lbjs war budget the student protests at berkeley which california governor reagan denounced as a communist plot against america or even newly elected senator charles percys wifes miniskirt id been in fifth grade and that stuff sailed completely past me it was the local news that surprised me id completely forgotten the tornadoes that swept the south side the day before the big snow the big storms rose hebert had mentioned the winds had blown over a halfconstructed building at eightyseventh and stony three miles from my childhood home a cop had been killed at the scene i stared at photos of the rubble cinder blocks filled the streets looking like legos thrown on the livingroom floor by a badtempered child a vw bug was buried up to its windows in the debris and then the next day twentysix inches of snow fell covering the debris the mills the roads all of chicago burying the living as well as the dead my memory of the storm wasnt the tornadoes nor even the dead copalthough every cops death was an occasion of anxiety for my mother and mebut gabriella waiting outside for me when school ended my mother never walked me home from school and i was scared when i saw her scared that something had happened to my dad that she was worried about the snow seemed funny to me a blizzard blowing five and even tenfoot drifts was exhilarating a game not cause for alarm but after a year of riots and protests where she had sat up night after night waiting for tony to come home me sometimes watching from the top of the attic stairs sometimes joining her at the kitchen table whenever she did something out of the ordinary i thought first of my father tu e bernardo spericolati e testardi tutti e dui voi she said to me in italian seizing my mittened hand both of you reckless and headstrong if i dont stop you you will get lost in this blizzard you will do something impossibly dangerous that will cost you your life and forever break my heart im not a baby dont treat me like one in front of my friends i shouted at her in english yanking my hand away it upset her when i didnt answer in italian in my anger i wanted to hurt her feelings the truth was id been planning on finding boomboombernardowho went to catholic school we wanted to see if the calumet river had frozen enough for skating being caught out made me sullen even more so when gabriella made me play the piano for an hour when we got home sitting in the library this morning i looked at my fingers and regret twisted my intestines the way it uselessly does i could be a decent pianist todaynever gifted but competentif i had acceded to my mothers wishes that i study music more seriously why had i fought so against practicing my mother adored me and i had loved her fiercely back why would i not do this thing that was so important to her could it be that id been jealous of music who could possibly compete with mozart my rival for her affections mi tradì quellalma ingrata donna elviras aria about jealousy and betrayal in don giovanni had been one of gabriellas favorites so lost was i in my memories that i sang the first line out loud and then blushed as everyone in the reading room turned to stare at me i sank down in my chair and stared fixedly at the screen in front of me i looked at reports of homicides starting on january and moving forward to the end of februarythey got more play forty years ago when the numbers were smallerbut i didnt see any unidentified bodies i looked for car accidents and studied gang activity the daily news had interviewed members of the blackstone rangers who felt they were the legitimate voice of the black south side they were going to do all this good for the community they told the paper day care schools health care i made a face in the dark reading room the gang had started some of their grand projects but in the end all they did was sell drugs and run protection and prostitution rackets i turned to the heraldstar and read the same homicide reports there saw the same pictures of the city up to its rail girders in snow a week after the news talked to the rangers the heraldstar played catchup running a feature on the avalon anacondas i sat up straighter my fatigue forgotten as i began reading about johnny the hammer in the heraldstar he described some of the work the anacondas had performed during the riotfilled summer of sixtysix i looked at the clock reading about johnny merton couldnt be charged to miss ellas account i read all five articles in the stars series a day inside the projects at sixtieth and racine a day at a clinic that merton said the anacondas had started pictures of the hammer feeding his own eightmonthold daughter the police are labeling the anacondas as a criminal gang and for what for starting a school milk program for black children for opening a health clinic at fiftyninth and morgan when theres been nothing in our neighborhood for fifty years for organizing our people to vote and getting us a real candidate for alderman in the sixteenth ward this was a side of merton id never known about by the time id been facing him in that dreary bull pen at twentysixth and california hed moved a long way from community organizer the only organizing he did by then was where and how to separate small businesses from their money or his opponents from their body parts on the other hand in he was already head of a powerful street gang maybe hed just been spinning the reporter a line a lot of white progressives had found street gangs glamorous or hip in the sixties a lot of white reporters wanted the swagger that being on the inside with a black gangbanger would bring the man sees us as the threat to law and order on the streets of this city but we werent the ones throwing bricks at martin luther king were we so how come its the brothers who are behind bars not the white boys who turned cars over and such you put steve sawyer up for murdering harmony newsome on no evidence whatever no witness no nothing the sister went down in marquette park protecting dr king and then they want to know why we arent grinning and tapdancing for them what if it was a white boy killed her in the middle of those riots they were the ones with the weapons but they are not the ones in jail the star inserted a picture of harmony newsome in her high school prom dress her hair carefully straightened so that it hung to her bare shoulders in a slight bob it wasnt the photograph that startled me into sloshing my contraband cappuccino all over my jeans it was the caption trial begins today for steve sawyer arrested in the murder of harmony newsome the sidebar explained that sawyers trial was the culmination of months of protest by friends and family of the dead woman they had held a prayer vigil outside the area police station since her murder the previous august sawyer had been arrested at new years which meant the trial was being rushed through like a bullet train i sat back in my chair trying to figure it all out steve sawyer that must be or at least might be lamont gadsdens missing boyhood friend i read through all the papers and finally found a small paragraph in the heraldstar on january th steve sawyer was convicted of harmony newsomes murder no other details were given nothing about weapon or motive and certainly no mention of lamont gadsden i did a cursory search for john does thered been a good few deaths because of the snowstorm but even though i skimmed all the papers through the end of april i didnt find any reports of unaccounted bodies as i put the boxes back on their shelves i kept wondering about miss ella she must have known steve sawyer had been convicted of murder when she told karen to give me his name yesterday why hadnt she included that information what was going on with her and her hostility to this search that she herself had initiated but i had looked for steve sawyer along with lamont in department of corrections databases around the country and hadnt found either name did that mean that lamont too was actually doing time somewhere i hurried past students whose faces were puffy from lack of sleep pinched with anxiety over exams or jobs or love in the sunken garden behind the library i could see a grayhaired woman throwing a ball for her dog they seemed to be the only happy creatures on the campus when i was a student the war in vietnam was just winding down students with pinched faces were often worrying about the draft but it didnt seem like todays kids cared much about their own war eight thousand miles away the thought gave me another idea about lamont gadsden maybe hed forgotten to tell his mother hed been drafted his bones might be rotting in a jungle in southeast asia i detoured to lionsgate manor before going to my office miss ella opened the door the length of the chain bolt but didnt invite me in i asked her about steve sawyer you knew hed been sent to prison when you gave his name to pastor karen didnt you dont take that tone with me young woman you wanted the names of lamonts friends and i told you i didnt approve of them now you see why it was an effort not to scream at the client what about lamont is he in prison too if i knew where he was i wouldnt have asked you to look for him we went back and forth for a few more fruitless minutes she didnt know where steve sawyer was now or she wouldnt admit to knowing i couldnt tell i finally left cursing her and pastor karenand myself for agreeing to get involved in their quagmire still just to cross every t i called the pentagon when i got to my office to see if they had any record of lamont i wasnt expecting any information so i was surprised when the woman on the other end said lamont had been called up and told to report to his local draft board in april he was still officially absent without leave you didnt try to find him did you i asked oh honey i wasnt even born then the pentagons publicaffairs woman said but i expect from what ive read that they guessed he was one of ten thousand boys hiding out either in canada or somewhere deep inside his own neighborhood unless they crossed the legal system somewhere applying for a drivers license or a loan or if someone turned them in we never saw them which left me back where id started with zero information actually that wasnt true i had johnny the hammer to add to the mix and i knew what had happened to steve sawyerat least until january in the detectives absence ii the detective lady was here again today ella held her sisters left hand pressing it to make sure claudia was listening to her white girl i think i told you that the gnarled fingers pressed against ellas own hard palm yes im listening to you yes you told me shes white shes pretty much used up all the money i agreed to finding out nothing the left side of claudias mouth trembled and tears slid down her face since the stroke she cried easily claudia had always been emotional such a warm person was everyones favorite description making ella feel colder more bitter against the world at large claudia had never been a crier though shed learned early in life like ella had herself that tears were a luxury for babies and the rich her heart might break over a dead sparrow in the road but she wouldnt cry her eyes out now though you had to watch what you said and sometimes ella felt herself slipping back in time back to when she was five and claudia was the darling baby of the block those soft brown curls that winning smile so cooed over in church that ella would steal claudias dolly or slap her when mama was off at work and granny georgette wasnt looking pure meanness she knew it then and she knew it now but sometimes you got tired of always being the responsible one everything all right here one of the nurses aides had bustled over the sisters were out on the sunporch a kind of enclosed roof garden that held plants and a tiny fountain the dog that some wellmeaning dogooder brought during the week was drinking from the fountain to the delight of several of the other stroke patients but ella wouldnt let them bring it around claudia when she was there she couldnt abide dogs cats either why feed and spoil some animal when children were going to bed hungry she looked coldly at the aide if i need help ill let you know the aide black herself stared pertly back at ella your sister needs her eyes wiped thats something you could learn to do for her miss ella if you dont want me here but since i am here im happy to oblige she knelt next to the wheelchair dabbing at claudias face with a tissue whats troubling you honey you need something i can bring you just like everybody else on the planet soon as she talked to claudia she was crooning and singing jesus did try his saints that was certain when the aide finally left claudia worked hard forced herself to speak clearly who tective talk to i told you the names i gave her she went through them ill say this for her shes thorough shes a hard worker she found mr carmichaelyou know lamonts science teacher at lindblomand he says he never heard from lamont after the boy graduated she talked to curtis rivers who says he cant remember when he saw lamont for the last time she cant find steve sawyer she knows he got arrested for killing harmony newsome but she says theres no word of what became of him she says shes been through all those prison records but cant find any trace ellas mouth worked she hadnt liked the way the detective looked at her as if she felt sorry for ella no right no right to hand me pity white girl you think maybe steve sawyer was the only black boy who went through those prison gates and disappeared not teve member ella not teve new name wha name what do you mean not steve of course it was steve sawyer who got arrested i remember how his mother carried on at the trial even if you dont claudias good eye drooped she was tired too tired to argue too tired to be sure her memory wasnt playing tricks on her the way it did since shed had the stroke she took another breath hite girl talk pator oh yes this detective went to see pastor hebert of course he isnt talking any more than you these days ella paused she says rose saw lamont the left side of claudias face came alive a shadow of her old smile broke through hen ere that same night he left us after church rose was walking home and saw him go into a bar with johnny merton ella folded her arms in grim satisfaction i always told you he was hanging out with those anacondas no claudia cried not drug dealr mont not she was breathing hard from the effort of making the words come out right and from anger at her sister wron wron wron the young aide hurried back over pastor karen in her wake ella hadnt seen the chaplain arrive on the terrace whats wrong miss ella pastor karen asked while the aide began fussing with claudia i talked to your detective this morning and im trying to explain to my sister what she reported its not easy i told claudia before you ever brought in this detective it wouldnt be easy did ms warshawski find lamont the pastor pulled a chair up so that she was sitting between the two sisters she found someone who saw him go into a blues bar with the head of a street gang the night he disappeared my sister has never wanted to believe lamont could have been dealing drugs not drugs claudia anxiously following the dialogue shouted the phrase oh cant talk cant splain condas gang yes bad no not bad not mont she began crying again tears of rage and frustration at her inability to speak the roar of the hoof i had hoped that when i left the public defenders office i had also left johnny merton behind i just didnt know who else to talk to about lamont gadsden or steve sawyer i searched some legal databases and was relieved to find merton easily i was beginning to think i didnt know how to find people anymore the hammer was in stateville doing twentyfive to life for murder conspiracy to commit murder and other crimes too heinous to mention in a family paper i tracked down johnny mertons lawyer if i could persuade merton and his attorney to let me in as part of johnnys legal team it would be my best shot at seeing him soon getting on the visitors list at stateville can take six weeks or longer the lawyers name was greg yeoman with an office on fiftyfifth street so johnny had left the big downtown firms behind and returned to home base in his current round of troubles that probably said more about his income than his politics i drafted a letter to johnny with a copy to yeoman and returned to more pressing or at least more lucrative searches even though i was exhausted after my short night and long day i kept going until almost seven trying to catch up on paper i was finally packing up for the day when the outer bell rang i saw my cousin on the video monitor and walked outside to meet her elton grainger was there too offering petra a copy of streetwise vic you saved my life he gave an elaborate bow and kissed my fingertips he was graceful on his feet but smelled of sweet wine you did petras face lit up perhaps she pictured me stepping in front of a sniper or some other exciting scene from burn notice i didnt haul him from a burning building or a sinking ship i said drily he passed out in front of me and i got him to a hospital i lost consciousness elton corrected me its my heart the doctors said i could have died without medical attention the doctors also said you could die if you dont stop drinking elton and i saw pastor lennon this afternoon she mentioned shed found housing for you but i already got my own crib its private and its a damned sight safer and cleaner than those shelters and after lying in a tunnel in vietnam with fifteen other guys i like being by myself where i know no ones gonna piss on me in the dark he turned to petra you ever been in a shelter course not young girl like you you got your parents to look after you like i shoulda done with my own girl but what with one thing and another i let her down he squeezed his eyes shut briefly hiding a drunken tear while petra shifted awkwardly from one foot to the other elton offered streetwise to a couple of passing joggers then looked at petra again trouble with shelters they rob you blind you go to sleep for one second and they steal the shoes off your feet when youre homeless your shoes are your best friend you walk an awful lot and you need good soles under your soles if you get my drift wheres your crib elton i asked its private i start telling the world and it wont be private anymore im not going to give it away to anyone not even the pastor but if i dont see you for a number of days then ill want to know where to look for you see if you need a doctor again he looked up and down the street it aint that easy to find which is why its such a good place but its over by the river you get off honore and then theres a path and then theres this shack hidden way out of the way under the train embankment now dont you go telling no one vic not your daughter neither petra giggled shes not my mother were just cousins but scouts honor i wont say anything i gave elton a dollar and took a paper im coming back in ten minutes with a sandwich for you ham on rye mayo mustard no tomatoes and id be real grateful vic he danced across the street on his light feet to a coffee shop where people were sitting at outdoor tables what are you doing here i asked petra lock yourself out again i saw your car was still in the lot when i was driving home and i hoped youd let me use your computer for a little bit just like half an hour maybe while you get him his sandwich they shut down the net at the krumas campaign no but i want to catch up on my own stuff and the wireless signal ive been using in my building disappeared today youve been stealing someone elses signal its not stealing when its just out there she said hotly i was too tired to argue the point and anyway i didnt really care i showed her the code to get into the building and made sure i hadnt left any confidential papers lying on my desk try to remember to turn out the lights when you leave okay the outer door will lock automatically behind you so dont worry about that she gave me her biggest brightest smile and a warm thankyou did you really save that guy elton is it did you really save his life i felt embarrassed maybei dont knowi got him to a hospital but he might have recovered on his own the alcohol doesnt help hes a vietnam vet which i only learned when i picked him off the sidewalk last week war sure messes with peoples minds i know ptsd we studied it in psych brian got a plan for them petra nodded solemnly feeling responsible for her candidate of course he does he ought to be presidentafter barack obama finishes i meanbut if we get him into the senate hell do everything he can for people like elton something about her youth her solemnity her faith in brian krumas made me nostalgic for my own youth i gave her a quick hug and went off to buy eltons sandwich the next morning i started my dance with johnny mertons lawyer nothing in greg yeomans manner inspired my confidence but i tried to tread softly around him he was my ticket to seeing the anaconda chief when i met yeoman at his south side office he put on the act of someone who knew the gang world inside out and would run interference for a price im not paying for the privilege of talking to johnny i only want to know if hell talk to me and given how crappy stateville is it will be easier if hell let me come in as part of his legal team that way we can meet more easily and talk with a pretense of privacy yes ms detective but that kind of work costs money if you want to see johnny in a hurry it will help you if you and i become friends ah yes becoming friends a chicago euphemism for bribe after all the anacondas still have a street presence and you wouldnt want word to get out that you were threatening merton yeoman added but if it does ill know where to come for help is that it i smiled sweetly he gave the satisfied smile of a man who sees that the little woman understands how powerless she is if johnny knows were friends i dont think it will come to that but i cant look out for you for nothing then well hope it doesnt come to that of course lamont gadsden was close to johnny all those years back when they were protecting dr king johnny wont be happy if he thinks his own lawyer was keeping him from helping lamonts mama look for her missing son i got up to leave im writing johnny you understand writing to ask him to put me on his meeting list itll just be easier if hes willing to give me legal credentialsim still a member of the bar after all but i dont want you to have to do any work that you dont want to so dont you worry ill put it all in writing yeoman gave me a look that made me glad i was standing near the exit but he said there was no need to be so very literalminded hed talk to johnny when he went out to stateville on monday in that case i can send this letter without making changes to it i handed yeoman a copy of the letter id written his client of course i didnt say johnny was the last known person to see lamont gadsden alive i merely wrote that i was making inquiries on behalf of ella gadsden and her sister claudia and since johnny knew everyone in west englewood i was hoping he could give me some names of more people to talk to on my way back to my office i stopped at fit for your hoof the man whod been there on my first visit was sweeping the sidewalk again singing to himself but when he saw me his eyes widened in fear and he bolted into the shop when i followed him in he was clutching curtis riverss leather apron she gonna hurt me she gonna take away my manhood no shes not kimathi because i wont let her curtis folded his newspaper under his arm and led the frightened man into some inner part of the shop behind the repair equipment when rivers came back he glared at me what did you say to kimathi to frighten him so badly nothing i was bewildered he saw me and ran for cover whats he afraid of if you dont already know its none of your damned business to find it out what is it youre really after ms detective warshawski who you protecting or hurting or covering up for no one else was in the shop i sat on one of the stools next to the tiny chess table whats that supposed to mean i told you what i wanted and why whos suggesting its something else thats well done all innocent indignation im impressed i clasped my fingers under my chin studying him youre protecting this guy whos hanging around your shop i dont know how to persuade you im not here to hurt anyone he slapped his paper onto the small space between us you cant but im starting to think you know where lamont gadsden went all those years ago is it his mother whos got you so angry she is a difficult woman i know is there some secret from the old days that i dont know about i think i already said more than you needed to hear he got up and went behind his counter rose hebert saw you enter the waltz right inn right after lamont went in there with johnny merton the night before the big snow that was the last time anyone knew him to be alive now i know youre lying he crashed a fistful of tools onto the counter rose hebert in the waltz right inn you overplayed your hand right there lady i smiled through thin lips you might not jump to conclusions if you listened more closely i didnt say ms hebert was in the bar i said she saw you enter it just as shed watched lamont and the hammer a few minutes earlier wishing she could be part of everyone elses good time rivers shifted a pair of shears from hand to hand measuring me at least he was thinking over what i said i wouldnt dispute a ladys word especially not a lady as sanctified as miss rose but i went to the waltz right inn a lot in those days and i saw lamont there more nights than not the night before the big snow doesnt stand out in my mind ms investigator is it johnny merton youre afraid of i dont blame you he scares me too between him and ella gadsden i dont know which makes me more nervous maybe you scare easier than me and maybe theres a reason for that what about steve sawyer i know now he was convicted of murder but hes disappeared too theres no record of him in the department of corrections is he the person youre trying to protect how dare you how dare you bitch come in here and flaunt him at me my jaw dropped all i know about him is that hes vanished as completely as lamont gadsden you wish you wish dont you get out of here before i land these scissors inside you the rage in his face was heartstopping i parted the handbagladen ropes trying to walk naturally trying not to let the shaking in my legs show id forgotten the train whistle its blast made me stumble as i opened the outer door a woman passed me at the door holding a scuffed pair of pumps noise always gets to me too i tried to smile but riverss fury made my mouth wobble i drove slowly to my office staying off the ryan i wasnt steady enough to deal with semis roaring around me nothing like echézeau for relaxing at my office i found petra had written thank you in big magic marker capitals on a piece of paper with a giant cookie from the coffee shop across the street taped to it the ingenuous message made me feel marginally better although i gave the cookie to elton who was outside again i also found a message from my temporary agency saying they had a marilyn klimpton available who met all my requirements including familiarity with legal databases shed start in the morning that was a mercy still the only thing that would really make me feel better was to understand why rivers was so furious with me i spent the rest of the day trying to find out more about both him and sawyer my first search had been superficial now i went deeper into databases that cost more money i couldnt charge these to miss ella but i needed to learn what lay behind riverss rage nothing came back to link either man to me rivers had served in the army from may through july with his year in vietnam sandwiched in near the beginning hed been married his wife died three years ago they hadnt had any children he had a sister and two brothers both living in the chicago area i put their phone numbers in my case file rivers had never been arrested and none of his siblings had ties to any of the people whose arrests id made possible at least not in the last six years amy blount had created a database of all the people id dealt with during that time so it was easy to crosscheck his name and address against my recent cases when id exhausted the net i dragged out the boxes id brought with me from my three years with the public defender of course most of the material had stayed in their offices at twentysixth and california but my own notes and records still made a tidy pile when id emptied them onto my big worktable i couldnt possibly check all those old cases but i did pull out my files on johnny merton curtiss name never came up neither did steve sawyers i called a friend of mine who had connections to the states attorneys office and asked if they could locate the trial transcript for sawyers trial and yes i knew what it would cost me to get a copy and yes i would pay for it i slid all the papers back into their boxes and tried to turn my attention to other jobs i was wrapping things up for the day when my friend at the sas office called back no record of a steve sawyer in or but things were a little sloppy back then any hints on the exact trial date i looked through the notes id made at the university library the vics name was harmony newsome but i dont know the trial date he promised to have another look in the morning right after he hung up my cousin petra phoned vic you were a lifesaver to let me use your computer did you get your cookie do you remember you and uncle sal are coming to brians big fundraiser next week i need to get names on a list since the president might come yes indeed your uncle sal is counting the minutes you spell warshawski w a yeah i know its like a warrior in a rickshaw going skiing how do you think i passed first grade i was the only kid in my school who knew what a rickshaw was we both laughed and i felt better when id hung up maybe mr contreras was right maybe i did need to be more like my cousin learn to charm the socks off rocks the next day i resolutely put the whole gadsden case out of my head lotty and i were having our weekly dinner that night i arrived a bit late since a job had taken me to the dupage county courthouse and the traffic back to the city was typically sludgelike when lotty let me into her apartment i was surprised to hear voices in the background she hadnt told me anyone else was coming max loewenthal was on the balcony that looked across lake shore drive to lake michigan he and karen lennon were both holding wineglasses she was laughing at something he was saying ah victoria max came forward to kiss me we hadnt seen each other since my return from italy how good it is to see you again and looking so very refreshed from your trip that was typical of max i looked about as refreshed as a monthold jar of dandelions he poured wine for melotty doesnt drink except for the occasional medicinal brandy but max keeps part of his important cellar at her apartment we chatted over the echézeau while lotty heated up some duck shed bought at a carryout place near the hospital max knows italy well over dinner we talked about the wines of torgiano and the piero frescoes in arezzo when i described the stage in siena where my mother had trained and sung lotty and max got into a side argument about the production of don carlos theyd seen there in finally over coffee max came to the point i saw karen this afternoon at an ethics committee meeting and when she told me she needed to see you i asked lotty to include her tonight not that i object but im not hard to reach or has miss ella asked you to slip me some poison karen had drunk her share of the heavy burgundy and she giggled with more hilarity than my comment merited i guess you and she had kind of a quarrel yesterday morning you could say that shes annoyed with me for trying to find one of her sons friends and im annoyed with her for hampering the investigation and keeping me away from her sister i think miss claudia would like to talk to you if she can get the words out clearly enough for you to understand she had her own fight with her sister after you spoke to her and it had something to do with that friend of lamonts thats why i wanted to see you as soon as possible to talk to you about him youve run into steve sawyer i couldnt disguise my surprise no but one of my projects is serving on the committee to end the death penalty and the chair shes a dominican nun named frankiefranceskerrigan she may know something i didnt think he got the death sentence but maybe he was executed and they didnt keep a record maybe that was why curtis rivers was so furious karen shook her head no no todays my day for racing around chicago doing good worksdeath penalty this morning hospital ethics this afternoon i had just come from seeing miss ella so she was on top of my mind and while we were waiting for the rest of the group to arrive i told frankie how frustrated i felt having sicced you on the case and how it was impossible to figure out what was going on with miss ella well frankie asked a few questions the way people do to be polite if they see youre troubled but when she realized it had to do with that civil rights time she got really interested it turns out she was in marquette park the day the girl was killed the one steve sawyer was arrested for murdering what i was startled into sloshing coffee over lottys linen napkins yes frankie had really bucked the tide of the south side her family lived in gage park and her father was furious when she got interested in the civil rights movement but her mother kind of quietly supported her thats when frankie found her vocation as a nun they were so brave those sisters they still are actually she lives and works at something called the mighty waters freedom center harmony newsome i interjected trying to steer her back on course sorry right frankie had been in selma with ella baker and she was marching with king and the others in chicago and she was with harmony newsome when newsome was killed isnt that incredible its extraordinary did she what did she the killer did she see i dont know what she knows about it all she told me was that steve sawyers arrest had always troubled her and shed like to talk to you i bombarded karen with questions why had the arrest troubled the nun had she seen the actual murder had she stayed in touch with sawyer karen held up her hands protesting ask frankie i dont know any of that stuff max laughed victoria i seldom actually see you at work but now i understand why you are so attached to that large dog of yours you are very like a retriever trying to flush a rabbit you know i joined in the general laughter and in lottys effort to turn the conversation in a different direction max brought out a bottle of armagnac and even lotty drank a little we lingered late unwilling to give up the warmth around lottys table unwilling to go back to the world of coldness of homelessness of desperation where karen and i both worked as we rode the elevator down karen brought me abruptly back to that world i checked with the sro where i found a room for your homeless friend he didnt show up and i wondered about that it wasnt easy finding a place lowincome housing is disappearing faster than the rain forests it was good of you to go out of your way but he seems to be a guy whos so allergic to other people that hed rather take his chances on the street we had reached her car as she got in i commented on how packed her life was her work at lionsgate with the homeless the death penalty what do you ever do to relax what do you do she said pertly except for your italian trip it sounds like youre at it morning noon and night i laughed it off but as i walked the two blocks farther to my own car i had to agree i wasnt living much of a life these days meeting the hammer in the tank the first thing i did in the morning was to call the mighty waters freedom center and ask for sister frances the woman who answered said sister wasnt in the center that day but gave me her cellphone number shes out of town trying to find housing for the families of some of the immigrants who were arrested in iowa last week they cant find enough homes for them over there i dialed sister francess cellphone and wasnt surprised to get her voice mail i left as concise a message as i could private detective steve sawyers trial if she remembered any details after all these years would she call me marilyn klimpton arrived from the temporary agency i spent most of the rest of the day working with her on my files and creating a list of key clients if one of them called marilyn needed to find me and get me a message at once late in the day i heard from sister frances she wasnt sure when shed be back in chicago she said but shed arrange to meet me as soon as she returned when i pressed her to tell me about steve sawyer she said she wasnt sure that what she knew would be useful to me i didnt know him and i was so shocked so overwhelmed when harmony collapsed i wasnt thinking at all it wasnt until much later that i started to try to remember details about the march and what i do remember is too too insubstantial if i try to talk about it now im afraid it will all evaporate lets wait until we can meet facetoface that was frustrating as well as disappointing i should have realized that if sister frances had seen who killed harmony newsome she would have spoken up forty years ago i had to put the lamont search on a back burner where the flame was just about ready to go out i had to wait anyway for the trial transcript for a chance to see miss claudia in a bitter irony johnny merton was beginning to look like my last hope because nothing happens fast in stateville i was surprised that my visit to merton happened ahead of the transcript and seeing sister frances inmate letters typically sit in bags for weeks sometimes months waiting for someone to get around to sorting them when johnnys lawyer greg yeoman called me a scant ten days after i sent my letter to johnny with the news that the old gang leader would see me i knew the hammer still had plenty of influence my visit to stateville was scheduled for the day before brian krumass big shindig on navy pier before driving to joliet i took mr contreras to his safedeposit box in his old neighborhood so he could pick up his medals even though he was keyed up almost beyond bearing talking nonstop about the fundraiser what he thought i should wear whether he should call max loewenthal to borrow a dinner jacket mr contreras took time to warn meagainagainst getting involved with johnny merton hes got a lawyer you said so yourself let the lawyer ask him your questions if those black friends of his aint talking to you theres a good bet merton wont either would you trust some black detective who came around asking questions about your childhood friends it wasnt our first goround on the topic i hope id have enough sense and skill to evaluate their sincerity and skill and not judge them or any person on their race yeah well if you have to have a dish perfect before you eat it youre always going to starve to death cookie and thats a fact its pretty darned hard for the rest of us to be perfect enough for you i was just perfect enough not to tell him he could get himself to petras damned fundraiser at the bank i waited in the lobby while he went to his safedeposit box he returned glowing with justifiable pride over his collection a bronze star a purple heart his good conduct medal with stars and his eto medal also with stars i left him polishing them while i drove west to the big house it wasnt even as though i wanted to visit johnny certainly not that i wanted to go to stateville i had been locked up once myself it had almost killed me and the helplessness and pain from those two months still haunt my nightmares prison is one endless round of violations of every human boundaryyour mail your time alone your time with others all these are invaded someone listens to your phone calls toilets and showers are open to any prurient guard and your body itself is constantly violated you being powerless to protest the frequent strip searches as i left the interstate for route my stomach twisted so hard that i doubled over at the wheel and had to pull off the road i knew i would be searched and that was the problem i kept telling myself that it was impersonal too many peoplecivilians lawyers guardshad smuggled in weapons and drugs to exempt anyone from a thorough inspection of person and property but the thought of willingly submitting to it turned me so cold i was shaking i switched on the heater despite the warmth of the july day gradually i calmed down enough that i could drive through the gates i showed the sentry my letter from greg yeoman announcing me as part of johnny mertons legal team i showed my letter from the warden authorizing my visit this afternoon the guard did a thorough inspection of my car including the old towels i keep in the backseat for the dogs when i passed through the three sets of razor wire the electronic security and the body search i felt myself shriveling disappearing into a numb place so i couldnt feel pain i was panting when the search was finished and i was escorted into the lawyers holding pen like everything at stateville the room was old and poorly lit the sagging deal table where i was going to meet merton might have been manufactured in the year the prison opened stateville consists of a series of circular cellblocks with a guard station in the middle of each guards in theory can see all the cells without the prisoners being able to tell if theyre observed as it stands today the lighting in stateville is so bad that no one can see much of anything many of the inmates spend days in the dark pigeons fly through their cells and along the corridors getting in easily through the cracks in the windows and walls but like many of the humans never finding their way out again because of staff shortages the men are essentially in a supermax facility allowed out briefly once a day often going weeks without getting to use the exercise yard their starchy meals are slapped through the bars at them i guessed thats why johnny agreed so readily to let me be part of his legal team even if the state wouldnt let him use a gym or a library they had to let him see his lawyer id been in the meeting room more than an hour before the locks scraped back a guard came in with johnny in cuffs and seated him at the scarred table he left us alone for a minute then returned with two styrofoam cups of coffee johnny clearly had clout the guard stepped to the corner of the room supposedly out of earshot so little white girl lawyer couldnt take the heat at twentysixth and california johnny gave me an evil grin had to jump to the pig side of the fence huh good to see you again too after all this time mr merton i sat down across from him actually seeing johnny was a shock he was almost bald and what remained of his closecropped hair was white he had once been lean and lithe as supple as his anaconda namesake but the loss of exercise and increase of heavy food had weighed him down only the anger behind the tearing in his bloodshot eyes was familiar that and the coiled snakes tattooed on his arms and what brilliant new insights are you bringing to my legal team little white girl i narrowed my eyes at him the pleasure of knowing i dont have to try to make you look good to a judge again that silenced him i hoped he was remembering the time i represented him all those years back in our meetings after showering me with the barrage of insults that had become his second skin he had raged against the rampant racism of the courts the cops the economy i somehow persuaded him to tone it down to speak civilly to the judge and opposing counsel and in the end we got an aggravated assault charge reduced to a sentence for battery i read through your file over the weekend i expect the cops could have got you anytime they wanted you for the rackets but they were waiting for you to make a big mistake and do it in front of a guy with a wire he smacked the table with his palm you think im admitting to anything in front of you bitch you are so wrong i pulled suite française from my briefcase and started to read after watching me in mounting fury johnny suddenly gave a bark of a laugh right ms detective i should have said close enough i closed the novel but didnt put it away im looking for an old pal of yours lamont gadsden the ugly look never far from his face came back full bore and what do you want to frame him for ms detective im the wrong kind of detective for that mr merton i only want to find the guy so someone else can stick him in here next to me his face was mean but he knew the prison system he spoke in a jailhouse whisper is there a reason he should be was he complicit in one of those murders they booked you for they booked me but never proved anything no evidence but a highwire act and that acrobat aint soaring too high these days the man whod fingered johnny for three gangrelated slayings had been johnnys secondincommand at the anacondas hed been found dead in an alley the day johnnys trial started as id read in the heraldstar s account of the trial theyd never arrested anyone for the mans murder although his ears were missing the telltale sign of an anaconda whod been abandoned by the gang booked you and convicted you im sure greg yeoman did his best but you didnt give him a whole lot to go on with did you i paused for a beat let him smolder anew over his adjutant whod flipped for the state lamont gadsden his mother is old the aunt who doted on him is dying they want a chance to see him before they pass ella gadsden dont make me start to cry detective there is no guard in this prisonhell no guard in this whole systemas hard as that pious lady only person who can match her is that reverend of hers what about miss claudia shes having trouble holding her head up has trouble even forming words she wants to see lamont again he folded his arms in front of him in a deliberate gesture of disrespect i remember those two sisters and miss claudia was always a ray of sunshine on south morgan but i dont remember any lamont he was with the anacondas during freedom summer helping look after dr king in the park his ma tell you that no disrespect to an upstanding pillar like ella gadsden but maybe her memory aint what it once was she must be somewhere near a hundred years old eightysix and i dont think theres a thing wrong with her mind johnny laid his arms on the table so that the coiled snakes were under my eyes i am the anaconda and if i say i never saw any lamont gadsden then he wasnt with us freedom summer or not his menace was palpable but i couldnt understand why he would be disowning one of his homeys funny other people remember him well so well in fact that they remember seeing you go into the waltz right inn with him the night before the big snow the last night anyone saw him alive the words hung between us for a long moment before he said lot of people went through those doors girl hard for me to remember who i might have seen forty years ago but ill ask around maybe some of the brothers have a better memory than me and while youre asking around see if any of them remember steve sawyer too he laughed if thats what you could call the raw and raucous sound i heard you were asking for steve sawyer its funny damned funny detective warshawski that you of all people dont know where that brother ended up i looked at him with so much bewilderment that he laughed again then signaled to the guard times up white girl come again sometime i always enjoy the chance to shoot the shit about the old days a wild night at the end of a pier the police had cordoned off navy pier as mr contreras and i showed our invitations at the barricade and were passed through i couldnt help thinking of stateville its true that the cops here treated us with deference since we had the vip reception tags for people who gave ten thousand or more or who had connections to the campaign but the barricades the very idea that we were never far from a police guard made me tense you okay doll you want to ride mr contreras looked at me anxiously and pointed to the trolley cars waiting to take guests to the east end of the pier i realized id come to a halt in the middle of the street i smiled at him determined not to ruin his pleasure with my fanciful fears the evening was soft and warm with the reflected sunset painting the eastern sky a rosy gray i took his arm and said i needed the walk the pier is a strange honkytonk place a tourist version of what chicago means gimcrack souvenirs of our sports teams and of the pier itself the big ferris wheel where you slowly rise above the city while listening to ads the usual highfat eateries and the endlessly blaring pulsing music loudspeakers placed on poles every ten feet guarantee that you can never escape the noise krumas for illinois had taken over the pier with the small donors partying at the west end under the ferris wheel and the vips a quarter mile east in a signal of krumass star power the states celebrities were moving around us the illinois house speaker the attorney general county officials corporate chiefs big lawyers local media luminaries you cant be a player in chicago without crossing paths with many of the usual suspects it pleased mr contreras no end to have a number of people come out of the crowd to greet me by name i saw murray ryerson from the heraldstar with a carefully fit young woman and beth blacksin who anchors global entertainments evening news see doll i said you needed to be dressed up and look at you bestlooking gal in the place and everyone knows it id worn my mothers diamond drop earrings and an anklelength scarlet sundress id bought for a wedding last summer i did it partly to please mr contreras and partly i confess to flaunt myself i wanted my young cousin to see that you could be circling my age and still be sexy dominatingly sexy at that thought i gave an involuntary grimace i hoped my time with johnny wasnt rubbing off on me how depressing for a feminist to feel the need to dominate anyone let alone do it with a red dress still i enjoyed it when my onceuponatime husband a player himself partner at one of chicagos international law firms gave me a silent whistle in greeting and kept an arm around my bare shoulder a moment too long for his current wifes peace of mind when i introduced him and terry to mr contreras the old man recognized their names and laughed with pleasure hes thinking maybe he made a mistake letting you go cookie he whispered audibly as we moved on not when he remembers how ive treated some of his important clients i laughed too though happy at the attention mr contreras was jaunty in his one good suit his battle medals and ribbons attracted their own attention from men like my brief husband who had carefully constructed their lives to avoid any public service especially the kind where other people shot at you now too old to serve they had a wistful longing that they too could brag of their military heroics at the east end of the pier we showed our vip tags again and got admitted into the grand ballroom the outsize space with its starstudded ceiling had been designed back in with this kind of event in mind a band lost in one of the alcoves was playing a rumba the music barely audible above the hubbub of the crowd whitejacketed waiters offered us little snacks members of the legislature and the governors entourage huddled with lobbyists and lawyers pr staff and journalists kept firing camera strobes at obligingly grinning guests and near each entrance city cops stood at grim attention we were handed brian krumas lapel pins by a twentysomething volunteer when we entered and everywhere we turned brians smile gleamed at us tacked to tables chairs the support columns in the room topping it all was a floortoceiling portrait of the candidate with his slogan krumas for a change in illinois he was flanked by the president of the united states the governor of illinois and the mayor of chicago we were working our way to the drinks table when i felt a tap on my shoulder i turned to see arnold coleman my old boss at the county criminal courts hed been a political flunky who made sure not to step on the toes of a powerful states attorney and hed been given his reward a state appellate judgeship vic good to see you have time to turn out for young brian even if a judicial campaign is beneath you judge coleman congratulations on your election i had turned down my invitation to a fundraiser for colemans campaignillinois treats its judiciary like any other commodity for saleand arnie clearly had kept a list of friends and foes another illinois tradition you keeping your nose clean vic the judge asked genially wipe it twice a day judge on my sleeve just like we used to do at twentysixth and california judge coleman this is mr contreras my old boss gave a fake laugh and turned back to his own party ignoring my neighbors outstretched hand cookie thats no way to talk to a judge mr contreras scolded i dont know from what i hear from my old pals at the bar association justice in colemans court isnt just blind shes deaf and lame too the only one of the five senses she has left is touch to feel how big the bills youre pressing into colemans hand are thats terrible what youre saying it cant be true people wouldnt stand for it my mouth twisted in an involuntary grimace when i was with the pd coleman and the states attorneykarl swevel it was thenfell over each other to see who could line up the most support for the local dems who we defended and how we did it that took a far distant backseat to licking local asses nobody minded then and nobody seems to care much now i saw that my neighbor was looking seriously aggrievedas much at my choice of words as what i was sayingand patted his arm consolingly lets find the kid we need to prove to her that we showed up we worked our way through the press of people until we stumbled on petra near one of the bars she was talking to an assorted collection of lobbyists and legislators who all had the round shiny faces of people whove spent too many years with their heads in the public trough petra squealed with delight and flung her arms around mr contreras uncle sal you made it look at you with all your decorations and vic youre so splendiferous i wondered for a second who uncle sals gorgeous date was she gave a peal of laughter and the group shed been talking to jaded old party hacks though they were joined in mr contreras brightened instantly petra herself was wearing a chiffon flowerchild dress over shimmery tights in her spiky heels she towered over almost everyone around her including me i have to find the senator i mean mr krumasi keep forgetting we have to elect him firsti know hell want a picture with uncle sal she explained to her group adding to mr contreras im going to take you to uncle harveys table so i know just where to find you she linked her arm through mr contrerass and started to steer him through the crowd i followed meekly in their wake twentythree years old and she was already a pro tapping shoulders laughing stooping to hear what an old woman with a hearing aid was shouting up at her about a dozen numbered tables festooned with red white and blue balloons and giant reserved signs stood near the band and a podium pretty soon wed get to hear a bunch of soulstirring rhetoric the tables were set aside for the people who had really come through for krumas according to the program they cost a hundred fifty grand fifteen grand a chair which just proves that adage about realestate prices being all about location the chairs were the same metal folding kind you can pick up at any church rummage sale the seats would fill when the speeches started right now only a handful were taken petra took mr contreras over to table right in front of the podium jolenta krumas the candidates mother was sitting with a small knot of older women who were all talking at the same time two younger women sat across from them i recognized jolenta from the newspaper photos of brian with his family i think the younger women were a sister and sisterinlaw but they werent as striking as jolenta her thick dark hair well streaked with gray was swept back from her face with a couple of diamond butterflies at sixtysomething her posture was still perfect she was intent on what the woman to her left was saying but she looked up with a good humored smile when petra bent down aunt jolenta this is salvatore contreras hes like my newest honorary uncle and i know the senatortobe would adore meeting him and having his picture taken jolenta krumas glancing from petra to the row of polished medals on mr contrerass suit gave a wry smile you are doing a splendid job darling ill make sure harvey tells your papa the next time they talk and so salvatore is petra exhausting you come sit down rest brian will be along in a while hes in back with some of harveys friends now that hes running for office im lucky if i see him at mass on sunday mornings this fundraiser is our first meal together in months petra turned around and saw me behind her she made a grimace of mock contrition oh aunt jolenta im sorry i forgot to introduce my real cousin vic victoria shes uncle sals upstairs neighbor shes a detective vic this is the senators mom senatortobe dear senatortobe we all hope the elections a long way off lets not jinx it okay she patted petras hand then indicated a chair near her for mr contreras everyone swarming nearby stared at him trying to figure out what hed done to get a seat near power i picked up a glass of wine from the krumas table as i moved toward an exit i heard a woman say to her partner oh thats brians grandfather the guy behind me just told me that i laughed a little so stories start i moved away from the building and walked to the east edge of the pier remote from the pounding loudspeakers and the endless preening conversations see and be seen see and be seen i stared down at the ripples that gleamed on the black water the pier was awash with money tonight with everyone hoping some would drift their way or at least some glamour or a tiny snippet of power like my old boss i hadnt thought about arnie coleman for a long time but he was the main reason id left the criminal courts if you had a highprofile case that states attorney karl swevel wanted to ram through you were supposed to put on the brakes when it came to questioning the cops or finding witnesses who might support your client id ignored the directive once and coleman told me then that if it happened again id be on report to the state bars ethics committee my dad had died six months earlier my husband had just left me for terry felliti i felt unbearably alone and scared i could lose my license to practice law and then what would i do the next morning i handed in my resignation i went around to the private criminal defense lawyers and starting doing odd jobs for them and one thing led to another and i became a pi i started to feel cold in my backless dress when i returned to the melee the band was playing a martial medley the candidate and his inner circle had appeared krumas was working his way through a wildly cheering crowd shaking hands here kissing a woman therealways choosing a woman hovering on the fringes of a group never the most striking in the knot he was passing through he was as petra said extraordinarily beautiful in person you wanted to lean over and stroke that thick head of hair and even at a distance his smile seemed to say you and i we have a rendezvous with destiny i craned my head to see if mr contreras had been allowed to stay at table i finally saw him looking a little forlorn squeezed between brians sister or maybe sisterinlaw and a stocky young man who was talking across my neighbor to another man on mr contrerass left i threaded my way to his side prepared to rescue him if thats what he wanted or to stay on the sidelines until he was ready to leave harvey krumas appeared from some place in the crowd and stood behind his wife with a small fist of cronies in attendance i recognized the head of the fort dearborn trust but none of the others although a stocky asian man was probably head of a singapore company in which krumas had a large stake the candidates father was in his late sixties with a thick head of curly gray hair and a square face that was starting to give way to jowls when he saw me near mr contreras he bent to ask his wife about me his heavy face eased into a smile and he beckoned to me it was only when i crossed to his side of the table that i realized arnie coleman was part of the group around him little petras talked about youher big cousin vic the detective youre tonys girl right tony warshawski was the staid and steady guy on the street he explained to his friends bailed me and peter out more than once back when we were wilder than we can afford to be these days bet you dont know that old gage park neighborhood do you vic not much to detect there these days except a boatload of poverty and crime a pretty gal like you shouldnt touch warshawski used to work for me in the pds office harvey arnie coleman said she was always getting her hands dirty up to her nose krumas was surprised to have coleman turn his party chitchat into something so venomous and i was astonished too who knew his animosity ran as deep as that after all this time we had a pretty rough crew as clients mr krumas i said people like johnny the hammer merton i dont know if you remember him from the roaring sixties but i guess he was quite a figure on the south side in his day merton krumas frowned name rings a bell but i cant head of a street gang harvey coleman said you probably saw his name in the papers when we finally got him locked up good and proper after vic here kept him loose for too many more years is that the man you went to see yesterday petra had popped up next to krumas vic drove out to the prison to visit him and hes like covered with snakes or something didnt you say tattoos i explained to a startled harvey you havent taken up the baton again for merton have you vic hes locked up for a reason no maverick investigator is going to come up with any evidence that will overturn his convictions coleman announced oh shes not trying to get him out of jail petra said shes just working on a case that goes back to when you and daddy lived in gage park uncle harvey some guy who went missing in a snowstorm or something i made her drive me down to see the house daddy lived in and i couldnt believe it like it would totally fit into our basement in overland park a guy who went missing in a snowstorm krumas was bewildered the big snow of sixtyseven i explained wondering at my cousins capacity for burbling forth disjoint news i looked at coleman and added just to be malicious black guy a friend of johnny mertons they were protecting dr king from the rioters in marquette park in sixtysix were you already with the pd then judge did you make sure those good boys who threw bricks and stuff got acquitted thats when this city began to go to hell coleman growled if your father was with the cops he probably told you that meaning what judge i could feel my eyes glittering meaning men ordered to turn on their neighbors on decent churchgoers trying to protect their families are you referring to dr king i asked if i remember correctly he was a churchgoer thats enough jolenta krumas turned to look at us this is brians big night i dont want a lot of sniping and backbiting to interfere with it jolentas the boss harvey crossed his arms over his wifes shoulders and shes right as always vic good to meet tonys girl i cant believe youve been stirring up the south side all these years and we never met dont be a stranger from now on the words were pleasant but they were a definite dismissal coleman smirked as i retreated to mr contrerass side while he got to stay next to power and glory a moment later though the candidate appeared brian kissed his mother embraced his father and then was taken by petra to meet mr contreras she was flanked by the campaigns pr staff and it was my side of the table not arnies that beth blacksins global entertainment cameras began shooting dreams of olden times there was a blizzard a white wall of snow i was choking as i fought my way through it i needed to find my father i needed to make sure he was safe someone had blown up st czeslaws even though they were christians they had blown up their own church father gribac was standing in front of the burning building waving his arms shouting that the cardinal had it coming if he wants to give the church to the niggers well see theres no church left to give them every time i tried to pass him the priest shoved me backward my father was a policeman he was trying to protect the church they might have blown him up too papà i tried to shout but dreamlike i had no voice i sat up sweating and weeping im a grown woman and there are still nights when i need my father so badly that the pain of losing him cuts through and takes my breath away i supposed the dream came from seeing my exhusband the night before that and meeting harvey krumas dick yarborough had loved my father tony was what kept our brief marriage together as long as it lasted even though dick left me almost as soon as the funeral was over whenever i see him he brings my dad to mind and then there was harvey krumas the candidates father tony used to keep him and my uncle peter on the straight and narrow harvey said last night as if my dad being a cop meant he monitored peoples lives it had been a misery of my childhood parents saying to my playmates victorias father is a cop hell arrest you if you dont behave apparently that was also how harvey and peter had seen tony not as a person just a uniform but if you hang out with a prize creep like arnie coleman you probably need someone to keep you on the straight and narrow i said out loud my voice startled peppy asleep on the floor by my side she twitched and whimpered yeah you havent seen your birth father for years and years either have you girl i leaned over to rub her head father gribac had been the pastor at st czeslaws the church my aunt marie attended actually nobody had blown up st czeslaws but father gribac sure had fanned fires of hatred in south chicago after the riotfilled summer of sixtysix marie was just one of the crowd of furious st czeslaw parishioners who vowed to do everything they could to show king and the other agitators hed brought with him that they should stay in mississippi or georgia where they belonged she was furious that the cardinal made every priest read a letter to the parish on brotherhood and open housing our chicago negroes always knew their place before these com munists came to stir them up marie fumed father gribac read cardinal codys letter since he was a good soldier in christs army but he also preached a thundering sermon telling his congregation that christians had a duty to fight commu nists and look after their families we heard all about it from aunt marie when she dropped in on my mother a few days after my tenth birthday if we dont stop them in marquette park theyll be here in south chicago next father gribac says hes tired of the cardinal sitting in his mansion like god on his throne not caring about white people in this city were the ones who built these churches but cardinal cody wants to let those ni not that word in my house marie my mother had said sharply oh you can be as high and mighty as you like gabriella but what about us what about the lives we worked so hard to make my mother had answered in her ungrammatical english mama warshawski she tells me always the hard times polish peoples have in this city in the germans are here first next the irish and they are not wanting for polish peoples to work at their work mama warshawski tells me how they are calling papà warshawski names when he looks for work stupid pollack and worse and tony he must do many hard jobs at the police they are irish they not liking polish peoples is always the way marie is sad but is always the way the ones coming first want to keep out the ones coming second i hugged my knees shivering as my sweat dried it seemed as though everywhere i turned these days i was being forced to think back forty years to those hot riotfilled days or to the january blizzard that followed johnny merton lamont gadsden and now tonight arnie coleman with his veiled racist comments thats when this city started going to hell cops forced to turn on their own neighbors they had busted up the south side those riots my father coming home after four days on shift without a break had been shaken by the hatred hed experienced directed at him and his fellow officers and even at some nuns who were marching with dr king you cant believe the insults these catholic boys shouted at the sisters people i went to mass with when i was a boy id heard him tell my mother when he finally got off duty i pulled on a sweatshirt and shorts peppy followed me into the dining room where i knelt in front of the builtin cupboards and pulled out the drawer where i keep a photo album of my parents i brooded over their wedding picture city hall my mother in a severely tailored suit looking like anna magnani in open city my father in his dress uniform bursting with astonished pride to be marrying the most extraordinary woman i ever met petras father peter a late thought in my grandparents life was a child in a sailor suit in the family photo my grandfather who died when i was small was there tall and bigboned like all the warshawskis boombooms parents appeared in several photos my aunt marie characteristically looking sourly at her immigrant sisterinlaw my uncle bernard giving gabriella a most unbrotherly kiss i looked more closely at that picture maybe that explained some of aunt maries sourness pictures of me didnt appear until much later i was a late thought too in a way my mother had three miscarriages before i was born and two more after a sign or maybe a cause of the cancer that grew inside her and silently overwhelmed her i found a family shot at the beach when i was three my mother in a rare moment of relaxation looking more like claudia cardinale than anna magnani me grinning over my sand bucket my dad in swimming trunks bending over her and me his two pepperpots he called us i flipped the pages softball in grant park my dad played on one of the teams the department fielded i used to know most of the men he played with i frowned over the team picture now reading the names printed underneath in my fathers curious boxy script bobby mallory in his rookie year on the force playing shortstop two men whod died in the last few years had been in the outfield my eyes widened in surprise as i looked at the man next to bobby george dornick hed been part of brian krumass entourage last night after the drumrolls and trumpets gave krumas a royal fanfare those of us lurking around his fathers table met the candidate and entourage dornick was running a big private security firm these days he was advising the candidate on terrorism and homeland security issues its not strange to find excops running private security firms it was strange meeting him last night and now seeing him forty years younger with his hair still brown and thick grinning with my dad and bobby and the other men id known if tony hadnt died maybe hed have gotten rich doing private security too i finally put the album away and went back to bed but i couldnt relax into sleep again i found a bottle of blueberry juice in the cupboard and took a glass out to the back porch peppy whod wandered down into the yard gave a short bark i leaned over to see the back gate starting to open peppy stood stifflegged growling i called to her but she stayed at attention growling more loudly as a luminous white shape appeared i started down the stairs in my bare feet but stopped on the secondfloor landing when i realized it was my new neighbor returning home with his bass in its large white case peppy changed at once from warrior to cheerleader circling around him as he came up the stairs thats a good feeling someone to greet you at the end of a hard day i was feeling sorry for myself just now coming home to an empty apartment he was in black tie tonight but hed put the tie in a pocket and undone his shirt what are you doing up so late indigestion i ate too many politicians for dinner last night what about you isnt it three or something we finished at ravinia and one thing led to another he said vaguely making me suppose hed been with a lover he leaned the bass against his kitchen door what politicians were you eating my cousinthe tall kid you may have seen around hereshe has a bit part in the krumas machine she dragged me to a highend event at least my ex saw me looking my best not the way my clients will in a few hours oh these exes at least yours probably isnt an oboe player their main relationship is with their reeds mine was wound up most in his billable hours but i brought my own faults to the table i added somberly thinking again of morrell and my failure to make that relationship work i left jake thibaut at the thirdfloor landing and went back inside i tried to sleep the few hours that remained before i had to go downtown for my seventhirty meeting after i finished my presentationmore by luck than skilli went to my office to check in with marilyn klimpton from the temporary agency i tried to focus on reports and email but i was too sleepdeprived i went back home to bed old trial or something like it i was awakened a little before three by another family drama mr contrerass daughter ruthie arriving from rolling meadows with her two sons was shouting at her father from the doorstep mitch and peppy were barking furiously once again i went to the street window to look down the dogs were waving their tails as they barked to show they didnt mean serious harm ruthie was standing on the cement slab in front of the door while her teenage sons lingered behind looking as though theyd rather be anywhere than here from above i had a clear view of the black roots sprouting in ruthies bleached hair we have to find out about you on the news you dont have the common decency to call and say oh by the way im going to meet all the bigwigs on earth let alone invite me and your grandsons to go with you your own flesh and blood and you show up on tv with that socalled detective my cousin petra suddenly appeared in the scene dancing up the sidewalk in stovepipe jeans and her highheeled boots clutching a sheaf of newspapers the dogs ran to greet her barks turning to squeaks of pleasure uncle sal petras husky voice drowned out ruthies nasal whine uncle sal just look wasnt that a fabulous party werent we all incredibly brilliant and you are a star uncle sal did you see the heraldstar and the washington post used the same photo i ran to the bathroom and stood under a coldwater shower for a minute i hadnt bothered with the papers on my bleareyed way to and from the loop this morning but id tucked my copy of the star into my briefcase i looked at it now there mr contreras was with brian krumas on the front page of the chicagoland section krumas a lock of hair falling over his forehead à la bobby kennedy had one hand on mr contrerass shoulder the other clutching mr contrerass arm just behind the elbow so that the cameras focus was on my neighbors medals his bronze star gleamed as brightly as the candidates smile petras value to the campaign must have quintupled overnight when she got that photo staged i pulled on my jeans and a tshirt and went down to join the party or whatever it was autograph autograph i thrust my copy of the paper at mr contreras he was smiling so widely i thought his ears might split open isnt he wonderful petra said uncle sal youre a hero theres no stopping you now she was oblivious to ruthies broad insults what hole did you crawl out of i dont remember no cousins called petra this here is his real family her sons were embarrassed and her father offended but petra ignored her demanding that i let them go up to my apartment to look at my computer hes on youtube hell want to see that and you guys will too wont you the grandsons shuffled their feet and mumbled adolescents unnerved by petras valkyrie sexuality her cellphone rang as we were clambering up the stairs petra looked at the number then announced it was her office she had to take the call he does really no im at my cousins yeah my cousin vic i suppose in half an hour she hung up and turned apologetically to mr contreras that was tania my boss at the campaign they never need me for anything anything important i mean in fact tania told me i worked so hard last night i could take today off but now im supposed to go to the office right away for a meeting vic can you show uncle sal the youtube footage all you have to do is search for last nights event i gotta run she clattered down the stairs in her highheeled boots leaving ruthie fuming even more who did she think she was shes my cousin ruthie so let it ride okay i took the unhappy family up to my apartment and set up my laptop for them the grandsons could navigate youtube for their grandfather but while everyone was shouting out on the walk id gotten a text message of my own the transcript from the harmony newsome murder trial was ready for me to pick up i rode the el downtown finding the trial record hadnt been hard theyre all on microfilm down at the county building getting it translated had been tougher the reporter whod transcribed steve sawyers trial was long gone her machine and her shorthand notes were also long gone finding someone who could make sense of the document hadnt been cheap i had to shell out almost two thousand dollars for the transcript i handed in my credit card with a sour face miss ella allegedly was paying me a thousand dollars for my initial inquiries i was now close to that much in the hole how much further could i really afford to go i rode back to my office feeling so bitter about the money i was losing on miss ellas business that i couldnt bring myself to look at the transcript the temp was typing letters and emails that id dictated during the last few days she handed me a list of a half dozen phone calls to return while i was holding for darraugh graham i finally flipped through steve sawyers trial record for a murder trial it wasnt very long only nine hundred pages many of them filled with yesorno answers not much defense as darraughs pa came back on the line to apologize for keeping me waiting my own name suddenly jumped out at me testimony of arresting officer tony warshawski my father sent to pick up steve sawyer this couldnt be my dad back in my life in this unbelievable coincidence johnny mertons bitter comment suddenly came to me that it was damned funny that i of all people didnt know where sawyer was vic vic are you still there caroline i said weakly tell darraugh ill have to call him back or if its urgent he can reach me on my cell tonight i hung up without waiting for her response and took the file over to my couch i couldnt make sense of any of it merton sawyer my dad they began to whirl in my head like an old top until i felt so dizzy i couldnt see anything at all enough melodrama i said out loud startling marilyn klimpton shape up warshawski pull yourself together i went to the little kitchen i share with tessa and made myself a black coffee sitting crosslegged on my office couch i went back to the beginning and read the whole transcript the trial had lasted a day and a half harmony newsome had died in marquette park on august the day of the civil rights march accompanied by an eighthour riot performed by the local community at first police and fire officials thought newsome had fainted it wasnt until they couldnt revive her in the ambulance that the fire department realized she was dead because of the confusion in the park and the amount of debris left behind police had been unable to locate exactly where she died or to find the murder weapon the medical examiner testified that newsome had been killed when a sharp object penetrated her brain through the eye the detectives in charge of the case larry alito and george dornick testified claiming that right after christmas an unnamed neighborhood informant led them to steve sawyer otherwise given the crowds in the park when newsome was killed they probably would never have made an arrest marilyn klimpton was leaning over me it was fivethirty and she was leaving for the day sorry to interrupt but i called your name three times and you didnt hear me ive left letters for you to sign and you still need to get back to darraugh graham i smiled as best i could and attempted to follow her report on her progress today as soon as the door closed behind her i went back to the transcript after three days in custody sawyer had confessed to the murder alito read the confession out in court sawyer had been in love with newsome but she wouldnt pay attention to him she got hincty when she went away to college judge gerry daly hincty is that some kind of colored word asst states attorney melrose i believe so your honor judge daly could i have that in english counselor laughter in the courtroom asst states attorney melrose i believe it means stuckup your honor although i dont speak their lingo either according to sawyers confession he thought he could kill her during the riots and have the murder be blamed on the white people in the park judge daly questioned sawyer briefly the public defender assigned to sawyer raised no objections either during the reading of the testimony or during the judges questioning he didnt call any witnesses he didnt try to get the name of alitos and dornicks snitch sawyers responses to the judge seemed vague and unconnected and he kept saying lumumba has my picture he has my picture the jury deliberated an hour before returning their guilty verdict i reread my fathers testimony shivering it was as though my nightmares of the early morning had been a prophecy of what i would find here my father sent to execute the warrant described sawyers shock and his attempt to flee described cuffing him described telling him his rights miranda was new that year the transcript included some ribald byplay between states attorney melrose and detective dornick over sawyers rights dornick and alito the detectives in charge larry alito had been my dads patrol partner for a year or so around my dad hadnt liked him much and i could remember him complaining about alito to my mother there was one night when he came home depressed alito had been promoted to detective while he tony with ten times the experience was still in uniform my mother consoled him saying at least you dont have to work with that prepotente any longer the sky outside my high windows darkened as i sat on the couch staring into nothingness when i finally turned on a light i saw it was after eight oclock i signed my letters and took a last look at the transcript before putting it into the gadsden file id been brooding so much over my father that i hadnt noticed the name of steve sawyers lawyer arnold coleman my old boss now a judge hed been a green young public defender in but he couldnt have been so green he didnt know he was supposed to raise an occasional objection like to the racially charged language in the court and why hadnt he demanded the identity of detective alitos snitch could that have been lamont gadsden alito off guard is this your idea of a joke vicki id waited an hour for a word with bobby mallory dropping in unannounced on a senior police officer is never a really brilliant idea but at least he was actually in the building the sergeant guarding access to those shiny new offices in bronzeville didnt know me but terry finchley one of bobbys aides was nearby he isnt exactly a fan of mine but he did grunt at the sergeant that it was okay to send me upstairs to wait for a break in bobbys schedule id brought a stack of work with me as the wait dragged on i managed to answer a bunch of emails and finish a report on the fraud burdening a small toolanddie company before bobby came out of his office to see me hed greeted me with a mix of affection and wariness he knew i wouldnt have come to police headquarters unless i had a favor to beg still he put an arm around me called to his secretary to bring in a cup of coffee for me and started with family news hed become a grandfather for the seventh time but he was as pleased as hed been the first time round i made suitable noises and wrote a note in my pda to remember a christening present that boy youre dating i hear hes back in afghanistan he didnt go halfway round the world to get away from you did he that boy is a fiftyyearold man and we both realized he finds afghanistan way more exciting than he does me i startled myself as well as bobby with the bitterness in my voice before bobby could probe or worse comment that my lack of domestic virtues was what drove men from my side i quickly started to explain my story the trail i was trying to follow how ella gadsdens inquiry had led me to the old harmony newsome murder trial bobby shook his head if it was one of mine ive forgotten it it was highprofile at the time civil rights worker killed in marquette park her family brought a lot of pressure on the department until they made an arrest i still dont remember he smiled bleakly families are always pressuring us to make arrests this time we made an arrest right and got a conviction so wheres your beef you saying now that the verdict was tainted youre madame zelda who sees all knows all i pressed my lips together i wasnt planning on overturning the verdict although maybe i should try reading the trial transcript was like reading mistrial malfeasance and nonfeasance the state couldnt produce a murder weapon and the public defender didnt call any witnesses the detectives the states attorney and the judge had a good old time laughing over language and customs on the black south side except they used farlesspolite words so the justice system in had its flaws i cant fix the past tell me one of my cops is using filthy language today and ill do something about it my dad was the arresting officer i got the words out with difficulty im trying to find out what happened people are hinting that tony crossed a line i dont believe this bobby thundered i dont believe even you would have the nerve to come in here and smear tonys name two things mattered to him gabriella and you you for what reason ive never understood the best officer the kindest man the closest friend and you you you have the damned gall to bobby i stood and leaned over the desk into his angry face shut up and listen to me i dont want to think any bad thing about my father ever i know better than you what kind of person he was he trained a gazillion cops a lot of them did like you went on to big careers but he wouldnt put in for promotion himself because he didnt want to make compromises in his his code of honor something happened to steve sawyer after my dad picked him up the men who know sawyer wont tell me but they keep passing hints and i need to know if i knew which i dont i wouldnt tell you youd put it out in the daily worker or some other leftwing pile of crap and smear enough i sat down wearily it is not easy to be a cops kid and date cops and have cop friends all the time knowing what some people do with that badge in front of them but if tony didnt talk to you about the sawyer arrest he didnt maybe that means it went by the book i guess ill see if george dornick will talk to me or larry alito dornick alito bobby leaned back in his chair suddenly quiet even wary why oh were they the detectives in charge well well well dornick is a big sob now out in the private sector id love to be a fly on the wall listening to how you figure out a way to talk to him and alito last i heard he retired up to chain of lakes you let me know how you make out with him and dornick if you end up with your nose broken ill send them a personal commendation on department stationery i stood up to leave in the doorway i turned to look at bobby who was still breathing hard guess who steve sawyers pd was bobby arnie coleman so so when i worked for him in the criminal pds office he cut so many deals with the states attorneys office he looked like the sas chief assistant you know he got his reward a state appellate judgeship judge coleman was hanging around harvey krumas at the big shindig on navy pier the other night when bobby didnt say anything i added and george dornick is young krumass adviser on homeland security and terrorism whats your point vicki that krumas knows a lot of people bobby smacked his forehead in mock comprehension oh i get it harvey krumas fixed the steve sawyer trial forty years ago even though he was just a twentysomething guy from the south side without any power his father owned ashland meats i said yeah that was a twobit outfit before harvey took over and turned it into the operation hes got today when i joined the force dornick used to razz harvey about having the bulls with the smallest never mind that but in dornick used to razz harvey i asked harvey was never a cop or was he no no he and dornick grew up in gage park together ran around with tonys brother your uncle peter are you trying to say that somehow harvey got arnie coleman to turn on his own client while dornick got the perp to make a phony confession and now harveys rewarding them by letting them lick his sons ass if youll pardon my french do you imagine if tony was still alive hed be part of that inner circle too because he tortured sawyer for krumas it was my turn to be discomfited i left without trying to say anything else but when i returned to my office i looked up dornick and alito bobby had made me feel defensive but when i first said their names hed grown quiet at full strength the cpd includes some thirteen thousand officers its true bobbys been with the force a long time and he knows a lot of people but he doesnt know all thirteen thousand yet those two names had stood out for him of course bobby would have met harvey krumas and my uncle peter through my dad if peter and harvey had grown up with george dornick i guess it wasnt surprising bobby would have met dornick too and since alito and dornick worked together bobby would have known alito as well maybe i was reading too much into bobbys reaction to their names but that didnt stop me from digging around on the web there were hundreds of hits for george dornick dornick had started mountain hawk security when he retired from the force his website told me that the firm specialized in training police officers around the world in how to do everything from recognizing and combating terrorists to identifying clandestine drug labs mountain hawk provided tactical training for officers needing help with close quarters combat use of tasers and other restraining devices wilderness survival for desert and mountainbased forces and how to use cars as offensive weapons in urban environments our clients expect total confidentiality and we provide that along with worldclass training so we regret that we cant supply you with a client list we have worked with police forces throughout the americas in cities in jungles and in the punishing sonoran desert we have also sent our experienced personnel into combat zones to provide support for american troops with offices and equipment in nine strategic locations around the globe we can be at your next training meeting within hours i found pictures of dornick looking alert and combat ready with everyone from chicagos mayor to the president of colombia i saw dornick demonstrate the use of tasers to women at a domesticviolence shelter and read articles about contracts hed received from san diego waco and phoenix to conduct special borderpatrol training sessions i couldnt find information about his life as a policeman but hed left the force some fifteen years ago alito looked more like the average cop forty years on the force retired to a small lake in northern illinois the little bit of press hed gathered showed a mixed picture hed been cited for bravery during a hostage crisis involving armed robbers at a strip mall on roosevelt road then six months later he was accused of using excessive force at the same incident for killing both robbers as the situation unraveled hed injured one of the hostages which was why hed been cen sured and an unnamed coworker quoted him as saying shes lucky to be alive and theyre better off dead so whats the beef since a lot of the citizenry agreed that a dead armed robber saved the city the expense of a trial the letters to the editor were predictably proalito with a segue into the importance of every american being fully armed at all times i stared blankly at the computer for a few minutes then pulled up a map of alitos home he lived just a mile south of the wisconsin border near one of the little lakes that dot the hills northwest of chicago a lot of chicagoans have weekend homes up there some like alito retire to live there yearround according to mapquest the sixtymile trip from western and north to lake catherine should take about eighty minutes but they were assuming you were driving at three in the morning during a rare period when neither the kennedy nor the edens was under construction i reached the north shore of lake catherine two and a half hours after leaving my office its true the birds were chirping the sun was shining and the air was clearer than on milwaukee avenue but my mood was much grumpier and i was desperate for a bathroom that involved backtracking to the nearest service station where i spent a little fortune filling my mustang used the mercifully clean washroom and bought a chili dog to tide me over id been so intent on my searches that id forgotten lunch a major violation of the warshawski family motto never skip a meal it was close to five oclock when i finally pulled off the road at the top of queen annes lace lane and walked down to alitos house he lived in a yellow splitlevel shoehorned onto a tiny lot his neighbors as close as they would have been on the south side of chicago but here he was just a few steps from the water as id sat in the tollway traffic id tried to come up with a strategy for getting alito to talk to me at one of my pi training seminars wed reviewed techniques for conducting a successful interview get your subject to think youre on his side dont be confrontational establish some common ground that he has to assent to so larry did you torture steve sawyer would not be a good opening gambit instead try so larry lets agree that it was a necessary and good thing to torture steve sawyer alitos wife answered the door she was about her husbands age somewhere in her sixties in khaki cargo pants with faded red curls that reminded me a little of the aging gwen verdon she didnt smile or greet me with any warmth but she didnt slam the door in my face either when i explained that i was the daughter of one of her husbands old partners on the force and hoped detective alito and i could talk her expression lightened minimally larry just got back from golf hes showering hell be down in a minute or two im making supper right now the sentence trailed away vaguely as if she were afraid i might want to be fed i assured her that i didnt need food or even very much time should i wait in my car that galvanized her into inviting me to come out back where she was getting ready to put burgers on the grill the cramped family room made me think of miss ella like her home this one was filled with small china figurines ms alito seemed to collect angels and kittens rather than african jungle creatures but everything was clean and carefully arranged down to little dishes of play milk in front of the kittens i felt my scalp twitch there was a sense of desperation in the displays still as i trailed after her through the family room to the kitchen i made appropriate noises about charm and so on its small of course but its just larry and me we have the one son but he lives in michigan and when he comes to visit we just put the grandkids in bunk beds on the sunporch you sit out here on the deck and ill go tell larry youre here i walked to the railing and looked around lake catherine was at the end of the road about thirty yards south of the alito place you could just glimpse the gleam of sun on water through the willows and bushes that grew around the shore the neighbors to the north were grilling the lots here were so small that the hamburgers and chicken legs were practically under my nose despite the chili dog i was still hungry i wanted to jump over the fence and grab a drumstick a mans voice came clearly through the open window above me you didnt even get her name sheesh hazel dont you ever think oh for heavens sake larry you think every person you meet is going to scam you and you didnt find out what she wants you gotta pay extra if you want me to be your secretary mr alito hazels voice was part sarcasm part seduction a disturbing window into their relationship alito grumbled but the conversation faded and a moment or two later he joined me on the deck he was fresh from the shower his thinning hair still dark with water but his eyes were almost as red as his sunburned nose he was carrying a can of beer from the smell of his breath as he came up to me it was his fifth or sixth of the afternoon detective alito im v i warshawski tony warshawskis daughter that a fact he looked at me without enthusiasm fact i said brightly i found a picture of your old slowpitch team the other night my dad played first i think is that right how should i remember tony warshawski on first whats on second that right i laughed dutifully you know my dads been dead for some years now yeah sorry i forgot to send flowers but we didnt stay in touch and i became a detective but private im not with the force private dicks they give me a pain in the whasis he swallowed deeply from his beer can and set it on the deck railing im looking up an old case that my dad and you both worked he didnt say anything but a pulse in his neck started to jump steve sawyer dont ring a bell the tone was indifferent but he grabbed the beer can and took another deep swallow hazel bring me another his wife had been standing at the grill with her plate of raw meat waiting for me to finish so she could make dinner she reached into a cooler by the grill and brought out another can what a fun evening for her you and tony had been partners on patrol in sixtysix and then you got moved to the detective branch at i can read my own history in the obituary pages whats your point he grabbed the can from his wife and popped the top it was a highprofile case at the time a young civil rights worker was murdered during a demonstration in marquette park and months went by without an arrest then you picked up steve sawyer tony picked up sawyer alito corrected me i thought you didnt remember sawyer all those shines marching in the park you saying that brought it all back to me he smirked i didnt say that i said sharply i said a civil rights demonstration yeah it was a demonstration full of shines he laughed and in the background hazel laughed tinnily too i gritted my teeth but said so if its all come back to you who was the snitch snitch what snitch at the trial you said your snitch had pointed you to sawyer no one ever asked for your informants name im asking you now ah jeez what a dumbass question like i remember every twocent junkie who wanted a fix bad enough to finger his friends what about lamont gadsden how well do you remember him from your old beat the question took him off guard and he slopped beer down the front of his sox tshirt he hollered to hazel to bring over a towel when shed mopped his shirt he said what were we talking about lamont gadsden he another of your shine friends name doesnt ring a bell if thats what you came for you wasted a tankful of gas the words and tone were right but his forehead was beaded in sweat i looked at him steadily when sawyer came into court he was badly disoriented didnt seem to know who he was or where he was going by the trial transcript what do you remember about that he tripped and fell against the bars of his cell you could ask tony if he hadnt croaked and hed tell you the same now get the fuck off my property what do you mean tonyd tell me the same i felt as though someone had punched me in the gut what i said everyone says your father was too good to be true right the level cop not the cop who had community complaints or iad smelling his shorts before he put them on well i could tell you a thing or two about saint anthony maybe the whole south side had reason to hate your guts but tony warshawski was the best damned cop in chicago you were lucky you had the chance to work with him but you got hincty like you claim steve sawyer did didnt you and bought yourself a i saw his fist coming a half second too late i swerved and he missed my jaw but the blow socked my right shoulder i kicked him on the shin and went for his solar plexus but water suddenly poured over my head my eyes my mouth and i was choking hazel had turned the hose on us spraying her husband as thoroughly as she was me alito and i backed away from each other breathing hard i stared at him for a long second then turned abruptly and opened the door to the kitchen you cant go through the house youre all wet hazel observed in her unemotional nasal voice i followed her off the deck without looking again at her husband she pointed me toward a narrow path that separated her house from the one next door as i walked up the lane to my car i could see curtains twitch at windows along the way if i had to live with larry alito i wouldnt fill the house with china kittens id have a large collection of axes the friendly man from mountain hawk going home i drove east all the way to the big lake before starting south i stayed on the local roads it made for a longer trip with all the stoplights in the little towns but the breeze off lake michigan was cool and it was easier to think without the congestion and impatience that clogged the tollway partway down the coastal road i stopped to walk over to the lake the water was a purply gray in the summer twilight i could see running lights away from the shore but i was alone on the beach crickets and frogs chirped around me alito hadnt been surprised to see me who had warned him i didnt want to think it was bobby that opened the door on a kind of ugly possibility that i couldnt bear to examine my fathers best friend in league with a drunk abusive cop maybe arnie coleman had called after seeing me at the krumas fundraiser i tried to remember what id said when we were sparring at the krumas table it was petra who blurted out that i was working on a case going back to gage park in the sixties and i had mentioned johnny merton if the sawyer trial lay heavy on colemans conscience he could have connected the dots although i had a hard time imagining anything lying heavy on my old bosss conscience the other thing that this afternoons interview showed was that alito knew lamont gadsdens name had lamont been his snitch then after all had merton killed lamont to punish him for fingering sawyer the hammer was capable of anything murder was all in a days work for him tony would have said the same thing alito claimed that a prisoner in his custody with a bloody nose and a black eye had tripped and fallen against his cell bars he would not you lying little twobit scumbag you think because tonys dead you can drag him down but you damned well cant my heart was pounding i thought i might choke to death there on the shores of lake michigan christmas eve it came back to me suddenly christmas eve when i was in bed and my parents were in the kitchen their reassuring laughter coming up the stairs had bobby been there someone a friend having a glass of wine and alito stopped by he and my father were arguing you got your promotion thats enough isnt it my father said and alito replied you want to see him in prison i had crept down the stairs anxious and heard my mother sharply call my name i scurried back up the stairs lying on the attic floor straining to hear but my dad and alito lowered their voices who would have gone to prison what were they fighting about my shirt was still damp from hazels soaking and the evening breeze rising across the lake was making me shiver i walked slowly back to my car trying to dredge up any more remains of that fugitive memory i stopped in highwood for supper the little town halfway between my home and alitos had been settled in the nineteenth century by the italian artisans who built the north shore mansions its become a kind of foodie heaven but i chose one of the old italian restaurants where you got a straightforward pasta and the chef was called a cook i spoke italian with the owner who was so pleased he gave me a free glass of amarone for an hour while we talked about food and i described a memorable meal id eaten in orvieto across the square from the cathedral roast pigeon with fig terrine i forgot my anxieties on the way home though i kept worrying about my father and larry alito and steve sawyer the way you do with a sore tooth curtis rivers and johnny merton both thought my father had beaten up sawyer that was the only credible explanation for the way the two men reacted to my name and my questions but tony would never have done that not unless sawyer had jumped him and hed had to subdue him but sawyer had been confused and badly represented at his trial what if what if nothing i said aloud tony didnt beat people up ever george dornick had been the senior detective in the harmony newsome investigation i would call him first thing in the morning see if he could set my mind at rest despite bobbys jeers it proved easy to get an appointment with dornick the warshawski name doesnt open many doors in the world but men who had served with my father were usually willing to see me at least once anyway when i called at eight as soon as i got back from running the dogs dornicks secretary said he could fit me in between ninethirty and ten am meetings i dressed carefully in an amber jacket over beige slacksfeminine but severely professionaland rode the el into the loop mountain hawk securitys headquarters occupied four floors in one of the glass towers on wacker that line the chicago river and their reception area actually overlooked the river i got there at ninethirty to be safe and ended up waiting for over an hour for a time i amused myself watching the barges and tour boats while mountain hawk personnel passed between elevators and locked glass doors leading to offices they spoke in urgent tones that stressed the importance of their work a few clients arrived and were whisked inside i was getting bored and there wasnt much to read in the waiting room the wall street journal swat digest and company brochures i spent fifteen minutes on the phone with my temp marilyn and sent a few emails but i was getting restless by the time dornick came out to greet me dornick was a vigorous man in his sixties the brown hair in the softballteam photo had turned gray in the way that gets labeled distinguished seeing him in his pale summer worsted i found it hard to believe he could ever have been covered with mud from a slowpitch game in grant park he held out a hand and shook mine energetically so youre tonys girl i should have recognized you at the fundraiser the other night you look just like him around the eyes he was a sad loss a very sad loss one of the best cops i ever had the privilege of serving with the contrast to alito couldnt have been more pronounced dornick put an arm around my shoulder and told nina to get us coffee and hold his calls he steered me into the kind of office you want to see when you need a good program in subduing and manacling the restless masses everything was made of polished wood and stone much of it gleaming black no paper was visible but an array of computer consoles kept dornick in touch with his team on the wall were the pictures of dornick that id seen on mountain hawks website this is really impressive i said how did you put it all together twenty years in the chicago pd got me my law enforcement knowhow and then it was a matter of scrabbling and scrambling some of my childhood buddies pitched in their nickels i had a lucky break early on busted a hamas training camp on the perucolombia border it was a fluke the way things often are in police work we were only looking for drugs and we found armaments that made our eyes pop he laughed youd think after being on chicagos streets nothing could surprise you but thats until you get into those latin american jungle outposts nina brought in coffeelovely smooth coffeeprobably handknitted in one of those jungle outposts nina tells me youre in private security yourself that you have a onegal shop you interested in moving up to the majors id be pleasedprivileged reallyto bring tonys daughter into my organization i learned more from him in two years on the streets than i ever did anytime after yeah my dad was a great guy i still miss him but im better on my own ive been my own boss too long to be happy in a big organization besides you probably know that i started in a big outfit the county public defenders office dornick nodded i saw your old boss at the krumas event you were right to chafe against an sob like arnie coleman and you were young at the time a big organization can be a chance to spread your wings rather than have them clipped you keep mountain hawk in the back of your mind the next time youre out doing surveillance in the rain and know you have to race back to your office to file a missing persons report i was startled it was as if he had spent a week watching my workload no doubt about it he was as smooth as his coffee i thanked him awkwardly dornick ducked a discreet look at his watch so what is it you need today vic im following an old cold trail i said a person whos been missing for fortyplus years my closest lead to him is also hard to track down you were the detective who handled the interrogation when he was arrested for murder steve sawyer the harmony newsome trial dornick put his coffee cup down and whistled silently that is an old cold trail my god i do remember the case though it was the first murder investigation id caught on my own i was working with larry alito you talk to him i think hes up in wisconsin now i saw him yesterday hes on lake catherine in the chain of lakes he said he didnt remember any of the details although i got the feeling that he was hiding a lot behind a can of beer dornick laughed behind a can make it more like a case one of the reasons i wanted to leave the police larry alito was not a good boy to partner with ill tell you that between you me and the kitchen sink no one could forget the newsome case it was so highprofile the mayor was calling me personally the dead girl was a really important person in the civil rights movement we couldnt afford a black eye as a city not after the way the riots had played on national tv the summer before you didnt have any doubt that you arrested the right man dornick shook his head we had a good snitch on that one not a jailhouse snitch a guy who was undercover for us in the anacondas was that lamont gadsden by any chance hes the man im trying to find a funny look crossed dornicks face the expression boomboom used to assume when he was deciding whether to dare me to do something really insane like jump off the breakwater into lake calumet what the heck vic its been all this time yes gadsden finally turned sawyer in wed been leaning on him for a name and i guess he and sawyer were good friends in the anacondas youre not trying to suggest that sawyer didnt do it are you im just trying to find lamont gadsden for his mother you dont know what became of him do you he disappeared the night before the big snow dornick shook his head we wondered too we wondered if hammer merton found out lamont was a flipper and had him put away because we never saw lamont again we checked with hammer but you know yourself how tough he is to talk to what do you want with sawyer im hoping he can tell me something about lamont but im meeting with a nun from the mighty waters freedom center she was with harmony newsome when newsome was killed and she does have some doubts about whether sawyer was the murderer dornick laughed oh the sisters the ones who didnt try to beat our balls off at school look at the world through such rosy glasses or they imagine they can be another sister helen prejean even get hardasses like me to oppose the death penalty nina came in the meeting was over dornick ushered me out with a renewed assurance that tonys gal was always welcome at mountain hawk and you tell your nun that im darned sure we sent the right guy to pontiac there isnt any record of steve sawyer in the department of corrections i said as dornick turned to go back to his office are you sure it was pontiac dornick paused in the doorway it might have been stateville not every detail sticks this far from the trial and your dad probably could have told you or bobby that we cops dont follow our perps once theyre sentenced i made appropriate sounds of gratitude for his time theres one last thing george and its very hard for me to bring up one reason im having trouble on the street with my search is the guys who grew up with gadsden and sawyer think sawyer was roughed up pretty bad during the arrest dornick turned again hands on his hips eyes bright with anger they always say that vic you should know from your time in the pds office they always bleat about excessive force we operated by the book and i mean we dotted every i we had too much riding on the arrest and dont you go dragging tonys name through the mud on this he was the best tony warshawski and those scumbags were fucking lucky to have him bring them in that was the end of the interview but his reassurance lingered with me all day gave me more confidence as i did a document search at the county archives as i organized a freelancer i work with to do surveillance at a warehouse in mokena in the southwest suburbs on my way back to the city i toyed with the idea of signing up with mountain hawk security it would be great to be part of a big operation where someone else went to mokena dornick had been right about a lot of things most especially his appreciation of my dad id liked him so why had i come away with an uneasy feeling as if something hed said had triggered not an alarmthat was too extremebut a warning i was sure in the kind of operation mountain hawk security conducted that all meetings were secretly recorded if i could get a copy of the disc nina made of my conversation then maybe id be able to figure out what was bugging me i laughed picturing myself scaling the green glass tower cutting a square out of one of the windows on the fortyeighth floor disabling mountain hawks security measures movie heroes have it so easy clint eastwood would pull out his magnum and blow people away make my day he says taking out someones brains and we all cheer soon the survivors are so nervous they tell him everything in life when youre scared or being tortured youll say whatever the terrorist wants to hear like steve sawyer coming into court disoriented confessing to harmony newsomes murder at that thought my foot came off the gas and i slowed so unthinkingly that a van behind me honked furiously i held up a placatory hand and pulled off at the next exit i sat at the curb at the end of the ramp and tried to think lamont had flipped on sawyerdornick said thatand johnny had been furious and killed him or curtis killed him for johnny and theyd disposed of the body make my day one of you make my day tell me what happened i couldnt imagine a threat or a bribe that would make either dornick or alito open his secret diary to me i didnt have an in with the states attorney to offer merton immunity or even a reduction in sentence for talking to me and even if i did merton still might not talk to me maybe judge coleman would explain why he hadnt called any witnesses when hed representedor misrepresentedsawyer forty years ago maybe there had been damning evidence that he kept out of the trial i looked up the number for the cook county judges and called coleman naturally the judge wasnt available for my call a clerk said shed be glad to take a message in a voice that sounded like shed be glad if she never used her telephone again i wanted just to leave my name and number but the clerk wouldnt take a message unless i explained my business in some detail i used to work for the judge i said i wanted to go over an old trial one that dated to his early years in the pds office i left my number without any expectation of ever hearing from him id pulled off the road at rd street pullman was just a few miles to the east maybe rose hebert could shed some light on all these players dubious judge frightened woman rose answered the door in another sober dress this one a navy dotted swiss she looked at me with a flicker of eagerness have you learned something about lamont it was painful to tell her no to watch the dull heavy expression settle on her face again i need some advice or insightsomething like thatinto johnny merton or curtis rivers she gave a selfderisive bark of laughter i dont know enough about life or those two men to have insights into their minds youre selling yourself short ms hebert i said gently i dont have news for you but ive been to see both men and ive talked to people who knew steve sawyer theres been a suggestion that lamont might have flipped on steve might have led the police to steve sawyer might have said sawyer was harmony newsomes murderer oh no i oh the house bell had begun to ring behind her and she turned fearfully away from me he wants to know whos at the door whats keeping me so long i grabbed her wrist and led her down the shallow stone steps maybe hes ninetythree but hes not too old to learn how to cope with frustration where can we sit where youll be comfortable she looked back at the house but finally muttered that there was a coffee shop on langley where she often stopped for breakfast on her way home from the hospital we drove over to the pullman workers diner in my mustang where the waitresses greeted rose by name and looked at me with frank curiosity rose ordered coffee and blueberry pie i had a slice of rhubarb to keep her company i dont even know where to start she murmured when wed been served its all so wrong steve harmony i dont believe that but even if he did kill her lamontoh he and steve were best friends growing uplamont would never have turned him in to the police did harmony live in your neighborhood she and her family they were up the street from us but they went to a baptist church that daddy said wasnt a true church and they were rich mr newsome he was a lawyer and harmonys brother he went off to law school and became a professor out east someplace harmony was in college down in atlanta she got involved in the civil rights movement down there and when she came home for summer vacations she talked it up in her churchs youth group she talked at a lot of the churches in our neighborhood but not at daddys church because he thinks women dont belong speaking up in church like it says in saint paul and besides he doesnt think church people belong marching on the streets we belong in the pews she bent over her coffee stirring it as fiercely as if it were her father or her own life she were attacking i shouldnt say this but i was so jealous of harmony she was so pretty she got to go to a fancy college spelman while i had to scrimp to put together money for nursing school and then the boys were all spellbound by her when i first heard she was dead i was glad i reached across the table and pressed her free hand you didnt kill her by being jealous of her you know she looked up briefly her face contorted in pain all the boys followed her around even the ones who went to our church which is why i never could believe lamont really cared about me i figured he thought id be an easy mark big old ugly girl like me no one else wanted if he couldnt have harmony hed make do with me but i dont think any of the boys would have killed her not out of jealousy like they claimed steve did she never went out with him never went out with any local boys far as i knew she was in love with the movement not with any boy not even some college boy in atlanta with her same background were steve and lamont at the marquette park march daddy ordered everyone in our church to stay away but lamont and steve they ignored him johnny merton hed taken part in the deal the gangs made with dr king that they wouldnt fight that summer and in exchange they provided protection along the march routes she sucked in a breath remembering and continued very softly oh daddy was angry he hated having his authority crossed when steve and lamont did what johnny wanted not what their own pastor said he read them out of the congregation it was a terrible terrible sunday and after church daddy told me my own soul was in danger if i ever even spoke to lamont gadsden again even so if i had to go to the store or something id take a route that led me past his home or carvers lounge where he and the other anacondas shot pool her voice trailed away this morning george dornick told me lamont had been the person who fingered steve sawyer for him and alito i remembered the funny look hed given me when id asked maybe it had really been pastor hebert furious with his two parishioners wanting to get the police to take care of them for him how angry was your father with steve and lamont i asked rose abruptly could he have turned them in to the police what a terrible suggestion how dare you even think a thing like that she pushed her chair away from the table daddy is the holiest man on the south side like tony had been the best cop on the south side were we daughters always like this always ready to leap to our fathers defense even against the evidence i looked into her flushed face ms hebert i apologize for speaking so bluntly i shouldnt have said the first thought that came into my mind you say you dont believe lamont was a police informant and certainly not your father who then she twisted her fingers together does it have to be one or the other no it could be someone i havent even heard of some twobit player in the anacondas but i went over to stateville to see johnny and hes pretending he never heard of lamont that makes me think well im sorry to give you the harsh unedited workings of my mind again but you think johnny murdered lamont i wondered too when he disappeared but its hard for me to see a reason unless lamont snitched out steve yes that could be a reason but her words twisted around with as much agitation as her fingers oh that johnny merton theres nothing i wouldnt believe of him and yet he set up a clinic in our neighborhood he made the government give our children the same milk they handed out in the white schools he looked after his little girl like she was the crown jewel dayo that was what johnny called her and that made daddy mad all over again because it was african it means joy arrives she gave an unhappy bark of laughter my daddy would have looked at me and said joy departs so why am i standing up for him where was your mother when you were growing up i asked mama died when i was eight my granny she took me in for a while but her heart was bad and anyway daddy wanted me home where he could keep an eye on me i paid for the pie and the coffee and drove rose back to her home during the short ride she tried cleaning her face with a tissue she couldnt face her father looking distressed hell think its about sex at my age with my life hes still sure im off having sex with strange men go for it i said mischievously pulling up in front of her house its not too late you know she looked at me startled almost afraid you are a very strange woman where would i even find a man whod look twice at me as she got out of the car i remembered a final question do you know where steve sawyer is now i think curtis rivers and merton both do and they wont say she shook her head slowly he was in prison a long time i know curtis he visited steve but i heard maybe he even died there dont be thinking curtis would tell me he doesnt like me any more than well he seems to like you he thinks i was always carrying tales back to daddy when we were in high school he cant forgive that she hesitated then leaned back into the car youre a good listener and i appreciate that im grateful thats good im glad i was a good listener because i needed her to tell me things a thought which embarrassed me enough that i added you can always give me a call you know and talk to me again she walked heavily up the steps her shoulders stooped no one would look at you with love or even lust if you were so bowed over but she didnt need me to tell her that i turned around and headed back to the expressway by now it was the height of the afternoon rush and the ryan was about as express as a turtle with corns i was stalled on the overpass above the sanitary canal when my cellphone rang i figured the risks of talking while driving didnt extend to talking while parking but i did almost hit the car in front of me when the woman at the other end said she was judge colemans secretary and could i hold for him judge thanks for returning my call id like to stop by to ask you about one of your old clients we can do this by phone i told you the other night to leave johnny merton alone i ground my teeth not the hammer one of your first clients judge when you were a newminted pd remember the steve sawyer trial he didnt say anything harmony newsomes murder do you remember her he turned so quiet that i thought at first the connection had gone someone behind me honked a gap of four feet had opened in front of me i scooted forward glancing at the oily surface of the canal the day was hot and humid and the water looked as though every person murdered in cook county in the last century had rotted in it the judge suddenly spoke again why this interest in ancient history warshawski i thought my answer over carefully if id been able to meet with coleman in person transcript in hand i would have tried to ask about all the gaps in the recordwhy he didnt try to find out the name of the snitch why he let the obvious collusion between the cops and the states attorney go by unchallengedbut on the phone i didnt have any way of pressuring him steve sawyers name keeps coming up in a missingpersons search im doing but hes disappeared as well in fact theres no record of him at all after his trial im hoping you have your old notes im trying to find which prison he was sent to that trial was forty years ago warshawski i remember it my first highprofile case he laughed thinly across the airwaves i learned a lot from that trial but i couldnt possibly keep track of all the lowlifes who went through twentysixth and california during my time there i was finally on the farside of the canal of course not judge but the transcript did raise a number of interesting procedural questions why did you read the transcript he demanded of all the questions he might have asked that was the oddest looking for traces of steve sawyer judge it was exciting to see your name there mine too my dad was the cop they sent to make the collar cellphones dont give you good reception but i thought i heard a quick intake of breath almost a gasp you have questions about the trial ask your father hes been dead for years judge and im not a big believer in séances you were a smartass knowitall when you worked in the courts warshawski and it doesnt sound to me like youve changed any i dont owe you a damned thing but im still going to tell you for your own good to leave all that old history in the archives merton newsome the boy who killed her leave it alone he cut the connection before i could thank him just as well i couldnt have kept the savagery out of my voice much longer exuberant cousin when you get home feeling that youve been pummeled by all sides in the hundred years war and youre longing to lie in the tub for a decade or so to soak away your wounds the last thing you want is to see your highspirited cousins shiny pathfinder parked out front i tried to slink past my neighbors place unnoticed but the dogs betrayed me whining and scratching at his front door a moment later they all bounded into the hall dogs cousin and mr contreras uncle sals picture got me a kind of promotion petra called were celebrating come on in i protested feebly that i was exhausted but they ignored that mr contreras bustled inside to get a glass of spumante while the dogs circled me yipping as if i really had been away for a century the commotion brought the neighbor across the hall into the entryway shes a plasticsurgery intern who is perpetually affronted by the dogs she keeps trying to get the coop board to declare the building petfree but the korean family on the second floor who have three cats was so far fighting on mr contrerass and my side really the dogs wont hurt you theyre superfriendly petra called to the doctor see mitch hell take food right out of my mouth wont you boy she put a taco chip between her lips and invited the dog to jump up on her before the intern had a stroke or called the cops i bundled my team into mr contrerass living room the coals are just about ready the old man beamed we wasnt going to wait more than five minutes longer for you doll but now i can put the steaks on i dont much like spumante while mr contreras took the steaksa gift from uncle peterout to the grill i poured my glass down the sink and went upstairs for whisky i looked wistfully at my bathtub but settled for a quick shower with clean hair and clothes and a glass of johnnie walker i felt if not revived at least strong enough to cope with the outgoing personalities on the first floor they were all out back now the dogs sitting at attention around the grill in case one of the steaks dropped to the ground petras hearty laugh floated up the back stairs to me i could hear jake thibaut playing his bass next door it would have been pleasant just to sit on the steps listening to the music drinking my whisky but i let duty be my guide and went down to the garden i asked petra about her promotion does this mean youre working directly for brian krumas now dont i wish although maybe i dont theres so much responsibility at the high levels of the campaign making sure all the facts are right the speeches are just so that brian knows whos saying what about him and what he needs to think about im happy to be a worker bee although mr strangwellhes like brians most important adviserhe met with me personally he wants me to brief him about the same stuff i tell my real boss that sounds like a serious jump up the ladder i said how does your real boss feel about it oh tanias used to people moving around in the operation shes totally cool i wish youd met her at the fundraiser but she was pretty much spending the whole night with national media types whats strangwell like id never met him but you cant operate on even the fringes of chicago politics without knowing about him if he was advising brian krumas personally it meant the national party might well be grooming brian for a postbarack obama presidential run petra gave an exaggerated shudder hes kind of scary hes so serious everyone else in the campaign were all young and we joke around its how we get the job done but hes mr serious in my pod they all call him the chicago strangler and when he looks at you and tells you he wants something done you feel like gosh better drop everything and do this now and even then youre afraid it wont be good enough what does he have you doing then really just more of what ive been doing looking for attacks on brian seeing whats out there but getting more focused you know she gulped down her spumante thats enough of the boring old campaign did you go see any more snake charmers today snake oh anacondas very good little cousin ill call johnny merton that the next time i visit and see what kind of reaction that gets me no just burrowing around in the past even more boring than the campaign i assure you why would you want to do that are you like trying to get on americas most wanted find some criminal whos been on the run for forty years or something if vic ever went after one of them old crimes shed only be doing it to prove the fbi or the cops or someone had arrested the wrong person nothing gets done right if she aint done it herself my neighbors tone did not make his words a compliment so do they have the wrong man in prison for murder or something petra asked eyes so wide that her long mascaraed lashes were flat against her brows i dont know if the guy im looking for is guilty or innocent hes disappeared so leave him lay mr contreras said roughly i would i answered slowly but i read the trial transcript and my dad was the person who arrested him and and i want to know what went on when he picked up the guy mr contreras insisted that that was all the more reason for me to leave it alone who knows what your pa faced when he was on the job with your cockeyed way of looking at things youd put the worst interpretation on it what if he beat up a helpless man what good interpretation could i put on that i cried im saying what if he did people look all helpless and defenseless in a courtroom but you dont know did he pull a gun did he attack your pa maybe threaten his life you cant go by only the end of the story cookie you got to know the beginning and the middle too uncle sal is right petra chimed in i never knew uncle tony but daddy talks about him a lot he was a good person vic you cant go around making up stories to say he wasnt im not i know better than either of you what a good man he was i grew up with him i rubbed my eyes wearily was peter still here in petra i cant remember when he moved to kansas city she flashed the smile that made her look like my father i wasnt around so i cant be sure but i think it was in when ashland meats moved down or maybe seventyone i know daddy didnt marry mom until she was some kind of local debutante or something queen at the american royal you know the big livestock show the queen and king of meats thats what i call their wedding photos i laughed dutifully but said i wonder what peter remembers from the summer of sixtysix he was still living with grandma warshawski over on fiftyseventh and fairfield he must remember the marquette park riots he always says thats what ruined the south side the neighborhood started to change grandma warshawski had to move north to get away from the crime my cousin shifted uneasily on the grass as she caught my expression the fault lines of race in the city they run through my family along with the rest of the south side my grandmother had wept when she moved that unnerved me as a child to see an old woman cry granny warshawski tried to explain her own confused and conflicted feelings about race about the changing neighborhood i know how hard it is to be the stranger in the land kochanie but i dont know these black people and grandpa is dead peter will find himself a wife someday soon my friends are gone i cant be alone here im scared to be the only white lady on the street id been eleven at the time id argued with her belligerent selfrighteous even then was that what made it hard for me to live with someone else was it what mr contreras had just accused me of that in my book i was always the only one who knew anything i dont suppose tony confided in peter or that your father would even remember after all this time hes had meat to worry about not to mention you which must be a fulltime job but maybe ill give him a call ask him i can do that vic i talk to him or mom just about every day but maybe uncle tony left some kind of record do you still own the house he lived in we could go exploring for secret closets or something petras eyes sparkled with excitement sounds like you want to be a detective yourself i said petra warshawski and the secret of the old closet no sweetie houses in south chicago were built pretty close to the lath not much room for secret hiding places anyway i sold it after he died and i was lucky to find a buyer the neighborhood was so depressed what did you do with his stuff did he keep a diary i laughed youre thinking of storybook cops like adam dalgliesh or john rebus endlessly secondguessing themselves when tony needed to unwind hed watch the cubs or play ball himself have a beer with your uncle bernie he didnt brood or write poetry but didnt he leave you anything petra demanded like i dont know his prize bowling ball or something neither that nor his polkaplaying accordion where do you get your stereotypes petra take it easy doll mr contreras admonished me lots of guys bowl not that i liked it much pool for me that and the horses although my ma thought itd turn me into a dropout and a drunk my dad hadnt left much unlike a lot of cops he wasnt a gun collector hed had only his service revolver which i turned in when he died id kept his sole backup a millimeter smith wesson for my own use id given his shield to bobby mallory i had the photo album id looked at the other night some softball memorabilia a plaque featuring the eightpound coho hed caught in wolf lake id kept some of the tools from the little shop hed had behind our old kitchen i even used them occasionally to repair a broken sink trap or build a simple piece of shelving other than that all i could remember keeping was his dress uniform which id stored in a trunk with my mothers music and her burnt velvet concert gown petra was all for digging into the mementos then and there when she heard i hadnt looked at the trunk for years she was sure there was something id forgotten that would explain everything mr contreras agreed with her you know how it is doll you put things away you forget what they were same with claras things when i went to look for her jewelry to give to ruthie i found id put all kinds of things in boxes even her false teeth i know i know i agreed wearily my dad probably had the secret plans for building a gasless car but im not going to look for them tonight im beat im going to bed petra had drunk a fair amount of spumante which made her argumentative and insistent on going to the third floor at once i got tired of arguing long before she did and announced i was going to bed i suggested that she stay the night i didnt want her driving in the state she was in finally around eleven when mr contreras chimed in on my side she let us put her into a cab i helped him clean up letting his waterfall of talk wash over me yes petra was a good kid wonderful news about her promotion yes maybe i was too hard on her didnt i remember being young and enthusiastic and then he was off to the races on his own youth i left him in front of the television with a glass of grappa and took peppy upstairs with me in my dreams though a sabertoothed tiger was charging me when i fell helpless to the ground in front of it it changed shape and became my father trunk show petra showed up the next morning just as i was returning from the lake with the dogs shed come to collect her pathfinder but when she saw us she climbed out of it and jogged over the dogs raced to her fawning and barking covering her white cargo pants with water and sand she was as bright as ever showing no aftereffects of her evening with spumante you know we could look at that trunk of yours before i go to work she said playing with mitchs ears whats with you and my trunk i demanded do you think there are going to be false teeth or rubies or something she grinned at me i dont know i guess since coming to chicago ive gotten more interested in my familys history i mean my moms family theyve been in the kansas city area for centuries one of her ancestors was a colonel in the confederate army and another came out to kansas with the antislavery pioneers in the s so i grew up on all her stories and her family is well so waspy that dads story was always kind of looked down on you know polish meatpackers now i want to know more about the warshawskis they seem more interesting since ive been in their city and met you and so on id taken her to look at the bungalow on fairfield avenue where my grandparents lived when they moved from back of the yards now petra wanted to see the house on the citys northwest side where grandma warshawski moved after the sixtysix riots and the tenement in the stockyard district where my dad grew up and her own father had been born she followed me up the stairs energetically planning an outing for the end of the workday that would include back of the yards my childhood home in south chicago and norridge park where our grandmother lived out her old age petra darling calm down how about one house at a time being as how just getting from norridge park to south chicago will take us a couple of hours she gave her selfmocking pout sorry mom always says i take off like a rocket ship when everyone else is still riding in buggies lets go see back of the yards and your house today we can go to norridge park tomorrow or even on the weekend my little saturn booster i have plans for tomorrow night i put my stovetop espresso maker on to heat asking my cousin to turn it off when the pressure built up while i rinsed sand out of my hair and off my skin when i returned to the kitchen there was espresso all over the stove and floor and no sign of my cousin i turned off the flame cursing loudly and began mopping up coffee oh sorry petra suddenly appeared in the doorway i didnt know how long it would take so i thought id just try to find your trunk damn it petra why couldnt you stay in here long enough to turn off the stove i said i was sorry that doesnt solve the problem i dont want you helping yourself to my home especially not when you dont do a very simple task that would have kept this explosion from happening ill clean it up while you get dressed she muttered id used the towel id dried off with after my shower to soak up the worst of the mess i put it in her arms wet grounds and all and stalked back to the bathroom to rinse coffee from my hands when i returned to the kitchen dressed for work petra was standing in front of the stove anxiously monitoring my little espresso pot the floor was washed and the bath towel id dumped on her was hanging on the porch railing outside my back door she looked at me with an expression so much like mitchs after hes been caught digging up the backyard that i couldnt help laughing her own face relaxed into a smile gosh vic do you know how scary you look when you get mad i hope im doing your coffee thingy the right way i turned the flame off as the pot started to burble and offered to lend her some clothes her own were stained with coffee both from the towel and her energy in diving in to clean up the kitchen she took a tshirt and trailed after me into the living room i felt my temper rise again when i saw that shed been rooting through my big walkin closet shed pulled out my winter boots and my bike to get at the trunk which stood open shed ripped apart the protective tissue in which id wrapped my mothers velvet concert gown the dress itself was flung over my armchair so that a sleeve and the skirt were on the floor my dads dress jacket lay open on the piano bench i guess im so used to living with my sisters and my roomie i forgot not everyone wants to share petra said in a small voice after a glance at my face its not about sharing its about consideration empathy i picked up the evening gown and started to fold it back into the sheets of tissue my hands shaking do you know how many hours of lessons my mother gave so that she could buy this dress how many evenings we ate pasta without sauce do you know what its like to live with so little that each possession has to be cared for and cherished my mother started to rebuild her career in this gown after each performance i helped her hang it up with dried apples and cloves to keep moths out of it she could mend little tears in it but if it had been badly damaged she couldnt have afforded another my mother died when i was sixteen i dont have much left to me that has her hands on it her touch i dont want you near this trunk or her clothes im sorry vic i was thinking about your dad and you wanting to find something to show what he was doing in i didnt think how this would look i took a breath and tried to steady my voice i think it would be a good idea if you left now but arent you going to look at your dads stuff she asked as i started to fold tonys jacket by myself when i feel up to it im late now for a meeting with a client i tried to find a lighter note doesnt the chicago strangler expect you to show up some time even if you were yesterdays hero you could be todays goat campaigns arent forgiving places she started to explain how relaxed her work atmosphere was and anyway because brians dad and my dad were like homeys brian knows that family comes first brian told you to come look at my dads dress uniform because he and peter grew up together she turned red no of course not i just meant oh never mind ill see you tonight okay we can go look at back of the yards i looked at her wearily ive had enough family for today petra ill call you when i feel up to spending an evening with you i cleaned up your kitchen i apologized for taking out your moms dress i think you could show some kind of response do you i was kneeling by the trunk to lay my mothers gown inside but turned to look at petra my response is that you are a wonderful young woman with a lot of energy and goodwill but youve lived your whole life in a privileged bubble come back and see me when youve thought through how youd feel if your mother was dead and your only memento of her was treated like like a towel for mopping up coffee she stared down at me her face a mix of surprise and anger her cellphone rang she pulled it from her shirt pocket looked at it looked at me and bolted from my living room i heard her cluntering down the stairs in her heavy shoes the sound drowning her voice as she answered her phone i sat for a time on the floor my mothers dress still in my lap i smoothed the tissue my throat tight remembering how gabriella looked onstage at the old athenaeum theatre her only major recital before she became too weak to perform she had been luminous in this gown and her voice had filled the theater i looked at my watch i had about an hour to get downtown instead of replacing the gown and my dads dress uniform jacket i started rummaging through the trunk myself my mothers music a box of my old school report cards my birth certificate my parents marriage license my mothers naturalization papers another thin box held reeltoreel tapes my mother had recorded herself when she began training seriously again she went to a professional coach but could afford only a single session a month mr fortieri the instrument maker had a pioneer recorder a beautiful piece of machinery that he let my mother borrow it weighed a ton and i remembered helping her carry it home on the train mr fortieri lived on the northwest side and it was a day trip for us to go there and back the illinois central downtown the ravenswood el to foster and then the long bus ride across foster to harlem where mr fortieri lived in an old italian enclave while he and my mother discussed music in italian i was given a quarter to buy gelato or a cookie at umbrias on the corner the day he decided to lend my mother his machine she demurred twice as good manners dictated but i knew she had been subtly hinting at her need for it for several months i helped her wrap it in a blanket we carried it between us as we transferred from bus to el to train at home she let me and one of my girlfriends record a play wed written for school but boomboom wasnt allowed near it once or twice i remember my father using it too although like me he was just goofing around for my mother it was a serious work tool i put the tapes to one side if i could find a place that would transfer them onto cds for me i could listen to her again i owed petra a little consideration for making me open the trunk i might have gone the next forty years without remembering i had these tapes all i found in my fathers handwriting was a few love notes to my mother and a letter hed written me when i graduated from college i sat back on my heels to read it you know how proud i am of you the first person in our family ever to go to college i wish your mother was here i wish that every day but most of all on this day you know she saved her nickels and quarters from all those piano lessons so you could have this chance and youve made the most of it were so proud tori everything you do makes me proud to be your dad but you need to watch that hot temper of yours i see so much of it on the streets and even in our own family people let their tempers get the best of them and one bad second can change your life forever in a direction you dont want to go i wish i could say theres nothing in my life i regret but ive made some choices too that i have to live with youre starting out now with everything clean and shiny and waiting for you i want it always to be that way for you love dad i had forgotten the letter i read it through several times missing him missing the love that he and my mother surrounded me with i thought with regret too of the many times i let my temper get the best of me turning difficult situations into impossible ones even yesterday talking to arnie coleman or this morning with petra i could get so much better a response from people if i stopped shooting first maybe mr contreras was right maybe i did need to be more like petra i thought it over maybe i did but i couldnt move myself into sanctity i was still furious with her for raiding the trunk to begin with i put the letter into my briefcase so i could take it downtown and get it framed as i put it away i wondered what my goodnatured peaceable father had ever done that he regretted enough to mention in this letter i couldnt bear the notion that it had to do with steve sawyer i looked quickly through a cardboard box that held my fathers memorabilia i had kept his citation for bravery from an armed robbery hed stopped in his wedding ring and a few other odds and ends there was also a baseball i held it for a moment like mr contreras and his wifes false teeth i hadnt remembered putting it away funny my dads game had been chicago slowpitch i didnt think hed ever even played hardball i realized as i turned the ball over in my hands it was autographed by nellie fox that made it even stranger because fox had played for the sox and my dad had been a cubs fan south side still means white sox when tony was young you could be beaten to a pulp for showing cubs paraphernalia south of madison street comiskey park was a few blocks from the stockyards where my dad grew up his high school buddies were all sox fans only tony warshawski and his brother bernie sick of the stench of blood and burning carcasses decided to risk their lives by taking the el up to wrigley field so why had tony kept a sox ball it was weatherbeaten with holes in the horsehide maybe hed used it for target practice although the holes were too small for bullets i jumped as i heard footsteps in my entryway and then a mans voice calling to ask if anyone was home petra had left my front door open on her way out and jake thibaut wandering down to check his mail had noticed i got to my feet looking guiltily at my watch id been mooning over family mementos far too long what are those old reeltoreels thibaut pointed at the faded scotch boxes on the floor my mothers old tapes she was a singer who was trying to reclaim her voice after twenty years of breathing iron dust i was hoping to find a place that would put them on a cd but then i dont know my mother is dead maybe her voice wont sound as wonderful as i remember it maybe i should just let these lay iron dust thibaut asked doubtfully i grew up down by the old mills i looked at my watch again and bent to pick up the tapes and the nellie fox ball give me the tapes i have a friend with a studio even if youve romanticized your mothers voice dont you want to hear it again of course i did he took the tapes while i stuffed the ball into my briefcase with my papers and tonys letter i tried to curb my impatience while jake ambled to the hall talking about the better quality of sound you got with some of the old eighttracks than with digital equipment he was helping me i didnt need to be belligerent over a few more minutes delay i could curb my pit bull personality for three more minutes i tried to flash a petratype smile of thanks with an apology for needing to run and tore down the stairs running to roscoe to flag a cab evermoreinquisitive cousin when i got home that evening i found a massive bouquet of peonies and sunflowers on my doorstep a handmade card showed petra sticking her head out of snoopys doghouse i couldnt help laughing at such an apology i called to tell her all was forgiven then can we go out tomorrow and look at the old family homes i suppose so little cousin i suppose so i felt let down as though shed sent the flowers to manipulate me into taking her around town not because she had genuinely wanted to reach out to me i hung up and went out on my little back landing with a glass of wine and the days newspapers it had been another long tiresome day after my morning meeting downtown id looked up johnny mertons daughter dayo she proved easy to find she was working as a reference librarian for one of the big downtown law firms when i called she was understandably cautious but she did agree to meet for coffee in the downstairs lobby of the building where her firm had its offices talking to a private eye about her dad didnt make her all warm and friendly but i felt she was reasonably honest with me i cant tell you anything about the people in my parents old neighborhood she said when i explained that i was trying to find anyone who could talk to me about lamont gadsden or steve sawyer my mother left my dad when i was little all i remember is they had some huge fight after he locked us out of the apartment it was that big blizzard you know and he wouldnt let us in she said he was in there with his other women doing drugs and she wouldnt put up with it so she took me to tulsa to live with my grandmother and my aunties all they ever did was talk about him like he was satan in the flesh and i got so sick of it i came back here a few years ago to make up my own mind that had been right before he was tried on the charges that sent him to stateville dayo had used her training to do pro bono research for her fathers defense team shed been unimpressed with greg yeoman but he was from the old neighborhood and johnny could no longer afford downtown counsel i dont think my fathers a saint but hes not the devil everyone wants me to believe he did all this good for the community back in the sixties and if the cops and the fbi hadnt railroaded him he might have been a community organizer instead of a gang leader maybe then i could have led an ordinary family life instead of suffocating with my mother and my aunties in oklahoma she gave a painful smile maybe hed be president today starting out as a community organizer when i asked how often she visited johnny i got the feeling that the gap between what she wanted him to be and the person hed become was too big for her to bridge easily she mumbled that she made the trip to joliet for christmas and easter sometimes thanksgiving i brought the conversation back to lamont and steve sawyer to see if shed be willing to try to talk to johnny about them theyve been missing forty years now your dad is the one person who might know what happened to them but he doesnt trust me she shook her head im not doing any work for the police maybe my dad did some things he shouldnt have but hes sixtyseven i dont want him dying in prison because i helped tack another twentyfive years onto his sentence maybe his old buddies arent dead i suggested or maybe if they are he didnt kill them but knows where their bodies are she was resolute enough maybes build a whole hive of bees and i dont want to be part of it we left it at that the conversation sent me home depressed the only helpful news id gotten today was a text message from karen lennons friend the nun whod been with harmony newsome when she died sister frances wrote that shed be back in chicago sunday night and asked that i meet her at her apartment on west lawrence after supper on monday on saturday in response to petras wheedling i got up early to take her on a tour of our familys south side history we started in back of the yards nowadays nothing is left of the massive meatpacking houses that used to cover two city miles except for one small kosher shop which provides lamb to muslim and jewish butchers around the midwest petra and i parked on halsted and walked through the giant gates where drovers used to register their cattle shipments it was hard for either of us to imagine the days when tens of thousands of cattle were unloaded every day and the drainage ditches ran with blood and offal my dad used to tell me that during the depression when he was growing up here the yards were the most popular tourist attraction in the city i told petra when the worlds fair was held along the lakefront in more people lined up here to watch cattle being killed than went to the fair ugh i cant imagine all the blood and stuff might make me a vegan and then daddy would have six heart attacks and disown me right before keeling over she laughed merrily at the notion we walked across exchange place past the remains of the international amphitheatre to ashland avenue the beatles had played the amphitheatre just a few days after the marquette park riots my dad had to help with crowd control i remembered how upset he and my mother were the riots had kept him away from home round the clock for a week and now because of hysterical teenagers in my mothers bitter language he had to go straight back out i begged him to take me with him i was a bit young for full bea tlemania but was catching the fever it was such a relief to have something fun happening on the south side for a change he let me and one of my girlfriends sit in the back of his squad car we got to see the fab four pretty close as they went inside petra rubbed my forehead i touched the eyes that saw ringo laughing and kidding together we meandered through the old neighborhood saturday is a busy time in any part of town shopping laundry kids sports yard work car repairs all bring people into the streets ashland avenue was crammed with women lugging children and groceries girls playing hopscotch and double dutch the staples of chicago sidewalks slowed progress even more all down the street heads turned as we passed petra towering over the crowd her spiky blond hair shining like a roman helmet was startling a freak show traveling through the neighborhood when i was little granny warshawski already lived over in gage park my dad took me by here once just to show it to me so i hope i remember which building he grew up in this part of ashland is still vibrant light industry has filled in some of the holes left by the stockyards people tended their little gardens the tenements were covered with fresh paint but underneath the uninsulated siding remained these wooden row buildings dated back over a century to when upton sinclair wrote the jungle when my dad lived here they hadnt had running water or central heating he used to have to stoke the furnace on winter mornings running water finally arrived in the fifties the pipes were attached to the backs of the buildings as they had been to my childhood home on south houston you got just enough water into the house to supply the kitchen so a tiny bathroom with a handheld shower was installed behind a makeshift partition near the kitchen sink i could still remember the first time i visited a college friend in her oak park home it seemed so luxurious to have a second bathroom and a big tub to stretch out in a woman came up the walk with a toddler and a shopping cart in tow petra turned to her eagerly asking in competent spanish if we could look inside mi abuelita vivía antes en este apartamento my grandmother used to live in this apartment the woman looked at us doubtfully but shrugged and gestured to us to follow her in petra and i helped her carry the heavy cartloaded with bottles of pop milk and topped with clean folded towelsup the steep wooden steps inside the narrow hallway crammed as it was with bicycles and strollers petras high spirits became subdued which one did granny warshawski live in she asked me secondfloor front i said the velázquez family our guide said in english shes not home but the fathers mother stays with the baby maybe shell let you look she called to the toddler who was staring dumbstruck at petra mother and child went on down the hall the child looking back over its shoulder at us we climbed to the second floor and knocked on the velázquezes door we could hear a baby wailing and a television blaring in spanish after a moment we knocked again and then heard a voice asking in spanish who was there my cousin called back also in spanish explaining our mission our grandmothers old home could we have a quick look a suspicious silence on the other side while we were inspected through a peephole and then the sound of many locks scraping back and the rickety door being pulled open we were instantly inside the apartment no foyer or other formality stood between us and the front room where a sofa bed stood open the baby who was about ten months old lay on it still crying an older sibling in front of the television turned to look at us he shrieked and ran behind his grandmother my cousin stooped and began playing peekaboo with him in another minute he was laughing trying to grab her spikes of yellow hair the baby struck by her brothers laughter stopped howling and pushed herself to a sitting position in a second she had scooted to the edge of the bed i picked her up before she fell off and sat her on the floor in the midst of the chaos the grandmother apparently decided that the easiest course was to let us take a quick look around i dont know what petra thought shed find sixty years and who knows how many families lay between our grandparents and the current tenants my cousin looked in the four rooms quickly saw the arrangements made to accommodate five children and three adults sofa bed bunk beds air mattresses under the diningroom table clotheslines hung with diapers and clothes toys stacked under beds wrinkling her forehead in puzzlement petra asked the grandmother where the family stored their other belongings the older woman had been reasonably friendly until then now she frowned and snapped off a volley of spanish too complex for my primitive knowledge except for espías narcóticos and immigracíon which she kept repeating my cousin stammered a few words but a moment later we found ourselves on the far side of the door what was that about petra complained i just wanted to see where they kept the rest of their stuff darling that is all their stuff when you started wanting to see storage places she assumed you were with the ins or were an undercover cop hunting for drugs my building has storage bins in the basement where we can put our bigger things i wanted to see theirs why on earth what business is it of yours i looked at her in astonishment are you doing some kind of research for the campaign on drugs in hispanic households of course not i i thought maybe well i wondered if petra stammered her cheeks beet red wondered what i demanded as she broke off she looked around the hall at the tricycles and skateboards i thought maybe if people had more storage room they could clear out the hallways the last sentence came out in a rush i see i said drily giving her a little push toward the stairs how thoughtful of you these buildings dont have basements at least not the way you understand basements theres a hole underneath the kitchen end to house the furnace what if theres a tornado fortunately theyre not as common in chicago as in kansas but i suppose you could wiggle under the building in an emergency when we got outside i pointed to the outside entrance to the furnace room and to the opening under the back stairs where you could huddle if you absolutely had to back in the car as i headed over to the ryan to go to south chicago i said i dont know what you really wanted back there but dont try it again on south houston my old house is smack in the heart of gang territory we could get shot if anyone imagines were dissing them we may get hassled just for being anglo women nosing around the block okay okay petra muttered picking at a loose thread on her jeans a scary sidewalk we rode the expressway south in silence petra kept her head studiously turned to the window looking at the old slag heaps and collapsing bungalows without comment this had always been a rough part of town but when the mills were filling the landscape with clouds of toxic dust most people had good jobs now those mills are as dead and gone as the cattle that used to pour through the stockyards most people in south chicago lucky enough to find work are pulling minimum wage at the fastfood joints or the big bysmart warehouse on rd street unemployment rates have stood at over twentyfive percent for more than two decades down here and street crime usually involves more than one gun skirting potholes big enough to swallow a flatbed truck i pulled up in front of the house on houston where id grown up this is it i tried to sound jaunty i couldnt carry it off the leadedglass transom above the front door was still there but two of the little glass diamond prisms were missing the prisms had made gabriella feel she wasnt living in just another shabby bungalow but a house with some distinction to it she and i polished the glass every month and scrubbed the iron dust from the frame around it i pointed to the porthole window in the attic that was my room i used to watch the street from up there when i wasnt driving my mother crazy being out in the middle of the action petra looked at me doubtfully what did you do my cousin boomboom actually hes your cousin too your dad talk about him boomboom was a hockey star but he was murdered a dozen years or so ago he and i used to jump off the barrier into lake calumet to swim in the summer or we skated on it in the winter its where he practiced his slap shot i fell through a hole in the ice one winter and the main thing we were both scared of was that gabriella would find out we used to climb the girders on the el to ride up to wrigley field if we didnt have money for carfare then wed shinny up the ivy behind the bleachers and sneak into the park for nothing gosh daddys always said you were too wild but i always thought it was because you were such a feminist he hates libbers i didnt know you were a street punk when you were little i smiled at her why do you think im a pi i couldnt take all the rules and regs in the public defenders office and they couldnt take me either arnie coleman the judge who was hanging around harvey krumas at your fundraiser he was the head of the criminal pd unit when i worked there he gave me one bad performance review after another mostly because i wouldnt play the county game shed started to open her door but she paused when i said that what county game its all politics over there at twentysixth and california its not about justice or trying to get the best deal for your client not if your client is an ordinary street criminal as soon as theres a whiff of politics about a casewhether its police brutality or a connected guys kid whos been arrested or someone trying to move up the laddercases get decided to help careers arnie was probably the most skilled mover in that cesspool i ever saw and he got his reward hes an appellate judge now and hanging with your candidates daddy if brian gets into the senate arnie will get a federal judgeship vic her face flushed brian isnt like that why do you have to be so negative and cynical im not i said just when i think about arnie and some of his cuter tricks mind your step weve got company id been watching a cluster of young men in my rearview mirror theyd been milling around the north end of the block trading insults and catcalling passing women while they ostensibly worked on a rustedout dodge pickup a boombox belting out rap was on the sidewalk i shouldnt have spent so much time reminiscing theyd started our way while i was lost in memories of my childhood the gang looked in the mustangs windows saw that we were both women and that petra was young and began rocking the car wha choo doing here the one nearest me shouted i put all my weight on my right side shifted and flung open my door so fast that it caught him in the chin i got out quickly blood was oozing from his lower lip bitch he screamed why you do that i ignored him and looked at his friends hello boys why dont you go back to your own car i think those little kids up there are messing with your stereo they looked up the street where two small boys were darting glances between the gang and the boombox two of the gang took off to deal with the kids but the one id injured and his other two friends stayed near me petra was still inside the mustang but when her door was clear she uncoiled herself from the passengers seat and hopped out to the pavement they turned to look at her even the one whose lip was bleeding any of you boys know señora andarra id done a lexis search last night for the names of the current occupants who wants to know one of them who sported latin kings tattoos asked because i want to talk to her and id hate to have to tell her someone in her family was acting like a punk out on the street in broad daylight they started muttering among themselves and finally backed a few steps away from us we watch you you bother her we take care of you it was the latin king again you her grandson thats good we grannies like to know the little ones are looking out for us i put my arm around petras shoulder and pushed her onto the sidewalk and up the short walk to the front door it felt queer to ring a bell at a place id gone in and out of freely for twentysix years we listened to the sound die away in the house after a time while the latin king moved up the walk behind us the door opened the length of a short thick chain and a short old woman peered through the crack at us your turn i said to petra my cousin explained in spanish what our mission was but señora andarra was adamant we could not come in no perhaps we meant well but how could she tell and with only geraldo out there on the walk no if her son were home it would be another story but too many people wanted to rob you and told you stories petra pleaded and wheedled as best she could in her classroom spanish but we couldnt budge the woman we turned around keep your head up look confident you own this sidewalk what do we do if they attack us petra whispered say our prayers i said then called out geraldo your abuelita is worried about you she doesnt like to see you just hanging around nothing to do with your time she wants to see you with a good job not ending up in the morgue like your buddies geraldo looked from the house to us id been talking to his granny we knew his name of course i was just guessing about what she might have said but it wasnt hard to imagine what she might say about a kid like him geraldo bit his lip backed away from us we got into the mustang without any other trouble from the gang although they struck a defiant pose until we turned the corner at the end of the street and were out of sight gosh vic i was so scared i thought i was going to pee back there when you hurt that one guy i was sure the others were going to attack us yeah i wondered about that too but in broad daylight and once a bullys taken a hit hes more uncertain of his ground at night in an unlit alley id be rats meat by now could you have beaten them if theyd jumped us nope i could have done some serious damage but me against five young men not great oddsnot unless youre a street fighter yourself are you kidding i can use my elbows in beach volleyball but thats about it could you teach me some moves if we get in a jam again i dont want to be the helpless damsel while you do all the fun stuff i laughed a little ruefully ive spent my share of time in the hospital after doing the fun stuff but id be glad to show you some moves every woman needs to know what to do in a tight spot eighty percent of its mental not physical like just now i was betting that geraldo was too afraid of his granny to attack us right in front of her house we drove north in a peaceful silence i suddenly realized i hadnt heard my cousins phone ring all day i switched it off because i figured it would annoy you if i kept talking but ive been texting here while you drive she paused and then said not to piss you off about something else but did you ever look at your dads stuff all i found were rubies his false teeth and the secret plans for the invasion of canada canada why would he want to invade canada why not mexico so we could be warm in the winter seriously vic did you find like diaries or anything no darling just his old softballs and a white sox baseball that might be worth something it was signed by nellie fox nellie a woman played for the white sox daddy never alas sweet p nellie was short for nelson not eleanor he was a gold glove second baseman for the white sox anyway the ball is so beatup its full of holes i have no idea why tony even had it maybe he picked it up for your dad and forgot to give it to him peters a white sox fan isnt he we live in kc so its the royals for us poor us but daddy keeps a soft spot for the sox we talked baseball the rest of the way north as i was dropping petra off she reverted to our little encounter with the punks outside my south chicago home please dont tell daddy about it okay he already thinks im like six years old without enough sense to keep out of harms way and he thinks youre this megafeminist troublemaker if he knew id waltzed right into danger at your side hed skin you for supper and put me in a convent hed have to catch me first and fear not youre safe from the convents your dad and i never talk visit a client and talk i drove over to lionsgate manor sunday afternoon to meet miss claudia i was tired of getting the runaround from her sister and even from karen lennon on when she would be fit enough to talk to me the building receptionist sent me to the skillednursing floor where the head nurse told me that theyd taken miss claudia up to the rooftop garden the nurse warned me that miss claudia was noticeably weaker and vaguer she hadnt been able to go to church this morning and she had slept most of the day on sundays when theres no therapy i like our stroke and dementia patients to have a chance to be outside even if she doesnt seem responsive to you she probably understands more than youd think when you talk to her are you from the social welfare office no im trying to find her nephew lamont for her the head nurse patted my hand thats good of you real good she talks about him all the time at least as much as i can make out from what shes saying the garden turned out to be a dozen or so trees in pots enclosed by a low wooden fence the manor had done what they could within their budget limits window boxes with flowers and some vegetables hanging from the fence big umbrellas making the space look almost gay a place to get drinks and in one corner and under a canopy a television set tuned to the white sox game a couple of women were working over the tomatoes and peppers in one of the window boxes another group was clustered around a kitten each trying to get the animal to come to her the aide who was escorting me to miss claudia explained that they brought in different animals for therapy the kitten will live here but we have to be careful these old ladies theyre all so lonely they get in terrible fights over whose turn it is to have kitty in her room at night so we have to say kitty lives with pastor karen its easier to bring in the therapy dogs because they understand that the dogs have to live on the outside miss claudia was in a shady corner dozing in a wheelchair with her sister knitting nearby even allowing for claudias poor health the two women looked as unalike as two sisters could miss ella tall narrow pressed and ironed the younger sister rounder softer although she was wasted by illness miss claudias face was still plump beneath her gray afro and you could see smile creases at her left eye her good eye when the aide bent to gently shake miss claudia awake miss ella frowned at me in awful majesty my sister is very poorly today you should have called before coming along like this to bother her i know shes doing poorly i said trying to remember not to give way to my quick temper i dont want to lose the chance to talk to her altogether thats all the aide was speaking loudly and brightly to miss claudia as one might offer a treat to a toddler telling her she had a visitor lets wake up from our nice nap a big bible its red leather faded to russet along the edges where shed held it all these years dropped from miss claudias lap to the ground cardboard markers inscribed with verses scattered around her chair ible miss claudia cried fall no i bent to pick it all up for her and i tucked the markers into the front of the bible the covers were thick and lumpy as if the book had suffered from the damp youre always dropping that big thing miss ella said roughly why dont you leave it in the apartment and keep a small one with you that you can hang on to no tears oozed out of miss claudias left eye keep with me always i pulled a chair up next to her left side and placed the bible in her lap where she could touch it miss claudia im v i warshawskivic im the detective whos looking for lamont tive she said turning her head to me and getting the syllable out with difficulty yes shes the detective miss ella said loudly shes the lady thats taking our money and not finding lamont for us so maybe if she tells you why she cant find him youll let go of this idea i took claudias left hand and held it lightly between my own two as slowly and clearly as i could i explained who id talked to and what id learned or hadnt learned about her nephew she seemed to be following me at least following some of it interjecting a syllable here and there that sounded like the names i was reciting ive been looking for steve sawyer i said he was lamonts friend they were together the night lamont left your home miss claudia frowned not teve you dont want a detective youd like me to stop looking she shook her head no no you look find mont talk bad teve ssstuheve not name miss ella smiled grimly at my confusion she thinks his name isnt steve but of course it is what is it i asked miss claudia no member not teve the aide brought over a glass of apple juice and i held it for miss claudia to drink will rose know his name miss claudia smiled gratefully on the left side of her face as ose love mont yes rose hebert had loved lamont do you know any of lamonts other friends claudia slowly shook her head i let her rest for a minute or two then asked if she remembered harmony newsome claudias good eye brightened and she struggled to tell me about harmony and the neighborhood i couldnt make out much of her garbled syllables except that harmonys father had been a lawyer i think miss claudia was telling me he had money he could afford to send harmony to college but i wasnt sure when i got to harmonys death and reminded miss claudia that steve sawyer had been convicted of her murder i brought up what george dornick had said do you think lamont told the police that steve sawyer killed harmony newsome not mont no teve friend baby school friend mont good boy not hell good boy tears leaked from her good eye again see what youve done miss ella said with a kind of grim satisfaction my sister cant help you you need to leave miss detective and stop bothering us before i could voice my angershe hired me it wasnt my idea to ride out to stateville or get insulted by curtis rivers in the last few weeksmiss claudia said no ella find mont you she tapped my hand with her own good one mont conda not friend johnny yes conda not leave give she stumbled over the word and finally picked up the bible and showed it to me the markers fell out again mont ella give mont ible he give me leave see johnny he say keep keep safe keep safe she squeezed her eyes shut and struggled to speak i keep mont come i give the night he left home he told you he was going to see johnny es she managed to say then he gave you his bible and told you to keep it safe for him that he would take it back from you when he came home again i translated she smiled in relief that i had understood her but didnt try to speak again i picked up the markers and tucked them into the bible before i gave it back i turned the wellworn pages looking to see if lamont had left anything ill do my best for you miss claudia i promised she squeezed my fingers again with her weak left hand when she smiled i could see what a beautiful woman shed been before her stroke miss ella was frowning more deeply than ever but i felt better about the case when i left not because i had any better ideas but because i understood now how much it meant to miss claudia that i find her nephew i felt a little less optimistic after talking to rose hebert that night she didnt know what miss claudia meant that steve sawyer wasnt lamonts friends name of course his name was steve maybe he called himself steven to be formal but i dont know what else miss claudia had in mind fire in the nunnery at six monday evening i rang the bell to sister frankies apartment on the fringes of uptown she lived in a square box the kind of characterless building that went up in the sixties with metalframed windows set level against the tan brick walls so that you didnt even have a ledge to hold a window box the mighty waters freedom center had offices on the ground floor the rest of the building seemed to be private apartments some with nuns f kerrigan op and c zabinska bvm for instance from the other names and the discarded toys i could see in the entryway it seemed that a number of families lived here too the building sat flush with the walk without even a token patch of grass in front no one looking at the cracks in the bricks or the open windows where fans tried to stir an evening breeze to life would accuse the sisters of violating any vows of poverty after a minute i rang the bell again the lock would have been easy to undo with a credit card but i leaned against the door and watched the street while i waited someone had opened a hydrant on the far corner and kids mostly boys were racing in and out of the jet of water couples embraced at bus stops or in alcoves a woman whose matchstick legs stuck out in front of her like raggedy anns was sitting on the bus stop bench beating her thigh with a shaky fist muttering you cant tell me that you cant tell me that in the alley kids were lighting firecrackers the fourth was only a week away it had been a full day and if i hadnt been so impatient to hear what sister frances could remember of her day in marquette park forty years ago i would have gone home for an early supper and bed karen lennon had called around noon to thank me for visiting miss claudia miss ella is angry but im glad you didnt wait for me to give the green light miss claudia feels much more at peace now i think shes ready to die knowing that you are committed to finding her nephew that statement had alarmed me i realized miss claudia was frail when i saw her but i hadnt been imagining her as close to death lennon tried to reassure me the doctor says shes stable but with strokes that can change rapidly too but after meeting you and feeling reassured that youre taking her seriously that could make her feel less stress so it could help her get stronger when we hung up i felt a renewed stab of urgency in the search for lamont but i didnt know what i could be doing with a sort of helplessness i put in a second request to see johnny merton out in stateville perhaps by the time the visit came through i could think of some quid pro quo that would make the head snake speak to me parseltongue thats what i need i murmured out loud as i brushed my teeth a language for communicating with snakes the door suddenly opened behind me detective im frankie kerrigan sorry to keep you waiting we were having a short meeting on our iowa refugees frankie kerrigan was a thin wiry woman around seventy with curly gray hair that had once been red her face and arms were freckled and sunburned she wore a tshirt and jeans her only badge of office was a plain wooden cross on a thin chain she seemed to realize i was searching her for signs of nunness because she flashed a smile and said when i have to talk to a judge i put on a veil and a skirt but here at home i get to wear jeans come on up detective i followed her into the hall you know im a private investigator right not a cop yes i remember that i didnt know how you like to be addressed most people call me vic the hallway was a jumble of strollers and bicycles like any urban building unlike most the halls and stairwell were scrubbed clean i could smell the disinfectant as i trotted up the stairs after her the virgin of guadalupe sat in a niche at the turn in the landing at the top of the first flight a weeping jesus looked at me from a foothigh cross how was iowa i asked while she unlocked her own front door depressing five hundred families broken up by these ridiculous raids women and children left homeless the business that employed them shut down for loss of workers were doing our best but the judicial atmosphere these days is so punitive our best is pretty futile she ushered me into a front room that was furnished simply but with warmth bright throws on the daybed and two chairs bookcases built of a light wood and filled floor to ceiling a small fan sat in one open window in the other window shed built a shelf to hold a plant erful of red and orange flowers she brought teahot tea is the best thing to drink in hot weather ive always believedbut didnt waste time with other preliminaries i cant tell you how happy i am that someone is revisiting harmonys murder she was an amazing young woman i met her when i went to atlanta to work with ella baker and harmony was one of the sncc volunteers there she was a student at spelman but she was from chicago and came back here at the end of the spring semester to do organizing shed already been arrested three times in the south during sitins and trying to register voters that gave her a kind of glamour and credibility with young people in her neighborhood she picked up a photograph from a small desk i found this after you called last week harmonys mother gave it to me after the funeral and when we started the freedom center we named it in harmonys honor after her favorite bible verse the old eightbyten showed the young woman whose face id seen in the heraldstar story but more alert more attractive than in the old file photo she was standing next to sncc founder ella baker both women were smiling but with a kind of fundamental seriousness that made you feel the importance of their mission the picture had been inscribed let justice pour down like waters i handed back the picture i hope you realize that im not revisiting her death but trying to find steve sawyer the man who was convicted of killing her you said on the phone you hadnt been happy with the verdict no i wasnt and i did try to go to the police when i learned about the arrest sister frankie frowned over her teacup you see harmony and i were marching next to each other when she suddenly collapsed i thought at first it was the heat you have to understand the noise was so intense and the heat and the hate we couldnt hear each other let alone any individual voices from the mob but all the young men from the neighborhood all those gangbangers they were clustered around the leadershipdr king al raby and so onnear the front of the march she flashed a wry smile we women were at the back women and children last you know when it comes to public action or recognition harmony got hit from the side at the moment it was so shocking i couldnt think at all let alone analyze what happened or even think about looking for a killer later though after the funeral after the horror of the march and harmonys death subsided a little i started thinking it over the missile had to have come out of the mob out of the crowd surging around us all the gang members were up front you see around dr king and al raby the person who killed her was at the side and that meant it couldnt have been a black person the mob would have murdered any black man if hed been in their midst i felt let down id been pinning my hopes on something substantial an explicit identification so you didnt see who hit her she shook her head i offered to testify at the trial but steve sawyers attorney wouldnt put me on the witness list i tried to insist but my bishop called me and told me i was out of line the cardinal was trying to calm passions in the city and there i was stirring them up she smiled sadly nowadays that wouldnt stop me but then i was only twentysix and i didnt know how far i could go before the hierarchy would stop me what was it you thought you could add your opinion about where the gang members were standing relative to you and harmony no it was something else one of the boys had a camera he was taking pictures of us and i hoped a loud bang cut her off midsentence a rifle report an m glass splintered and jangled a large starfishshaped break now in the window over the flowers sister frankie sprang to her feet as a bottle filled with liquid sailed through the break the telltale rag in its mouth get down get down i screamed she was bending down to pick up the bottle when a second bottle flew in it hit her in the head and burst into flames i grabbed the throw from the daybed and flung it and myself on her wrapping her up rolling her along the floor i heard a third bottle land and then screams from the street car tires screeching and above it all the hissing of fire the snapping of flames as fire grabbed books bookcases my own jacket choking on smoke and gasoline fumes i rolled myself on top of sister frankie trying to put out the fire licking at the arms of my jacket nun throw detectivean ungainly bundlerolling to the door i stuck up a quickly blistering arm fumbled for the knob tumbled into the hall alphabet visitors fbi oem hs cpd it was the dead of night and my father was still out on patrol still facing rioters someplace in the midnight city people were throwing molotov cocktails at him i could see the bottles flying at his head and i cried out trying to warn him which was stupid because he was miles away and couldnt hear me my mother mustnt know i was frightened it only made her worries harder when she had to comfort me as well as herself our house was never truly dark flares from the mills created a ghostly light even at two in the morning and the sky always yellow from the sulfur vapors gleamed dully all night long light seeped through the curtains and made my eyes hurt my arms ached and my throat was sore i had the flu and somewhere in the background my mother was talking a doctor had come to the house and was asking me how i felt im fine i couldnt complain about being sick not with papà out fighting a riot whats your name the doctor wanted to know victoria i croaked obediently who is the president the doctor asked i couldnt remember who the president was and i started to panic is this school is this a test youre in the hospital victoria do you remember coming to the hospital it was a womans voice not my mother but someone i knew i struggled to come up with her name lotty yes liebchen relief flooded her voice lotty youre in my hospital beth israel i whispered i cant see weve bandaged your eyes to protect them from light for a few days you got a bit scorched fire the molotov cocktails hadnt been flung at my dad but at sister frankie the nun is she how is she shes in intensive care right now you saved her life lottys voice quavered my arms hurt they were burned but you got medical help fast and there are only a few patches where the underlayer of skin was compromised youll be fine in a few days now i want you to rest a man was speaking in the background loud demanding that i answer questions lotty answered in the voice that made max bow and call her eure hoheit your highness in german the surgeon as princess of austria telling the man that i would answer no official questions until she was sure i wasnt still in shock lotty was protecting me i could rest i could relax and be safe i drifted off to sleep riding on a field of violets a sabertoothed tiger prowled through the violets i crouched low but it smelled me my flesh was burned i smelled like steak on mr contrerass grill i tried to scream but my throat was swollen and no sound came out i struggled back to consciousness and lay panting in the dark i felt my hands they were wrapped in gauze and the pressure was painful because they were still swollen i tentatively felt my blistered eyelids they too were padded in gauze a nurse came in and asked me to rate my pain on a scale of one to ten ive hurt worse i think i whispered maybe a nine is it day or night its afternoon youve slept for five hours and i can give you some more pain medication now how is the nun how is sister frankie i could feel her moving near me i dont know i just came on shift the doctor will tell be able to tell you dr herschel i asked but i was already drifting back to the fractured lines and colors of morphic sleep a baseball sat on the kitchen table rocking back and forth from a passing freight train that shook the house it was christmas and papà had gone to the ballpark without telling me he and mama and a strange man had been arguing in the middle of the night their loud voices waking me up i cant do it papà shouted and then mama heard me on the stairs and called to me in italian to go back to bed the mens voices dropped to whispers until the man shouted im tired of you preaching to me warshawski youre not the cardinal let alone a saint so get off your plastic crucifix the front door slammed and the baseball started to roll off the table it was a cannonball now and rolling toward my head its fuse blowing sparks and i woke again to darkness drenched in sweat i fumbled on the nightstand for water there was a pitcher and a cup and as i poured i spilled water on myself but that felt good someone came in with a cup of broth it was strangely hard to find my mouth with my eyes bandaged as if loss of sight meant loss of balance loss of feeling a nurse arrived to take my temperature and ask me my pain level im crappy i rasped but no more morphine i cant take the dreams i wanted to wash my hair but that was out of the question until the bandages came off the nurse sent in someone to sponge me off and i dozed fitfully until lotty arrived the police want to question you victoria i see youve discontinued your morphine how much pain are you in enough to make me know i was in a fire but not so much i want to scream about it how is sister frankie lotty put a hand on my shoulder thats why they want to talk you vic she didnt make it no i whispered no sister frankie had marched with ella baker at selma she stood with king in marquette park she sat with men on death row she housed guatemalan asylum seekers and testified for immigrants no harm came to her until she talked to me lotty offered me vicodin or percocet to help me through the interview but i welcomed the pain in my arms and the burning in my eyes where my useless tears leaked out by some fluke i was alive when i should also be dead v i warshawski death dealer the least that should happen was that i feel a little pain i could sense bodies filling the room two men from bomb and arson identified themselves but i could tell there were others and i demanded to know who was with them there was a shuffling of feet and muttering and then they went around the room giving their names i didnt recognize any of them a man and a woman from the office of emergency management our local branch of homeland security tagged along a field agent from the fbi lotty had cranked up the bed so that i was more or less sitting i had my arms in front of me on the sheet the iv tube going up to the bag that was giving me antibiotics and fluids swung against my shoulder my little plastic friend and lotty my team against the police the bureau and homeland security the bomb and arson men announced that they were taping the session one of them asked if i was ready to make a statement im ready to answer questions but not to make a formal statement not until i can see well enough to read any document you ask me to sign one of the group i think the man from oem was wearing a kind of musky aftershave that made me feel sick to my stomach the cpds bomb and arson team was leading the inquiry it was one of them who had me state my name for the record v i warshawski as i spelled warshawski i remembered petras a warrior in a rickshaw on a ski and had that horrible impulse to laugh that seizes us at moments of grief and fear what were you doing at sister francess apartment a member of the bomb team asked we were meeting to discuss a fortyyearold murder a murmur went through the room and the woman from oem asked whose murder harmony newsome sister frankiesister franceshad been with ms newsome when she died why are you interested in this old murder vicki is it vicki it isnt i said you may call me ms warshawski there was a shifting and more muttering and the temperature in the room went up a few degrees good why should i be the only one feeling burned why are you interested in this old murder the fbis lyle torgeson asked im not very i started to explain my search for lamont gadsden and suddenly felt so tired that i thought i might go to sleep midsentence it seemed to me that i had been looking for lamont gadsden and steve sawyer my whole life why did you go to sister francess apartment torgeson again that was where she asked to meet me i said she wanted to talk to me she said shed been troubled for forty years by the verdict against steve sawyer and why was that said one of the detectives truculent we in the chicago police department do not bring innocent people into court i dont know we got three sentences out before the bombs fell what did she say torgeson asked she said iowa was depressing we were warned that you think youre funny the man from oem said but this isnt the time or place do i look to you like someone in the throes of merriment i said im in pain im in shock and i would love to think youve got a really active crime scene unit going over every square inch of the freedom center and the sisters building im also mildly curious about why the oem and the fbi are here do you think a terrorist was after sister frankie a sucking in of breath and another buzz around the interrogation circle anytime someone starts throwing bombs around were curious torgeson finally said as a citizen you have an obligation to help us in our investigation as a human being i am deeply grieved that sister frankie died and that i couldnt do anything to keep that from happening so tell us as a human being what sister frankie said torgesons voice was heavy with sarcasm sister frankie said iowa was depressing shed just come back from trying to help the families of the people your buddies in ins scooped up and arrested for the crime of working in a meatpacking plant she said it was oh i get it i leaned back against the eggcarton hospital mattress sister frankie was helping people who were in this country illegally thats why youre all here panting like badly trained bloodhounds lottys fingers gripped my shoulder steady there vic keep your temper under control do you think her death is connected to her work in iowa i said were asking the questions this afternoon warshawski that was the woman from oem determined to be as tough as the men around her i smiled tightly so you do think her death is connected to her work in iowa we dont know torgeson said we dont know if sister frances was the target or another member of the freedom center it might even have been you youve made yourself plenty unpopular with some people in this town the accusation was so ruthless so unsettling that i almost missed the woman from oem saying we thought the target could also be one of the families who live in the building some are illegals some are dealing drugs you know a lot about them i said fast work its an amazing thing about lack of sight you feel peoples emotions more than when you can see them i could feel torgeson withdraw into himself as if a glass wall had slipped between him and the room you know about them because youve had the freedom center women under surveillance i said youve been watching them tapping their phones america is facing international terror threats and youre following a bunch of nuns we are not at liberty to discuss our actions nor are we required to do so the oem woman snapped i ignored her youre dogging the sisters and you couldnt stop a fire bombing we moved as fast as we could torgeson protested we were undercover it didnt look like a serious attack at first not until we saw the flames in the windows what in the name of sweet fanny adams did you think it was i cried the room became completely quiet i could hear the hospital noises the pages the squeaking of rubber soles on worn linoleum one of the bomb men cleared his throat tell us what happened inside the apartment i shook my head exhausted we heard the window break for five seconds i thought it was street noise kids had been setting off firecrackers in the alley i thought it was an m that had misfired behind my bandages i shut my eyes trying to remember the few minutes id spent with sister frankie then i saw a bottle come in through the window i saw the rag i knew it was a fire bomb i screamed at sister frances to get down but she went to pick it up and then another one came through and and she was on fire with my eyes shut i could see the flames engulf her wiry hair her skin turn white beneath the yellow flames i was shaking and heaving and lotty was telling everyone they had to leave we need to know what sister frances told warshawski here about harmony newsome you are in my hospital by my sufferance only lotty said coldly i have told you the time has come for you to leave and you will leave doctor you may mean well the woman from oem said but we have powers here from the department of homeland security that means we talk to warshawski until were ready to leave i could smell lottys fury i felt my plastic tube move and suddenly i had slid out of the room down the waterslide at wolf lake with boomboom yelling my name he was trying to dunk me in the lake but gabriella pulled him away from me and i started to breathe again and now murray thanks to whatever lotty injected into my iv i slept the clock around when i woke the pain in my arms and eyes had subsided to a manageable throb when a volunteer came in to help me with some kind of liquid goop that id been cleared to consume i asked if shed also help me with the phone i called mr contreras first he had seen the story on the news but the hospital was blocking my calls he said he had called lotty who reassured him but it was still a relief to him to hear from me in person dont worry about the dogs none doll on account of i got that service you used when you was in italy to come around and peeweehis nickname for my cousinshes been rallying around she took mitch into work with her this morning and last night she went up to your place to get the sheets changed and everything and even bought you yogurt so youll be comfy when they let you out that was reassuring sort of after the business with my trunk it made me tense to think of my cousin wandering around my apartment maybe shed collected the nellie fox ball and hoped with her usual optimism that i wouldnt notice it was gone then theres that nice fella who just moved in the musician hes been helping with the dogs too mr contreras added but murray ryerson hes been around him and some other reporters i told him he should be ashamed acting like a hyena following after the lions picking up the food they did all the work finding mr contreras has never been crazy about any of the men in my life but for some reason he actively dislikes murray i deflected the complaint as best i could and patiently answered his questions i even took his rough words of comfort in stride i wasnt to blame myself nuns who went around working for terrorists knew they were taking risks it wasnt my fault someone had firebombed her the night i chose to visit after he and i finished i got the volunteer to dial my office so that i could speak with marilyn the temp she was overwhelmed by phone calls it hadnt occurred to me but of course i was a media sensation if it bleeds it leads is the old news bromide and if a nun bleeds it leads for days julian bond had called as had willie barrow and other prominent civil rights veterans immigrant rights activists had held a vigil outside the hospital and two men sister frankie had helped free from death row were staging a hunger strike outside police headquarters demanding action in finding her killers since id been with her when she was murdered i was understandably a person of interest to the tv crews they keep calling and some have been here thinking you were hiding out what should i tell them that it will be a week before im well enough to talk to anyone and they should go away and find blood someplace else we went through the more manageable part of my incoming calls the subcontractor doing surveillance for me in mokena some outstanding reports to clients which i managed to dictate to her and messages to various other clients to tell them id be back in my office within the week and would talk to them then in the afternoon i was wheeled to the ophthalmology department and my eyes were unbandaged although the doctor had the blinds pulled and the overhead lights turned off even the murky gray light made me wince at first i could see nothing but sparkfilled spirals after a few minutes though shapes swam into focus the doctor examined me closely you are very lucky ms warshawski the burns on the lids were not severe and are already healing for the next few weeks youll need to wear dark glasses with photochromic lenses whenever you are outside whether the sun is shining or not and anytime youre in a brightly lit room if you wear glasses you need to get prescription sunglasses to use in front of a computer for the next month or two and stay away from tv and computers altogether for two more days thats a serious order okay he gave me an antibiotic salve to put on and under the lids twice a day and told me it was safe to wash my hair when they brought me back to my room with a pair of those outsize plastic sunglasses they give people after cataract surgery the resident came around to inspect the rest of my body my arms were rough and red id been wearing a linen jacket since id dressed professionally for my meeting and while the fabric had charred it had spared my skin from more severe burns my hands had suffered the worst damage when the dressings came off next week id need to wear cotton gloves anytime i went outside when i finally crept into the bathroom and looked in the mirror i looked sunburned but my face only had a few blisters along the hairline id apparently buried my face in the throw while i tumbled sister frances out of her room which also had saved me from serious burns what made me look bizarre wasnt my shiny red cheeks but the clumps of hair missing from my head i looked like a dog with mange even so i had been staggeringly lucky to escape the full force of the fire if only id pulled sister frankie down instead of screaming at her i could see the bottle hitting her head over and over again every time i closed my eyes the resident had said they would discharge me tomorrow if i continued to hold my own in the meantime they were removing my ivs i could switch to oral antibiotics and actual food you know youve created a kind of media circus at the hospital the resident was a young man and a media circus was clearly a welcome change of pace for him apparently the hospital security staff had found one reporter trying to get into my room while i was asleep that morning they had gotten the city to arrest another man theyd discovered at one of the nursingstation computers calling up sister frankies and my charts we put a block on incoming calls to your room the switchboard says theyve clocked a hundred seventeen calls i hadnt thought there could be a plus to a hospital stay but missing a hundred seventeen media calls proved me wrong when the doctor finally remembered he had other beds to visit i put on plastic mitts to protect my hands and took a shower in the little bathroom i felt better physically but exhaustion medication and depression made me go back to the bed in a sort of numb lethargy i put on my heavy glasses and lay half dozing someone brought a species of lunch i begged for coffee thinking caffeine might lift some of the fog in my brain the attendant said it wasnt on my diet and i lay back down nauseated by the wobbly red jello on the tray by and by i thought of my clothes my wallet had been in my handbag and that was probably melted into the remains of sister francess home but i often stuff loose bills into my pockets i found eleven dollars and thirteen cents in my smoky clothes my cellphone was there too but the battery was dead i pulled my lario boots onto my bare feet and put on my torn and charred linen jacket i looked in the little mirror in the bathroom between the costume my clumpy hair and the outsize glasses i looked like i belonged on the uptown streets outside the hospital collecting cigarette butts i made it down the hall on wobbly legs two days in bed with no food and a lot of shock had atrophied my muscles a hospital security guard at the nursing station looked at me curiously but didnt try to stop me i rode down to the firstfloor lobby hospitals have realized that the cash register chings louder if they install an espresso machine they dont study how to make it good figuring a clientele under stress will drink anything i wasnt in a position to be picky either i ordered a triple espresso from an attendant who taking in my costume and my mangy head asked to be paid first while he pulled my shots i looked across the lobby to the front of the building the media circus had shut down most of its rings with only one camera truck still there as i squinted through my glasses i could just make out a couple of people with picket signsthe immigrant rights activists perhaps or maybe a striking local or even abortion protestors the lenses were too opaque for me to be able to read the signs themselves my hands were so thickly wrapped that i had to hold the cup with my fingertips and i had trouble opening the sugar packets i finally tore them with my teeth spraying sugar over myself and the floor before managing to get some in my coffee i was heading for the elevators when i spotted my old pal murray ryerson from the heraldstar at the reception desk he was collecting a visitors pass and grinning with satisfaction at the clerk so much for the lockdown on reporters i felt vulnerable and exposed with no underwear under a shabby hospital gown only my smoky jacket keeping my breasts and buttocks from public view i retreated into a chair behind a potted plant and watched until murray was inside an elevator as i waited beth blacksin from global entertainment went up to the reception desk and started gesticulating in indignation pointing at the elevator so murray had scammed his way in a hospital security guard joined beth hospitals have a million exits and stairwells i left the coffee shop by the far end and went into the first stairwell i came to one flight and i felt as though id been sandbagged my legs wobbling my head dizzy i leaned against the wall and drank some of my coffee it was bitterthey hadnt cleaned the machine heads anytime recentlybut the caffeine steadied me a doctor came running down the stairs but paused when he saw me do you belong here i held out my wrist with my plastic patient tag looped above my gauze hands i got turned around when i went downstairs for coffee he read my tag your room is on the fifth floor youd better take an elevator im not sure you should be up and about at all definitely not climbing five flights of stairs he opened the door to the first floor and held it while i walked past him i can call for a wheelchair no the nurses told me i needed to start walking ill be okay he was in a hurry and didnt stay to argue with me i looked at my tag sure enough it had my room number on it that was a mercy i hadnt bothered to check it when i left i found a secondary elevator bank and saw a sign for the hospital library carrying my coffee in my fingertips i walked past the orthopedic outpatient clinic and respiratory diseases and came to the library to my relief this was merely a room filled with donated books mostly unread review copies with publicists letters still inside the front covers no staff were present to question whether a person in heavy dark glasses and no underwear ought to be there i turned out the overhead lights and curled up in an armchair time to stop feeling sorry for myself and guilty about sister frankie time to think to work the feds had been watching sister francess apartment and hadnt intervened in the attack on her did that mean they wanted her dead or had they been out getting pizza and not noticed whoever threw the molotov cocktails the coffee helped but not enough to get my muzzy brain fully functioning i uncoiled myself from the armchair and took some of the publicity letters out of the books scrabbling in the drawers of a little desk i found an old pencil stub it would have to do i couldnt see well enough to write and the pencil stub was too blunt for cursive so i used block letters feds watching frankie why lamont gadsden snitch true what in bottlespro or streetgrade accelerant who would tell me any of these things there was something else too another important question nagging the back of my mind i took off my boots tucked my legs under me and let my mind drift i dozed and woke and dozed but it was lottys anger that kept coming to the surface it couldnt be about lotty it must be the law enforcement people she sent about their business yesterday they had asked something odd i stuffed the paper into my jacket pocket and bent to pull my boots on when i stood i had to clutch the chair to keep from falling over it was infuriating to be so weak i needed to be out on the streets talking to people not so shaky that a walk down a hospital corridor did me in i made my unsteady way back to my room i had just sunk down on my eggcarton mattress when a nurse looked in where have you been weve been looking all over the hospital for you didnt you hear us page you sorry i was testing my legs and got so tired i fell asleep in a chair i didnt hear anything she took my temperature and felt my pulse and disappeared to spread the good news that i was back as soon as she was gone the bathroom door opened and murray came out well well warshawski they were telling the truth youre not dead yet ryerson get the fuck out of my hospital room i was startled into fury oh those sweet words he grinned and peered at me you know you do look pretty strange if you dont mind my saying so i do mind i survived a fire it was extremely unpleasant now leave after you talk to me my fireeating private eye ill talk to you if you do something for me he bowed low over his tape recorder as you command o queen so shall it be done i need some clothes i cant wear these and my wallet and credit cards and whatnot are all at the sisters apartment murray sat up im not going to your place you know the old guy hates me hed sic that hellhound of yours on me and id be fish food before i could explain why i was rummaging in your closet buy me something then jeans a longsleeved white shirt and a bra thats all i need a bra you mean like brassiere ixnay murray you were wearing a twentysomething blonde at krumass fundraiser you cant tell me you blush and get prickly heat in a lingerie department size c and size shirt long jeans you record all that for posterity okay murray scowled i got it now what were you doing at sister frances kerrigans home to get her killed i sat up in bed and looked at my arms somehow i dont seem to have a shirt on before we talk do you know what it took to get in here i had to find the name of a patient and pretend to be visiting her and then i had to skulk around until i could get at a computer and hack in to find your room number they wont let me back in im not leaving until you talk yeah i figured youd welsh on your end of the deal but dont worry your perfectly groomed head mr contreras will be glad to bring me some clothes he loves me most when im on the dl i closed my eyes behind my dark lenses and leaned back against the pillows oh damn you you manipulative bitch warshawski im going to call the nurse in ten seconds ryerson im not the bottomfeeder who hacked into a hospital computer system youre the bottomfeeder who got a nun fried i sat up and pulled off my shades you put that out anywherein print on a blog in a text messageand you will spend the rest of your life defending a libel action do you hear me there was an uneasy silence between us before murray said you were there when she was attacked i ignored him and to speak in such language about sister francess death she worked her whole life for social justice and civil liberties and you think you can talk about her death like a chris matthews gag line do you know what its like to hold someone whose head is on fire burning on top her body like the wick on a candle get out of here im sorry vi okay we all spend too much time trying to think of the next clever cynical thing to say that was tasteless and thoughtless i apologize he pulled out his cellphone in contravention of all the posted signs and called someone to buy me clothes he even gave his gofer a creditcard number and told her to deliver them to the hospital i put my shades back on the dim light in the room was making my eyes hurt and besides id started crying which i didnt want murray to see what are your sources saying i asked after a moment do they think she was attacked because of her immigrant work were not getting anything off the street about that murray admitted the nun in charge of the freedom center a sister carolyn zabinska says they got death threats back when the iraq war startedthe nuns were opposed to it and started these weekly vigils against itbut no ones ever threatened them because of their prison or immigrantaid work he paused people are wondering why she was attacked the very night you visited her i lay very still in the bed eyes closed what people besides you of course just what i hear around murray said ever since global bought the star youve been more on the entertainment side than the crime beat i said still angry wanting to prick him as he had me so who you hear from doesnt carry the punch it used to when have i ever skimped on a story warshawski murray was furious now too you on your pedestal its easy to work solo as an investigator but i have to work for a company if i want to write for a newspaper and my sources trust me i looked at my wrapped hands and wished i worked for a big company where someone would pick up the slack when i was on the disabled list so what are your sources telling you about the perps lawrence avenue was hopping when i rang sister frankies bell they all suffer from witnessphobic amnesia i couldnt see his face through my lenses in the darkened room but murray was still breathing hard he didnt speak for a long moment but despite my nasty accusation he was a reporter through and through he wanted my story and knew he had to answer some questions if i was going to talk there are a ton of witnesses to the perps a ford expedition drove up at high speed honking everyone jumped out of the way and the expedition pulled up onto the sidewalk a guyor maybe a gal but theyre pretty sure a guywith a stocking pulled over his head got out threw the bottles jumped back in and the expedition took off before anyone really realized what was happening license plate no one bothered or they know and arent telling ive heard both stories murray said one of my sources says the boys in the alley recognized the suv and are afraid to admit it for fear of being targeted next someone who will fire bomb a nun will pretty much do anything i was quiet for a moment digesting that the fbi and oem had a stakeout going any news out of them yeah the news that the first amendment is doa we have to clear anything we print through them turds and sos my editor bitch just nodded and blinked and said the rules have changed and we need to follow them if were going to bring people the news his words brought my own police interrogation back to me that was the question nagging at me the woman from emergency management wanting to know what sister frances had told me about harmony newsome i lay back against the mattress feeling sick again oem already knew about harmony newsome when they talked to me in halting words i explained why id been at the freedom center the old murder the search for lamont and the fact that oem already knew about my interest in harmony newsome before their investigator talked to me is that because they were monitoring sister frankies calls i finished or mine or both murray if she died because i was there hey hey wonder woman dont get all weepy now murray protested i couldnt help it the doubts that had nagged me all summer about my personality why i couldnt keep a relationship alive did i bring destruction to everyone around me in the fired house lotty sailed into my room just then followed by two of the residents and a medical student lotty sent murray out of the room with a comment that stung like the snap of a whip i fumbled for tissues on the cart next to me lotty found the box but warned me not to rub my eyes how did ryerson get in here at all she demanded what is going on in this hospital that i give a specific order only to have it overridden i have expressly forbidden any visitors in your room to make sure neither reporters nor police harass you you didnt invite murray in did you she had two fingers on the pulse in my neck this is why you cant have visitors youre vulnerable you shouldnt be crying like this and they tell me you disappeared this afternoon while i was in surgery was that to organize this rendezvous i went down to the coffee shop for an espresso and the trip did me in i fell asleep in a chair and didnt know people were paging me i didnt like lying to lotty but it was sort of the truth i wondered if she was right though i wondered if id wanted to see murray i could have reported him to hospital security when i spotted him in the lobby but i didnt maybe my unconscious brain was hoping hed track me down lotty grunted and asked the residents to update her on my progress while the medical student stood respectfully to one side the two residents reviewed the damage to my corneas and optic nerves i felt a stab of frustration followed by a bigger stab of guilt i was alive i would recover maybe while i was on the dl i could train myself to sleep days and work nights im thinking of bringing you home with me when they discharge you tomorrow lotty sounded like she was adopting a dog that had been returned to the pound too many times by people it bit im worried about your health and im worried about your safety my safety murray was saying that some sources think the bombers were after me not sister frances have you heard the same thing lotty dismissed the residents and the student and sat on the edge of the bed frowning i was thinking more about your recklessness does he have any proof i dont know you booted him out before i could get him to come clean i wouldnt even be worrying about it if the woman from homeland security hadnt pressed me on what sister frances told me about the newsome inquiry i looked at lottys dim outline lotty i cant go home with you if im a target of fire bombers i cant risk you being hurt youd be safer at my place than in your own home we have a doorman we have security youre completely exposed in your building and if someone threw another fire bomb those children on the second floor would be hurt im so helpless i burst out to save my eyes and skin i have to sit in the dark i need to be out talking to people i need to be at my computer looking up data what am i going to do lotty put an arm around me does everything have to happen today in a few days youll be able to get around as long as youre careful about the sun you know how it is when youre in the hospital you feel more helpless there than after you get out she stayed until a supper tray arrived at six and insisted on my eating something that might once have been a chicken when she left i tried to sleep since i couldnt read or watch tv instead i kept thrashing around in the narrow bed worrying about my role in sister frankies death a little before eight a volunteer came in with a shopping bag that had been left at the front desk for me murrays gofer had come through with my clothes the bra was a plain white that i wouldnt have chosen for myself but it didnt matter with my bandaged hands i couldnt fasten it anyway i managed the buttons on the shirt and pulled on the jeans the gofer had dutifully brought me a size after two days of living on ivs i could have gotten away with a just being dressed made me feel better i pulled on my soft brown boots again and looked in the bathroom mirror something would have to be done about that hair i looked like a freak show the byproduct of hospitalization is plastic the room was full of bags and trays and specimen cups and bananashaped things for throwing up in i filled a bag with cups made a hump in the bed that might look like a sleeping vi turned out the lights and looked into the hall eight oclock visitors were leaving nurses were handing out meds a crowd to mingle with auspicious you know the old movie where humphrey bogart has been sandbagged and pumped full of drugs and even though his head is spinning he gets up and goes after serious bad guys ive always thought it was really stupid and unrealistic i was right i tried to stride confidently despite my freaky hair and the big plastic glasses but like bogie in the long goodbye i saw the hall spin around me i had to clutch the wall to keep from falling over not so auspicious when i reached the front lobby i was sweating and lightheaded the hospital was a bit over two miles from the building where sister frankie had lived normally i could have walked it but i was nowhere near normal i still had eight dollars not enough for a taxi but it would get me there and back on the bus i wobbled my way two blocks north to a lawrence avenue bus stop murray had unsettled me i kept stopping not just because i was unsteady but to see if i had company whether cops or robbers if i really had been the fire bombers target i was hoping they were monitoring me so closely that they knew i was still in the hospital tonight might be my one chance to go back to the freedom center apartments without anyone knowing one thing about the uptown neighborhood women with weird hair who have trouble staying upright are a dime a dozen two women just like me stooping to scoop up cigarette butts in the midst of a ferocious shouting match passed while i waited for the bus no one gave any of us a second glance a bus lumbered up to the stop i fed two of my crumpled bills into the money maw awkwardly because of my gauzy mitts and slumped back onto one of the seats set aside for the disabled and elderly i felt disconnected from the world around me and when we got to the kedzie stop i had to coach myself on how to walk down the steps my car was parked on kedzie but my keys had been in the handbag id dropped in sister frankies apartment i walked up kedzie to see if i could get into my mustangi have picklocks in the glove compartmentbut of course id locked all the doors however the city hadnt forgotten me three tickets for meter violations were stuffed under the wipers i ground my teeth but left the tickets i couldnt do anything about them tonight it was easy to spot sister frankies apartment from the street the windows were boarded over and the brick and concrete around the frames were charred black lights showed through open windows on some of the upper floors though meaning the fire had been contained quickly enough for the buildings wiring and plumbing to be usable that was one mercy that others hadnt been injured in or made homeless by the blast it also meant the federal morons watching the building hadnt stopped the fire department from doing their job the street was full as it had been three nights ago with kids and shoppers and lovers and drunks people stared at me the building was a stage and i was a new actor on it but i couldnt help that i took off my plastic dark glasses the sun had set the streetlamps were on and the city was bathed in the haze of midsummer twilight surely that wouldnt hurt my eyes i pushed the gauze back on my right hand exposing my thumb and my forefinger and used the edge of the glasses to push in the tongue on the front door as id thought the other night it was a simple lock to undo i hoped if oem was watching they wouldnt come after me the stairwell smelled like a lab sink a musty sour chemical stench mingled with charred wood and damp i wished for a flashlight the only light coming from a single bulb two stories up i worried about missing steps or tripping on debris but my flashlight was also in my glove compartment the things you can do so easily with money walk to the nearest drugstore buy a flashlight hop a cab buy a new outfit no wonder women who look like me walk down the street shouting their heads off i stopped at the landing in front of the virgin of guadalupe she was barely visible in the dim light i stroked her roughcarved wooden cheeks it would be so wonderful to think she could protect me to believe sister frances was even now clasped to her bosom i crept on up to the second floor and turned right toward sister francess apartment the hall was even darker here because the windows facing the street were boarded over each step was a gamble like walking on a rocky beach in the dark i couldnt tell what i was stumbling across wallboard wires parts of light fixtures i ran my fingertips along the wall to steady myself but lost my footing when the wall disappeared i grabbed at open air and found myself on my knees in the rubble even to my damaged eyes the yellow crime scene tape across sister francess door gleamed dully in the dark i found the knob and turned it unlocked the door was sealed but it gave way to a firm shoulder push inside the apartment the air was so acrid that my eyes started to tear i put my plastic glasses on to protect my eyes then took them off the thick lenses meant i couldnt see anything at all i stepped backward catlike from the heart of the damage sister frances had brought tea in from the kitchen and i was hoping i might find a flashlight in there in the dark there is no sense of distance or space i kept banging into furniture until i found a wall that i could follow step by cautious step i finally found the swinging door that opened into the kitchen it seemed like the gate between normalcy and hell on one side were the charred sodden remains of sister frankies life on the other was an ozzie and harriet set everything clean and tidy the windows werent boarded over and in the lights from the back stairs and the alley streetlamps i could make out the shapes of stove refrigerator cabinets the nuns breakfast cup and bowl were on the counter with a box of cornflakes set out for the morning meal she wouldnt be eating i tried the lights but the power had been turned off to this part of the building i couldnt find a flashlight but i took a spatula and a ladle from a jar by the stove i saw matches and a candle but as my hand hovered over them my whole body shuddered at the idea of more fire moving cautiously back to the front room i could see enough in the ghostly light sifting in from the kitchen doorway to start picking through the debris i wanted to find my handbag but what i really wanted was glass from the molotov cocktail bottles id been in a chair near the door when the barrage had started id put my bag on the floor next to me i squatted on my haunches and shuffled forward my fingers pressed against a damp matted mess it felt like a clump of rotting lettuce but when i forced myself to delve more deeply i realized it was a book the floor was thick with dead books and i shuffled past them on legs that shook with grief as much as fatigue i found a damp revolting mass of styrofoam that might have been the chair cushions and bits of the frame of the chair but i didnt come across my bag however in the middle of the room one of my clumsy hands closed on a piece of glass it took several tries with the spatula to lift the shard from the floor and into the ladle and then into one of the plastic cups in my bag feeling around the area i found bigger pieces the neck of a bottle and a chunk that might have been part of the base i collected these in my makeshift containers as well i had no way of photographing the spot where id found this evidence or labeling the evidence bags which anyway werent certifiable as free from contamination and while this evidence could never be used in court it might tell me something helpful about the assailants i pushed myself to my feet i was spasming up and down my body with fatigue i longed to lie down where i was on the pile of soggy books and give way to exhaustion i groped for a wall to steady myself my mothers face came to me the day she came home from the doctor to tell me there was no hope no treatment no help her dark eyes large against skin turned transparent and luminous with mortality victoria my darling one grief and loss and death theyre part of life on this planet we all mourn but it is selfish to turn mourning into a religion you must promise me that you will embrace life never turn your back on the world because of your private sorrow my grief had come in the loud sobs of adolescence and then in shouting matches with my dazed helpless father your papà is not as strong as you and me carissima he needs your help not your anger dont turn against him now the words had brought no comfort then and brought no comfort now they were a burden a load i had to carry that of needing to be stronger than the strongest person near me sister frances had died i had to be strong enough to look after her in death since id been unable to look after her in life i picked my way backward slogging through books and boards and cushions like an arctic explorer whod never reach the pole i was nearly at the door when i saw a light dance underneath it and dance away i held my breath a phantasm of fatigue it came again a flashlight poking along the jamb oem fbi punks i had nothing to defend myself with except a kitchen spatula and no strength to use it the door opened a tall figure stood there hesitantly playing the flashlight around the room and then turned to look over the shoulder the movement swept the light upward so that it played on the figure revealing spiky hair petra warshawski i said what are you doing here and fire in the old homestead the flashlight clattered to the floor and my cousin screamed as i stooped to pick up the light i thought i heard retreating footfalls i pushed past petra and looked down the hall but didnt see anyone who was that i demanded vic its you she was breathless and frightened i thought you were in the hospital i am what are you doing here and who came with you no one im on my youre not a very convincing liar petra you dont have the guts or experience to come into a burnedout building on your own who was with you one of the guys who works on the campaign with me she muttered he took off when i screamed and i dont want him to get in trouble so dont ask me his name i wont tell you anyway you shouldnt be yelling at me i came here for you did you now i was so weak that i had to lean against the charred wall what noble deed were you doing on my behalf uncle sal told me youd left your wallet and everything here i thought i could find it he said neighborhood punks would break in and help themselves to anything that wasnt nailed down that has the ring of authenticity i said applaudingly i can believe mr contreras would use exactly those words youre doing better why do you have to act like a bully petra demanded why cant you believe me i retrieved her flashlight and swept its beam around the room i believe you go look for my handbag im too exhausted to move but ill hold the light for you she glowered at me but moved gingerly into the room she was wearing her highheeled boots and wobbled on the uneven surface i pointed the light toward the place where i thought id been sitting if its here thats where it should be try each step before you put your full weight on your leg you dont want to go through a burned floorboard she tiptoed over to the remains of the chair and knelt as i had done to feel around its sides this is gross its like dumpster diving what is going on in here a second flashlight suddenly brightened the room i was so tired and so focused on petra i hadnt heard the newcomer in the hall my heart pounded i could hear it in my ears like the ocean roaring this was a recipe for early death personal inattention on this scale who are you and why are you in this apartment you can answer me quickly or talk to the police im v i warshawski i said quietly i was here with sister frances when she was killed and you are sister carolyn zabinska i had heard the name but i was swaying badly and couldnt make sense of anything murray had said hed said i was the real target i blinked trying to clear my head i turned to look at zabinska her flashlight blinded me my knees buckled and i was suddenly on the floor petras flashlight falling from my useless hands i never really lost consciousness but i couldnt summon the strength to speak i heard the nun ask petra who she was i heard petra say i was supposed to be in the hospital but had insisted on coming to the apartment she didnt know why but thought i was hoping my handbag would still be here i struggled to speak i was baffled by my cousins lies was she instinctively trying to save her own skin more footfalls sounded no police i finally gasped but it wasnt police it was two more nuns and between them and my cousin i was half carried half dragged up the stairs to the fourth floor we cant use the elevator until the wiring has been completely tested one of the nuns apologized we went into a clean living room a copy of sister frankies with books and bright throws and a statue of the virgin and i was put in an armchair someone forced hot sweet tea into me and i thought maybe it really was wednesday night again that i was back at sister frankies that the fire my eyes my hands all that had been a nightmare and now i sat up and now i would pull myself together and stop being a tragedy queen i dont have my bag i said i picked up your bag after the fire that was sister carolyns voice it was cold i was a selfish bitch worrying about my private possessions in the middle of a disaster not my handbag my evidence bag i tried to stand but the sisters kept me in the chair sister carolyn squatted so i could see her face evidence i drank down the rest of the tea it made me feel marginally better but it was still hard to be coherent evidence about the fire hard to explain bottle fragments the police should have taken them test for assel acc i was close to tears with frustration at not being able to speak and i remembered sister claudia her tears her garbled english what was in bottles i finally managed to say what difference does it make frankie is dead whether it was gasoline or scotch one of the other nuns cried out matters matters ordinary fuel anyone but i think pros there was silence for a moment then sister carolyn said i know youre exhausted but i need you to explain what youre saying are you saying this was the work of a professional arsonist another sister handed me a second cup of tea laced this time with brandy i choked as i swallowed the alcohol but it did its job giving me the fleeting illusion of clarity the accelerant i think it was some kind of jet fuel something that burned fast and very hot or the books wouldnt have gone so fast and neither would i broke off her head i tried to catch her to wrap her but her head hands were all around me holding me and after another swallow i managed to say i wanted to know two things did the police take the fragments in for analysis i dont think they did or i wouldnt have found such big chunks of broken bottle and if not i want a private lab i use to do an analysis tell me what was used sister carolyn zabinska nodded in understanding and added that she wanted to talk to me about the attack itself she needed to know what happened i was planning on calling on you as i said i found your handbag i tried to see you in the hospital but they have a lockdown on your visitors even nuns but if youve been released she hasnt been petra said she broke out just to come here tonight thats reassuring one of the other sisters said not to be rude but you look like death on a mop handle and i thought this was another sign of our execrable health care system that theyd released you before you were fit yes she needs to be back in bed zabinska said ill collect your evidence bag from frankies if you tell me where to take it ill make sure it gets to your forensics lab but its time your nieceoh cousin is itdrove you to the hospital of course i will petra said but how am i going to get her past the front desk into her bed which hospital one of the sisters asked beth israel i said i have a pass the sister said i work there with the hivaids moms she murmured something to the other two who gave a ripple of laughter i dozed and then came to with a start as i felt them fastening a scarf around my head okay sister vi zabinska said on your feet were going to bring a little succor to the ill and bedridden the three nuns were laughing theyd donned habits i remembered sister frankie saying she wore hers whenever she had to go in front of a judge the nuns helped me to my feet and showed me my face in the bathroom mirror theyd pinned a veil around my face hiding my chopped hair it was startling to see my eyes emerge from a nuns face as if the piece of cloth had changed who i was too wildeyed and drawn to be audrey hepburn in the nuns story maybe kathleen byron in black narcissus zabinska and the sister who worked with the hiv moms each took one of my arms and guided me out the door and down the stairs with petra and the third sister following we were moving slowly because of me and had reached only the top of the third flight when we heard a crash from the floor below us sister carolyn dropped my arm that came from frankies place feet pounded down the hall below us sister carolyn ran down the stairs the hiv sister stayed with me but the other nun ran after sister carolyn and my cousin pelted after her i wanted to lead the charge but i had to grab the banister and move one slow step at a time we reached the turn in the landing in time to see a man running down the stairs followed by the nuns and petra we heard sister carolyn demanding that the man stop and then the front door opened tires squealed a moment later petra and the nuns reappeared someone went into the apartment and made off with your bag zabinska announced how did they know to look for it dont know i shook my head wearily it was hard for me to think feds been watching building you know that maybe them shouldve remembered maybe followed me from hospital thought i was clear but not too clever right now the feds have been watching us the hiv nun echoed how do you know that in hospital told me i was starting to drift we almost had him sister carolyn said he was wearing a stocking cap and i grabbed it instead of his shoulder then he opened the door so hard he hit mary lou in the nose and we got tangled up with each other now im really angry if he was a federal agent hell have some real explaining to do beating up a nun in her own home mary lous nose was bleeding the hiv nun sat her on the stairs and tilted her head back stanching the blood with her own veil other tenants came into the stairwell more nuns families with small children the noise grew to a clamor that i couldnt take in my current state i collapsed on the stair next to mary lou with my plastic dark glasses back over my eyes i need to lie down i was panting sisters go to sister frankies look for bottle fragments bring flashlights bring camera bring clean bag take pictures where you find pick up with glove something clean put in bag seal label now again the sisters murmured among themselves the hiv nun who had the hospital pass would go with me to beth israel sister carolyn and sister mary lou would take care of hunting for more glass fragments petra ran ahead to get her pathfinder while the three nuns got me down the stairs as they helped me into the backseat of the suv sister carolyn handed me my purse youre not what i was expecting when i looked in your billfold and saw that you were a detective thats okay you and your pals werent what i expected when i learned you were nuns she smiled and cupped her hands on my forehead a caress that was a blessing well pray for your speedy recovery when the resident made rounds the next morning he was dismayed to see that id had a setback he ordered me to stay in the hospital an extra day lotty saw that i had fresher bruises on my arms and legs than could have come from the fire but she didnt ask and i didnt tell i walked up and down the hall a dozen times trying to build my stamina but i had to go back to bed afterward which was infuriating that was basically how i spent the day walking and sleeping midafternoon i went downstairs for another espresso when i returned to my room i found conrad rawlings in the visitors chair conrad is a cop weve been friends enemies lovers collaborators off and on for over a decade i was happier to see him than i would have thought possible a few days earlier have you been transferred up here nope still down in your old hood you and fire you cant leave it alone can you the words were harsh but his tone was sympathetic enough to take the sting out of them your eyes going to be okay they tell me i said gruffly i read the report nasty fire that killing a nun and all was there any word about the accelerant i demanded it looked like it had to be rocket or jet fuel it burned so fiercely and so fast he shook his head early days for forensic results but fires are tricky gasoline could get the job done if the perp was lucky you know that so dont go starting a conspiracy theory trying to put cops or the fbi in your sights just because some woman from oem rubbed you the wrong way is that why you came up here i demanded to tell me to pull back from holding the feds accountable damn it conrad theyve been watching the freedom center they could have done something besides watching it all unfold for them on their whoa there ms w im not here on anybodys business but my own i looked at him puzzled nothing id been working on lately involved south chicago but i waited for him to speak make the interrogation come to you dont race out to meet it that was advice id always given my clients in my public defender days and its the hardest advice to follow you and fire ms w he repeated i dont know if it follows you around or you bring it with you he waited for a while but when i still didnt respond he said you were in south chicago last saturday in the trauma and drama of the last few days id forgotten taking my cousin around the south side how nice of you to come all the way up here to tell me he smiled briefly not warmly you stopped at a house on ninetysecond and houston you wanted to get inside i watched him through my dark glasses any particular reason conrad asked i am damned tired of cops and feds asking me to justify every step i take is this iran or america or isnt there any difference anymore they had a fire sunday night when we got there the lady a señora andarra told us two women had been there and they said they had grown up in the house and wanted to look around she was afraid they were from a rival gang to her grandsons she was afraid they set the fire to punish her for not letting them into the house that sounds like me all right gangbanger torching an old ladys house conrad leaned forward you showed me the house once the place where you grew up your mas tree and everything that was true in the spring before i left for italy id been coaching a basketball team in my old high school and conrad and i had occasionally had a drink together after the games one evening in a fit of nostalgia id shown him my home along with the place on the breakwater where boomboom and i used to jump into lake calumet and various other high points of my childhood i sat up i have a young cousin whos spending the summer in chicago she wanted a tour of historic warshawski family sites if you go to back of the yards and gage park youll find weve been there too if those two places have been torched ill start to get seriously interested in your questions was anyone hurt at the houston street fire nope old lady got herself her daughter her grandkids out and not only that in a rare moment of civic cooperation the fire department came before things got out of hand anyway there never really was a fire so the structure is okay thats a mercy i lay back down again you going to ask me how it started faulty wiring geraldo doing reefer in bed smoke bomb someone broke a window and threw it into the living room while they were eating supper everyone ran out the back door and a couple of lowlifes came in through the broken window and helped themselves while the family was waiting for the fire department scum i agreed im very sorry to know this of course especially if they broke one of those windows with the prisms across the top those prisms were what made my mother feel she could tolerate living in south chicago you dont know anything about this ms w i knew i was furious but i was still so tired and lethargic from the residue of morphine in my system that i couldnt feel the anger conrad im tired im in pain i held a burning woman in my arms a few nights ago and couldnt save her life dont make me play twenty questions and dont accuse me of things you know are simply beyond me one more innuendo about this about how i might be implicated in an attack on the people who live in my childhood home and you will never speak to me again even if you want to buy me world series tickets youll funnel your invitation through my attorney he sucked in a breath the lady says she saw you she says she went around to the front of the house to wait for us and the fire department and saw you across the street watching it all i made a face oh please it was dark right and shed seen me once through an inchwide chain bolt she saw someone else and is confused or she knows who really did it and is so frightened of that person that she wants to finger a stranger conrad stood up and looked down at me i believe in you vic i really do im the only person in the fourth district who knows you grew up in that house and im keeping it that way for now but id like to put you in a lineup for señora andarra for my own peace of mind if nothing else all those friendly government agents the next few days were a time of frustrating inaction while i let my eyes heal enough that i could get to work lotty took me home with her and i continued to build up my strength using the gym in her buildings basement making phone calls during the day while she was at her clinic or the hospital my first day at lottys mr contreras came over in the morning before lotty left for work he brought a small suitcase with clothes that petra had packed he would have been embarrassed to rummage in my underwear drawer himself he also brought the dogs which annoyed lotty because her apartment is full of glass tables and museumquality artwork including a small statue of andromache salvaged from the ruins of her grandparents art collection mitchs exuberant energy made her so tense that she terminated the visit quickly on grounds that i didnt have the stamina for it you mean you dont i said but i took the dogs out to the hall behind the kitchen where we waited for the service elevator peewee wants to visit mr contreras said i told her i was sure youd want to see her absolutely the sooner the better can you go up to my place and collect my phone charger so she can bring it with her i couldnt tie up lottys phone but i needed to start connecting myself to the land of the living and here are my car keys get her to drive you over to pick up my car on kedzie before i get a hundred meter violations and twenty boots i didnt think i could stand to use my old handbag again when i had stuck my hand in to fish out my keys it came out covered in ash sister carolyn had known i was a pi only because my license had been the plastic on top when she looked at my wallet the credit cards underneath it had fused together with my drivers license i called my card companies for replacements but id have to go in person to the secretary of states office for a new pi license after mr contreras left lotty went to her clinic on damen i resisted the impulse to go back to bed and phoned sister carolyn instead i wanted to know if shed been able to find any more bottle fragments in sister frankies apartment the police came almost as soon as youd left they wanted to know who broke the seal on frankies door i told them it must have been the intruder we chased down the stairs they put a padlock on the door so we cant get in bolt cutters i said absently flexing my fingers inside their gauze wrappers imagining working a pick into the padlock well think about that the nun said drily but i want to know whos watching our building when you were here you said it was the federal government the feds came to see me in the hospital someone from homeland security someone from the fbi and local guys from the bomb and arson squad it was the day after the fire so i dont remember it clearly they know who lives in your building all the families come to think of it theyre probably listening to this conversation so forget the bolt cutters eavesdropping zabinska was almost speechless with fury i suggested she come see me at lottys so we could talk about it privately i wanted to speak to her anyway now that i was more alert mentally to learn anything sister frankie might have said to her about steve sawyers involvement in harmony newsomes murder before lotty left she had made me promise to stay inside but i wanted to be in motion after doing as much of a workout as i could handle and having a phone meeting with marilyn klimpton at my office i wandered restlessly around lottys apartment in the side room where she keeps her television offlimits and her library overflow offlimits i found a sewing basket with a pair of shears in it i went into the bathroom and started chopping my hair when i was five my father gave me a doll for christmas that had a huge halo of dark hair it was jfks first year in office and dolls all had the jackie do boomboom and i took a pair of scissors to that doll and by the time wed finished she looked much as i did now dentists shouldnt drill their own teeth and detectives shouldnt cut their own hair at least not when their hands were wrapped up in boxers tape a little after one when i thought i might go mad from inaction the cops showed up they knew id been sprung they probably knew lotty wasnt home it was time to talk i put on my heavy dark glasses to underline my invalid status just to be prudent i rode the elevator to the lobby to make sure they were really cops not robbers i hadnt actually seen any of their faces in the hospital but their voices told me these were essentially the same players whod interrogated me last week the fbi had sent lyle torgeson again but the feds had beefed up their presence with someone from homeland security the city had sent only the woman from the office of emergency management instead of the duo whod come to my hospital room the cpd sent the same two guys from the bomb and arson squad a young white man with a crew cut who was already developing a paunch and a latino about my own age who was balding and had big fatigue circles around his eyes i dont have dr herschels permission to bring all these strangers into her home i told the doorman is there a conference room we could use theres a room in the building managers office the doorman said doubtfully its kind of small though we can take you down to thirtyfifth and michigan the latino bomb and arson guy suggested you have a warrant then well meet here there are only six of us after all the doorman called up to the building manager to see if the room was free and to send someone down to escort us so that he wouldnt have to abandon his post at the entrance it was a small room and getting six chairs around the round table meant we all had to be careful to keep our knees to ourselves i was sorry in a way that id kept them out of lottys place but if they were uncomfortable inhaling one anothers bad breath which the woman from oem had to a remarkable degree they wouldnt stay long i kept my big plastic glasses on mostly to annoy them they would want to try to read my facial tics how i moved my eyes and so on and now they couldnt you look like the bad end of a catfight torgeson said you get your hair caught in a wringer over at the nuns place when you went back there everyones taping this right so the fbi and oem and cpd are all going to get the same useful transcript the real question here isi paused long enough to see that they were all leaning forward hoping for some gem of selfrevelationwhy is a woman always characterized as being in a catfight after an altercation im sure with the research youve done on me you know i have two dogs so its a good bet id be more responsive to a dogfight metaphor and yet your underlying sexism made you enough torgeson barked you know damned well what i was talking about i shook my head mind reading isnt one of my skills and i havent been tapping your phone so i cant rely on your conversations to tell me what youre thinking or talking about ms warshawski we know you left beth israel to return to the nuns apartment four nights ago it was the white guy from bomb and arson when i didnt say anything he said well is there a question i said what were you doing at the nuns building four nights ago he said his voice tight from the effort not to lose his temper i was in the hospital four nights ago i said when the hiv nun had escorted me back inside shed flashed her hospital id at the security guard and stopped to chat briefly with one of the nurses no one looked at me a rookie nun new to the hiv aids service head lowered no one on the fifth floor had commented on my absence either when i slipped back into my room or the next morning so i didnt think it had been noticed you were seen entering the freedom center building the woman from oem said what were you doing there i was seen i echoed thats an old old ploy i need more than that to persuade me i was at kedzie and lawrence instead of in my hospital bed the oem woman pulled a set of stills from her briefcase and laid them on the small round table in the middle of the room we all took turns looking at them they were timestamped and they showed a woman whose dark hair held a few white streaks wearing jeans and a white shirt they were shot from behind so you couldnt see where her hair had been shaved back from her temples nor could you see that she was using the edge of her plastic lenses to snap the tongue back in the frontdoor lock i dont know i said its not like this person is wearing a jacket marked v i warshawski and i think id remember if id been there you have some shots showing me leaving some where i could see my face i dont recognize myself from behind there was a momentary silence id left wearing a nuns veil my face down two other sisters and my cousin holding me close they had the shots but they probably didnt know what to make of them look warshawski this isnt supposed to be an antagonistic meeting the latino guy from bomb and arson said we assume youre on the same team we are and what team would that be detective that you want to catch sister francess killer he said oh i definitely want to do that i agreed then why dont you tell us what you were doing at her apartment that was the fbis lyle torgeson i yawned i wasnt at her apartment lets forget four nights ago torgeson said the night of the fire you agree you were there that night tell us why right i went to talk to sister frances about steve sawyer we know about that the man from homeland security said you have bugs planted in her room i asked theyre good quality i guess if they survived the fire and you retrieved them not like the crap weapons you buy from china and sell to afghanistan you were bugging the room the white bomb and arson detective said turning to the feds why the fuck were you doing that national security the homeland security man said i cant say any more beautiful umbrella i murmured from now on whenever i do anything particularly embarrassing ill just cry national security and refuse to say anything else thats enough torgeson snapped what were you doing in sister francess apartment national security i said the two bomb and arson squad detectives swallowed smiles harmony did not reign supreme between the federal and local law enforcers i let them bicker with one another for a few minutes i have a question for you i said you know why i went to see sister frances to discuss the case of the man whod been convicted of killing harmony newsome in marquette park forty years ago sister frances was marching with ms newsome that hot summer day and said she didnt think it was possible that steve sawyer killed ms newsome are you reopening the case he was tried convicted did his time were not interested that was the latino cop then why was that the last question oem asked me in the hospital why did i care what sister frances had to say about that old murder i think you misheard you were drugged in a lot of pain torgeson said youre the ones with the tape recorders i looked at my fingertips go listen to the conversation i dont have anything else for you the crowded room was momentarily quiet then the bomb and arson team started asking me questions that i could answer to lead them stepbystep through my brief time with sister frances it wasnt meaningful or helpful but i was the only witness the more times i recounted the molotov cocktails sailing in on us the less real they became it was easy to describe them glibly as if they were a plot detail in a thriller and not a deathdealing event when i finished i asked what residue theyd found in the bottles gasoline rocket fuel jellied bomb accelerant we cant answer questions like that the homeland security man said theyre in connection with an investigation linked to our national security it was my turn to remember i needed to keep a leash on my temper what about the perps you must have pictures of them timestamped and everything right anything you can show on the street for an id we cant comment its an investigation linked to our national security but these pictures arent i picked up the stills of me at the entrance to the freedom center building thats good ill show them to sister carolyn see if she knows who this might be given that someone was in sister francess apartment that night she might recognize who if you werent there how do you know someone was in the dead nuns apartment torgeson pounced you just told me i got to my feet holding the stills the woman from oem leaned over spraying me with her fetid breath and grabbed the pictures these are government property and are highly classified i know i said an investigation linked to our national security she glared at me id strongly advise you not to suggest to a nun that she take a bolt cutter to a room thats been secured by the police i smiled at her we were playing a game where the person who keeps her temper longest wins you know we live in a county where patronage workers get paid a hundred thousand dollars a year not to work so it cheers me no end to see that you really are earning the salary my tax dollars pay for youve been hard at it and ill see you get a note stuck in your personnel file line spinners even though id walked away triumphant from that skirmish there was no way i could win a larger battle with the law the real question if i could get my tired brain to return to duty was why they cared so much their questions their whole attitude seemed more about sister francess and my conversation than her murder i had to be honest enough to admit my arrival at the murder scene two days later warranted investigation but why did they have such an elaborate stakeout on the building in the first place the interrogation had worn me out i tried to make some notes in big block capitals with a felttipped marker but the effort put me to sleep when i woke it was because the doorman was calling on the house phone sister carolyn zabinska had arrived you dont look well are you up to talking she greeted me her own face was pinched and gray with grief she was tall and sturdily built but her shoulders were bent forward with pain its just my hair i said steering myself away from selfpity i tried to trim it with sewing shears and was singularly inept the fbi was ruder they said i looked like the losing end of a catfight yes the fbi thats what i want to talk about one of the things anyway she followed me onto the balcony off the living room where lotty has a little table and chairs in the summer i offered refreshments and left her standing there looking out over lake michigan while i burrowed in lottys kitchen she practically survives on viennese coffee but i found some german herbal infusions in the back of a drawer when i returned to the balcony with a tray precariously balanced between my bandaged palms sister carolyn sat down and asked how i knew the fbi was watching the freedom center building i dont know if the fbi is involved homeland security took the pictures i explained what id learned from todays interview including the news that the feds photographed everyone entering and leaving thats so outrageous why on earth i dont know when they questioned me in the hospital they were dancing like rhinos around the subject they implied it could be because of your tenants youre the one who knows if youre treading on their toes treading on their toes its true we protest at the school of the americas we work with poor immigrants with refugees with people on death row were involved in affordable housing and peace but we dont do anything clandestine or immoral we dont sell drugs or weapons or spy on people you know darned well youre rocking the whole aircraft carrier with those issues america as armed camp is the status quo peace letting in immigrants ending torture ending the death penalty no wonder they think youre a threat there must be a whole floor of that building on the potomac dedicated to your freedom center but that means were endangering the other tenants zabinska said worried we dont own the building but the management company that does has been pretty generous they let us run the freedom center out of the groundfloor apartments five of us sisters attached to the center rent there and weve ended up working with a lot of the other tenants because so many are either refugees or are trying to figure out how to get health care or housing vouchers maybe we should see about moving the ones whore most at risk for deportation everyones pretty scared as it is because of the fire bombs youd better be very careful where and how you talk about it i warned her they probably are listening to all your conversations not just your phones she was outraged of course especially when i explained how hard it is to detect or block a sophisticated eavesdropper which the feds certainly are we talked over her options technological solutions were outside her budget and playing cloakanddagger with codes and meetings off premises was too timeconsuming besides that kind of secretiveness would drive us mad its so counter to our vows and our mission but maybe we should start leaving through the alley when we want to be private i made a face it would be easy to mount tiny surveillance cameras on the light poles in the alley it depends on how much they care about you sister carolyn pushed the heels of her hands against her eyes i know these are important matters but its hard to pay attention to them right now were all still in shock at losing frankie the violence of the attack thats very hard to absorb but losing her i wasnt ready for that im the head of the freedom center but she was our real leader spiritually psychologically in all the ways that count most i need to understand why she was killed i bit my lower lip i wish i knew but i dont when i looked in your wallet and saw your pi license i thought maybe youd come to spy on her i didnt realize then that the government was already spying on us i thought maybe an antiimmigrant group had hired you i went through my tired story about hunting for lamont gadsden and steve sawyer when i mentioned karen lennons name sister carolyns heavy expression lightened for a moment karen of course i know her shes on our death penalty committee and weve done some work together on affordable health care how did she find you by chance she was in a hospital er when i came in with a homeless man whod collapsed on my sidewalk and dr herschelthis is her apartment i realizedi was surprised to learn you were staying with her ive known lotty half my life now ever since i was an undergraduate and she was advising an abortion underground sister carolyn took that in without blinking some of her immigrant clients got medical care at lottys storefront clinic and lotty had saved the life of one of their pregnant women when she was shot in the abdomen it clearly made me a better citizen in zabinskas eyes that lotty was my friend and that i was working with karen lennon i finally brought the conversation back to my own inquiry did sister frances ever talk about steve sawyers trial or the march in marquette park where harmony newsome died i was a child when that happened a middle schooler at justin martyr frankie came to speak to us as part of the cardinals outreach program a lot of the children booed and called her names but she made me see the world in a different way i came to my vocation because of frankie she shook her head trying to shake tears away she wouldnt have talked to me about the murder at the time because i was a child and by the time i went through my novitiate and ended up back in chicago with her it was twelve years later so many other things started happening that we needed to tacklethe school of the americas and the guatemalan asylum seekers and then the loss of jobs and health carethat we didnt dwell much on that past did she think this steve sawyer was wrongly convicted he may have been all i can say with any certainty is that he was very badly represented in a trial that was a travesty at least as far as i can tell from the transcript sister frances said she wanted to testify at the trial but the defense wouldnt call her i stopped my throat was so dry i could hardly get the next words out a reporter suggested i was the real target but he wouldnt tell me who hed heard that from killing a nun to keep her from talking to you or you from talking to her these things have happened in nicaragua or liberia but here we think were so safe here and yet my own government is spying on me the government are the people who would have known she was talking to you her eyes widened in horror and she choked out you dont think they that they i grimaced what that the contras might kill a nun but not homeland security i dont think they did but i cant swear to anything right now except that i feel pretty vulnerable zabinska pleated lottys linen tea napkin over and over in her fingers the work that youre doing for karen for these two old women in lionsgate manor how much are you charging them my standard fee is a hundred fifty an hour plus expenses we cant afford that is there any chance you could work out an arrangement with us i want you to find out why frankie died well all feel better if we know why i could feel the request coming before she said it but i didnt try to fight it i owed sister frances the effort of an investigation yes i said quietly ill feel better too we talked through the various issues the freedom center worked on that might have brought someone to the boiling point we talked about people who might have harbored a personal resentment against sister frances even saints make enemies its how they become martyrs at the end i said the best thing you can do is get back into that sealed apartment and bring me some bottle fragments you suggested bolt cutters she said doubtfully or a hammer that door isnt too sturdy a few good whacks on the panel would take care of it id do it myself but im a bit out of action right now my padded hands would be unwrapped in two more days if theyd healed sufficiently lotty would let me go home sister carolyn got up to leave but she took the tea things to the kitchen and washed them for me first in the hall as she waited for the elevator she said you know taking a hammer to that door would cheer me up some kind of fierce action for a change if we find any bits of bottle one of us will bring them over tomorrow later that evening petra arrived bubbling with so much energetic goodwill that i felt exhausted almost from the moment she got off the elevator when lotty let her in petra danced down the hall to the guest room where i was dictating notes to send to marilyn petra had remembered the charger to my phone amazingly enough and also brought my mail which she dumped on the bureau before settling in a wing chair by the window shall i open it and read it to you there must be a hundred letters here no most of them are bills theyll keep another day how are the dogs whats happening with the campaign you still the goldenhaired girl she laughed i dont take any of it too seriously i think thats why im so popular everyone else is like totally ambitious you know hoping for big jobs when brian gets to the senate so that they can have really big jobs when hes president and what are you hoping for i asked idly just to get through the summer without making a mistake thatll get everyone else in trouble she spoke with such unexpected seriousness that i took off my heavy dark glasses to look at her whats going on petra is someone suggesting youve done something wrong no no i dont want to think about it tonight you know that baseball you said you found in uncle tonys trunk the one signed by someone in the white sox nellie fox you mean yeah what about it i mentioned it to daddy and hed love to have it did you keep it i mean you said it would be worth something if you auctioned it on ebay she was floundering and i stared at her with even more surprise petra what is the matter with you tonight i kept the baseball but i dont know what i want to do with it it meant something to my dad or he wouldnt have kept it with his good conduct citation ill think about it where is it she persisted could i take a picture and send it to daddy petra you are up to something i dont know what but she flushed and played with her array of rubber bracelets oh hes turning seventy next year and mom and i were trying to think of something really special to do i thought of the baseball and i thought you just said youd talked to him about it and that hed love to have it why are you biting on me like i was some steak bone im just making conversation she nearly tilted the wing chair over in her agitation then lets make some more conversation what really brought you to sister francess apartment the other night and who came with you i told you baby ive been listening to line spinners since i was six and you are not in the majors not even double a she scowled at me if i tell you now youll make even more fun of me try me i thought its not like you have an assistant or anything and when we went to south chicago i loved how you dealt with those gangbangers i thought if i went in and found somethinga clue or somethingmaybe youd take me on as an apprentice when the campaign winds down but if youre just going to laugh at me her face was so red that it almost glowed in the soft light of the guest room i slid off the bed and knelt next to her patting her shoulder you want to be a detective you know the fun stuff you said i got to do after i tangled with that gangbanger on houston street your folks would eat me for lunch if you were working for me and got your eyes burned not to mention that you could have gone through the floor in that apartment i sat back on the daybed as another thought occurred to me petra someone threw a smoke bomb into my old house on houston last sunday señora andarra said she saw one of us watching from across the street that wasnt you was it vic you told me not to go down there alone does that mean no i asked you werent trying to play detective and get into that house i wasnt playing detective at your old house okay her face turned red again in her agitation now im sorry i ever said anything to you about it daddy says your mom spoiled you something rotten so you never learned how to let anyone else be in the limelight that a fact is that what you were doing at the freedom center the other night showing me how to let you be in the limelight oh you twist everything i say the wrong way she strode from the room her rubber bracelets bobbing up and down on her arms her exit was a little anticlimactic one of her bracelets flew off as she reached lottys front door i bent to pick it up it was white and labeled one it was supposed to make us want to get together as one planet to solve aids and poverty i shut my eyes i was supposed to be the grownup in this situation i handed her the bracelet and said if i try to learn how to share the limelight will you try to learn how to listen to directions her flush faded you mean you would let me study detecting with you most of what i do is truly tedious like all those bills on the bureau there i warned her but if you want to work for me for six months see how you like it sure we can give it a try when youre through with brians campaign she flung her arms around me pressing into the raw new skin on my chest then ran into the waiting elevator i stopped in the living room to say good night to lotty i was puzzling over petras words and her behavior with lottycould petra be serious about trying to emulate me could she be lying about being in south chicago last sundaywhen lottys phone rang it was carolyn zabinska for me vic we went to frankies place as soon as we got in tonight she said without preamble a demolition team had come in from nowhere and stripped the room the building manager said it was an anonymous benefactor who wanted to do something good for the church and that builders would be arriving tomorrow home in tatters a few days later i left lottys for home my gauze had come off revealing puckered red skin underneath i was to wear special gloves day and night a kind of lacy mitt there was to be no swimming for now and no sun for some months to come i graduated from my special plasticlensed dark glasses to ordinary dark glasses i was cleared for viewing television and computer screens and for driving a car i spoke with the doorman several times during my stay with lotty he hadnt seen anyone lurking around waiting for an injured private eye to emerge no strangers had come calling for me except the law my first day there i was beginning to believe the attack on sister frances had been connected to her work at the freedom center the thought didnt stop my wanting to find her killers but it eased my nightmares i hadnt killed her id only been the helpless witness to her death while i was recuperating at lottys i wasnt idle i returned all the calls from the media that had piled up sad but true part of being a successful pi is for people to see your name on the web this was especially important because my temporary agency phoned to say that marilyn klimpton was quitting she didnt expect to be there on her own with so many angry clients and all the reporters and so on trying to reach you also you being attacked in that bombing shes afraid for her safety being alone in your office we dont think we can send anyone to replace her right now then i dont think you and i will be working together again in the future either i said grandly this was just great not only was i out of commission but the backlog waiting for me would be growing to himalayan proportions again i called my answering service to tell them to handle the phone during normal business hours and then i started phoning my clients to see what business i could subcontract out and what could wait a few more days for me to get to it personally some people had already moved their inquiries to bigger firms with more detectives prudent if your lead investigator is singed go where you know theres backup i thought of my bills and tried not to panic i thought of george dornicks mountain hawk security and his offer to hire tonys daughter i hoped it wouldnt come to that and i worried too about my cousin something wasnt right with her story about why shed shown up at the freedom center the night id gone back there it was flattering to think she wanted to emulate me but i was having a hard time believing it and the smoke bomb at my old home on houston señora andarra had told the cops she saw the woman who grew up in the house watching from across the street conrad thought that had to be me because he associated only me with growing up in the house but señora andarra probably thought of petra and me as a family unit it had been petra who spoke to her in spanish although petra had sworn angrily she hadnt been playing detective in south chicago she hadnt categorically denied being there last sunday night but why would she have been down there i couldnt begin to imagine a reason i finally put the idea aside and called the management company that handled the freedom center building hoping they could tell me who had sent over a demolition team to gut sister frankies apartment and prepare it for the builders they couldnt or they wouldnt tell me i left a message on sister carolyns cellphone to see if she could get any information out of the contractors she was in a meeting with an ins attorney but she called back several hours later to say shed talked to someone from both the wrecking crew and the builder both contractors insisted they didnt know who hired them they had been promised cash almost double their usual fees if they would drop everything and take care of the building they didnt want to tell me even that much i guess because they were afraid i might report them to the irs but i put on my costume and assured them that all i wanted was information her costume oh the veil right i asked who had given them the money but she said they claimed it was a middleaged white man someone they had never seen before dont tell me i said drily he was wearing a trench coat and a felt fedora i dont know she said would it make a difference yeah it would be a giveaway that they were lying instead of just a probability you think they really know who sent them i was sitting at lottys kitchen table my frustration at my inaction just about at the boiling point i dont know of course but my best guess is that they owe someone important a favor or theyre gofers for someone important maybe theyre a minoritycontracting front i dont know but to drop everything like that they have to have a pretty good idea who sent them and then your place being under surveillance and that police seal on sister frankies door didnt stop them for five seconds when we hung up i called the detectives from the bomb and arson squad who had been over to interrogate me the latino cop was in you know your crime scene doesnt exist anymore i said what are you talking about i just got off the phone with one of the nuns who lives there a building crew showed up not anyone the sisters hired and took down the door stripped the room i hope you secured any samples you took someones going to a lot of trouble to keep that fire from being investigated he didnt exactly thank me it was more of a snarl a demand for sister carolyns phone number and a warning that id better not be behind any destruction of evidence i missed amy blount badly i could have sicced her on the contractors gotten her to track down the ownership trail i wondered if i could turn it over to my cousin see how she would handle a routine search through incorporation records if she failed i was no worse off than i was when i started i tried petra on her cellphone she was at the campaign office and we were interrupted several times by people who came by to see her each time she announced that she was on the phone with my cousin you know the one who got burned in that fire last week so ill get back to you right away but she needs my help when i finally got her full attention she was enthusiastic and bubbled over with questions i gave her the urls of a couple of websites i subscribe to and told her id email her the passwords so she didnt have to try to write them down in midconversation if the subcontractors havent made it into the database youll have to go to the state of illinois building to check their incorporation filings but what if they incorporated in some other state dont they usually do it in delaware if theyre big enough to incorporate in delaware you should find them online but good catch if you find them please little cousin do not go tracking them down by yourself contractors have short fuses and big hammers oh vic so do meatpackers i grew up around them i know how to talk to people without getting their undies in a bundle anyway i can outrun a guy whos weighed down by a big hammer youll see i would see i frowned at the phone wishing i understood what was really on petras mind and hoping i hadnt started her on a quest where shed get in over her head lotty took the afternoon off to drive me around first to the hospital where her presence let me jump to the front of the line from the hospital we drove to the bank until i got all my plastic replaced i didnt have a way of getting cash so i brought my passport and cashed a check for a thousand dollars hoping that would see me through until a new atm card arrived our last stop was my hairdressers so i could get my weird clumps of hair shorn to a uniform length something between baldness and a marine buzz cut was how it looked at the end but certainly way more attractive than the mangy dogd do id been sporting it was a pleasant day a sort of minivacation after the trauma of the past ten days and we finished it by eating supper with max at a little bistro on damen he and lotty drove me to my apartment where mr contreras and the dogs tumbled out to greet me the dogs showed such ecstasy that the medical resident across the hall threatened to call the cops if mr contreras and i didnt silence them at once even that didnt dampen my pleasure at coming back to my own home lotty gave me a long hug and relinquished me to mr contreras who insisted on carrying my bag up the stairs my pleasure died as soon as i opened the door i was so shocked that i couldnt take it in at first my home had been ripped to shreds books lay on the floor my stereo was dismantled music had been dumped so the inside of the piano could be inspected my trunk stood in the living room with my mothers evening gown wadded up on the floor next to it my first reaction was a kind of despair a desire to get on a plane for milan and spend the rest of my life in the little hill town where my mother grew up my second response was fury with my cousin come on vic my neighbor protested cut the kid some slack how could she be behind this there are no signs of forced entry i said you let her in with my keys right shes been obsessed with this baseball i found with my dads stuff and this has all the earmarks of a spoiled kid wanting what she wants when she wants it i let her in yeah but that was two days ago when she stopped in for your phone charger she didnt stay long enough to do this kind of damage and anyway you got her all wrong i dont know whats wrong with you cookie but its like youre jealous of her for being young and pretty and lively i thought you was better than that really doll i thought you was how can you talk like that when my apartment has been trashed look at this i held up my mothers gown she knows how much this matters to me and she just wads it up and dumps it like its an old dish towel im just saying petra couldnt a done this no matter what you think and i didnt let anyone else in so this was a professional someone who could bypass all your locks and gates and stuff and get in anyway they had tove done this late at night when me and the dogs was sound asleep your cousin wasnt here in the middle of the night i called petras cellphone but there wasnt any answer i left a message telling her to call me the instant she picked up her voice mail with the dogs and mr contreras accompanying me i walked through my apartment looking at wreckage the old man was right petra wouldnt have been so wanton but neither would a professional unless it was a professional deliberately trying to terrify me in which case they had done a great job but what could they be looking for i asked mr contreras except for that nellie fox ball theres nothing here that anyone would want besides as i keep saying theres no sign of forced entry maybe petra forgot to lock up behind her my neighbor suggested then why was it locked when we came up the stairs just now i was teetering on the brink of meltdown and kept hysteria out of my voice by effort of will alone mr contreras wanted me to call the police but id had my fill of the law although the more chaos i saw the less i thought my cousin had caused it i didnt want a crime unit to find some trace of petra there if shed done this id tackle her myself i spent the rest of the night cleaning mr contreras stayed to help picking up books helping fold clothes cleaning the kitchen with me in my dining room dishes had been pulled from the shelves with the same recklessness apparent everywhere else the old man knelt grunting to pick up cups and plates and wipe them before putting them back on the shelves my mothers red venetian wineglasses which she had wrapped in her underwear and carried in her one small suitcase when she fled italy were piled on the floor i picked them up my hands shaking so badly i was afraid i would break them and held each up to the light i had lost two over the years and cracked a third now a fourth had a chip in the base i held on to the fourth glass unable to keep from crying when bobby and eileen mallory had their first baby gabriella had brought these glasses out to drink a toast after the christening that was the first time i remembered seeing them and my mother had told me their history the wineglasses had been a present to her grandmother in on her wedding day they had been carried by gabriella into hiding as a memento even though they were an unwieldy and fragile burden she had managed to carry them from pitigliano to siena where she hid in her music teachers attic and then hours before the fascists arrived smuggled them to the hills where she hid with her father until bribes and luck got her passage on a ship to cuba not one glass had broken but me id now damaged half of them victoria iphigenia the ox i dont know how long i sat there while mr contreras tiptoed around sympathetically putting away books and papers peppy came to lay her head in my lap i put the glass down to stroke her then finally got to my knees on my way to return the glasses to my breakfront i was getting to my feet when i saw that my photo album had been flung under the table i got down on my knees again and crawled between the legs after it my eyes were aching from overuse and my hands were throbbing but i turned the pages trying to figure out if any of the pictures were missing a number had come loose from their little corner mounts i doggedly went through the album slipping in the loose ones including one of my parents toasting each other with the venetian wineglasses i winced and turned the page the picture of my father with his slowpitch team was missing i looked under the table then sifted through the album a second time but the picture had disappeared vanishing cousin we finished a little after one mr contreras left the dogs with me for protection and i made sure all my door and window bolts were shot home on the inside but even so i slept badly every time mitch scratched or a car honked too loudly i jumped awake heart pounding sure the next minute would bring a home invasion or a molotov cocktail through a window finally around five the lightening sky made me feel safe enough that i dropped off the dogs woke me at nine whining to get down to the back garden i slumped out after them sitting on the back porch with my head on my knees until the hot sun burning my neck reminded me that i couldnt be outside without protection back inside i tried my cousin again she answered just as i thought the call was going to roll over again to her voice mail uh vic uh i cant do that thing for you that you asked me petra i can barely hear you whats going on i cant talk to you now she was still speaking in almost a whisper i answered sharply that i needed some answers from her at once about what shed been doing in my apartment i wasnt there she said except when i went to make your bed and stuff you didnt look around for that baseball you wanted i did look in the trunk but i put everything back again so dont get too mad at me please vic i cant talk right now ive got to go and i cant find those guys for you she whispered so fast before hanging up that i couldnt squeeze in another word i walked to the front window and frowned down at the street id told my cousin the other night that i was an expert at detecting line spinners but im not sure how true that boast was someone very skillful was spinning me around but whether they were using petra or she was a willing participant or even just a bystander i couldnt make up my mind i flicked the cord on the blinds and realized i was standing in such a way that anyone on the street could see me if they wanted to aim a gun or a bottle at me whatever petra might or mightnt have done it was impossible to picture her throwing a molotov cocktail at anyone or even the smoke bomb that had driven the family out of my childhood home last weekend mr contreras was right she was exuberant and careless not meanspirited or cruel that was how i would write her up at her performance review i heard the dogs whining and scratching at the back door and went to let them in i knelt to talk to them ill take you guys for a good walk tonight after the sun goes down but this is it for now i dressed carefully in a highnecked tshirt and loosefitting linen trousers and jacket that covered my arms and chest i put on the white cotton gloves i needed to protect my hands and found a widebrimmed straw hat that i sometimes wore at the beach when i was finished i looked like scarlett ohara protecting her fragile skin but it couldnt be helped to complete my protective gear i went to the safe in the back of my bedroom closet my intruders had shaken out my wardrobe but theyd missed the safe which is built in behind my shoe bag occasionally i have a document so sensitive i dont want to leave it in my office overnight otherwise all that i keep in it is my mothers diamond drop earrings and pendant and my smith wesson i made sure the gun was still cleani hadnt been to the range for several monthsand checked the clip i didnt know for sure that i was in someone elses sights but it made me feel a little better when i snapped my tuck holster over my belt loops i went doortodoor in the best detective tradition to find out if anyone had seen the person whod gone into my apartment and how theyd made it past all my locks without forcing them of course some people were out at work but the older norwegian woman whos lived on the second floor for a decade had been home as had the grandmother of the korean family neither of them had seen or heard anything unusual jake thibaut came bleareyed to the door in a tshirt and shorts id woken him but i couldnt help it and how was i to know what time he got in at night he didnt recognize me at first its the hair he finally decided you cut off all your curls i ran my fingers through the buzz cut and winced as i touched the bruises i kept forgetting about my hair when i dont look in the mirror did you hear anything in my apartment two nights ago someone came through with something like a forklift and knocked the place apart two nights ago he rubbed his eyes i was playing out in elgin i didnt get home until two or so but maybe i saw your forklifters leaving i was getting my bass out of the back of my car when i saw two strange men coming down the walk i sucked in a breath black white young he shook his head i thought maybe they were clients of yours paying a secret visit so i didnt get closethey had that kind of edward g robinson look that makes you think that you should keep your distance were they driving or on foot im pretty sure they got into a big dark suv up the street but im not good with cars i cant tell you what the make was you didnt see a tall woman with spiky hair lurking about did you he laughed you mean that girl who comes to visit youwhat your cousin is she no she came around a few times while you were away visiting the old guy but she wasnt part of that team these guys were bulky not skinny and spiky i left with a measure of both relief and worry relief at the reassurance that petra hadnt been involved in this breakin and worry about who had sent people to search my apartment i picked up my car from the alley where mr contreras had put it when he rescued it id left my briefcase in the trunk some million or so years ago when id gone to visit sister frankie when i opened it to stick in a new set of papers for some meetings id scheduled that afternoon the first thing i saw was the nellie fox baseball id completely forgotten about stashing it in there i laughed softly to myself poor petra she could have boosted the ball without my knowing the difference if shed only thought to look in the trunk i held it up to the sun squinting at it through my dark glasses it was stained and worn someone had played with it maybe grandpa warshawski he died when i was little but hed been a sox fan the ball also had holes in it and that was mystifying a couple of them went all the way through the ball so i wondered if my dad and his brother bernie had run fishing line through it to hang it up for batting practice i tucked the ball back into my briefcase and drove to my office until she sank under the weight of my media calls marilyn klimpton had done a good job of sorting files and papers even though messages had built up and some incoming documents needed sorting the office looked in pretty good shape especially compared to the mounds of papers id found on my return from italy i booted up my computer and looked at the message page from my answering service among the nuisance calls from media outlets were a pointless threat not to tamper with evidence from the emergency management woman and some client queries there also was a message from greg yeoman johnny mertons lawyer i was on the list of confirmed visitors to stateville for tomorrow afternoon could i please call to confirm i suddenly felt so tired i went to the cot in my back room to lie down id forgotten about putting in the call to yeoman i had done it after i saw miss claudia at lionsgate manor i remembered now the murder of sister frances my own injuries the invasion of my apartment had all pushed ella gadsden and her sister completely out of my mind i lay there in the dark for close to an hour i finally got back on my feet and called greg yeoman to confirm that i would make the drive out to stateville the following afternoon thinking about sister frances reminded me that i wanted some background on the demolition and building contractors who were taking care of her apartment petra was going to find out about them for me but she couldnt do it and it really wasnt that big of a job sister carolyn had given me the contractors names little bigman wreckers and rebound construction both were owned by a man named ernie rodenko at west roscoe his seemed to be a midsize company doing about ten million in business every year and specializing in fire and flood rehab the address would put him at the intersection of roscoe and lake shore drive which wasnt zoned for business so his office must be in his home which meant i might drop in on him in the evening when i could go out without all my unguents and hats and so on i entered the address in my pda and continued working through my messages in the afternoon an appointment took me to a building in the east loop across a wide plaza from the skyscraper where krumas for illinois had its headquarters after my meeting i wondered if i should drop in on petra to see if she might tell me something facetoface that she couldnt say over the phone it could be of course that shed been chewed out by her boss for too many personal calls maybe her old boss didnt care much about inoffice discipline but petra was on les strangwells staff now from what i knew of strangwell you belonged to him body and soul you didnt fritter away time on your cousins projects when you had to get brian krumas into the senate in case strangwell was keeping a close watch on my cousin i decided to leave her alone before returning to the hot summer afternoon i turned into the coffee bar in my clients building lobby for an iced cappuccino as i waited for them to make my drink i stared idly around the way one does and caught sight of a familiar face at one of the spindly tables tucked into the corner of the bar the thinning dark hair combed sharply back from a jowly red face id seen him two weeks ago in lake catherine what had brought larry alito into downtown chicago on a hot july day and into a coffee bar instead of a beer joint i was going to slide back into the shadows when i realized my outsize hat dark glasses and gloves made a pretty good disguise i collected my drink and went to sit on one of the high stools by the window near alitos table the man he was talking to looked like many other middleaged middle managers with spreading middles he had fine sandy hair that had receded to the middle of his head which he wisely had trimmed short instead of trying for a combover with his turnedup nose and pursed mouth he had the expression of a perpetually surprised baby only his small gray eyes cold and shrewd made it clear that it was he not alito who was running the meeting i couldnt hear any of their conversation because the coffee bar had a sound track with a loud bass thumping the two men were going over a set of papers in a manila folder and the man running the meeting was tapping the papers with his thumb he wasnt happy with the work alito had given him i pulled out my cellphone and took a quick shot of the two of them while pretending to be texting when they got up i waited until they were almost to the building lobby before i followed them as they reached the lobby they separated without looking or speaking to each other the meeting commander headed for the exit while alito studied the door to a fedex shop near the coffee bar i knelt on one knee to adjust my socks alito may have been a crappy cop but hed spent three decades studying wanted posters and he might recognize me close up despite my disguise from my kneeling position on the floor i looked out at the plaza and saw that the commander was going into the building where the krumas campaign had its offices alitos phone rang and i stood moving behind him to a newsstand where i picked up a pack of gum yeah he said into the phone les already told me and i know what he wants you think im some kind of retard you have to doublecheck everything i do oh the same to the horse you rode in on he snapped his cellphone shut and stormed through the revolving door les had told him had he that man with the sandy hair and cold eyes that was les strangwell i took my coffee out onto the plaza and sat in the shade what line connected strangwell to alito of course excops do freelance work all the time but what kind of security work did the krumas campaign george dornick dornick was advising brian on terrorism and homeland security issues he was alitos expartner maybe dornick was throwing some crumbs his way but what crumbs i thought of my apartment someone who knew how to pick locks in a sophisticated way had gotten in there a cop would have access to all kinds of tools and george dornick with his special security services had access to even more but what could i have that dornick let alone les strangwell might want the picture of my dads softball team larry alito had been in it as had dornick bobby mallory and a lot of other guys alito was proud of his police service it defined him i couldnt imagine any reason why he would want the picture unless it was pure spite against me but there wasnt any reason for that either i didnt have enough data to make up a believable story i gave up trying and took the el back to my office elton grainger was out front hawking streetwise he didnt recognize me at first but when he realized id been in a fire he was all sympathy and a nun got killed you say oh vic i dont have a tv i dont see the news thats terrible no wonder you havent been around hows that cute cousin of yours cute as ever i tried not to grind my teeth anyone been coming around looking for me while ive been away i havent been looking but ill put out a guest book anyone comes up to the door they got to sign in with me he parodied a hotel doorman and i had to laugh of course it was idiotic to think elton would pay attention to anyone scouting out my office i typed in the code on the door lock and went inside keeping a hand on the handle of my gun in its tuck holster when i was inside i searched the office from the cot to the bathroom i shared with my sculpting leasemate but no one was there i answered a few emails but i had reached the end of my stamina and set out for home when i got there i found petra out in the backyard with the dogs mr contreras had his barbecue going she was sitting on the grass with her arms around mitch who acknowledged my arrival by lifting his head to look at me peppy at least came over to meet me poor peewee is beatthey got her working too hard mr contreras announced were doing burgers and corn you want some i accepted gratefully and went upstairs for wine and a salad leaving my hat and gloves i brought some cushions down with me and stretched out on the grass where i could see my cousins face she looked pinched and anxious but when she saw me studying her she tried to grin in her usual enthusiastic fashion im pretty beat myself first day back on the job i had to go to the prudential plaza this afternoon and i finally got a look at les strangwell you didnt talk to him did you petra asked a little breathless not about you not about anything guy has freaky eyes dont you think she shivered but didnt say anything petra are you in trouble at work mr contreras frowned and started to protest but he caught my little headshake and was silent no no why should i be in trouble i do whatever they tell me to and faster than a speeding bullet you just seemed jumpy on the phone today and youre definitely not your usual highvoltage self tonight she played with her stack of rubber bracelets its like uncle sal said theyre working me too hard i even have to go back in tonight as soon as i scarf down some of uncle sals home cooking what took you downtown are you still looking for that missing gangbanger did you think youd find him in the prudential building yep selling bonds out of the fiftiethfloor office actually im going back out to joliet tomorrow afternoon johnny merton the head snake charmer has agreed to see me again and im hoping the murder of sister frances may jolt him into telling me something youre going out to the prison tomorrow she repeated looking at me anxiously why not she bit her lips just uh i dont know youre still hurting i mean im a renewable resource i took a hamburger from mr contreras and sat up to keep it out of peppys mouth im like hercules except i regenerate my spleen my skin and my brain every morning she laughed in a distracted forced way and changed the subject also in a distracted forced way she fed most of her hamburger to mitch then got up to leave i followed her to the side gate petra what is wrong here her large eyes filled with tears and she stared at me for a long pause then said leave me alone cant you do you have to pry into everybodys business no i said slowly no of course not but youre acting i know what im doing leave me alone she slammed the gate you havent been riding her over your place being torn apart have you mr contreras and the dogs had bustled over to join us i shook my head i wish now i had gone to her office today maybe i will after i get done with johnny tomorrow but the next day was when i came back from stateville to find that intruders had been in my office and wrecked it with the force of an f tornado that was when i found petras white rubber one bracelet on the cement apron outside my back door that was the night i spent with bobby mallory and the fbi trying to find any trace of my cousin after that sleepless night my uncle peter and aunt rachel arrived my uncle unleashed his own f on me blaming me at high volume for anything that might have gone wrong with petra i tried to ride out the storm without fighting back because i knew raw rage was the only way he was able to express his fear i was afraid too and so was my aunt finally after several hours of his useless screaming rachel took peter downtown to meet with the fbis special agent in charge losing a follower after peter and rachel left i had a long talk with mr contreras which included a promise to involve him in any action necessary to rescue petra i even shared with him the list id made of all the odd questions i had about my cousin during the past few weeks the nellie fox baseball her relentless interest in the contents of my trunk her wish to see any storage places in the old family home in back of the yards her effort to tour my own childhood home in south chicago her arrival at sister frankies gutted apartment last week the smoke bomb that forced the andarra family to vacate the house the night before sister frankies murder at first he put up a spirited defense of her youth and impulsiveness but by the time i got to her latenight trip to the freedom center even mr contreras was uneasy but doll if she was doing something she shouldnta been it was because she was pushed into it you listen to me shes as good as gold little peewee and dont you go thinking otherwise when you get to the end of this story youre going to find johnny merton was behind it mark my words lets find her first and argue over who got her in over her head later right he agreed gruffly and watched while i printed out a couple of shots id taken of petra on my cellphone i also printed random pictures off the web of young blond women some celebrities some pictures that people had posted on their blogs finishing with a few shots of myself i uploaded the photo id snapped of alito and strangwell at the prudential plaza the other day it wasnt a very clear shot but it was the only one i could find of alito strangwell was highly visible his website showed him with various illinois politicos with us presidents and a supreme court justice and with entertainers like michael jordan i guess if you were coming to strangwell for help the portraits showed you what kind of access a thousand dollars an hour bought you i printed a couple of those images and pulled one of dornick from the mountain hawk security website as well the old man finally left when i went into the bathroom to get ready for my day outside as i covered my face and arms with protective creams it seemed somehow wrong to be tending to my body when my cousins life might be in danger i put on my hat my gloves checked the clip in my gun and put it in its tuck holster and went out the back door jake thibaut was on his little porch with a cup of coffee thats a fetching costume you going undercover on a civil war plantation i tried to smile but found my voice cracking instead its because of the fire because of sorry my cousin has vanished in a way that has me pretty freaked ive got to go see what i can find out he walked down the five steps to our common landing you need any kind of help from me you know anything that doesnt involve a handgun or some kind of physical heroism i started to say no then remembered that thibaut had seen the people who broke into my apartment as they left early tuesday morning i pulled my folder of photographs from my briefcase and showed them to him i know it was dark and these arent great shots but could any of these guys be the ones you saw its impossible to say he tapped the picture of alito and strangwell theyre sitting so i cant tell how tall they are this onehe was touching alitohes broad enough but id have to see them walking i measure peoples height against bessie my bass he added when he saw my puzzled look i put the pictures back in the folder as i started down the stairs thibaut said they looked menacing remember that i nodded soberly menacing didnt even begin to cover the way these people had acted i went out the back gate and picked up my car in the alley in the frenzy wed all been in since last night no one had talked about seeing if petra were at home doped or or not dead i was going to make her apartment my first port of call then head to south chicago i hadnt had time to replace the lump of melted plastic in my wallet with a new drivers license and i didnt want to waste an hour explaining that to a traffic cop so for the few miles that lay between me and petras loft i stayed within the thirtymileperhour limit stopped at all stop signs and even braked when the light turned yellow my picklocks were still in my glove compartment i rang petras bell but there was no answer even though i leaned on it for a good thirty seconds i didnt want to be seen using my picks in broad daylight so i got inside on the triedandtrue method of ringing every bell in the building there is usually someone careless enough to buzz you in and i was lucky with the third bell i pushed i took the stairs up to the fourth floor two at a time by the time i reached petras door i had a stitch in my side where my gun was poking me the woman whod buzzed me in was shouting up the stairwell i tried to steady my voice when i called down an apology id rung the wrong door the voice of an educated white woman was reassuring to her and she called back an acknowledgment i heard her door close and i knelt to work petras lock my hands were shaking i was slow exhaustingly slow and my cotton gloves kept slipping on the picks i took off the stupid gloves but still felt like i was stirring molasses with my fingers when i finally got inside the apartment had a churchlike quiet a tap was dripping somewhere that ping of water on enamel was all i could hear i found myself tiptoeing through the big room that made up the bulk of the loft looking for any signs of my cousin or anything that would give me a hint about where shed gone petra hadnt bothered much with furnishing the place she had an overstuffed sofa one of those big sacklike things covered in a kind of taupe denim an outsize teddy bear was sitting in the middle of it staring at the windows with a sad smile on its face its wide plastic eyes unnerved me i finally turned it facedown she had a television on a rolling stand a rolling computer table and an armchair that matched the sofa she had no curtains for the long row of windows just the blinds that came with the apartment i hadnt been here except the night i unlocked the door for her so i had no idea what might be missing if shed left under her own steam no drugs in the bathroom but her electric toothbrush and waterpik were still in their stands her tube of toms toothpaste was carefully rolled from the bottom up in the area where she slept she had a futon and a dresser a change of clothes was tossed carelessly across the futon trailing onto the floor and more clothes were half on hangers or had been allowed to fall to the closet floor a stack of wicker baskets by the bed held books magazines and a box of condoms i wished i knew who she was dating or whether the box was simply there for insurance i flipped through the lost diary of don juan hoping that the lost diary of petra warshawski might fall out but i didnt see anything in her handwriting not even a checkbook with someone in the millennium gen you couldnt tell if that meant she had run away taking her checkbook with her or that she did all her banking online the one thing i had hoped to find was her laptop so i could see who shed been emailing what to although she seemed to do most of her communicating by texting a computer might have longer documents more of a key to what she was doing at a minimum i could have seen what websites shed been visiting lately the big room flowed into a kitchen with a tiled work island and a big cooktop with a grill and a restaurantsized exhaust fan the fancy appliances seemed wasted on my cousin her refrigerator held wine and blueberry yogurt and not much else in the morning shed grab a carton and eat it on the bus at lunch shed pick up a sandwich and eat it at her desk and at night the group of friends shed made would all go out for thai or mexican or so i pictured it a door by the refrigerator led to a small deck and back stairs when i pulled the door open it swung crazily on its hinges and then fell off i jumped out of the way just in time to avoid a smash on the head the noise the shock of the door collapsing under my hand i leaned against the work island shaking when my heart was more or less normal i saw my gun was in my right hand i hadnt noticed drawing it whoever had come in through the back hadnt bothered with the finesse of picklocks theyd simply crowbarred the hinges out of the doorjamb and then propped the door up when they left what had they taken the computer my cousin at gunpoint i moved the door and went down the back stairs there were cigarette butts on one landing but they looked old the residue of a smoker sent outside to indulge not a recent watcher the stairs ended in an asphalt areaway that was separated from the alley by a high fence and a gate i opened the gate its lock was still in place but a row of parking spaces lay behind the gate and the intruder could have waited out there for someone to park and simply followed that person in i propped the gate open and walked the length of the alley my cousins shiny pathfinder was sitting there all locked up i opened it and looked through the receipts and empty drink containers i got down on my knees and looked under the seats in the glove compartment in the sparetire compartment under the hood under the fenders i detected that petra drank a lot of smoothies and bottled water didnt go in for soft drinks ate at el gato loco and wasnt careful with her creditcard chits after searching the alley the only other clue i found was that a lot of people drink at night and cant be bothered to find a trash can for their empties i returned to petras place through the back i needed to do something about the broken kitchen door on my way out through the front i saw the buildingmanagement company name on a plaque i called them to report the broken door and called bobby mallory to tell him that someone had broken into petras apartment that someone wasnt you was it vicki they broke the back door getting in i was there just now trying to see what was missing and im wondering if they stole her computer or maybe forced her at gunpoint to go into my office bobby catechized me on what my aunt and uncle were up to when i told them they were meeting with the fbi this morning he was skep tical the bureau was stretched too thin with terror watching he claimed he didnt think they could find petra even if shed been kidnapped bobbys comments only increased my own high level of terror i wished i knew whether my next step was a waste of time or not fear paralyzes you makes it hard to act creatively it wasnt until id driven three blocks that i realized i had company after the fire bombs after the trashing of my home and office after petras disappearance i should be taking triple precautions making sure no one had planted bugs or bombs in my car before climbing into it riding around the block two or three times to make sure i was clean before i went anywhere it was only this sixth sense id gotten from all my years in the business that made me note that the bike messenger the same one whod been riding behind me on my way over to petras was in my side mirror again a bike was a great way to do a tail within the city any maneuver i made he could react faster to than a car of course he couldnt follow me onto lake shore drive but anyone smart enough to use a messenger as a tail had a car or two as backup i pretended i hadnt noticed him and got onto the drive i didnt bother to check for tails if they wanted me to know theyd reveal themselves if they didnt my best strategy was not to try to flush them out now i pulled off at the first downtown exit and stopped at the second hotel i came to i turned my car over to the valet explained i was going to a meeting and that i wasnt a guest and went inside theres a network of underground passages that connect the hotels and highrises on the east side of the loop i took the lobby escalator down slipped behind a pillar and knelt down i didnt see anyone behind me but i still took off my scarlett ohara hat and left it behind a potted palm it just made me too damned easy to track i waited until a group of women all came down together laughing and talking and moved just in front of them so that we all seemed to be walking along the underground corridor together they peeled off at one of the subterranean takeout joints i darted into a neighboring gift shop where i bought a cubs cap going up and down escalators buying a frozen yogurt i didnt see the same face twice i bought a red chicago sweatshirt at another gift shop and pulled it on over my linen jacket although the weight of the sweatshirt on a hot day made me feel as though i were encased in a burka i wasnt instantly recognizable still underground i finally headed to my original destination the illinois central station there was a twentyminute wait for the next train to south chicago i bought a ticket and stood near the door leading to the tracks when they called my train i waited until the last possible moment before sliding through the doors and down the stairs i thought i was clean but you never know the slow ride to south chicago was like a backward journey through my life the ride id taken with my mother so many times as a child past the university of chicago where my mother had wanted me to study the best victoria you need to have the best she would say when the train stopped there to let off students ninetyfirst street end of the line a certain desolation attached to the conductors announcement life ends here i walked the four blocks from the station to my old home at least señora andarras grandson and his friends werent visible this morning but a couple of helplesslooking men were sitting on a curb with a bottle in a brown paper bag somewhere a car stereo was pouring out a bass so loudly that the air was vibrating from it at my old home i saw the boardedover window that had been broken to throw in the smoke bomb the prisms across the top were splintered too i concentrated instead on the decorativeglass fanlight over the front door which was still intact i rang the bell after a few minutes when i wondered if shed gone out señora andarra opened it the length of its stubby chain esta ventana i stumbled in my bad spanish pointing at the fan mi madre amó esta ventana también the fact that my mother also loved that window didnt make señora andarra smile but it did keep her from slamming the door in my face using painful pidgin spanish interlaced with english and italian i tried to explain that i was a detective that i had photographs could she look at them let me know if any of the people in them had been at her house when the bomb came through the window the whole time i spoke she stared at me through the crack in the door her dark eyes frowning in her nutcolored face when i finally stumbled to an end of my story she took the folder from me as id feared she singled petra out with no trouble su hija she asked i was tired of everyone thinking petra was my daughter so i dutifully explained she was my cousin mi prima y los hombres i thought she lingered on the shot of alito with strangwell but i couldnt be sure she finally shook her head and said she didnt know any of them hadnt seen any of them i walked back to the station and waited for the northbound train to whisk me back to civilization or whatever it was the boys in the back room on the train north i called conrad rawlings at the fourth district of course i should have gone to see him before visiting señora andarra but i didnt feel i had spare time for getting police permission to talk to people in my cousins orbit conrad was predictably annoyed but hed seen the news about petra he was more interested in finding out why shed been at a crime scene in his bailiwick than yainching at me for not calling him first is there anyone else you can place at the crime scene that you might care to mention not that we cops can compel testimony the laws keep us from getting answers to questions that might help solve crimes but if youre in the mood i ignored the savagery in his tone i showed ms andarra a shot of larry alito with les strangwell but they didnt look familiar to her spell the names i could hear him tapping at his computer any special reason you think a cop and a politicoa big gorgon zola politico from what google is telling mewould be involved in a twobit home invasion alitos an excop and hes sniffing around this story somewhere somehow strangwell is my cousins boss at the krumas campaign and thats reason enough to suspect hes a villain because anyone who tries to boss the warshawski women around must be a criminal i cant talk about this now not with you hostile and me out of my head with worry i pressed the off button a detective whos out of her head with worry is useless i slipped off my shoes and pulled my feet up to sit crosslegged on the seat took deep low breaths tried to empty my mind of fear to fill it with a useful todo list the police and fbi had both canvassed the street where i have my office to see if anyone could describe the men whod been with petra or at least the car theyd drivenif theyd come by car naturally they wouldnt share the results with me i didnt want to retrace all those steps not on my own there must be several hundred people in that section of milwaukee between the businesses and the apartments but i could talk to elton grainger i couldnt remember whether id seen him yesterday or not he was usually at the coffee bar across the street during the day if he hadnt been too drunk he might remember seeing petra with her entourage petras college roommate kelsey ingalls my aunt wouldnt give me her phone number but kelsey was the person petra might have confided in i could surely find her in one of my subscription databases those two tasks meant i should go to my office but when the train pulled into the randolph street station i realized i was underneath the building where the krumas campaign had its headquarters maybe petra had confided in one of her coworkers maybe les strangwell would tell me what shed been working on what was it johnnys daughter had said enough maybes make a hive i went through the maze of underground corridors and found my hat where id left it stuffed behind the potted palm not a good mark for the cleaning staff but easier for me i put the cubs hat and chicago sweatshirt in my briefcase i kept forgetting the nellie fox baseball it was in there too my case now bulged so much with discarded clothes that i couldnt zip it shut i checked in with the lobby guard who phoned up to the campaign she did a creditable job with my name petra having probably accustomed her to it the guard looked at my passport printed out a pass and directed me to the elevators that would carry me to when i got off the elevator i barely had time to admire the giant redwhiteandblue posters with brians bright smile and keen eyes a thirtysomething woman with a mass of reddish curls hurried through the double glass doors to greet me she was carelessly dressed in a yellow shirt whose tails partly hung out over a floralprint skirt and she started speaking almost before she was through the doors where have oh who are you her hands which shed been brandishing in annoyance fell loosely at her sides v i warshawski who are you oh petras cousin the detective petra forgets her id about once a week and the front desk has to call for permission to let her in i was hoping this meant shed shown up where is she i wish i knew i want to find out what shes been working on to see if itll give me any hint about where she might have gone the woman glanced uncertainly at the double glass doors maybe id better ask mr strangwell shes been doing more for him lately than for me youre i squeezed my eyes shut trying to remember if petra had ever called her boss by name tania crandon i run the netsquad which is where petra started before she got so important that she only takes orders from mr strangwell when she realized how resentful she sounded the skin at her throat and chest flushed in the blotchy way that afflicts very fair people she was wearing an id around her neck which she swiped against a pad on the doors when they clicked open i followed her into the campaign hive her cellphone tweeted to let her know she had messages coming in she glanced at these and thumbed responses as we walked past campaign workers they were gathered in knots over computer screens arguing in corners answering cellphones and landlines shrieking news at each other across the tops of cubicles ms crandon looked like a senior citizen in here most of the staff was petras age regardless of race or sex they all seemed to share my cousins exuberant energy maybe krumas really did signal a change in politics as usual in illinois various youths scurried up to tania with questions one asked for petra they couldnt respond to some rumor on drilling for oil in the shawnee national forest without her input shed been doing the research see me after lunch tania said ill have something for you by then our destination was the southwest corner of the floor this part of the operation was quieter with a row of offices banked along the south wall the corner suite included a secretary who was handling a phone console with the panache of solti on the podium tania bent to murmur in the secretarys ear the woman looked at me in surprise made a call of her own hit a key on the computer on the desk and unlocked the inneroffice door tania followed close behind her they shut the door too fast for me to see inside but not too fast for me to hear my uncles voice raised in a hoarse shout so peter too wanted to know what strangwell had his daughter doing that was a help the politico might share more with her father than with her pi cousin a few armchairs were arranged to give visitors a view of the bean the big sculpture in millennium park in which you can see sky city and self reflected in its stainless steel curves i stood for a few moments at the window watching tourists photograph themselves but the light was so bright that i had to put my dark glasses on and then i couldnt see much as the minutes stretched on i left the window i tried the office door but it was locked i scowled at it then left the area looking for the netsquad i had a feeling that if i didnt find petras coworkers now id be hustled off the floor before i could talk to them the campaigners were deep in conferences or text messages and cellphones a youth who finally responded to me told me the netsquad was in sector sector is which way were in pods communications is pod nearest the elevators pod is r and d sector the netsquad straddles the two he went back to his computer finished with me pods sectors theyd clearly grown up playing too many scifi games on their handhelds the energy and selfabsorption of the campaigners which had seemed entertaining at first began to grate on me when i finally found sector i saw the young woman whod wanted petras input on oil drilling in the shawnee forest about five kids were at their computers it was hard to get a real count because they never sat still for long someone would type furiously for a bit yell im sending you this read it before it goes live and then take off while another two or three staffers would emerge from other pods look at what was onscreen sit down to type a comment then drift away again i finally managed to get a young man with a shock of black hair falling into his eyes to pay attention to me petra warshawski petra shes not here she disappeared they think shes been kidnapped the magic words brought the whole pod to his desk where they started arguing about whether petra had been kidnapped or had disappeared on a secret assignment for strangwell petra could be doing an undercover assignment for the chicago strangler a young woman with a number of piercings said she never says what the strangler has her doing running a hit squad the sole africanamerican youth on the team suggested the strangler feels free to machinegun the whole opposition in broad daylight the pierced woman said you wouldnt have to be undercover for that who would petra talk to if she had a tough problem to unknot i asked that quieted the group for a minute but a young woman in jeans and layered tank tops said we dont work like that its more like how do i do this and we all like brainstorm and come up with different ideas brians campaign its about change its not about personal glory so we like all work together what if petra had a personal problem i asked the africanamerican kid said she didnt have personal problems that i could see i mean before the strangler pulled her off the team then i dont know if working for him went to her head or he had her doing something she didnt like but she stopped eating with us after work we dont know what shes doing or who shes talking to guys a fucking organizing genius the first kid id spoken to said granted the africanamerican youth said but would you want to go to el gato loco with him the pierced woman laughed another young woman came along and asked who was going where for lunch before they all took off i handed cards around im her cousin she disappeared in a way thats got me seriously worried and the chicago police and the fbi are on it too so im surprised they havent been around to talk to you if you can think of anyone she might confide in or anything shes said that would tell me why she took off call me please they were emailing with excitement before i even left the pod police fbi way too cool to keep to yourself i walked slowly back to strangwellthe stranglerscorner of the floor the kids admired him but he frightened them and at the same time they had been jealous of petra for being singled out to work for him strangwells door stood open now tania crandon was next to it working her cellphone the secretary was standing next to her desk talking on the landline strangwell frowning watched from the doorway we didnt know what happened to you tania pocketed her phone i know its a big operation easy to get lost in i smiled amiably i wanted to talk to petras coworkers to see if shed been in touch with any of them and had she strangwell asked i dont think so they say that she turned standoffish when she started working for you was that one of your conditions his cold eyes turned fractionally chillier i expect everyone who works for me to protect the confidentiality of our clients the fact that netsquad talked to you without permission makes me think i havent been clear in communicating that rule tania crandon flushed again it was clearly supposed to be her fault that her team had chatted with me she started to apologize but i cut her short you have a young and energetic team and im guessing that if you tamp down their exuberance youll lose the best qualities of their work im v i war i know who you are your uncle is here wed all like to talk to you to make sure you dont do something that might jeopardize our ability to find petra i didnt know if he was being an sob because id spoken to the netsquad or because i was petras cousin and shed disappeared on himor because it was his naturebut i followed him into his office i knew peter was there of course and it wasnt surprising to see george dornick since he was advising the campaign on security but i was startled to see harvey krumas as well of the four men only strangwell looked at ease his cold shrewd eyes surveying me to see how i was reacting to the group harvey and peter were both flushedwhether from anger fear or some other emotioni couldnt decipher their expressions even dornick a vision in pearlgray shantung and pink shirting looked ill at ease i moved forward before strangwell could take complete control of the encounter mr krumas we met at your sons fundraiser on navy pier george have you come in to augment police efforts to find petra mr strangwell can you tell us what petras been working on the last ten days or so shes been seen in some odd places and it would help if i knew whether youd sent her to them or shed been going on her own odd places dornick said like what like the mighty waters freedom center a few nights after it was firebombed i touched my face inadvertently like my childhood home the night someone threw a smoke bomb through the window petra wouldnt go to south chicago not unless you took her there damn it vic if you put her in front of a crew of gangbangers my uncles outburst lacked conviction apparently even to himself since he let dornick cut him off midsentence les says petra was playing at detective for you vicki vic i corrected strangwell ignored me i had to read petra the riot act when i found she was looking up information for vicki here on campaign time im sorry peter now i cant help wondering if i wounded her pride and she ran away its not like petra to be hypersensitive my uncle said but youre such a ruthless sob strangwell maybe you were crueler than you realized at the moment this is a very strange chorus i was trying not to lose my temper because that would cost me judgment is that what you did while i was waiting agree on the song and the harmony petra ran away because big mean les was too tough for her i chewed her out good and hard for rummaging through my private possessions and she bounced back like the proverbial pillsbury doughboy but now you want me to think she might have run off because les hurt her feelings george is putting a team together for us harvey krumas said we know you love your cousin but someone like you will hurt us more than help us someone like me being what a pretty ineffectual solo op strangwell said crisply you havent found a person youve been hunting for over a month but you did get a wonderful nun killed i felt it where he intended it right below the diaphragm that place where your insides collapse in on you when you think of all the terrible mistakes youve made im impressed that youve gone to so much trouble to uncover my workload i tried to keep my voice steady still i dont think you should discount what i can do i dont want you to do anything my uncle was close to tears rachel has left town to be with the girls and im turning everything over to george hes in charge what did derek hatfield tell you when you met with the fbi i asked is he comfortable too with letting georges team run the search theyre overworked vicki dornick said of course theyll put some agents in play but hatfield knows what i can do and he knows he can trust my operatives to behave sensibly if it turns out we have a ransom or hostage situation on our hands i looked at my uncle petra usually calls rachel at least once a day hasnt she been in touch at all my uncle made a rough meaningless gesture we kept calling and getting her voice mail why she cant answer her battery seems to be dead dornick said i raised my eyebrows youve been using your gps monitors to track her then where did you last pick up a trace dornick pressed his lips together he hadnt meant to tell me he was tracking petra but he didnt compound the blunder by trying to deny it we didnt get on it until early this morning so we dont know where she went after she ran out your back door now that you have hatfields acquiescence in letting the private sector handle the search what are your plans dornick smiled thinly the first thing well do of course is to sweat merton i was astonished you really think the anacondas are involved in this georgie he flushed at the nickname dont be naïve vicki vic you know that even doing life at stateville merton runs a big chunk of the south and west sides of this city drugs whores id theft we can squeeze him where it hurts and that would be where i asked politely he cant do more time than hes already doing hes proud of his daughter we can put pressure on her i didnt think they were close i objected that doesnt mean he wouldnt be upset as hell if her law firm decided she was a security risk dornick said and if it turns out merton had nothing to do with petras disappearance will you restore dayo mertons reputation and make sure she gets another job as good as the one she has now i asked adding to my uncle is that how youd want petra treated if hes behind her disappearance hes already treating her okay so youll start by sitting on the hammer and at the same time just in case well pull in some of the anacondas who hold a grudge against well lets say against your dad people like this steve sawyer youve been looking for you know where he is a little smile played around dornicks mouth condescension mostly i feel pretty confident i can track him down and well talk to you vic strangwell said we need to know what petra was doing for you peter was looking at harvey krumas with an odd almost pleading expression it seemed to me that the two men were holding their breath waiting for my answer nothing really i spoke slowly studying their faces trying to guess what they were hoping to hear when i was injured in the fire that killed sister frances my eyes were damaged they told me not to look at a computer for a few days and petra offered to look up an address in one of my databases then she told me les here had sat on her and that she couldnt do the search are you telling the truth harvey krumas demanded thats a useless question mr krumas if i say yes would you believe me and why on earth would i say no besides why do you care its data thats readily available to the public at large what difference does it make if petra saw it or not before any of the men could speak we heard a muffled shout outside the door a scrabbling sound as the lock was pushed back the door opened and the candidate himself walked in in the hall of the titans harvey krumas gaped at his son dornick got to his feet but for once he seemed at a loss looking from peter to harvey and then to les strangwell who picked up the cue and spoke first brian you have a full schedule with donors in la today why did you cancel that were going to have to do some serious damage control out there now chrissake les the damage control isnt about me and some bmovie starlets but about finding petra warshawski i need to be here brians tie was unknotted and his dark hair hadnt seen a comb for some time we have the situation under control les said george is putting his best people into finding petra how about just once les dad georgeand whoever you two arebrian looked at my uncle and me without recognitionjust once we pretend this is my campaign my life my staffers that we arent all pawns in your big power game i want to know what the cops have said about petra and what we know about her disappearance and why is george here at damagecontrol central instead of meeting with his best people to get them moving we want to minimize media attention on petras disappearance strangwell said you coming back here like this sends a message that we think its more serious than it is brians face turned white are you saying it isnt serious when a young woman on my staff vanishes into thin air the web is saying the fbi suspects kidnapping and youre nuts if you dont think the media isnt already on it like flies on a dead cow when i got to lax this morning i had a dozen mikes under my nose wanting to know where i was when the kid disappeared and what did i think about it and on and on and on tell me whats happened not the sound bite you think i should chew on but what the cops and the fbi have said and done of course dornick said ill tell derek hatfield he should give brian a full briefing on what the bureau knows and ill go to my office and get my team organized warshawski you want to come with me i started to get up surprised at the invitation then realized dornick was talking to my uncle as soon as brian heard the warshawski name he realized who my uncle was and crossed the room to his side im sorry pete with all this crisis i didnt recognize you im sorry as hell about petra i cant believe her work with the campaign had anything to do with her disappearance but george will find her im sure whatever she was doing is rachel here do you need anything a place to stay anything at all thats right harvey krumas put in come on out to the house pete jolenta will be glad to have you to look after we all feel helpless and she needs to be doing something helpless not you harve my uncle gave a bitter smile besides i want to be where i can get to the fbi oror anyonefast im fine at the drake the roscoe street apartment then brian urged i can go out to barrington hills with dad why should you run up a hotel bill no you need to stay in the city where youre accessible strangwell told brian now that youre back here we can schedule some events and some press this is a good opportunity to build support with women showing how sensitive you are to their needs violence against women that kind of thing art and melanie are standing by with some ideas on how to craft les you are a fucking machine i dont want you to craft a statement on how to talk about a missing kid i want a rundown on what were doing to find her and pete i want to make sure you and rachel are getting all the support you need youre sure you dont want the apartment thanks brian lets leave it lie vic you can ride up to the drake with me that was an announcement a command that the meeting was over harvey krumas and george dornick lingered to talk to strangwell but brian left the office with peter and me youre petras cousin arent you the person i talked to last night am i right that she was in your office yesterday and thats the last place she was seen vic doesnt know anything about petra peter growled she thinks petra was in her office but she cant prove it it was her bracelet i found outside my back door i said to the candidate a million kids wear those rubber bracelets peter said and rachel identified her from the video footage i went to petras apartment today someone broke down her back door she had something somebody wants or knew something ever since strangwell moved her onto his personal team shes behaved oddly what did he have her doing mr krumas you dont need to know that my uncle said quickly it wont help find her petra got into something over her head her laptop is missing so we cant check the websites she visited but either she got in with a dangerous crowd on her own or something she was doing for the campaign got her in trouble does she have a drug habit i didnt recognize no damn you to hell gambling get your mind out of the gutter you live in my girls were brought up to live decent lives i dont tolerate the crap that tony let you get away with if petra was kidnapped its because you introduced her to those fucking anacondas my uncles roar brought people out of their cubicles to stare at us they did a double take at the sight of brian and began moving their thumbs madly over their handhelds a small crowd gathered fast some staffers demanding autographs others just cheering their boy id better say a few words brian muttered to us to his team he flashed his bobbyesque smile holding up a hand to acknowledge the applause like a modest major leaguer acknowledging a home run he gave a quick thankyou to the group for their hard work a mention of petras disappearance and how worried he knew they all were an assurance that if a sparrow fell brian krumas would rescue it thats it guys these are a couple of people who are going to help us find petra he ushered peter and me into a nearby conference room ill talk to the fbi of course butvic is itbetter fill me in on what you know i think she ran out the back door of my building i said im hoping she ran clean away from the two people she was with but i cant imagine where shes gone i need to talk to her college roommate no you dont peter screamed you need to stay the fuck away from thisfar far away from thisand let george handle it peter were all upset but youre not just useless youre dangerous my uncle shouted george knows more than any detective ive ever heard of private or public including the fbi hell find petra without letting it get messy if you look for her chances are shell burn to death in front of your eyes i turned very cold but i said levelly petra was looking for something the last few weeks she organized an outing to your old place in back of the yards she was on houston street ten days ago when someone forced an evacuation from my old home she went to the freedom center three days after sister frances died what was petra looking for something for you mr krumas or was it for you peter is that why she was claiming an interest in the warshawski past my uncle shook his head like a cornered bull my girl wants to look at her family roots and you want it to be some filthy story involving the anacondas or whatever mud you wallow in i thought of petras fixation with the nellie fox baseball i dumped the red sweatshirt and scarlett ohara hat on the conference room table and pulled the ball from my case why did petra want this so badly peter peter and brian both bent over my hand looking at the ball with the same puzzlement and then my uncles face turned the color of putty sweat covered his face so fast it was as if he had sunk in a pool of water what is it brian asked its nothing its an old baseball peter muttered but he was clutching a chair back for support i began to worry about his heart but when i said id get water and call rachel he brushed my hand away with a violent gesture leave rachel out of this my apartment was ransacked two nights before petra disappeared is this what they were looking for how should i know my uncle said his voice had lost its belligerence youre the one whos so friendly with the blacks in this city not me the people in my apartment werent black someone saw them of course my witness said he couldnt make out their race but my patience was wearing thin did petra mention the ball in one of her daily chats home did you tell her to come back to my place to get it nellie fox she knew i was a nellie fox fan so she peter who are you protecting petra had never heard of fox when i mentioned his name she thought the sox had put a woman at second why wont you tell me what the story is with this ball there is no story theres nothing to know about it i rolled the ball in my hand while my uncle watched uneasily the door opened and strangwell and dornick came in with harvey krumas who looked in surprise at my uncle and me once again though it was strangwell who spoke first brian the kids said youd popped in here weve got global entertainment in the situation room ginas here to do your makeup the candidate let strangwell lead him away but harvey krumas and dornick demanded to know why peter wasnt back at the drake lying down you look like crap pete whats going on here brian wanted to talk to me i said peter wanted to stay close to me we were talking about what petra might have been looking for in my childhood home any hunches dornick said i dont know petra so i dont know what might have struck her fancy girls her age get romantic ideas about family history sometimes maybe she thought there were warshawski heirlooms mr krumas you know her better than i do youre her uncle harvey after all peter says she wasnt looking for a baseball this is outrageous harvey fumed petes sick with worrywe all areand youre treating this like some video game i tossed the baseball in the air caught it and put it into my briefcase youre right ill get this to a lab see what they can tell me about it and start searching for petra no peter said how many times do i have to repeat it stay the fuck out of this dornick said out of curiosity vickivicif you were going to look for her where would you start i started at her apartment but someone had been there ahead of me since peter doesnt want me looking im not going to hunt elsewhere but i would probably talk to larry alito alito krumas and dornick spoke his name in unison then dornick said i wouldnt trust much that an alkie like larry would have to say he met with les strangwell a couple of days ago id like to know what strang how do you know that krumas demanded im an investigator mr krumas its my job to find out stuff im not sure what it would take to get alito to tell me about that conversation or some of the other things he knows but guy would sell his wife for a sixpack probably turn in his own kid for a keg stay away from him vic hes bad news dornick was giving me an indulgent smile as if i were a toddler who needed extra coaching hes shorttempered and he drinks but hes an experienced cop and strangwell wanted him for an urgent confidential assignment the day before petra disappeared dornick laughed you think larry has something to do with petras disappearance im surprised youve made it in this field as long as you have vic an imagination like yours belongs on tv speaking of which what are you imagining about that nellie fox baseball and you know its a nellie fox baseball because the words hung in the air for a moment harvey looked like a stuffed bear on a mantelpiece and then dornick laughed and said lucky guess fox was the household god in your grandfathers family for everyone except your renegade father pete let me give you a lift up to the drake vic listen to your uncle and stay the hell away from searching for petra what on earth is going on i left the men hailing cabs on michigan avenue i wanted to see all three of them out of sight before reclaiming my car but even then i took a roundabout route catching a bus down michigan to the south end of grant park where only a handful of tourists passed the homeless guys lying on the grass and it would be easier to see if i had company everything in the meeting id just left was setting off warning bells when peter should have been with his wife or talking to cops or even talking to me why was he huddled with harvey krumas and george dornick in a meeting in the office of chicagos most feared political op and then there were the repeated injunctions for me to stay away from petra as if they knew where she was or maybe had received some kind of threat or even a ransom note it wasnt until i sat at the foot of a statue on a shallow flight of stairs that i realized how tired i was using the red sweatshirt from my briefcase as a pillow i leaned back against the crumbling concrete steps and shut my eyes the nellie fox baseball meant something important even devastating to peter harvey krumas and dornick both knew about the ball that was clear from their reactions petra had been ordered to get it from me that was why she had behaved so oddly about it with her clumsy story about wanting it for a surprise present for her father dornick or krumas or even les strangwell had learned that i had the ball probably because petra had burbled away about it at the office i could almost hear her gusty laugh as she informed her pod mates in the netsquad can you believe i thought the white sox had played a woman at second daddy would disown me if he learned i didnt know about nellie fox my cousin says he was like a big star a hundred years ago all the millen gen interns texted or twittered constantly nellie fox transgender ballplayer would become part of twitter that day that part was easy to imagine word filtered up to whom the candidate the chicago strangler the candidates father one of them told petra she had to get the baseball from me that much i could believe but i wasnt sure that the ball was what the thugs whod torn apart my house and office had been hunting for why had they taken the picture of the slowpitch team if all they wanted was the ball it doesnt make sense i said so lost in thought i spoke out loud thats what i be saying all along it dont make no sense those rockets they send up they messing with the weather then they use their cellphones to watch you see if you know what they up to the speaker had been around the corner of the statues plinth from me on another short flight of steps when he realized i was actually listening to him he asked for a donation so he could get something to eat i stared at him without seeing him they use their cellphones to watch you they were watching me theyd tailed me this morning were they watching petra as well damn it little cousin who are you working for not dornick or hed know where she was maybe he did know where she was maybe that was why he didnt want me looking for her i thought about flipping a coin heads he doesnt know where petra is tails he does was that what they were all talking about in strangwells office how will it play out for brian krumass campaign if we produce petra versus us leaving her in hiding was that why my aunt had gone back to overland park because dornick assured her he knew where the kid was and would produce her safe and sound but that really made no sense petra helping thugs break into my office and then they put her on ice well maybe i could see it they didnt want their thugs idd so they wanted to keep petra away from the cops on an impulse i tried rachels cellphone it rolled over to her voice mail i tried her home number in overland park the phone was answered by a man who refused to say who he was or where rachel was only that he would take a message for rachel i couldnt tell a complete stranger to ask rachel whether dornick knew where petra was hiding the man answering the phone could be anywhere in the world intercepting rachels and peters calls and he could be working for anyone i gave him my name and number but no other details then demanded to know who he was someone whos answering the phone he hung up i hugged my knees to my chest after the navy pier fundraiser les strangwell had pulled petra onto his personal staff it was then that shed suddenly announced an interest in my childhood home and the house in back of the yards and in my dads possessions in the trunk she knew i had the baseball so there was something else that strangwell wanted her to find a photograph since intruders had stolen the picture of my dads team something involving baseballs or baseball teams what did i have that could matter to les strangwell and george dornick nothing nothing at all except obviously the nellie fox ball which brought me back to where i started spinning like a globe no nothing as grand as a globe spinning like water spiraling down the drain peter and george dornick wouldnt care about brians campaign only les strangwell and the candidates father would put that first but when i showed up unannounced they kept on talking behind closed doors for half an hour they were deciding on how to handle me but what were they deciding to do about petra and why had my aunt gone home was it a game to you little cousin or did they utter those mystic magic words national security and get you to believe them they told you under no circumstances to confide in me what about your uncle sal not uncle sal uncle sam uncle sam be watching you he know when you be sleeping he know when you awake he say it all be for national securitys sake my partner on the other side of the statues plinth was still in full throttle on the people he said were watching him since i myself kept talking out loud it was hard for me to feel that i was a more stable girder on the bridge than him when was it paranoia and when were they really watching you i got up and pulled a five from my pocket for my companion one thing about our outbursts theyd driven everyone else away from us although these days with so many people spouting their secrets into the ether it was hard to know who had real friends and who had invisible ones i crossed lake shore drive at roosevelt road and waited for a northbound bus at the natural history museum my cousin was queen of the texters when we were riding back from south chicago together and i mentioned i hadnt heard her on her phone shed confessed shed been texting had she sent a message to strangwell telling him we hadnt been able to get into the houston street house did he send a team down then to throw a smoke bomb into my old house so they could search for what petra texting shed been texting at the freedom center petra leaning in the doorway to caroline zabinskas apartment her hands busy in front of her id been ninety percent unconscious and she hadnt thought id notice but maybe shed summoned the person who collected the bag of evidence id been gathering those pieces of the molotov cocktail bottles i wanted to send to the cheviot labs to test what kind of accelerant had been used the fbi and homeland security had both been watching the freedom center building but theyd claimed they didnt have any record of the person whod broken in to get my evidence bag so they knew whod gone in and didnt care or someone who had very big clout persuaded the feds to look the other way they had photographed me going in that night but not petra and not the person whod stolen the evidence bag and then the very next day the apartment was taken apart by some tame construction company paid for by a man who wanted to make a donation to the sisters for the freedom center very cute brian krumas had said something critical during the meeting it had only registered at the time as a faint puzzler and now playing back what i could remember of the conversation i couldnt put my finger on it it was something about his relationship with my uncle something that connected my uncle to sister frankie but the more i pushed on it the further it retreated from my mind petra wasnt a drug user i was sure of that despite putting the question to peter as for gambling or some other expensive vice i couldnt picture it but i wouldnt have pictured her breaking into my office either i was tangling myself up like a bowl of cold spaghetti assume for sanitys sake that petra was an unwitting or unwilling partner in strangwells machinations she was an overgrown puppy not a malicious schemer if she was in over her head i needed to help her out if she was trying to hide out in this big bad city or if she was hitchhik ing to her friend kelseys homeland security or even george dornicks mountain hawk security team could track her easily i needed to warn her they know when youre sleeping they know when youre awake and if youre texting they can find you so fast it will take you completely by surprise i pulled out my phone i didnt have the nimble thumbs of a twentyyearold but i tapped out petra wherever u r stop texting calling take battery out of phone disconnect u can b traced by gps lay low until i send all clear trust me vic please trust me little cousin i begged in my head i promise if you are in the hands of baddies i will not jeopardize your safety but if you are hiding and scared let me clear this up im putting my best person on it of course i too could be traced through my cellphone piece of cake for a sophisticated crew i called my voice mail and left a message that i would be off cellphone for a while and gave the number of my answering service for people to call i took out the battery and stuck it in my briefcase five buses had stopped while id been churning over what i knew or didnt know i boarded the next one a number that lumbered over to michigan and slowly took me up to the hotel where id left my car this morning when i handed my ticket through the cashiers window i was told someone had already paid for my parking i asked to see the receipt sure there was some mistake but when the attendant found it it was for cash no one could remember what the man looked like who paid the bill but hed described the car told them the ticket number even paid a lostticket premium strangwell or homeland security wanted me to know they could find me and deal with me whenever it suited them i drove home slowly meandering along the side streets not because i wanted to check for the tail that was surely behind me but because i was too tired for speed they could find me and stomp me out why hadnt they done so already maybe because they thought i had whatever it was they were looking for as soon as i produced whatever it was they would dispose of me sister frankies head full of flames appeared in front of me and i shuddered so violently that i had to pull over to the curb until it passed the hunt with a full pack of hounds closing in on a lame and limping fox and her brash and ignorant cub that was my cousin and me just now i went back to my burrow because i didnt know where else to go but i didnt feel safe reaching home i took my neighbor and the dogs into the backyard away from any possible surveillance and explained the situation as best i could given how little i understood of it myself you dont think peewees pa is really in on this mr contreras was horrified i think he knows what his pals are looking for and hes a frightened man indeed but i dont believe he knowingly put his kid in harms way so where is she the old man fretted i shook my head im too tired to think clearly im hoping shes run away hoping they dont know where she is if she calls you tell her to lay low then tell her to hang up at once before they can trace her these guys have me totally off balance if only i had the faintest idea what they want a bass ride or was it vile the old man and the dogs helped me search my apartment for any obvious intruders or bombs mr contreras offered to feed me but i was too tired to eat as soon as they left i went to bed and fell deeply asleep i was so tired none of my anxieties had the power to disturb me but when my phone rang at one in the morning i was instantly awake petra i cried into the mouthpiece ms warshawski is that you the voice on the other end was diffident who is this i choked out i woke you again im sorry it seems like its only in the middle of the night that i have the courage to talk to you id been so sure the call would be from petra or a ransom demand that i couldnt think of anyone else any other context i lay back in the bed trying to calm my pounding heart enough that i could think i saw about your cousin on the news its a terrible worry when someone you love disappears on you the hesitant voice was flat behind the speaker came the sound of hospital pages rose hebert my skin crawled she had snatched petra so that i could understand how bereft shed been at losing lamont gadsden knowing how you must be suffering ive been feeling guilty that i havent been wholly truthful with you she took a breath the way she had the last time she called in the middle of the night when she launched into the painful admission of her love for lamont gadsden when you asked if i knew another name steve sawyer might be using i said no but back in the sixties the anacondas they all took african names lamont his code name in the gang was lumumba there was a long silence during which i thought i might break into hysterical laughter petra had disappeared perhaps been kidnapped and the only thing rose could think of was her longvanished lover it was hard to think of a response but in the end i asked what steve sawyers gang name had been i dont know but it was probably african like i told you johnny merton he gave his girl an african name johnny was big on all those african independence movements he made lamont study up on lumumba and lamont talked to me about lumumba and the congo that summer the summer before he disappeared when he was trying to persuade me to be liberated with him her voice trailed off into the confusion of memories of adolescence where liberation meant sex as well as politics i wondered why rose hadnt told me earlier what about me would have made her think i would find african nationalism shocking she answered in her halfdead voice i guess i was afraid if i told you about lamont and lumumba you might be well like some folks like my daddy even who thought if you called yourself after an african national hero you were next door to being a communist and then youd stop looking for lamont i managed to thank her and to tell her not to worry that id see whether i could find lamont under his nom de guerre is there anything else it would be good for me to know something we could cover tonight it may be hard to reach me for the next week or so she thought about it seriously but decided she didnt have any more secrets to reveal at least not this morning after she hung up i lay back down but i couldnt get back to sleep my brain started jumping around again among all the confused ideas id had yesterday afternoon lumumba i tried to think about patrice lumumba but it wasnt a good meditation instead visions of his torture and death blended with my images of sister frankies death my fears about petra my fears for my own safety i sat up id heard the name lumumba recently it was connected in my mind to my father which didnt make any sense at all it was my mother not my father who cared about international politics she would have talked about lumumbas murder but i would have been too young at the time for the name to stay with me i went into the living room and plugged in my laptop sitting crosslegged on the couch i looked up lumumba he had died in i couldnt possibly be remembering a conversation about him that went that far back into my childhood since i was awake and alert i searched for lumumba in the databases i use for background checks i found a singer with the name and a doctor in new york but deeper looks at them showed that both were too young to be lamont gadsden under a new name it was two in the morning the heart of darkness the time of deepest loneliness i thought of morrell in mazärisharif and wondered if he too was awake and lonely or if his old friend marcie love was keeping him company or perhaps a new friend more in tune with his mind than i had been these were such strange times we were living through the age of fear with endless war around the world never knowing who we could trust with our bank accounts and our emails an open book to any gardenvariety hacker even though i use the web constantly im an oldfashioned detective i do better on foot and in person than through the ether someone had gone after petra the oldfashioned way breaking into her apartment had they made off with her laptop or had she taken it with her i looked again at the rudimentary surveillance footage from my office camera that id emailed myself it didnt look to me as though any of the office breakerspetra or her two companionswere carrying a backpack or anything big enough to be holding her laptop so someone had gone after that looking for her emails i supposed or to see whether shed been looking up african national heroes spy software of course petra had used my office computer my big mac pro one night at the beginning of the summer that was how shed known my keypad code i wasnt a hightech wizard but i knew enough to see which websites shed been looking at they might tell me something and it was better anyway than sitting in the dark feeling the age of fear close in on me i started to get dressed again but i paused while zipping my jeans i had to assume from now on that whatever i did wherever i went id have some shadow from homeland security or mountain hawk or maybe both and id just as soon not be caught alone on the streets in the middle of the night even if i could sneak out to my car it was possibleperhaps probablethat theyd installed some kind of gps tracker in it some little gizmo i wouldnt be able to find easily they wouldnt have to stay with me on the streets to keep tabs on me they could use their hotshot triangulation software to watch me online a thump on the back stairs made my heart jump again i took the smith wesson and slipped into the kitchen tiptoeing on the tile i laid my head against the door and squinted out through the glass and felt another bubble of hysteria rise in me the sound was jake thibaut hauling his double bass up the back stairs to the third floor i put the gun down and unlocked the kitchen door when thibaut reached the upper landing he jumped almost as much as i had on hearing him v i warshawski dont sneak up on me like that i dont have insurance that covers dropping bass down stairs when surprised by detectives sorry i said im so edgy these days that when i heard you i thought it was my housewreckers on their way back where were you playing ravinia and then we went out for a drink or three what are you doing up at this hour any word on your cousin he drew the bass up next to him if anyone has heard about my cousin theyre not telling me i measured myself against the basss case an idea coming to me how drunk are you bass players dont get drunk its one of our hallmarks long tall instruments give their players hollow legs why you want me to bow a perfect fourth for you i want you to smuggle me in your case out to someplace where i can catch a cab and not be seen he was quiet for a minute and then said how drunk are you not drunk terrified he rested the bass against his back door you dont seem like the terrifiable type no of course not we pis thrive on death and danger we dont have the feelings ordinary people do im a disgrace to the club letting trifles like a missing cousin and a murdered nun rattle me in the dim light coming from my kitchen window i saw him give me a speculative look anyone going to shoot at me or set me on fire if i wheel you out to belmont avenue anything is possible you ever been held up by a junkie who thinks he can sell your fiddle for a fix thibaut laughed softly one advantage of playing a really big instrument people know they cant race off down the street with it let me put bessie to rest and ill be with you i hope youre clean i dont want sweat and grease or anything on the inside of the case i went back into my place and carefully wiped all the protective cream from my face and arms i realized i was hungry i hadnt eaten since breakfast yesterday morning fatigue and anxiety had kept me from thinking about food but i was suddenly ravenous thibaut came into my kitchen as i was hastily putting together a cheese sandwich you cant eat inside the case he said probably you wont be able to breathe in it either the old guy downstairs is going to sue me if you suffocate nah hell just let the dogs chew on your bass thibaut helped himself to a chunk of the pecorino i was eating i cant carry you down the stairs im not sure the case would hold your weight but im sure i cant ill come down the front stairs and get out to the garden through the basement door when youre at the bottom of the back stairs ill try to creep along in your shadow ill wait to climb into the case until youre at the back gate you can wheel me down the alley to your car i went into my bathroom to rub mascara on my cheekbones so they wouldnt reflect light back from the streetlamps i hoped it wouldnt come off in thibauts case i put on a navy windbreaker and stuck my keys and my new wallet with cash and passport inside in my hip pocket i checked that the safety on the smith wesson was on pulled a cubs cap low over my forehead and ran as lightly as i could down the front stairs the only difficult moment came as i passed mr contrerass front door mitch let out a sharp bark and a whine demanding to join me once i went past him and into the basement he quieted down when i slid back the bolt on the basement exit thibaut was just bumping his case down the last flight of backporch steps i waited for him to reach the walk then slipped into his shadow he worked the move like a pro not looking over his shoulder for me but pulling out his phone and complaining to someone he addressed as lily you must be stoned as well as drunk to want to practice the schulhoff piece this hour of the night but my little chickadee to hear is to obey im on my way at the back gate i managed to stuff my sixtyeightinch frame into the fiftysixinch case as thibaut had warned i could barely breathe the few minutes where he bumped along the broken concrete into the alley and panting and wheezing laid the case across the flattenedout entrance to the backseat were an agony for my spine and neck once i was on the seat he unhooked the cases hinges i pushed the lid up a few inches with my knees so that i could straighten out my spine again without looking over his shoulder thibaut asked for my office address i told him he could drop me on belmont where id flag a cab v i warshawski i didnt seriously risk the life of this twentytwohundreddollar case to drive you four blocks tell me where youre going i didnt put up a serious fight i was glad of the offer i sent him on a route up past wrigley field turning onto side streets until he was sure no one was following him finally we drove to an intersection a block north and east of my office if the office was under surveillance i didnt want anyone registering thibauts car in a database i flexed my spine and did a few neck stretches before leaning into the drivers window to thank him whos lily the fox terrier we had when i was a kid when all this is over ill play a concert for you the schulhoff concertino to commemorate my most exciting performance since my marlborough festival debut he squeezed my fingers where they rested on his open window the warmth of his hand stayed with me as i slipped into the shadow of the buildings on oakley confession in myspace i didnt know any unobtrusive way to get into my office the alley exit opens only from the inside and the windows are twelve feet from the ground it would have to be through the front door at this hour of the morning all the trendy bars and cafés in the area are closed the coffee shop across the street would open in a few hours but right now its glass front gleamed black under the streetlamps like a pond i moved cautiously down the street gun in hand no one was out that i could see but if pros were conducting surveillance it could be done by remote camera they wouldnt have to be on the street a rat leaped from a garbage can at my approach and i came close to screaming i had to stop and gulp down the wave of panic that swept over me as it ran out onto the sidewalk still i couldnt hold back a little cry a car drove up the street and turned left onto cortlandt it was missing a taillight dornick looked like the buttoneddown type who wouldnt let you work for him if your car was missing a light or would he use a car like this to make me think he wasnt watching me or he could be enough the age of fear makes you crazy i took a breath crossed the street and tapped in the new door code to my building the lock wheezed as it always did a loud sound in the still night but i was tired of fear i boldly opened the door stopping long enough to tap each of the numbers on the pad so that anyone using a uv spray wouldnt be able to tell which ones unlocked the door i flicked on the lights not caring that they would spill out onto the street and advertise my presence my office suite still had a crime scene seal across the door but i broke it and went into the chaos for a moment my spirits flagged again on seeing the mess i made a feeble stab at straightening things out putting drawers back in the desk returning ordnance maps to their shelves but the chaos was overwhelming i wondered who i could hire to help since the temporary agency had backed away from me at warp speed i tried to remember the date that petra had been in my office to use my computer but i could only guess it had been around two weeks before the navy pier fundraiser i set up a program to find all the internet sites visited during those weeks while the program ran i knelt to collect papers from the floor gathering them in a big bundle and laying them on the couch one of the documents was the transcript of the steve sawyer trial i flipped through the pages looking again for my fathers name but instead lumumba jumped out at me lumumba has my picture steve sawyer had said on the stand lumumba lamont in the anacondas secret code lamont had sawyers picture what did that mean was it some cryptic way of saying that lamont had fingered him or did it mean he was expecting lamont to testify for him as in lamont has my picture lamont has my back i wondered if curtis rivers would interpret curtis rivers i smacked my forehead african names kimathi that was what rivers called the man who swept the sidewalk in front of his store while my internetsearch program was running i pulled up a separate browser window and looked up kimathi dedan kimathi a rebel leader in kenya in the s feeling a sort of nervous dread i put the name into the illinois department of corrections database there he was january convicted of murdering harmony newsome served forty years released a year ago january no time off for good behavior often in isolation for unspecified violent outbreaks living since his release on seventieth place at the same address as fit for your hoof i stared at the screen for a long time remembering riverss fury when id asked where to find steve sawyers of hammer mertons scorn when i asked him the same question my brain was frozen i couldnt concentrate on those old anacondas or miss claudias dying needs if petra hadnt gone missing id have driven straight to curtis riverss shop and camped out until he and kimathisawyers emerged and then id have energetically convinced them to tell me what had happened to lamontlumumba but petra was fragmenting my mind and sapping my energy i closed the browser window the search program had finished turning up over a thousand urls for the ten days id bracketed i started scrolling through them startled to see the amount of time i spent on the internet it took about twenty minutes for me to find where petra had been but once i got there it was dead easy to follow her in shed been updating her myspace pages she hadnt logged in as petra warshawski instead her page was called campaign girl i had to create my own myspace page to look at petras i signed up under peppys full name princess scheherazade of dupage and even created an email address for her i began to see why people liked using the site the process of making up peppys biography and interests the music she listened tocurrently you aint nothin but a hound dogtook me away from my dark disasterfilled office and my fears for my cousins safety for twenty minutes i was in a fantasyland of my own creation campaign girl loved natalie walkers urban angel she had five hundred friends to read the messages they sent her i needed petras password trying to figure that out would require either better computer tracking skills or more inside knowledge of petra than i had i concentrated on the posts shed made on her profile page she started by explaining that she had to post anonymously because she was working on an important senate campaign and if she said anything under her own name or her candidates name she could get both of them in trouble so im just campaign girl for now and all of you homeys out there please dont screw up and call me by my real name not unless you want me to lose my job and that goes quintuple for you hank albrecht wanting stuffy old janowic to win my boy is going to beat yours with one hand behind his back and i have a bottle of beer riding on it i looked up hank albrecht one of petras friends he had gone to college with my cousin and was in chicago working for the incumbent a few days later petra was writing about the work she was doing for brian whom she scrupulously only called my candidate i know all you vegans out there think im the wickedest person on the planet but i love being the meat queen showing up at a sunday barbecue loaded down with ribs and sausages mostly its for my teammates on the campaign whoever thought work would be this much fun im like doing blog searches to see who has bad stuff to put out against my candidate like anyone could and the whole world wouldnt know it was the biggest crock ever but everyone who meets my candidate thinks mr president four years down the road so we have tons of media and money and everything and im like saint joan on a charger going out and looking for dragons who want to attack us it wouldnt take a sophisticated code breaker to realize who petra was or who her candidate was based on her posts in fact as i skimmed the comments it was clear that many of her myspace friends knew that the candidate was brian there was competitive ribbing from hank albrecht the guy working for the incumbent there were passionate probrian posts and then there were quite a few people who wrote about altogether unconnected stuff dogs clothes favorite restaurants petra wrote about mr contreras and me i was codenamed dc for detecting cousin every now and then i go over to see uncle sal not that were really related and dc who really is my cousin shes like almost my moms age isnt that weird uncle sal who my detecting cousin only calls mr c he cant get enough of my dads companys ribs or of me my cousin is jealous of me isnt that fun uncle sal likes to flirt with me and it used to be her you know sometimes they seem like an old married couple having the same kind of squabbles everyones parents do oh my god we all may end up like our parents isnt that freaky i went over yesterday and uncle sal was scolding dc for wanting to go talk to this old gang leader whos doing a hundred years for murder or whatever and shes like it bugs me that people are too pissed off at me to answer the simplest questions and im like so put on your biggirl underpants and move on and uncle sal thought that was hysterical and laughed his head off so dc got really huffy but was trying not to show it i mean i thought being a detective was more dramatic like solving murders collecting clues not going out to prison to talk to some kind of ignorant black gangbanger i remembered that episode and it made me angry that petra had put it out for the whole world to read about i made a face at the computer screen put on your biggirl underpants now vi i muttered and read on i focused on her posts about the work shed done for brian wondering if any of dragons shed been sent to slay would turn out to be biting back but they seemed innocuous enough she had tracked down a rumor that brian had been seen in a rush street leather bar shed handled a post that hed taken money from someone whod been arrested for selling kiddie porn shed written about dc breaking into her apartment the night she dropped her keys by the front door and then we came to the navy pier fundraiser we had this huge fundraiser and i am like a superstar because my candidate chose one of my guests for his big photo op my guest was a world war ii hero and he wore all his battle medals and everything and was on the front page of a bunch of papers including the washington post which my dad always says is a liberal rag but its so important anyway im like a star at the campaign even though it was a total fluke but the head of the campaign who we all call the chicago strangler was superimpressed and pulled me out of the netsquad to do special assignments directly for him some of my coworkers are a little huffy cause some of them have been with my candidate from day and im a joaniecomelately but well thats life up through that post petras tone had been like her speaking voice breezy confident a few days later she wrote more soberly i thought they promoted me because i did such a great job turns out it was because i cant keep my big mouth shut i said some stuff about something that the strangler wants to know more about something that happened a million years ago that could come back to bite my candidate its so confusing its something i said but i have no idea what but now the strangler says i have to dig it up even though i dont know anything about what happened or even what im really looking for its like spy vs spy and i have to spy on my dc which in some ways is fun seeing if i can outsmart a person whos been a detective for twenty years but mostly i hate it because the strangler says i cant trust anyone he says if i tell a single soul what im looking for it could get people killed especially if i tell my detecting cousin the strangler says shell go out of her way to hurt people i care about and i know that when shes angry she goes off the deep end she saved this homeless guys life but she almost killed me because i didnt respect her mothers dress so watch campaign girl morph into undercover girl a week went by and petra made her final post if you say something that puts everyone you care about in danger only you dont know that its a big secret are you really to blame and then how do you know who is your friend and who is your enemy i cant tell anymore i wish id never come to chicago but its too late i cant go home i sat back in my chair and rubbed my eyes petra with her perpetual cheerful broadcasting of everything she knew had said something that put the powerful people around her on alert defcon and dropping i could hear the alarms ringing in les strangwells office i didnt know the things that petra might have talked over in the officethese clearly ranged from my breaking into her apartment for her since one of her web posts dealt with that to my visiting johnny mertonbecause shed even blurted that out at the navy pier fundraiser certainly anyone reading the posts on her myspace profile would know what she was doing i imagined the strangler coldly reading over her shoulder he could be any one of those five hundred friends invisible like a shark floating under her toes i had an uncomfortable memory of the morning in my apartment when id blown up over her pawing through my trunk my anger had frightened her and it had created a gulf between us i thought again of all the times my dad had told me my temper would get me into serious trouble my god hed been right but id never taken his words seriously to heart i had to find petra i didnt even know where to begin my search i felt like something large and clumsy a rhinoceros easy to spot as it crashed through the underbrush and about as effectual an ally in times of trouble i made a list of things id said or done and things petra seemed interested in johnny merton and the anacondas the house in south chicago where petra had stood watching when the thugs threw their smoke bomb through the window the nellie fox baseball her obsession with whether my dad had left a diary her arrival at the freedom center the night i went to collect evidence her nervous whisper that she couldnt look for the contractors whod been hustled into sister frankies apartment it was four in the morning id slept for seven hours until rose heberts phone call woke me but fatigue born of stress my stillhealing body and my recent sleepless nights was overwhelming me i went into the little back area and reassembled my cot and air mattress oblivious to the threat of another breakin i sank back into sleep a different car a new crib in my dream miss claudia was standing over me lamont will come back she said in clear plain speech my bible tells me so she was waving her red leather bible under my nose she shook loose the dozens of cardboard page markers when i put my hands out to catch them they turned into photographs and floated to the floor before i could reach them if i could only study them they would tell me exactly where petra was and why shed run away but when i gathered up the pictures they burst into flames in my hands and suddenly i was holding sister frankie her skin yellowwhite beneath the burning candle of her hair behind her larry alito and george dornick were laughing with harvey krumas and my uncle and strangwell was there pointing to my uncle and saying you know why she had to die i woke sweating and weeping for a moment i was disoriented in the black space i thought i was back in beth israel with bandages over my eyes and i flailed around my cot trying to find the call button for the nurse awareness gradually returned i swung my legs over the edge of the cot and fumbled my way to a light switch moving slowly to keep from tripping over the drawers that had been dumped on the floor it was eight in the morning long past time for me to get going my leasemate has a shower at the back of her studio because she welds big pieces of steel and polishes them with caustic substances and needs to be able to wash off in a hurry i stood under a cold spray of water trying to wake myself up and returned shivering to my own office to put my clothes back on i picked up the list id made in the middle of the night of the things that petra seemed to be trying to track and took it with me to the coffee shop across the street while i waited in line for my espresso i saw elton grainger out front hawking streetwise and accepting donations with his usual unsteady bow and flourish i took my drink along with a bag of fruit yogurt juice and some rolls and went out to the street elton ive been hoping for a word with you i held out the bag help yourself juice muffin hey vic his bloodshot blue eyes shifted uneasily from me to the sidewalk im okay dont need no food today you always need food elton you know what the doc said at the va when you passed out in june you have to stop drinking and start eating so it doesnt happen again you leave me to sort that out i dont need you hovering over me okay no hovering you know my place was seriously busted two days ago i wonder if you saw who went in vic i told you before i aint your doorman i pulled a twenty from my wallet early christmas tip for the nondoorman my cousin was there i want to know if you can id the two people she was with they were all wearing coats even though it was september and hot he eyed the twenty but shook his head dont know any cousin of yours and thats a fact my cousin eltonthe tall cute blondeyou met her with me a couple of times right after you got out of the hospital petra sorry vic i know you saved my life and all but i never heard of her he turned away from me to greet a couple who were heading into the shop streetwise new edition today streetwise i couldnt get him to look at me again finally i pushed the twenty into his hand along with a blueberry muffin and walked up the street toward armitage i was fuming someone had gotten to elton scared him into silence i should have swung by my office yesterday before starting my journey to south chicago should have talked to elton then if me saving his life let alone the twentythe price of a bed for a night or a week in the tankcouldnt budge him someone was putting heavy pressure on him strangwell wouldnt shake down a homeless guy personally that was way beneath him but he knew people who would larry alito for one id seen him with les strangwell the day before petra disappeared strangwell gave him an assignment i know what les wants hed snapped at someone who called to check up on him could it have been dornick i turned around and went back to my office where i once again called up the images from my video camera it was impossible to tell who was who if not for my aunt rachels insistence i wouldnt have known the figure in the middle was petra today magnifying details as much as i could it seemed to me that the man on her left was gripping her arm his cap was pulled low over his face his coat collar was pulled high around his chin but the general shape could have been alitos i tried to imagine what it would take to get him to tell me the truth about whether hed been there certainly not my girlish charm would a threat that the fbi was involved worry him not if it came from me he would have too many contacts from his years in the force to worry about veiled and vague threats from me only the possibility that strangwell and his pals would leave him to take the fall might persuade alito to start talking i looked up his phone number and called the house up in lake catherine when hazel answered i asked for her husband larry doesnt want to talk to you she said in her gravelly south side voice i dont want to talk to him either i said but theres something he needs to know i figure i owe him a tiny favor since he used to work with my dad hes been identified as one of the men who forced my cousin petra to break into my office two days ago she was silent im going to call bobby mallory but ill wait four hours before i do you be sure to let larry know okay ms alito larry is one of the guys who i heard you the first time the connection went and i stared at the phone id promised to wait four hours to call bobby but i hadnt mentioned the press i called murray ryersons cellphone and gave him the same message unlike hazel alito murray had a bucketful of questions starting with who had made the identification murray theres a good possibility that every call i make is monitored either by homeland securitys chicago office or by mountain hawk security or both so im not giving away confidential information over the airwaves anyway its not a rocksolid id id doublecheck with les strangwell at the krumas campaign strangwell murrays normal baritone rose an octave what were you sitting on that the krumas campaign cares about why would they hire murray darling im spreading rumors right now i dont have any facts i dont think i have anything that the krumas campaign cares about all i can tell you for sure is that strangwell did meet with alito last week and he asked alito to do something for him where are you in your office ill be there in twenty i cant set up meeting times and places im going to be on the move for the next few days so thats all for now i hung up on a barrage of questions the phone rang again as i checked that i had my wallet keys and gun i pulled my cubs hat low on my head no moisturizers or unguents to protect my healing skin today the cubs those frail reeds would have to look after me my phone was still ringing as i locked my office door behind me if anyone was monitoring my calls i had only a few minutes to get out of the area before they had a watcher in place i didnt run up the street but i walked fast and i turned left at the first intersection as soon as i left oakley i was on a quiet residential street where it was easy to see whether anyone was with me i moved north and west in a random way until i reached armitage i needed to find a car that couldnt be traced to me i couldnt rent one i didnt have my drivers license even if i did homeland security if they were paying attention to me theyd know the minute i rented a car or bought a plane ticket while i was talking to murray i had suddenly thought of not only where i could get a car but also a bolt hole assuming i could cover my tracks coming and going i walked to the el stop not bothering to look around and rode the train into the loop i got off at washington street and walked through the underground tunnel into the basement of the daley center where traffic court and a bunch of other civil courts sit since i had my gun on me i couldnt do the safest thing go through security and watch who came in after me so i followed the maze of corridors and came on the underground entrance to a trendy loop restaurant the staff were just gathering for the day the hispanic stockmakers and cleaning crew they looked at me narrowly but didnt try to stop me i went through the doors into the kitchen and found an exit that took me into a parking garage i walked up the ramp and out onto the street and made my way back to the el where i rode the red line north to howard street it was a long ride and i could watch all the changing characters who got on and off by the time we reached the evanston border i was reasonably confident that i was clear i changed to the evanston train and rode it three stops no one was with me when i got off no bicycles circled around me no cars passed and then repassed me morrell and i had broken up in italy but i still had the keys to his condo and i knew where he had hung the spare key to his honda civic i couldnt afford to use the phone to call anyone i knew but i could spend the night drive the city even change my underwear when i let myself in i found my favorite rosestenciled bra still hanging in his bathroom i thought id lost it in italy the shoemakers tale morrells honda started on the first try which was a relief id worried that the battery might have run down after sitting in the garage for three months going to morrells place had left me melancholy little traces of my life surfaced wherever i lookeda pot of my moisturizer in the bathroom sleeping arrangements which id read aloud to him when he was recuperating from his bullet wounds next to the bed when i put away the juice id bought i found a container of mr contrerass homemade tomato sauce in the freezer morrell and i had spent two years together he had put me back together when id been tortured and left for dead on the kennedy expressway id helped him when hed been left for dead in afghanistan maybe that was the only time we could really help each other when we were near death when we were near life we couldnt sustain the relationship the tomato sauce made me realize i needed to notify mr contreras as well as lotty and max about where id vanished to the easiest person to tell would be max because i could slip into beth israel through a side door and get to his office if anyone was tracking me theyd be keeping an eye on lottys clinic on damen avenue as well as her condo on lake shore drive since max lived in evanston if my friends wanted to reach me max could slip a note under morrells door on his way home it felt queer to be alone in an apartment and to know i couldnt use the phone it was like being in an isolation tank i quickly wrote a note to max telling him where i was how to reach me in this age of the internet and asking him to get word to lotty and mr contreras i picked morrells car keys from the top dresser drawer in his bedroom morrells extreme tidiness which had been a source of friction between usor maybe it was my extreme messiness that bothered himwas useful when it came to finding anything in a hurry in my apartment a team of skilled searchers had torn the place apart without finding what they wanted as soon as i pulled out of morrells garage i felt nervous and exposed morrell had been out of my life all summer i didnt think anyone hunting me would know about him but i could be wrong when all this was over and i had found petra safe and sound i would have to invest in a gps jammer that would force anyone tracking me to follow me physically instead of doing it the lazy electronic way situations like this usually key me up i get just nervous enough to be sharp while remaining confident about my ability to deal with whatever comes along it was petras disappearance coupled with sister frankies death that made me so skittish deep breaths vi i admonished myself deep yogasinger breaths you and the breath are one after a near miss with a heraldstar delivery van i decided meditation and driving werent an ideal mix and returned to skittishness i forced myself to believe i was in the clear got off the side streets and took the main ones to beth israel when i got there i circled until i found street parking at the emergencyroom entrance i went in head up a confident walk security didnt try to stop me even though i didnt have a badge on ive known maxs secretary cynthia dowling for years she had stopped by my room when id been laid up the previous week today she congratulated me on my quick recovery max was in a meeting she said naturally executive directors are always in meetings i gave her the note id written you havent seen me since i was released from the hospital have you cynthia she smiled but her eyes were worried i dont even know your name so i cant say that ive seen you today ill see that max gets this when hes alone do you know anything about your cousin i shook my head not enough of a whisper to even have a direction to follow but im talking to people who can talk to people and maybe one of them will finally start giving me real news i left by a side door and jogged back to morrells car i drove down damen avenue as the closest route to the expressway the light at addison turned yellow just as i got to the intersection without a drivers license without an insurance card for the hondamorrell kept his in his walleti was being very lawabiding i came to a virtuous halt the car behind me honked in annoyance roscoe belmont wellington i counted off the streets out loud nervous about needing to get to the south side ahead of dornick roscoe i shouted the car behind me honked again this time because the light was green and then zoomed around me almost colliding with the northbound traffic roscoe brian krumas had told peter he could stay in the roscoe street apartment the contractors who had shown up at the freedom center were owned by a guy with offices on west roscoe i made a uturn just as the light was turning yellow again forgetting my need to be utterly obedient to traffic signals and having my own near miss with an oncoming bus stupid stupid what had been his name the exact address the nuns at the freedom center could tell me id almost reached irving park road when i realized that if i drove to the freedom center id show up on homeland security cameras i needed a phone or a computer therefore i needed to find an internet café i drove along addison toward the lake just before wrigley field i found what i needed i paid cash for a card that i could stick into one of their machines compared to my mac pro the windows machine they had was painfully cumbersome to use but i logged on to one of my search engines and hunted contractors on roscoe street rodenko that was it west roscoe harvey krumas had an unlisted phone number but i found him too through my best search engine lifestory the house in barrington hills a place in palm springs a flat in london and the piedàterre in chicago at west roscoe three hundred west roscoe i stared at the address harvey krumas was ernie rodenko he owned ernie rodenko either way he had quickly mustered a couple of smalltime contractors to clean up sister frankies apartment and used his home address for the holding company however it had been worked when petra looked up the subcontractors broadcasting the news all over the office in her loud cheerful voice les strangwell heard her les was protecting harvey or was it brian did it matter i felt odd cold hot queasy remote i wasnt fit to drive not the fifteen miles to curtis riverss shop but it was all i could think of i had to find steve sawyer before harvey and strangwell and george dornick turned him into a fall guy for petra i have no memory of leaving the internet café to go to my car or of driving to the south side i dont remember if i stayed on damen or went to the ryan i didnt look for tails i was an automaton moving through space it wasnt until i was walking away from the car that i came back to earth i leaned against a light pole and sang a few vocal exercises forcing myself to breathe to get some semblance of calm for the hard interview ahead when i reached fit for your hoof kimathisawyer wasnt on the street i opened the door to the shop and parted the ropes to the interior id forgotten the whistle and the recorded welcome to chicago announcement and flinched as they sounded the chess players were sitting at their board the balding man with the paunch was still wearing his machinists tshirt the skinny darker one had on an outsize lumberjacks shirt curtis rivers stood behind the counter watching them play a toothpick jutting at a jaunty angle from his mouth the suntimes was on the counter my cousins picture had made the front page have you seen me the screamer headline read the radio was still tuned to npr it was worldview time in chicago the men had been talking but when they looked up and saw me the room became so quiet that even jerome macdonald seemed to sink to a whisper youre not welcome here rivers said gosh and youve been so subtle up to now i never would have guessed tell me about steve sawyer ill tell you all ive said before which is youve got a hell of a nerve to come here and ask about him he changed his name legally to kimathi didnt he before the trial but lamont never went that far he was lumumba only to the inner anaconda circle rivers shifted the toothpick from one side of his mouth to the other but didnt speak i saw a red handbag on one of the ropes made of the kind of leather that i love a soft supple calfskin at his trial kimathisteve was expecting lamont to show up with some pictures wasnt he and lamont never arrived i stuck up an arm and unclipped the bag ask your daddy about that ms detective oh right your daddy is dead pretty convenient isnt it i looked inside the handbag there was a zip compartment where you could put your wallet and a pocket that would just hold your cellphone i was not going to lose my temper and i wasnt going to start yelling about my father you remember george dornick of course since you remember tony warshawski i said still peering into the bag the cold eyes on the far side of the counter didnt give anything away and youve seen the news that my cousin is missing i paused again but still got no response rivers picked up the suntimes cute blond white girl of course its big news im sure the cops can find some black man to implicate before the day is done the chess players were watching me as if i were some complicated move on their board i looked up from the handbag at rivers they already have rivers turned off the radio the quiet became absolute i found a price tag tucked into an outside compartment five hundred thirty dollars a bag like this would be triple that at a downtown store i put it over my shoulder and went to inspect myself in a narrow strip of mirror behind the ropes johnny i continued to study my silhouette mans in stateville hard to see how he could be out grabbing white chicks off the street they figure he still has a lot of friends around town whod do a favor for him theyre going to try to pressure him through his daughter i turned around not in a hurry and leaned against the mirror his daughter rivers frowned what can they do to her what i hear she may not be proud of him but she doesnt pretend she doesnt know him i dont know what they will do but ill tell you what they can do plant evidence that shes trafficking drugs for him plant computer files that show shes dipping into private funds at the law firm where she works i fiddled with the opening on the bag a clever little tongue in hard leather that slipped into a catch when the whistle sounded and the loudspeaker announced welcome to chicago we all jumped i had my hand inside my tuck holster rivers had his under the counter a woman parted the ropes bringing in a pair of high heels that needed new soles rivers bantered with her but kept an eye on me when the whistle blew as she left he said they hurt dayo johnny will get revenge one way or another that wont make him confess to snatching your cousin heres how i see it either my cousin is dead or shes bolted and they dont know where shes run if shes dead if they killed her first they make johnny crazy by screwing with his kid and then they get a stateville snitch to claim he heard johnny confess to putting a contract out on petraon my cousinbecause hes still mad at me for various reasons it was painful to talk casually about petra in such a way clinical detached as if she were a movie script i was reading the really hard sentence came next they say theyll put the rap on kimathi theyll say he killed petra as payback i braced myself in case rivers or his friends came after me and by god he would be in his rights to curtis riverss voice was soft with a menace that chilled my bones why why rivers spat at me what is he supposed to be just one more jesusloving nigger getting tortured but saying i forgive them all because hate curdles the soul he doesnt forgive you and i dont forgive you im not asking you to forgive me but i would very much like to know what i did to earn this anger i had dug my fingers into the soft calfskin of the bag i was still holding in an effort to keep the trembling in my legs out of my voice and hands you would like to know as if you dont mr rivers we had this conversation two months ago i was ten years old when harmony newsome was murdered all i know about the story is from reading newspapers reading the trial transcript and from a brief conversation with sister frances which was cut short by her murder and you were conveniently at her side when she died i held her in my arms as her hair burned my voice did tremble at that i have raw wounds on my scalp and arms and chest and nightmares that dont go away and so does kimathi have those nightmares tell me what happened mr rivers the chess players had been silent almost motionless during our interchange but the machinist said you got to tell her curtis you were out of bounds just now over sister frankie ms detective here never caused frankies death and you know it the lumberjack nodded in agreement rivers scowled at his friends but went into the back of the shop i heard the deep rumble of his voice and frightened cries from kimathi more rumbling fewer cries and rivers came back out with kimathi clutching his arm this woman here her daddy was officer warshawski tell her what happened when they came for you shes going to take away my nature kimathi whispered theres three of us here were bigger than she is she cant cut you or hurt you and you are safe at night she cant break in through all my gates i held out my hands empty hands i cant hurt you mr kimathi it was all on account of harmonys death the way the police reacted to harmonys death i mean the machinist said softly the city didnt care about harmony but harmonys brother did saul was sixteen he was proud of his sister and her death was almost a mortal blow to him until sister frankie persuaded him that they could use the lessons of the movement as a call for justice in harmonys death saul and frankie they started holding a vigil outside the police station every sunday they got tv crews down they got the papers to write it up cops knew they had to pick up someone or the south side would blow up all over again so they picked on kimathi here kimathi was trembling looking at his feet tell her what happened officer warshawski came and picked me up in his squad car rivers prompted he pick me up he take me to the station kimathi whispered his eyes large flicking a glance up at me i kept my hands open in front of me my heart was pounding so hard that the pulses in my neck were choking me i was surprised i didnt know i killed harmony she so sweet so pretty so special too special for me i tell that to the officer and he say save your story for the detectives and the lawyers son im just the man with the warrant for your arrest and then he say like they do you have the right to remain silent and all that stuff and then my mouth was dry and the words came out in a harsh squawk the detectives come in they laugh im the party im the death of the party to them a big joke they tell me i kill harmony they tell me confess make it all easy only i didnt remember killing her now i cant remember one way or another the demons they come and claw at me day and night maybe the demons kill harmony maybe the demons say kimathi you a devil too you in the gang just like pastor always said you a child of the devil you bound for hell go ahead kill that sweet girl for all us demons you never killed a soul in your life kimathi rivers said those detectives messed up your body and messed up your mind you tell this white girl how they did they chain me up he was so ashamed at the memory that he looked at the floor tears seeped from the corners of his eyes they chain me they call me nigger they say i the songanddance man dance for them they put me on the radiator they burn the skin off my butt it bleed they laugh they say i singing for them then they put electricity on my manhood they run a current they say this nigger boy a good dancer they laugh they tell me next they gon cut off my manhood so i tell them the words they want to hear that i kill harmony that blessed child of jesus i felt tears spilling from my own eyes and a revulsion so strong it doubled me over yes a pretty story white girl isnt it rivers said and tony warshawski i managed to whisper he come in the room two times maybe more im hurting too bad to count and what did he do he tell them to stop but they tell him dont act like jesus christ on the dashboard warshawski this for your brother rousting an uncle my legs gave way and i found myself sitting on the floor curtis rivers looked down at me without pity but i didnt want any this for your brother this for peter tony watched alito and dornick chain a man to a boiling radiator watched them run a current through his genitals my daddymy wise and good and loving father my hands were wet i thought i would see blood when i looked at them steve sawyers blood the blood of every prisoner my father had watched in dornicks or alitos custody but it was only tears and snot i dont know how long i sat looking at the dust on the cracked linoleum watching a spider crawl along the baseboard i wanted to lie down on that floor and sleep away the rest of my time on the planet after id found petra after id found lamont maybe i could curl up and die this for peter the christmas eve conversation i had remembered after seeing alito came back to me again my father saying you got your promotion thats enough isnt it and alito replying you want to see him in prison at last i pushed myself up to a standing position again my shoulders ached my father had been tense all fall after the summer of riots i didnt remember anything about the demonstrations that harmonys brother had organized with sister frankie but they would have been outside my dads station i could picture the tension inside the station the mayors office putting heat on them demanding an immediate arrest so the states attorneys office organized a frame get one of the anacondas theyre all guilty of something who knows why they picked on sawyer or who put his name in play larry alito my mind flinched at the idea of naming my father arnie coleman played along as the public defender conveniently assigned to the case you choose the guy most eager for favors most likely to play your game in cook county it didnt take a genius or even very much money to persuade the head of the criminal defenders unit to give you a weak link after all by the time i was with the pd and coleman had moved into the number one chair i saw him do it over and over my coworkers and i knew money was changing hands we just never knew how much i took a shuddering breath and looked at the four men i needed to be a professional in this situation which meant i had to pull myself together i might not have another chance to talk to kimathi mr kimathi if i can ill find the person who really did kill harmony newsome but im afraid that means i need to ask you a few more questions kimathi swallowed convulsively and edged behind curtis at the trial mr kimathi what did you mean when you said lumumba had your picture thats right lumumba has my picture but what picture i asked he told johnny johnny promised and then no one came they all left me they all afraid the demons coming for them i covered with demons he suddenly thrust his head under my face bending over and skewing his body so that he looked at me sideways his tongue sticking out like a mayan mask see my demons see how they crawling on me i willed myself not to back away those arent your demons mr kimathi they belong to the detectives who tortured you you tell those demons to go away to go home where they belong oh they mine they been living with me a long time pastor hebert he told me he told me im bound for hell hanging out with johnny and lumumba instead of coming to church the demons pastor sent them to remind me every day it was close to unbearable talking to him but i managed to keep my voice from cracking what about the pictures what pictures did lumumba have kimathi pulled his head upright and looked at curtis his brow wrinkled in worry lumumba said he had a picture of who killed harmony but did i kill her did he have my picture you never killed her kimathi the machinist said and the white girl is right about the demons theyre not yours send them to the person who owns them as kimathi spoke i realized that was what my houseandoffice wreckers had been hunting the picture that showed who killed harmony newsome thats why petra wanted to see my childhood homes to see if tony had taken that vital piece of evidence away a picture that proved who killed harmony would it be his brother in the frame would tony go that far out of loyalty to his family and steal evidence and hide it at home what happened to lumumba i felt as though i were splitting in two between the emotions pounding inside me and my calm investigators voice asking questions curtis shook his head johnny knows it happened during the blizzard that much i can tell you you were at the waltz right inn the night before the storm i said rivers nodded fractionally lamont came in with johnny like sister rose said they went off into the back room talked between themselves then came out joined the party lamont took off about two am and that was the last time we saw him johnny went with him no and they werent fighting believe me if johnny had wanted to put a hit out on lamont we all would have known but we were scared about what was happening to steve to kimathi i think johnny and lamont were talking about that talking about whatever pictures lamont said he had you think lamont is dead im sure lamont is dead curtis said brother didnt have anyplace to hide that we didnt know about miss ella she had family in louisiana they would have taken him but we still would have heard if anyone knows what happened to lamont its johnny i thought johnny had seen a demon himself when the snow cleared and we all crawled out again after that storm he would never let anyone mention lamonts name on the street around him i squeezed my forehead with my hand what can i possibly offer johnny merton that would get him to talk to me he wants the innocence project working for him but frankly hes not innocent of what they sent him down for but he never killed lamont gadsden i fished in the handbag looking for a tissue before remembering the bag belonged to the shop the machinist chess player pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket and let me wipe my face and hands all four of us knew what i could offer johnny merton proof of who really killed harmony proof of who killed lamont and where his body rested kimathi telling his story me collapsing in the face of it that had shifted the relationships in the room rivers and his friends werent on my side exactly but i was no longer an enemy i guess you could say i was on probation i looked at the soiled handkerchief ill wash this and get it back to you but i have a lot to do first a lot of ground to cover and not much time you need to get kimathi out of here george dornick knows where he is and it would be pathetically easy for them to break in here kimathi has to go someplace where no one would think to look and you have to make double and triple sure that no one is on your back when you move him theyre sophisticated and they have a lot of money to throw around rivers said i have a shotgun and i was in vietnam i can look after no you cant dornick has firepower that makes hamburger hill look like a piethrowing contest listen to her curtis the lumberjack said softly shes telling you for kimathis sake no time for egotripping here brother the machinist nodded well take him away right now you want him ms detective you ask curtis less you know the better he turned to kimathi and began talking to him cajoling him kimathi didnt want to leave without curtis i thought i might start screaming i wanted him outnowbefore dornick or anyone else showed up here i parted the ropes to leave and realized i was still holding the red handbag i returned and put it on the counter this bag has attached itself to me mr rivers and i see anyway that ive stained it i lost all my cards and whatnot in the fire but if you put it away for me ill pay for it when i get the cash together rivers studied me up and down with somber eyes then handed the bag to me im going to take a chance on you ms detective youve extended yourself here today and if you dont come through with the money heck i can leave your body in george dornicks office claim he was responsible it was a feeble joke but we had all been so tense that we burst out laughing all but kimathi who jerked away when he saw me laugh they say i the songanddance man they laugh that sobered me up in a hurry i asked rivers to let me out through the back into the alley just to give myself a little comfort zone on my way out i again urged the chess players to follow with kimathi as fast as possible once i reached morrells car i moved quickly pushed by a nervous energy so frantic that i found myself flooring the accelerator and taking terrible risks in the traffic on the ryan at least i wasnt texting or playing the tuba at the same time i pulled off the expressway got out of the car and tried to take some deep breaths tried to regain some kind of center but all i could see was my dad the face i loved and trusted looking through a oneway window into an interrogation room you all right there a police car had pulled up behind me without my noticing i felt the blood drain into my legs but i clutched the car door and managed a smile thanks i had a cramp in my foot and thought id better get off to work it out the officer tipped a wave but waited until i got into the car and slowly merged onto the ryan he followed me as i studied traffic in my side mirrors kept to the speed limit signaled my lane changes a bubble of hysteria kept threatening to overwhelm me we serve and protect the chicago police motto was he protecting me was he making sure i hadnt pulled over for a drug deal was he bored what did he do in the station when he brought in a suspect i left the ryan again at the main downtown exit and put the car in the underground garage near millennium park i locked the red bag in the trunk if i got to a point where i had to run a bag like that would slow me down it would also be easy for some tracker to follow out on the street the late august sun was blistering and all that i had in the way of protection was my cubs cap no jacket no lotions to protect my skin i felt such a surge of selfloathing anyway that it seemed to me it would be good if the sun peeled the skin off my arms i was in too much of a hurry for public transportation and hailed a cab to take me to the top of michigan avenue theres a vertical shopping mall across the street from the drake hotel where my uncle was staying i went into the mall and found a stationer where i picked up a pad of paper an envelope and a pen the four seasons hotel was attached to the mall at the sixth floor i walked through the connecting door into the subdued colors and calm of wealth smiled at a concierge and found an alcove where i could do some writing i chewed on the capped end of the pen trying to figure out what i wanted to say dear peter your big brother tony covered your ass all those years ago but i know now that you killed harmony newsome there is no statute of limitations on murder and i dont feel tonys protective attachment to you i wont try to save you what im wondering though is why you would sacrifice petra i thought at least you had a fathers normal love for his children if you want to talk to me i will be in the gazebo across from the drake for ten minutes if you dont show ill be on my way will bobby mallory sit on the truth for you vi i sealed up my note in the envelope and addressed it to my uncle across the street i entered the lower lobby of the drake where theres an arcade of shops a bellman was standing near the stairs leading to the drakes main lobby i gave him a five and asked him to deliver the envelope at once then i walked quickly through the arcade to the hotels north entrance it was when i handed the letter to the bellman assume peter was in his room assume the bellman delivered the envelope right away peter would call dornick or alito or les strangwell something should happen within twenty minutes just across the street from the drake is a little park a triangle made by the hotel michigan avenue on the left and lake shore drive as the hypotenuse beyond the drive lie some of the citys most beautiful sand beaches this time of year the oak street beach was packed with tourists tanners swimmers and volleyballers but the triangular park was essentially empty a homeless man was asleep on a patch of grass outside its gazebo i walked along the row of cars parked on the south side of the triangle only one had someone sitting inside there was a service van in front of one of the condos and it could have held a surveillance team but i didnt think dornick or strangwell would feel the need to keep that sophisticated of a watch on peter i walked back to michigan avenue which was filled with shoppers and tourists a trio of black youths banged homemade drums on the corner a tunnel goes under the avenue but i crossed at street level i was in the company of a woman who had a leash with a dog at the end of it in one hand and a cellphone in the other that was glued to her ear a nanny with a baby buggy also on a cellphone was behind me i felt reassuringly anonymous just one more person in a ball cap enjoying the end of summer i sat on a bench in a bus stop on the far corner and watched the park an elderly man with a toy poodle shuffled over from one of the condos near the hotel the dog sniffed at lateblooming orange flowers while the man stared vacantly into the distance a hardmuscled young woman jogged past the gazebo down a ramp leading under lake shore drive and to the beach a few bicyclists emerged on the return route seventeen minutes after id handed the envelope to the bellman my uncle appeared his hair was uncombed his shirttails hung half out of his trousers he certainly wasnt resting easily these days while he looked in and around the gazebo i checked the opposite side of the street no one was lingering on the sidewalks no new cars hovered in the area i climbed down the stairs to the tunnel under michigan avenue and emerged on the path to the beach peter i called sharply over here roughing up the uncle what the hell are you up to close up my uncle looked worse than id thought his eyes were bloodshot he was unshaven and he smelled of stale alcohol what the hell are you up to peter letting petra take the fall so that you dont have to face the goddamn you you ignorant bitch i am protecting my daughter for a moment we both thought he was going to hit me my mouth creased in a sour smile sending her out to find police evidence that tony squirreled away for you involving her in arson and criminal trespass at my old south chicago house and at my current house and office you dont know anything his roar brought the cyclists and joggers around us to a brief halt did i need help i smiled and waved at the concerned citizens who were happy to leave us to our quarrel i kept the smile on my lips and my voice light conversational we didnt need to draw a crowd i know that in steve sawyer was brutally tortured into confessing to a murder he never committed i know he served forty years doing very hard time in your stead and i know he thought there were some photographs proving who really killed harmony newsome in marquette park during that riot i know that larry alito brought evidence of the murder over to our south chicago house back around christmas and that tony took it to keep your sorry ass out of prison i didnt kill harmony newsome peter hissed then who did peter looked around wondering who was listening i dont know brilliant i said it wasnt me i wasnt there i didnt do it every cop and every criminal lawyer hears that line a hundred times their first week on the job you werent in marquette park tony didnt take evidence larry alito shut up i was in marquette park okay is that a crime it was my neighborhood park my friends were all there what you guys went there to play ball and then suddenly in the third inning this huge riot broke out and then what you got lost in the crowd and started throwing bricks and rocks and stuff in the hopes theyd point you to your way home youre just like your tightassed bitch of a mother acting like she was the madonna and all the saints poured into one call me any name you like you twobit bully but do not insult gabriella my hands on my hips my face close to his he backed away the silence lingered between us peter was fidgeting worried about what i knew what i might say but i was weary of him of fighting of myself and when i finally spoke again it took an effort to go through the motions you went to marquette park in but you didnt kill harmony newsome and you dont know who did but you sent petra out looking for the evidence just in case it came back to bite you only its bitten petra instead take it from there tell me how youre protecting her his face was white underneath the stubble dont preach at me youre the one who got petey in trouble in the first place introducing her to gangbangers and taking her to slums no no no my hands were over my ears trying to stop the barrage of lies she wheedled me until i took her to see all the different houses you and grandma warshawski and tony had lived in i thought at the time petra was behaving strangely especially her wanting to see where everyone stored their stuff i tried to get her to tell me why and she wouldnt but of course she wanted to see if by any chance tony had left behind that photograph youre making this shit up to cover your own butt my uncle said peter someone idd petra idd her standing on houston avenue while thugs threw a smoke bomb into the house and ransacked it what did you have her doing people make mistakes all the time when theyre asked to id someone petra wasnt there you might have bought off a witness to get my own cousin in trouble or for any reason whatsoever i wanted to pick him up and bang his head against the concrete barricade above us do you understand i am crazy with worry i will say or do anything to see petra doesnt get hurt and if that means accusing youof anythingill do it you know theyll never let petra walk away from this i said when they find her theyll dump her body someplace where they can implicate one of johnny mertons boys theyd like it to be steve sawyer of course as dornick suggested in strangwells office yesterday dudes already gone down once instead of you why not twice dornick told me back then that sawyer was a killer he and merton both peter burst out sawyer was just going to prison for a different murder than the one he actually did have you ever watched someone put electrodes on a mans balls and run a current through them i asked he squirmed and his hand went reflexively to his crotch after a timeand not a very long timehell say anything to get it to stop tony watched larry alito and george dornick do this to steve sawyer he tried to get them to stop and they told him they were doing it for you i didnt kill the girl damn it sweat poured from peters face although it could have been the hot sun of course my own face was aching from the sun hitting my burns through the cubs cap why did you send petra out to look for the photos i didnt he was hoarse i didnt know what she was up to rachel was worried about petey said she sounded strange subdued not like herself and she stopped calling every day the way she usually did i thought it was the work on the campaign strangwells a hard boss petey isnt used to that much discipline or responsibility was strangwell at marquette park with you in he shook his head les is a friend of harveys helped him on the pr side taught him how to handle congressional hearings that kind of thing harvey was less most important client before the strangler became a political op so of course les moved in to run the kids campaign dornick i prodded was he at marquette park with you dornick was a cop he was in the park but he was holding the line around king we razzed him about it at he stopped realizing how bad that sounded in todays context we i prodded all of us from the neighborhood he muttered harvey krumas was there too i said all of us from the neighborhood and thats all im saying if you didnt kill ms newsome why did tony cave and take evidence when dornick and alito threatened to send you to prison they could manipulate the evidence tony knew that and that nellie fox baseballwhat was it evidence of i dont know what youre talking about he muttered unconvincingly thats what alito dropped off at my dads isnt it the night he said youd go to prison if tony didnt hide it that baseball didnt prove one damned thing george thought he was being so cute he cut himself short when he realized how much he was revealing then continued tony believed me when i swore to him that i never hurt that black girl why cant you cut me the same slack because my dear uncle you are willing to let george dornick put a bullet through my head to protect yourself all over again and despite your protestations that youd do anything for petra i dont see you going to bobby mallory spilling your guts so that your kid can come out of wherever shes hiding and stop fearing for her own life id love to know what theyre giving you thats wonderful enough for you to let everyone around youyour brother me but most of all your daughtertake the fall for you i waited a moment hoping hed say something anything to give me a handle to turn when he remained silent i started down the stairs that led to the tunnel under michigan avenue peter called after me i waited for him at the bottom leave town vic he pulled out his wallet and tried to shove a fistful of twenties at me leave town until all this blows over peter its not going to blow over bobby mallory is already pulling a thread out of this ball of yarn dont tell me your friends can force him to drop the investigation he looked around again if homeland security tells mallory to stop hell stop the interrogation id undergone after sister frankies deathhomeland security had been there and wanted to know what the nun had told me before she diedhad that been at dornicks behest did he or strangwell have so much clout they could shut down a chicago police investigation so theyre waiting for me to produce the photographs before they kill me i said slowly once they have the pictures and im dead theyll feel safe my uncle shifted uneasily maybe no one had said it out loud to him but theyd made it clear that hed get petra in exchange for me and whatever evidence was still floating around from marquette park all those years ago where are you going what are you doing now if you talk to bobby im not telling you what im doing because i dont want to be an easier target for your pal george than i already am if you have anything to say to me put it out on the web ill try to find a safe place to check my emails now and then he grabbed my arm trying to hector me into making a public declaration that i would drop the investigation but i was angry scared and short of time i shoved him away and sprinted through the tunnel and up the other side i jumped into the first cab that came along and rode south to millennium park the skin on my arms and scalp was throbbing from where the sun had burned the raw patches there are a couple of big fountains in the park slabs of glass where water falls from the top and children dance and slide in it as it hits the ground i held my burning arms and head under the water not minding that my clothes were getting wet keeping myself just turned away enough that the water didnt hit my back hip and my gun sitting in its tuck holster i dont know how long i stood soothed by the water oblivious to the exuberant children around me i finally trudged on leaden feet to the garage entrance a man was selling streetwise come on beautiful lets have a smile on that gorgeous face of yours nothing is this bad not if you have a roof over your head and a family that loves you i dont i walked past him into the garage in morrells honda i leaned back in the seat my wet clothes squelching against the vinyl upholstery i could picture morrells expressionannoyance quickly suppressedat my dripping in his car suppressed because hed see how distraught i was my confidence in my fathers essential rightness undermined morrell was so kindand well moralhe would always put his need for order behind another persons need for compassion this for your brother thats what steve sawyerkimathi said dornick and alito had told tony were torturing kimathi for your brothers sake and tony had turned around and left them to it nothing is this bad not if you have a roof over your head and a family that loves you what kind of love had tony given meall that wise patient advicewhat had it been grounded in and my mother how much had she known about steve sawyer and her husbands brother and her husband i thought of some of the men id known over the years my exhusband murray conrad my exhusband and murray ryerson were ordinary ambitious men but morrell at least was decent even heroic maybe i carried some taint id never been aware of something id been unwilling to face melodrama the trouble was id never imagined any taint could be attached to my father i was unexpectedly wracked again by sobs so violent that they banged me against the steering wheel i tried not to howl out loud the last vestige of reason warning me not to attract attention death of not such a good guy i finally returned to morrells place too worn by my emotional storm to do anything but sleep when i woke again it was after six i went into the kitchen to make a cup of tea and found that max had slid a note through the back door on his way home karen lennon was looking for you this afternoon she says your client miss claudia is slipping out of this life but has asked for you off and on all day captain mallory called on lotty at her clinic this afternoon he needs to see you urgently but wouldnt tell lotty why i got the news that youre safe to mr contreras and lotty but felt i shouldnt let them know where you are max i drank tea slowly i felt like someone convalescing from a devastating illness that if i moved too quickly the fever would return and carry me away for good bobby wanted to see me he had gone to the clinic in person hadnt sent a minion he knows lotty knows that the sight of a police badge stirs such terrible memories in her that even the best cop in the world receives a hostile reception but even so for a routine inquiry he would have sent terry finchley so he needed me badly and he needed me privately but miss claudia was slipping out of this life she might have died while i was weeping in millennium park i finished the tea and carefully washed the mug morrell would be quite cross if he came home from afghanistan to find it dirty in his sink i looked wistfully at the phone the trouble with the age of fear is that you dont know who is listening in on your conversations you dont know if you can talk safely or not probably i could talk to karen lennon without anyone else catching the call but the possibility that id jeopardize my safe house meant i couldnt work on probabilities it was too late in the day to expect to find karen at lionsgate manor i drove down to howard street the honkytonk dividing line between chicagos mexicanpakistanirussian north border and the very much more staid evanston and found a pay phone at the el stop there even more amazing the phones cord and handset were both attached and the phone asked me to deposit a dollar when i listened to it i put my battery in my cellphone just long enough to look up karen lennons contact information then called her cell from the pay phone vic thank goodness ive been trying to reach you since last night i finally called max this morning and he told me youre having to stay underground so thank you for coming up for air and getting back to me im sorry about your cousin but miss claudias been asking for you ive been afraid shed pass while you were hiding if i go to lionsgate manor now will i be able to see her if im with you it should be okay im home but i can be there in twentyfive minutes ill meet you at the main entrance okay not okay i dont know how long i can stay undercover but i cant have anyone know where i am ill meet you outside miss claudias room karen wanted to know how id get into the building you had to go past the guard station at night i told her not to worry about that just to give me the room number she started to object but i cut her off please i dont have enough time to do the things i have to do lets not waste the last hours of miss claudias life arguing about this i drove along howard until i came to a shop that sold uniforms and business apparel there are several ways to be invisible in a large institution the best in a nursing home is to be a janitor if you show up in a nurses uniform all the other nurses think they know you and study your face too closely a janitor however at the low end of the food chain gets only a cursory look i found a jumpsuit in gray which i put on over my jeans and a squarecut cap i bought a big mop to complete the outfit i stuck my gun into a side pocketnot the safest way to carry a firearm but i wanted it close to hand when i reached lionsgate i parked on a side street so i could get away fast if i had to mop in hand cap low on my forehead i walked down the ramp at the manors parking garage and entered the building using one of those elevators on the ground floor i had to pass the guard station to get to the main elevators the massive woman behind the counter wearing a lionsgate pale blue security blazer was watching television but she looked up as i passed and called out to me who was i where was my security id my polish is limited to a few stilted phrases garnered unwillingly as a child from boombooms mother tonight i didnt stop walking but shouted over my shoulder in polish instead that dinner was ready it was getting cold come to the table at once something id heard aunt marie say four or five hundred times the guard shook her head with the kind of annoyed incredulity accorded ignorant immigrants but she returned to the small tv on the counter in front of her i rode up in an elevator with a real member of the cleaning crew she was collecting dirty laundry and rolled her cart off at the eighth floor when i reached miss claudias room miss ella was sitting with her sister on the rooms one chair karen was on the lookout for me she hurried over and greeted me in a low voice taking my arm and escorting me to miss claudias bed another woman lay in an adjacent bed her breath coming in short puffy bursts a machine next to her beeping every now and then i pulled a curtain between the two women to create the illusion of privacy my client frowned at me our affairs havent been very important to you have they you took our money but you didnt find lamont and it seems youve stopped looking for him the last month i think your sister wants to see me i said as gently as i could how is she maybe a little stronger karen said she ate some ice cream miss ella says miss claudia was sleeping too her breath sounding much the same as her neighbors shallow ragged i sat on the bed ignoring the clients outraged snort and massaged miss claudias left hand her good hand its v i warshawski miss claudia i said in a deep clear voice im the detective im looking for lamont you told pastor karen you wanted to see me she stirred but didnt wake i repeated the information several times and after a bit her eyes fluttered open ti ve she asked i found steve i said shes asking are you the detective miss ella corrected me im the detective miss claudia i found steve sawyer hes very ill he was in prison for forty years sad hard mont i clasped her hand more tightly curtis you remember curtis rivers curtis says lamont is dead but he doesnt know where hes resting he says johnny knows her fingers gave mine a weak response miss ella said the anacondas i knew it was their doing i dont think johnny killed lamont but he knows what happened to him ill try my best to get him to tell me i was speaking slowly to miss claudia wondering how much sense she could make of my words miss ella huffed youll try and youll get the same results youve come up with all summer nothing i didnt try to answer or even look at her but kept my attention on her sister miss claudia lay silent for a moment taking conscious deeper breaths preparing herself for a major effort bible she pronounced both consonants clearly lamont bible you take she turned her head on the pillow so i could see what she intended the red leather bible was on the nightstand by her head find mont he dead bury with him he live give him another deep breath another effort promise i promise miss claudia lamonts bible miss ella was outraged thats a family bible claudia you cant quiet yourself ellie but the effort in making clear speech was too hard for miss claudia and she sank back into halfintelligible syllables hite girl hite tive i want give miss claudia watched me until she was sure i had the bible sure i was tucking it into the big side pocket of my overalls not handing it to her sister she closed her eyes and gasped for air miss ella favored her sister and me both with bitter words especially her sister who had always traded on her looks never cared how much ella worked and did and spoiled lamont when ella told her time and again that she had ruined him by sparing the rod if miss claudia heard she didnt respond she had worn herself out speaking to me i knew she wasnt asleep because as she lay there her eyes fluttered open from time to time looking from my face to my pocket where the end of the big red bible was sticking out holding her hand i sang to her the song of the butterfly the favorite of the lullabies of my childhood gira qua e gira là poi si resta supra un fiore gira qua e gira là poi si resta supra spalla di papà turning here turning there until she rests upon a flower turning here turning there until she rests on papàs shoulder miss ella sniffed loudly but i sang it through several times calming myself along with miss claudia until she was deeply asleep when i got up to go miss ella stayed in the chair i suppose not wanting to dignify her sisters bequest to me by acknowledging me but pastor karen followed me into the hall i know youre under a lot of stress right now and im sure your cousin is your biggest worry so it was a really good thing you did coming over here to see miss claudia she put a hand on my arm this man you mentioned curtis do you think hes telling the truth about lamont oh i think so he doesnt know what happened to lamont but it involved johnny merton and it was so terrible that it shocked merton into silence and merton youd have to know him to understand that a death hed find shocking might turn you or me as mad as as poor steve sawyer i gently dislodged lennons hand something about lamont or johnny and steve sawyer and the anacondas is connected to my cousin the man whos running security for the krumas campaign where my cousin worked he was the cop who interrogated sawyer forty years ago and tortured him into confessing karen gasped torture are you sure sawyerkimathis mangled burned body flashed in my head they say i the songanddance man they laugh would i ever be able to forget that yes oh yes i wish i wasnt but i know it happened i dont understand it not all of it but my uncle and harvey krumas the candidates father they grew up together and they still watch each others backs the murder that happened in marquette park all those years ago theyre both implicated in it and that means i couldnt bear to go on couldnt bear to add that that meant my own uncle was implicated in sister frankies murder because his old buddy harvey rushed a contracting crew over to her place to bury any evidence i might be able to dig up i pressed my hands against my temples as if that would push all that knowledge out of my head this is terrible vic why arent you going to the police my smile was twisted because dornick is an excop with lots of pals on the force and i dont know who there i can trust anymore karen started to ask me how lamont was tied to dornick but my own words reminded me that bobby mallory had been trying to reach me i interrupted her to ask if i could use her office phone to make a few calls we rode down to the second floor in silence karen shaking her head as if mourning all the sorry souls id told her about while she unlocked her office door i once again connected my cellphone long enough to look up bobbys unlisted home number eileen mallory answered oh vicki im so sorry about petra this is a terrible week we never knew peter at all well but please tell him and rachel that if theres anything we can do anything at alla place to stay extra help from bobbys teamthey must let us know i thanked her awkwardly and said bobby had been trying to reach me he hadnt come home yet she gave me his cellphone number and another message a personal one for me so warm and loving it made my eyelids prick bobbys response wasnt nearly so tender where are you he demanded as soon as i answered wandering around the city like a demented ghost i said i understand you wanted to talk to me i want to see you at once i looked at karen lennons scarred desktop you know bobby that is not going to happen i am hiding from george dornick hoping i find petra before he does if dornicks on your ass ill give him a medal for bringing you in that would be one you would hand him at my funeral then and you could congratulate each other on laying me and a lot of ugly department history to rest i wasnt sure how much time i would have before bobbys tech team figured out where i was calling from i decided i could stay on the phone for three more minutes victoria you have crossed an acceptable line youve always imagined that you could do my job and that of thirteen thousand other good decent cops better than we can youve always imagined when we chew you out its because were stupider or more corrupt than you but now you have gone further than i will allow by criticizing george dornick i asked by fingering if not murdering larry alito i had been watching the second hand go round on the institutional clock on karen lennons wall but that news jolted me alito is dead i repeated stupidly get your head out of your butt bobby was truly furious to use such coarse language talking to me even though he disapproves of me he usually sticks to his noswearingatwomenandchildren code when were speaking his body was found down by the river near cortlandt this afternoon and hazel says youd called up there this morning threatening him escape in contaminated laundry while id been speaking to bobby karen had been standing at her window aimlessly twitching the blind pull she turned to me as i hung up there are a lot of police cars out front we dont usually get so many here do you think i think i dont want to find out i looked wildly around hoping a hiding place would open up but all i saw was my mop the cops wouldnt be fooled by a generic jumpsuit and an unused mop theyd be inspecting all the janitors even the one id seen in the elevator linen carts theyre taking dirty linen someplace where karen thought a minute then pressed a speeddial number on her phone its pastor karen ive been with one of our critically ill patients and have some soiled linens where can i find the nearest bin i stupidly carried them down to my office no ill come back up i want to get them out of here and im going to have to scrub after handling them anyway number eleven right her mouth set in a thin firm line she opened her door looked around and beckoned me elevator eleven lets go i followed her through the maze of corridors muscles tensing to a rear service elevator we could hear the scratchy echoes of police radios the frightened shouts of lionsgate residents wanting to know if there was a killer running loose in the halls but we didnt actually see any cops karen pushed the button on elevator there was a stairwell nearby and i could hear the pounding of feet our elevator arrived but i stood frozen watching the stairwell door until karen shoved me into the elevator and pressed the button to close the doors i let out a loud breath thanks im losing my nerve she put a finger over my mouth jerking her head toward a camera in the ceiling and began talking excitedly about the need for the janitor staff to do more for the aids cases in the hospital i have to scrub now because ive been handling infected linens and syringes cant the cleaning crew do more its what happens when you outsource cleaning i said switching on the harsh nasal of the south side theyre paid by the room not by the hour and they dont do the job an inhouse service does the elevator was hydraulic and it seemed to me that in the time it took us to go from the second floor to the subbasement a crew could have disinfected all fifteen floors of the manor karen and i babbled about aids and cleaning until my mouth felt like a bell with a very dry clapper hanging in the middle the hydraulics finally hissed to a halt the doors opened onto a holding bay two dozen linenfilled carts stood there karen muttered that the laundry service would be by at midnight for pickup the shower rooms for staff stood beyond the bay and next to them a locked dressing room karen found a master key on her chain and unlocked the door uniforms were inside hazmat suits booties all those things she tossed me hat gloves mask and a white jumpsuit and told me to get into a cart and get covered i grabbed my gun and miss claudias bible then stripped out of my gray suit burying it in the middle of one of the other carts and pulled on the white jumpsuit i put on the hat the gloves and the mask and burrowed into the cart a few minutes later karen appeared and when i peeked at her she looked ominous in her own jumpsuit hat gloves and mask she flashed a bright red placard at me that read danger highly infectious then covered me up she whispered that she was tying the placard over the top of the cart wed hope for the best she pushed the cart onto the elevator i lay there as it wheezed up a story to the entrance of the parking garage the police had placed a guard there i lay sweating in the linens while he demanded to know who karen was and what she was doing im getting these aidsinfected linens to our cleaning service as fast as possible im checking all hospital ids he said a brief silence and then he said youre the pastor and youre handling linens i dont think officer it is my job to certify every death in this hospital its my job to go through possessions and make a list for the next of kin its my job to take bloody linens off a bed and cart them off when one of our patients passes and the cleaning crew has finished for the day i cant have foul matter in a room overnight another lady shares that room and i wont have her waking up and seeing the dreadful aftermath of someone elses death but if you want to carry these out for me i would be very grateful my day started at six this morning and i am weary i would love to get to my own home i wanted to applaud and cheer the pastor might have been pushing wanted detectives out of hospitals for years she was so smooth so natural in her mix of admonition and arrogance the officer apologized and said hastily hed leave her to handle the cart we bumped quickly through the parking lot i heard the chirp as she unlocked her car and the thump as she opened the trunk im lifting sheets theyll block the view to the elevator then get into the trunk youll be able to breathe i think at least enough until were in the clear she was in charge and i meekly followed her instructions in another moment the trunk closed i heard the rattle of the cart as she rolled it a short distance away and then we moved smoothly out of the garage apparently the cop at the inside entrance had called over to the cops guarding the exit and there was only a brief halt before we were in motion again between the bass viols case and the corolla trunk i would choose the corolla but only because i was cushioned by the sheets and could put my knees up air was in short supply in both i was thankful when karen finally decided it was safe to let me out she had driven up to a side street next to the campus that housed the university of illinoiss sprawling medical facilities i climbed out and scrabbled through the soiled laundry for my gun and miss claudias bible all of the burrowing and dumping had shaken miss claudias page markers out of it and damaged the spine and creased some pages i smoothed the pages out that had gotten creased and put in as many of the page markers as i could find what do you want to do now karen asked id like to give you a big smooch and then id like to take a shower you ever get tired of pastoral work you could open an agency easy the pastor laughed i dont want to go through that again ever when i had to get that cart past that cop i thought my pressure was going to start pushing blood straight out of my head and all over the garage where do you want to go from here morrells car was still down near lionsgate manor we agreed it might not be smart for me to show up there again tonight everything i wanted to do involved making phone calls from talking to murray ryerson to finding petras college roommate you can make those calls from my house karen offered i have an early meeting tomorrow and itd be easier on me if you spent the night with me than driving you up to evanston she rented the second floor of an old workmans cottage on the northwest side it was on a quiet street a few blocks from the river with a little balcony where she sat in the mornings to drink coffee she showed me to the bathroom and gave me towels and soap i was a good four inches taller than karen but i could wear her tshirts she gave me one to sleep in when i got out of the shower karen had opened a bottle of wine and set out a plate of cheese and crackers a big orange cat she called bernardo materialized and wrapped himself around her legs somehow despite the traumas of the day just being able to sit and talk naturally even to laugh without worrying about who was eavesdropping raised my spirits after a glass of wine i felt able to call murray for details about alitos murder karen had one of those phone services that lets you mask the number youre calling from so i didnt need to worry about it showing up on murrays caller id of course as soon as murray heard my voice he wanted to know where i was and a lot of other tedious stuff murray darling as i said earlier im on the move the more time you waste asking frivolous questions the less we have for a hearttoheart i havent heard the news except a report that alitos body fetched up on the riverbank down by one of those big scrapmetal yards tell me what happened warshawski its all take with you and no give i bought you a shirt i bought you jeans i let dr herschel take a piece off me and now this i know murray every time i see you in that skyblue mercedes convertible im thinking there he goes the peoples reporter never thinking of himself always giving so give oh damn you warshawski alito was shot at close range very close range by someone who probably had an arm around him very pally and then dumped him over the bridge what im hearing whoever killed him mustve thought alito would go into the river or get buried in scrap instead he landed in a pile that was due to be brought up for remelting the guy operating the forklift fainted almost fell onto a molten rebar belt murray paused a beat then said a lot of people think its quite a coincidence you calling me this morning to tell me youd spotted alito breaking into your office and him showing up dead this afternoon i drank some more wine murray does anyone at the star feel attached to facts these days say just in the interest of protecting the paper from a libel suit i told you id found a witness who idd alito i couldnt have spotted him at my office myself because i wasnt there i was in stateville with the hammer at the time alito was breaking in murray brushed that off i talked to the widow whats her name hazel right she said youd threatened him yep i been hearing that i told her exactly what i told you i have a witness who idd him period end of story i twirled the wineglass around watching the light change the colors on the surface i had changed alitos life too twirling a story around him as if he were wine in a glass of course i threatened him i said roughly i didnt know my words would get him killed i hoped theyd goad him into doing something that would betray himself or his handlers to me but when i spoke i pushed him and his handlers to the brink alito wasnt going to take the fall alone not if mallory or the fbi were coming after him so he called whoever hired him lets say oh george dornick his old partner when they were both with the force or one of dornicks clients call him les just to give him a name alitos a drunk he has a pension and a little boat and nothing else les and george are afraid hell crack he can do heavy lifting for them but not if hes going to lead someone like bobby mallory straight to them les murray exploded like les strangwell good night murray sweet dreams i hung up and grimaced at karen i think i really did send larry alito to his death i think i dont like myself very much today did someone really identify him going into your building i shook my head it was a hunch and apparently an accurate one since it must have sent him scrambling to dornick or even strangwell i repeated murrays description of the murder it must have been dornick i cant see strangwell embracing alito either but his old partner the man who gave him odd jobs to help him run his boat and his little retirement bungalow on the water yes alito would feel he had to trust him maybe you did set in motion the events that got him murdered today but you cant be greedy over guilt you know if he hadnt been the kind of person who would break into your office your phone call wouldnt have made any difference in his life karen looked at me earnestly her round young face flushed greedy over guilt i like that i have been greedily guilty all day my distress over my father swept through me again a wave that made me shut my eyes in pain i changed the subject we ended up drinking the whole bottle of wine and laughing over family stories like the one about her grandmother whose father wouldnt let her learn to drive so she took the family car and drove it into the horse pond and then calmly went in the house packed a suitcase and took off for chicago it was close to midnight when i finally helped my hostess pull the sofa apart and turn it into a guest bed for the first time in a week i slept eight hours like a tranquil baby the good book and the bad ball karen had already left for her early meeting when i woke up shed made coffee and put a note next to the carafe asking me to call her on her cellphone before i took off someone needs to know where you are im your pastor they cant compel my testimony i smiled a little at the thought of karen as my personal pastor she didnt get a morning paper so i took a cup of coffee back to the sofa bed to watch the television news after the daily economic horror story alitos death dominated the morning shows only beth blacksin on global entertainments channel suggested a sinister fallingout among friends as the motive behind his murder and while she didnt name any names she did say that alito had been doing freelance security work for an important illinois political campaign i blew murray a silent kiss he must have talked to beth since the star was also owned by global beths story would force dornick and les strangwell to spend some energy on damage control which would take a little heat away from their searches for me and petra on the other hand two of the networks mentioned the chicago private eye whom police badly want to question after hearing of threats she made against the dead man one of them even had put my photograph on the screen fortunately an old one copied from a newspaper it had been taken when i had a head full of curls not my current marine cut and i want to question you too bobby i muttered who are you covering for how much did you know back in you too were in marquette park during those riots i got dressed in my jeans and karens tshirt id rinsed my underwear out in her bathroom last night but my socks were kind of funky i decided to borrow some from karen although i felt a few qualms going through her chest of drawers looking for a pair her underwear was severely utilitarian but her socks were fanciful almost kiddish i skipped hello kitty and some bright red devils and angels and settled on a pair showing lisa simpson jumping rope i hoped i wasnt pushing my luck assuming that my pastors landline was open after all she was connected to some of the freedom centers programs and might be getting the same federal scrutiny the nuns got but i called my answering service anyway and found it had been deluged again with media calls everyone wanting to interview the private eye whom the police badly wanted to question my clients were more squeamish i spent almost an hour persuading two law firms to stay with me a third wouldnt return my calls and i didnt blame them until i could come out of hiding i was a pretty sorry excuse for an investigator bernardo the big orange cat appeared and decided i was better than no company at all he began following me winding in between my legs so that i had to be careful not to trip over him he jumped up onto the table next to the sofa bed while i was stripping the sheets off it and converting it back to a sofa and started sniffing my smith wesson when i snatched the gun out of the way he began exploring miss claudias bible my attention was on the gun checking the safety and putting it in my tuck holster so i didnt see his leap just miss claudias bible flying off the table bernardo i cried that book took a beating last night it doesnt need you throwing it around were holding it in trust the spine which had cracked during the flight through the laundry split completely with the fall i didnt want to try to tape it together which would damage the fragile leather but i could put a rubber band around it and leave it at karens until i had time to glue it properly the fall had opened the binding along the spine and pulled the leather away from the front cover it was when i started to press the leather around the edges of the buckram cover boards underneath to hold the leather in place that i saw the negatives poking out from beneath the endpaper i sucked in a breath and sat down slowly as if i were balancing a crate of eggs on my head i carefully peeled the endpaper back completely there between the buckram and the paper were two strips of negatives inside a folded sheet of onionskin i risked putting my battery back in my cellphone long enough to use the camera shooting the strips the way i found them in the bible under the endpaper then shooting my own fingertips pulling them out each strip had twelve exposures on it on the onionskin wrapping in faded block letters lamont gadsden had printed pictures taken in marquette park august i held the negatives up to the table lamp but it wasnt possible to make them out id have to find someone with dependable skills and a real darkroom not an ordinary photo shop the cheviot labs a forensic engineering lab i use was the only place i could think of they were in the northwest suburbs which meant risking a trip down near lionsgate to pick up my car it was better for me to gamble on being spotted than for me to entrust the negatives to a messenger i called karen who was just finishing her meeting and told her i was going to pick up morrells car ive found something that i need to get to a lab im going to leave it at your place while i fetch the car because i cant afford to be found with it on me ill write down what you should do with it in case i dont make it back here vic is this about lamont if it is it was me who started you on this journey im going with you to the end ill be home in fifteen minutes wait for me in the alley i didnt put up even a token argument i was glad to have my personal pastor take charge i wrapped the negatives back in their onionskin then slipped them between the pages of a copy of harpers i watched for karen through the kitchen window and as soon as her turquoise corolla appeared i ran down the back stairs while she drove i told her about the pictures that steve sawyerkimathi had thought would clear him in court forty years ago she nodded and pushed harder on the accelerator we reached the cheviot labs industrial park a little before eleven i had called my contact in the company sanford rieff from karens cell while we were en route sanford brought cheviots photography expert out to the lobby with him introduced him as theo and hurried back to a meeting of his own theo dressed in black as behooved a wouldbe auteur spoke in a rumbly slavic accent he had crooked teeth and a silver pentacle in his left ear but he handled the negatives carefully slipping them out of the brittle onionskin lamont had wrapped around them and into a plastic sleeve these pictures may provide evidence of a murder i said one that took place forty years ago and theyre going to be needed as part of a trial so do your best theyre all that remains in the way of evidence so please dont screw up i understand theo smiled reassuringly these come from instamatic camera my own first camera a used one i found on black market in odessa i treat as my own he had me watch as he logged the negatives into a database the number of strips the number of frames my name with the date and time id brought them in okay we have cafeteria we have park make yourselves comfortable maybe one hour maybe two i was too restless to sit in their lunchroom karen came outside with me but stopped at a bench to make calls of her own while i walked around the perimeter of a little lake the canada geese whove become the scourge of the northern united states were out in force drilling peg holes in the ground and leaving unappetizing deposits behind them i skirted the soiled path and went into a small woods i kept trying not to look at my watch but i couldnt bear walking too far from the cheviot building finally a little after one theo came to find us beaming like an obstetrician whos about to announce a normal delivery you can come now i have made many shots cropped shaded you see what you can see there had been twentyfour blackandwhite negatives in the bible but theo had multiplied them into over a hundred prints each with several different exposures some cropped to focus on individual faces theo had clipped most to light tables around a conference table some were blown up and attached to the walls thats lamont with johnny merton i murmured to karen as we started with the first picture on the first negative which showed three black youths arms linked across one anothers shoulders wearing the berets that wannabe revolutionaries used to sport you can see johnnys tattoos im guessing steve sawyer is the third man ive never seen a picture of him when he was young their faces were solemn but joyful getting ready for a big adventure lamont didnt appear in any of the other pictures it had been his camera after all he had several shots from the beginning of the march including one of martin luther king jr at the front and johnny nearby that might be a collectors item i whispered to karen when this is all over miss ella might sell it get a little comfort for herself we moved on to look at harmony newsomes ardent young face she was arm in arm with a solemneyed nun frankie karen murmured lamont had also photographed rictuses of hate in the crowd hed gotten one of the vilest of the racist signsburn them like they did the jewsthat littered the park and hed caught a can of pop just as it exploded in a cops face onlookers their faces indistinct seemed to be cheering as the violence increased the pictures began to get blurrythere had been too much crowd motion for an unsteady hand with a little kodakbut almost every frame told some recognizable piece of the story we looked at a man throwing something both the missile and the man indistinct in separate prints theo had done as good a closeup of both as he could the missile remained a blur but the mans face might be identifiable i think that must have been the hammer i said looking at a snakecovered forearm pushing dr kings head down dr king was hit by a brick that day maybe johnny was trying to get him out of the way harmony newsome appeared in the next shot clutching the side of her head her hand was covering something round and whitish that seemed to be stuck there in the next frame she had crumpled to the ground the round whitish thing having fallen from her hand theo had focused on it and blown it up so we could see it was a ball with spikes of some kind in it following that closeup we saw a cop in riot gear squatting to retrieve the spiked ball in the next frame he was standing and stuffing the ball into his trouser pocket both shots were blurry but you could still tell what he was doing at the next light table i cried out loud my uncle peter his face in clear focus was pointing a fingerin congratulation in admonitionat the man whod thrown the missile and who seemed to be clasping his hands over his head in a kind of victory dance his features were indistinct but theo had done his best with different exposures different croppings the square jaw and shock of thick curly hair made me think it was a young harvey krumas but i couldnt be sure that ball i walked back to the light table with shots of harmony newsome lying on the ground i want to see it as clearly as possible and the cop well never see his face but his badge is turned to the camera can you get the badge number theo had loaded all his different exposures and prints into a computer program always is best to start with negatives he said but maybe here is enough information to tell us this story karen and i stood behind him while he fiddled with the images on the ball underneath the nails you could just make out the big swooping f followed by the o nellie fox i sucked in my breath id been sure without the picture but it was still hard to have it confirmed those holes that i thought my father and my uncle bernie might have punched so they could hang up the ball and use it for batting practice those came from nails someone had pounded nails into a baseball somehow had thrown it at the marchers and gotten harmony newsome in the temple and then someone had retrieved the ball and removed the nails i felt a sick apprehension as theo focused on the fourdigit badge number of the cop in riot gear when we finally could read it i let out a little sigh i didnt know whose it was but i still could reel off my fathers by heart at least it hadnt been him pocketing a murder weapon at a crime scene discovery i made up a storyboard out of a selection of pictures sister frankie with harmony newsome harmony with her hand over the ball after it struck her in the temple peter with the man who might have been harvey krumas the closeup of the ball the cop pocketing the ball the closeup of his badge theo let me use a computer to type captions for the pictures and a letter to bobby mallory i addressed him formally by his title not just because hed pissed me off believing hazel alitos wild accusation against me but because i didnt know what hed been doing in marquette park all those years ago hed been a nineteenyearold rookie getting baptized by fire under the protective arm of veteran officer tony warshawski what had any of them done in the park that day dear captain mallory these pictures were taken by lamont gadsden in marquette park on august i found the negatives this morning and they are now in a secure location i believe the people who broke into my home and office this past week were looking for these negatives as you perhaps recall in january steve sawyer was arrested and convicted for the murder of harmony newsome photograph no murder weapon was ever produced sawyers conviction was based solely on an uncorroborated confession that was extorted under torture by george dornick and larry alito at his trial mr sawyer tried to insist that lamont gadsden had pictures which proved his innocence the photographs attached to this letter raise serious questions at minimum about the chain of custody of evidence at his trial before you ask the states attorneys office to file charges against me in larry alitos death i suggest you revisit this murder the trial of steve sawyer and in particular that you discover the identity of the officer wearing badge number for my protection i am sending a copy of this letter to my lawyer i am notifying judge arnold coleman who served as steve sawyers public defender during his trial and steve sawyer i am also notifying greg yeoman who is john mertons current counsel you may leave a message with my attorney about what next steps you wish to take in resolving both the murder and your baseless accusations against me in the death of larry alito while theo made up a dozen copies of my storyboard i called freeman carter my lawyer and told him i had evidence so hot that it needed to be in a vault i wondered when i would hear from you warshawski the cops have been to my office already demanding that i produce your body so i knew it was only a matter of time before you remembered you had a right to counsel im hoping it wont come to that freeman but let me give you a quick thumbnail of whats happening i explained as much as i knew about lamont and stevekimathi and dornick krumas and my uncle i even reported finding the nellie fox baseball in the trunk of my familys possessions so what do you want me to do with all this freeman asked hold on to the pictures and the baseball hold off the cops i need to find petra now if i can and then ill worry about everything else theo whod heard my end of the conversation said cheviot could store the negatives and the extra prints for me but i explained that the state could compel cheviot to produce them my lawyer had certain privileges that could keep the government at bay at least for a few days i did ask theo to use their messenger service to deliver my storyboards to bobby judge coleman and greg yeoman i would drop a copy off at fit for your hoof myself if i could do so without a tail but i wanted to watch freeman carter put my originals and the hundred prints theo had produced in his office safe by the time karen and i got back on the tollway we were in the middle of the oozing chicago rush hour slow hour it should be called while we drove karen reported on the repairs to sister frankies apartment at the freedom center the men doing the work are doing a terrible job after tearing the place apart all theyve done is put up some studs they started to work on the wiring and blew the circuits for the whole building and the sisters couldnt even get the building management to restore power until they offered to send pickets to the owners home yes i think those are phantom builders sent by harvey krumas to make sure any evidence of the fire bombing got destroyed it was one of my nagging worries about petra had she really texted dornick or alito or harvey himself to come get the bag of bottle fragments id collected from the fire bombing karen moved on to a piece of encouraging news miss claudia was a little stronger today karen had sent a pastoral intern to check on her and other highneeds patients and shed heard from the intern while we were waiting for theo to develop the pictures its as if turning over the bible to you took enough of a load off her spirit that she had some strength left for her own life karen said it makes me wonder if she knew all along that those pictures were in there dont you think if miss claudia knew about the pictures she would have pulled them out and had prints made i objected what i imagine happened is that lamont went to consult johnny about what to do with the pictures whether he should risk trying to testify at sawyers trial maybe lamont had prints made prints that disappeared when he did but he was smart enough to stash the negatives with the one person who really believed in him his auntie he couldnt count on rose hebert she was too much under her angry fathers control and he couldnt count on johnny who might barter them to save his own skin in some plea bargain down the road but claudia adored him and stood by him so he peeled open the endpaper inserted the negatives and gave the bible to claudia she must have noticed the cover was lumpy and at some level she might have suspected he had something hidden in there but she probably was afraid to find out what it was why karen inched forward toward the deerfield toll plaza i fished in my wallet for exact change she didnt know about the pictures but ella kept claiming lamont sold drugs claudia might have thought she was holding a packet of heroin or some acid or something we were both quiet for a few car lengths but karen kept glancing at me biting her lips she finally blurted out theres something you need to know but ive been worrying about how to tell you when i talked to my intern she said some men had been around looking for me they heard from the head nurse that you and i were both visiting miss claudia last night and they thought i would know where you were cops i demanded karen shook her head my intern wouldnt know something like that she assumed they were but she didnt think to ask for any id and after everything youve said today i do wonder if they could be with george dornicks company i rubbed my forehead that means they could be at your home after we go to my lawyers youd better let me come back with you to check for an ambush if it was dornicks people he may also have dug up your cellphone number which means they could be tracking us i smiled bleakly no one is safe if they are around me dornick is doing an excellent job of driving that point home perhaps you and bernardo could move into an empty room at lionsgate manor until this mess gets cleaned up ill be okay vic theyll believe me when i explain im just the pastor whos been too naïve to see through you she made a soft o of surprise with her rosebud lips and i laughed its my victorian face she added no one ever thinks i understand the big bad world its you whos in trouble and in danger the traffic began moving marginally faster i kept checking the road using the makeup mirror in the sun visor and peering into the right wing mirror the same cars crawled around us i couldnt tell if any of them were paying us special attention it was when we oozed off the kennedy into the loop that i began to wonder about a certain gray bmw it had an impressive collection of antennas and for the last few miles on the expressway it had seemed to be trading places with a black ford expedition karens turquoise corolla was easy to pick out in a crowd and they hadnt needed to stay close to us until we exited but then the bmw swooped around two cabs and a bus and landed in front of us the expedition was moving in from the side we have company i said im jumping out before they pin us ill try to send a cop your way before karen could react or speak or even slow the car down i had stuffed the envelope of negatives and prints into the back of my jeans and opened the passenger door i held on to it tightly got my feet and myself out and running alongside the car then slammed the door and tore off down lasalle street toward freemans office i heard whistles screams the screech of tires and then a messenger bike was on the sidewalk doing wheelies around me while another one came at me from the south i pushed through the first revolving doors i came to and sprinted through the arcade i heard steps behind me shouts of outrage as my pursuer collided with someone but i didnt waste time looking back the envelope was digging into my rear as i ran but the pain reassured me that i still had my precious cargo i should have left it at cheviot regrets save them for later i panted to myself and sprinted around a trio of slowmoving women to the buildings rear revolving door wells street seemed to be full of messenger bikes real messengers pursuers impossible to tell the difference a bike jumped the curb and headed straight at me another was approaching from the side i could see the glint of a pistol in the first mans hand as he lifted it i pulled off my cubs cap and rolled on the ground when he reached me pointing the pistol at me i stuffed the cap into the spokes of his bike the bike wobbled toppled the pistol went off the crowd screamed and scattered and i sprinted up the stairs to the el a train was rumbling into the station i shoved past a line of commuters sliding their cards through turnstile slots they yelled at me angrily and the stationmaster hollered in his microphone but i jumped over the turnstile and ran up the final flight of stairs i managed to squeeze through the trains doors just as they were closing the car was packed i collapsed standing against the doors sobbing for air while the mass of commuters pressed into me my gun was cutting into my side the envelope into my back my legs were trembling from my run and from my fear i thought of karen back on monroe street i hoped that when they saw id gone theyd left her alone please please dont let her be one more person injured in my wake for several stops i rode without being conscious of where i was moving away from the doors as we pulled into a station leaning back against them when they closed again we were heading north on the brown line i finally realized and wherever it dropped me there might be watchers waiting for me how big an operation could dornick afford to mount against me how many el stops could he stake out was i making him more powerful than he possibly could be i couldnt ride the train forever i got off at the next stop armitage avenue its in the heart of yuppieville and there was a good crowd to cover me leaving the station because it was yuppieville it was filled with a million little boutiques i longed for a wig something that would really transform me but the best i could come up with was another hat a white golfing cap the thousand dollars id cashed last week was dwindling but i bought a new shirt too replacing karens navy tshirt with a white one that proclaimed grrl power maybe it would rub off on me it had been days since id had dark glasses on and my eyes were aching from the glare i went into a drugstore and found a cheap pair and lipstick in a coffee shop i picked up an extralarge herbal tea and went into their restroom to wash off and plan my next move when i was clean and rehydrated i felt marginally better but i couldnt imagine any course of action no way to get out of the area no useful destination that would help me find petra no way to get my photos to freeman carter by now dornick might have scoped out morrells honda i couldnt take a chance on doubling back to lionsgate for the car i couldnt go home or to my office although i was halfway between the two outside the store a homeless man was hawking streetwise as long as you have a roof over your head and a family that loves you the guy in millennium park had intoned yesterday a roof that you cant get to a family thats trying to gun you down i gave the man a dollar and thought of elton grainger he too was near here when elton wouldnt give me a straight answer or look in me in the face id been sure hed seen petra running from my office months ago he had told me how to find his crib i would find it i would threaten to camp out there until he told me what i wanted to know about my cousin id been heading gradually west from the station while making my purchases i waited at a bus stop and got on the westbound bus i fished some singles out of my pocket for the fare then watched through the back window as we trundled along it was a tiresomely slow ride but i was too spent to walk and at least this way i could see if anyone had spotted me at damen avenue i got off the bus and set out on foot chicago streets are tangled here because of the way the river snakes through the northwest side i needed to get under the kennedy expressway and then follow honore to the river a shack under the railway embankment elton had said rush hour was over people were beginning to fill up the restaurants that lined the streets i felt overwhelmed with envy for the diners i could see through the windows eating and laughing together this was what it was like to be elton trudging back each night from his station outside the coffee bar on my street a vietnam veteran with no home and only the price of a bottle or a sandwich in his pocket on leaden feet i walked under the expressway and turned east and then north again the railway embankment was surrounded by razor wire but there was a gap hidden by the kennedys shadow i slipped through it and crawled up the embankment decades of chicagoans had tossed their garbage from their cars and in places along the embankment it was waist high i could see the path elton had carved through the refuse and followed it up to the tracks and down the other side where the embankment ended at the rivers edge i didnt spot eltons shack at first and wondered if in his paranoia he had misdirected me however a faint trail led through the underbrush and refuse and i followed it to the river the water here was a thick brownish green ducks bobbed in it along with plastic bottles and sticks there wasnt a visible current and mosquitoes rose in clouds from the thicket of shrubs that lined the bank from the rivers edge i looked back and finally saw the shack almost invisible against the underbrush and discarded tires it had a faded logo from the c nw railroad on it i suppose theyd once used it for storage as i got closer i saw elton had put a rain barrel on the roof and fixed up a showerhead there werent any windows in the shack and the boards it was built with were grayblack with damp but he had covered any holes with a variety of metal styrofoam and plastic sheeting i clambered up the embankment and made my way around to the side where the door was elton you home its v i warshawski we need to talk i rapped smartly on the panel and heard a movement from inside the shack an intake of a sob i pulled open the ramshackle door my cousin petra blinked at me from a nest of sleeping bags vic how did you know who told you whos with you i couldnt speak i was so overcome with relief at the sight of petra that i just stood there shaking my head in wonder a river runs through it i was on the floor holding petra while she sobbed against my shoulder vic im so scared its so awful dont yell at me i didnt mean i didnt want im not going to yell at you little cousin i said softly stroking her dirty hair when its my hot temper that made you too scared to trust me they told me if i talked to anyone theyd shoot mom and the girls and daddy would go to prison i didnt know what to do they said you wanted daddy to go to prison you were just using me and if i didnt help them if i talked to you about what i was doing youd punish me and him and mom and everyone who are they les strangwell dornick she swallowed a sob and nodded mosquitoes were swarming into the shack biting us through our clothes i had to close the door although there wasnt much air in the small space with the door shut it smelled of damp river mud and stale sweat the only light came from a couple of makeshift skylights elton had created by cutting squares in the roof and filling them with discarded windowpanes outside the sun was starting to set i could just make out my cousins bleached frightened face it started with the nellie fox baseball didnt it i said the day you found it in my trunk you talked about it in the office me and my ultrabig mouth it was only partly the ball everything started at the fundraiser when i talked about johnny merton in front of that creepy judge coleman i heard him tell uncle harvey that youd better not be screwing around in the harmony case which at first i thought was funny i thought he was saying something about you and music or your mom or something and uncle harvey said theyd nailed the anacondas for that and he didnt want this to be some snake coming back to life after its head got chopped off and then the day after the fundraiser when mr strangwell brought me in to work for him he told me it was top secret because you wanted to sabotage brians campaign i see so he told you i had some kind of evidence that would destroy the campaign and you had to find it a train thundered overhead shaking the shack we had to wait for it to pass before we could talk when the noise finally died away we could hear the ordinary sweet sounds of a summers evening the birds last songs the little insects chirruping the evidence i prodded my cousin when she remained silent at first it seemed like a game going around to all those places where daddy and his folks used to live and then it turned scary when that nun got killed and you were in the hospital they told me there would be something in her apartment and they sent this horrible horrible man to take me there that was when i started to get really afraid and i almost told you but then i thought of what they said about you being like an old lover of johnny mertons and what i was jolted into sitting up petra jesus no i represented him when i was a public defender but he was one of the scariest people i ever met at least until i got to know les strangwell and you dont sleep with your clients even if you want to please tell me you believe me on this dont get mad at me vic i cant take it her voice held an undercurrent of hysteria shed been alone with her fears too long no baby im not mad at you but it upsets me that they would tell such a big lie about me i like you enough that i dont want you to believe it thats all okay she muttered i waited a tick hoping for more something like of course i dont believe it but when she said nothing i pushed her to finish her story so you came along to sister frankies apartment with the horrible man was that larry alito and when you found me there you signaled to him to leave and then you texted him and told him to come get the bag of evidence it sounds awful she whispered hearing you say it out loud but it got worse they told me you had these old pictures that was what they wanted to find but they wanted the baseball too see every morning mr strangwell would ask for a report from me on what you were doing and what you were looking for and when i told him you wanted me to do a little work for you then he was really excited and said to do everything you asked and report back to him but when i looked up those contractors i saw their address was the same as uncle harveys chicago apartment and that was weird so i asked mr strangwell and then he said he said for a moment she couldnt go on but then she managed to pull herself together that was when the strangler said if i didnt do exactly what he said mom and the girls would die and daddy would go to prison i kept petting her and crooning to her trying to assure her that we could fix it all so that no one got killed or sent to prison although i wasnt sure about either of those things finally when she seemed a bit calmer i asked how shed ended up here in eltons shack that was after they made me open your office for them yeah babe i know that much i saw you on my video camera they said you had a picture that might send daddy to jail she whispered when i told them you and i hadnt been able to get into your old south chicago house they made me go down there with them to show them which house it was then when uncle sal gave me your apartment keys so i could make up your bed and bring you some yogurtyou know while you were staying at dr herschelsmr strangwell made me give him the keys to make copies i guess then they tore your house apart i wasnt there this one man the one they called larry he found an old picture of uncle tony and all of them playing ball together and the strangler was just totally pissed because he said only a drunk idiot would think that proved anything about anyone so they decided they had to go through your office i had to go with them they wouldnt let me just tell them your keypad code because the strangler said if you were therelike maybe you didnt get in to see the snake manyoud let me in then they went just totally crazy inside your office and i was terrified they would kill me because id seen too much and mr dornick kept phoning the strangler and saying how could he be so sure a bigmouth like me wouldnt end up babbling it all to you so i pretended i was having my period that i was bleeding and needed the bathroom and went down the hall this horrible man the one they called larry he was standing there holding his gun and i saw the back door and just bolted outside and ran like fury and elton was there out on the street so i remembered how he talked about his crib and i begged him to save my life so the bus was just coming and we jumped on and he brought me here and ive been too scared to leave while i cradled her i tried to think of a safe house someplace where petra at least could sleep while i tried to get the police to listen to my side of the story i was imagining and discarding ideas when petra suddenly asked about the pictures what are they its an old story and an ugly one your father was at a riot in marquette park in a race riot you mean when blacks were tearing down the neighborhood those came later this was a white riot your father and your uncle harvey and about eight thousand other people screaming and yelling at martin luther king the pictures show your father and your uncle harvey in the vicinity of the murder of a black woman they show a police officerim guessing it was either george dornick or larry alitopocketing the murder weapon later dornick and alito tortured a black man into confessing to the murder no youre lying daddy couldnt uncle harvey wouldnt i cut her off i know how you feel because my father was involved too he watched the torture and when he tried to stop it they threatened to send peter to prison so my fathermy father the best man ive ever knownhe turned his back on the torturers to save peter and later he took the baseballthat nellie fox baseball the murder weaponto save your father from prison thats not true petra screamed getting to her feet youre making this up i wish i was i got to my feet too and reached under my shirt for the photo album the light was too dim for her to make out much but she pretended to study the pages sister frankie was at the march with the murdered woman she was killed to keep her from talking to me why do you think they sent you to her apartment to collect evidence it was to keep someone like me from turning it over to the cops that building is under homeland security surveillance because the nuns provide assistance to immigrants but they didnt take your picture or larry alitos the night you two showed up because george dornick has good connections to homeland security i cant let you publish these she whispered you mustnt you mustnt petra forty years of wrong are sitting on us on you and me i mean forty years of wrong our own fathers did i cant even guess how many other men dornick and alito tortured i cant keep quiet not to save peter not even to save tony oh damn you she choked its like uncle sal says youre the only who gets to be right the rest of us dont count in your uni verse damn you too petra warshawski youve put my life in danger along with your own if youd told me all this a month ago sister frankie might still be alive how many people have to die to protect peter we were glaring at each other our noses almost touching in the cramped space both panting with fury and fear when we heard footfalls crashing down the side of the embankment the noise of many people not elton flashlights played around the embankment the summer evening was ending and the pale light coming in through eltons skylights had turned purple while we quarreled i squeezed petras arm and put my hand over her mouth the envelope of pictures they had to survive whatever happened to me i looked wildly around and grabbed a black garbage bag from the pile of bags and blankets on the floor i rolled the envelope up in it i didnt have time to get the bag or petra out of the shack i stuffed it into a crack and pushed my cousin against the sliver of wall next to the door i stood in front of her when the door opened we wouldnt be instantly visible i pulled the smith wesson from the tuck holster flipped off the safety and spoke directly into my cousins ear when i say go you stoop down run out of there and jump in that water swim across get to uncle sal it wasnt a great plan but it was all i had even in the purple light i could see her eyes large and terrified in her pale face the muscles in her throat moved but she only nodded this is the place the voice was george dornicks yes yessir it is elton quavering barely audible what a dump you are a worthless piece of shit you know that dornick amused contemptuous open the door i want to see the girl myself you said you wasnt going to hurt her none elton was anxious you told me you just wanted to talk to her thats right dirtbag no ones going to get hurt the girl needs to go home thats all that was a third man a stranger and when he laughed a couple of other men joined in dornick and two perhaps three subordinates petras heart was jumping against my shoulder blades i reached behind me and squeezed her hand the shack door swung open a flashlight played around the tiny space found my feet i dropped rolled and crashed into the figure behind the light knocking him to the ground go i yelled and kept rolling away from the shack so that the second flashlight followed me i heard petra behind me i fired at random to cover her dash out the door down to the river the moments hesitation the splash as she dropped into the water good girl i started down the slope after her but the lights followed me and someone fired i dropped into the brush landing on something large and sharp rolled away again and fired blindly toward the light thats warshawski goddamn it wheres the girl someone jumped in the water the person id knocked over had recovered and i saw the flashlight beam going down to the water a shot sang out over the river and ducks began honking and squawking wings flapped and the man shot again shouts sounded from the far side i tried working my way to the bank an old tire and a shrub tripped me i moved backward on my knees and one hand keeping my gun in front of me more shots and then dornick was spreading his troops in a triangle around me dornick shouted a command and two guns fired in succession one on either side i edged backward while he issued his orders but the men in the triangle around me were all shining their lights into the brush where id landed i was a fox in the hunt they had lightfinding heatseeking missiles or some crap that would take care of me where are the negatives vic dornick called my lawyer has them george you never made it to your lawyer we were there ahead of you i messengered them into town the same time i sent bobby mallory his copies bobbys name stopped him briefly but dornick only said we know you were on your way to carters office we were listening to that girls cellphone girls cellphone you mean the reverend karen lennon i bet you were fun as a little boy georgie bet you were the one who crawled under the jungle gym to look at your classmates panties did you start with that and then move on to torturing mice and cats captain mallory isnt going to watch your back anymore georgie not when he reads my report without the negatives your report doesnt mean shit dornick said you tell me where they are and ill let the drunk go its okay vic elton quavered you dont have to do nothing on my account what happened elton i called howd they know you had petra here someone in the coffee place across from your office dornick said they told us a homeless guy had gone off with the girl and we started shaking all the winos and weirdos in bucktown and a guy like elton doesnt take a lot of shaking before he falls off the tree isnt that right dirtbag im sorry vic i know you saved my life and all and i wish you hadnt thats the gods truth if youda let me die my little girl wouldnt be in so much trouble your little girl i mean shes a real nice gal vic you can be proud of her so dont worry about me no more now you hear you dont need to look after me no more okay dornick ignored eltons quavery apology i want those negatives vic he ordered his crew to come into the brambles after me alive i want to search her i dont want her dead yet the men crashed down the bank and into the thicket i fired and hit one of them but missed the other two and then they had me by the arms and i was kicking shooting but the end was ordained at the beginning they held me while dornick ran his hands inside my clothes squeezed my nipples i stomped hard on his instep and kicked back at the kneecap of the man behind me both men cried out they werent used to pain i broke free but dornick grabbed me before i could start running he wrenched my gun away and tossed it into the underbrush an underling held me while dornick slapped my face left side right side left side you watch too many old nazi flicks george i said thats always what erich von stroheim does he hit me again youre not as smart as tony always claimed you were where are the pictures freeman has them no he doesnt slap i put them in a fedex box on armitage i said take the shack apart dornick ordered she wouldnt even leave them with a messenger from cheviot she sure didnt put them in a box i had shot one man the second man was holding me dornick held a gun on elton while the fourth man dismantled his home elton gave little cries of misery as the walls were peeled apart plastic bags torn open his nest of sleeping bags ripped apart it took a good twenty minutes but the black garbage bag was gone petra must have grabbed it on her way out determined to save peters hide dornick was angry now he held his gun on me and i could see the red triangle of the laser sight in the dark toying with my chest my head figuring where best to shoot so as not to hit his lackey i went limp in the mans arms took a breaththe kind gabriella always wanted down down to my tailbone shutting my eyes breathe dont think breathe dont thinkand began my mothers signature aria non mi dir bellidol mio say not my beloved dornicks gun sounded and i flinched i couldnt help it ruining mozarts fluid line thinking instead of breathing hed missed you goddammed asshole you the grip on my arms loosened i broke free i kicked hard against the kneecap rolled to the ground rolled toward dornick elton had seized his legs dornick was flailing about trying to get an angle where he could shoot elton and not hit himself he was stronger than the homeless man but all that meant was that as he thrashed about he dragged elton with him i gave a primitive yell smashed my hand into his forearm and seized the gun a moment later the embankment was awash in blue up against the wall all of you a police launch had arrived but it took us all a few minutes to realize that two of dornicks banditti tried to run off but the launch turned its spotlight on the shore a couple of cops pulled out rifles and ordered the men to stop where they were dornick was doubled over on the ground but he shouted for help officer down officer down he cried get that bitch before she escapes she grabbed my weapon hes a liar elton cried in a highpitched gabble vic she was here with her girl they were hiding from this man here hes a psycho we seen plenty like him in vietnam rogue soldiers who start shooting their own men heda killed vic if i hadnt tackled him and he broke my house in little pieces just for nothing but to make me feel bad you look her up dornick said she already murdered one cop this week shes out for revenge on the whole police force men in kevlar vests jumped ashore they covered all of us with their assault rifles and herded us onto the launch i was shaking so badly i almost fell into the river the cops hoisted me over the side of the launch and left me under guard while they went back for dornicks wounded thug petra was sitting in the stern wrapped in a gray police blanket in some dim part of my exhausted mind i felt relief at knowing she was safe but mostly i wanted to lie down on the deck and sleep once we were all on board dornick had the gall to try to pretend i had held him hostagehim and his three bandittiand forced them to the river where i proposed shooting them just as i had shot larry alito thats not true mr dornick petra called out from the stern you know you tried to kill me and vic i dont even know how she escaped except i guess shes more resourceful than you that made me smile the cops wouldnt let me go over to petra so i blew her a kiss in the meantime though the river police had looked me up and found bobbys outstanding warrant on me they cuffed me and told me i had the right to remain silent but as we rode downriver i kept repeating bobbys cellphone number and telling them to call bobby before they booked me and left dornick free to flee their jurisdiction petras insistence that it was dornick whod been threatening us made them decide to give me at least enough of the benefit of the doubt to call bobby who ordered them to bring all of us in at the grand avenue landing station they transferred us from the launch to a paddy wagon it was one of the old beatup ones without springs or shocks dornick was beside himself with rage him the head of mountain hawk security a twentyyear veteran in the wagon with common criminals im not a common criminal mr dornick petra said and neither is vic and elton sure isnt so please be quiet elton was having the toughest time of all of us being crammed in with so many people he was sweating and his teeth chattered and each time we hit a pothole he seemed to think it was a grenade and hed try to hit the floor but was held to the seat by his handcuffs that one was close charlies closing in move your big feet he muttered elton were in chicago its vic you saved my life i leaned as close to him as i could in my handcuffs mine and petras well get your house repaired hold on for another hour were going to make it thats right elton youre the best its petrayour girl petraremember my cousin chimed in elton stopped mumbling to himself long enough to say youre a good girl petra well get out of here alive you trust me for that one dornick said trust you you drunken rat shut up ill deal with you later george youre the rat in this van and you are finally going to go into that big old rattrap where you belong you know how much fun theyre going to have with you in stateville when they learn youre the man who tortured johnny mertons boys i do hope your will is uptodate dornick lunged across the seat at me but the cops riding with us held him back petra huddled next to me on the narrow seat under her police blanket she was still wet from the river i clasped her hands with my own cuffed ones so how did you get all these boys in blue to show up in time to save my life i asked shed swum the river she said but she hadnt been able to climb up the slick logs that lined the far bank there was some kind of iron ring i got hold of that and screamed my head off therere these town houses up above and someone heard me and came outside shed heard the shots and was feeling pretty nervous the woman who responded to her screams called the police when a squad car arrived petra cried out that muggers were shooting at me across the river the cops in the squad car summoned the boat oh petra little cousin youve been scared but you showed real courage and real resourcefulness when all this is over you keep remembering that put all those bad faces away in a drawer and put your own courage out in the living room petra gave a little sigh and curled against me the cops didnt try to pull her away the night wore on interminably from there the paddy wagon unloaded us at headquarters when wed all been placed in a big interrogation room at thirtyfifth and michigan and left to glower at one another for an hour or so bobby made an entrance in his shirtsleeves terry finchley followed in a suit and tie carrying a briefcase bulging with manila folders bobby good to see you dornick switched on his hailfellow voice a hearty baritone congratulations on the promotion well deserved bobby ignored him and he didnt look at me either when he spoke it was to the air above our heads im trying to get harvey krumas down here peter warshawski is on his way over from the drake well wait to get started finchley unloaded his briefcase we could all read the label on the top folder harmony newsome at that point dornick demanded that he be allowed to call his lawyer bobby still not looking at him nodded at terry who handed dornick a cellphone when dornick demanded privacy finchley gave his thinnest smile you were a cop for a lot of years mr dornick you know the drill dornicks eyes glittered with fury if he managed to walk away from any charges tonight none of us would be safe in our beds he called his lawyer he was short and to the point then i took the phone to call freeman carters cellphone freeman was at dinner at the trefoil he first talked to bobby then came back on the phone with me youre going to be there awhile vic dont say anything stupid ill see you by ten i was astonished looking at the clock to see it was only a little before nine i thought id been on the river fighting george dornick my whole life another twenty minutes had dragged by before peter came in flanked by two cops petra oh my god youre safe petey petey he was at her side clinging to her but she pushed him away daddy dont touch me dont come near me not until you explain what you did dont talk warshawski dornick growled no you dont need to talk mr warshawski bobby agreed im going to do that you just take one of those empty seats he laid a slim file on the table the photo book id sent him this afternoon were going to start at the beginning marquette park i was a rookie and that was a hell of a time to join the police force another rookie in my class was larry alito he had the great good luck to be partnered with tony warshawski the best cop who ever wore this uniform bobby looked directly at me for the first time when he said that i bit my lips together alitos badge number was you can see it here on the chest of the man picking up a baseball that ball was a murder weapon used to kill a black girl in the park that day harmony newsome pride of her family marching next to a nun a black kid named steve sawyer confessed to the murder we all know that good police work dornick said case closed bad police work bobby snapped case reopened no proper forensic evidence was presented at the trial we didnt have the murder weapon then but it should have been possible to tell from the bruising and contusions and so on that shed been struck by a projectile not by someone stabbing her in the eye at close range he tossed the photo book across the table at my uncle you and someone else are in these pictures he throw that ball or you peter licked his lips but he looked at the pictures harvey he told me dornick said that someone at the march had taken pictures damn it did tony have them all along petra was looking at her father her face strained very white underneath its layer of grime when he saw her expression he winced and looked away harvey krumas bobby said dornick interrupted peter to warn him again not to talk theyre recording all this warshawski so shut the fuck up lamont gadsden had the negatives all along i said quietly he took the pictures with his instamatic hes been missing since the night of the big snow of sixtyseven three months ago his auntie hired me to find him she filed a missing persons report all those years ago but george and larry or their friends treated her like scum and didnt try to find mr gadsden now his aunt is dying and she wants to see him or know where hes lying before she can rest dornick was fidgeting in his seat trying to interrupt but terry finchley shut him up did you find him vic i shook my head no but i found these pictures mr gadsden had put the negatives inside his bible and he left it with his aunt the last night he was seen alive she gave it to me last night not knowing it held dynamite just wanting me to return it to her nephew when i found him it was a pure fluke that i found them thanks really to you george if you hadnt tried one fancy touch too manyfingering me for alitos deathi wouldnt have been on the run i wouldnt have dropped the bible but that cracked the spine open and the negatives fell out bobby flicked a glance in my direction some time youre going to tell me how you got out of that lionsgate manor without my people finding you i smiled bleakly magic bobby its the only way a solo op like me can function against hightech crap like george here has those negatives dornick said contemptuous they dont exist you manufactured these prints and not by magic anyone could create these out of stock shots of the riot yes bobby said where are the negatives vicki vicki so we were friends again i looked at my hands here petra spoke into the silence around the table i took them with me into the river she pulled the black plastic bag from under her blanket guilt all around dornick lunged for the bag but one of the uniformed men put a hand on his shoulder another picked up the bag and handed it to bobby let the record show that these negatives which had been in claudia ardennes bible and came into my possession last night are being given to captain robert mallory there are two dozen negatives in two strips of twelve each from film lamont gadsden shot in marquette park on august nothing in my voice betrayed my overwhelming relief or surprise that petra had saved the negatives bobby sent for an evidence technician while we waited the black trash bag sat next to him on the table a pool of brackish water spread around it dornick couldnt take his eyes off the water or the bag when the tech arrived bobby told her that there was valuable evidence in the bag that he wanted to see the negatives after theyd been saved and logged in she put the trash bag in a bigger bag saluted and left there was a commotion in the hall about then and harvey krumas came into the room trailing lawyers like a peacock spreading his tail feathers freeman arrived at the same time he was impeccable in black tie his whiteblond hair trimmed within an inch of its life les strangwell was at harveys side freeman inserted a chair next to mine vic why is it that when youre in extremis you stink from mud wrestling why cant you ever call me when youve had a shower and are wearing that red thing i want to be sure you love me for myself not for the outer trappings of frilly femininity there are a couple of waifs at the table who need help elton graingeri gestured toward elton whod shrunk deep inside himself while we had been talkingand my cousin petra warshawski petra doesnt need your help peter said shes got me here youre a suspect in a murder case peter and your shenanigans put her life in danger so i think it would be best if you let freeman represent her for the time being peter george bobby harvey interrupted this is shocking lets get it all sorted out fast so we can go home to bed harvey the big man very much in charge in a moment mr krumas bobby said lets just finish with these pictures i think youll recognize them he nodded at a uniformed cop who took the photo book from the table in front of peter and opened it at the page that showed a young harvey doing a victory dance while peter pointed a finger at him thats you in marquette park in mr krumas i said helpfully seconds after you threw the nailstudded baseball that killed harmony newsome krumas stared at the photo one of his lawyers kept a firm grip on his shoulder just before you got here captain mallory was explaining that larry alito picked up the baseball i added why did he do that george peter said hoarsely george told him to do it goddamn it peter i can sue you for slander if you say one more word dornick said you threatened my daughter you threatened my wife and little girls you want me to watch your back now peter said jesus it was a riot we were young we were hotheads harve and i we went over to the park to see what was happening we wanted to see the famous dr king who all the hoopla was about harvey brought his nellie fox ball he showed it to me it was packed full of nails if i get a shot at king nigger ill take it thats what he said warshawski after all we did for you for you to turn on me like this its really hard harvey said more in sorrow than anger yes your father gave me a job he got me my big start in life but did that give you the right to try to kill my girl dont get so emotional pete dornick said no one wanted to kill your girl we just were getting her to help us with harves boys senate campaign i stared at him rocked the way one always is at such monumental lies freeman shook his head warningly dont attack him in here leave that to me so harvey had a shot at dr king i went back to the main story he threw the ball only johnny merton standing next to king pushed kings head out of the way i reached for the photo book and flipped through it to show the hammers arm pushing kings head out of the way your ball hit harmony newsome and killed her mr krumas and george helped you out because you all grew up together on fiftysixth place george had to put on his riot gear and be mr cop turn against his own but he knew where his loyalties lay peter said with us with the neighborhood we were fighting to preserve have you been down there have you seen what those people did to our house ma looked after that place its very hard mr warshawski detective finchley said smoothly very hard for everyone who lived through that time it hadnt even registered with peter that there were black police officers in the roomnot just terry finchley but three uniformed officers as well my uncles face turned the dull mahogany of embarrassment and petras pale skin blazed crimson under its caking of mud i felt pretty shamefilled myself and george knew where his true loyalties lay i prompted not with the city hed sworn to serve and protect but with his homeys with harvey whose daddy owned ashland meats and with you peter his high school buddies george wasnt far away when harvey threw that baseball he saw what happened bobby was still looking at a place over my head but he nodded in my direction so i went on george sent larry alito into the middle of the marchers to pick up the ball alito turned himself inside out with excitement a rookie getting to play with the big boys he did what he was told and george saw he got a promotion right away rookie to junior detective no questions asked alito took to the job like the proverbial duck when the heat came down from the mayors office to arrest someone for ms newsomes murder and george decided one of the anacondas could carry the can for harvey larry was the eager boy who attached electrodes to the suspects testicles and ran a current through them until he fell apart and confessed to anything the detectives wanted him to say petra gasped in shock and turned to stare at peter peter looked at the table in front of him detective finchley was making an effort to control himself i saw the pulse throbbing in his left temple youre making that up dornick broke the silence theres no evidence no nothing except a conviction in a court of law of one anaconda scumbag who was guilty of murder three times over in other cases where we couldnt make it stick he was the hammers goto boy and the hammer he was too slick for us but we nailed that bastard for the newsome murder bobby looked at finchley who opened the bulky folder in front of him officer warshawski filed a protest after your interrogation mr dornick warshawski put a written statement in the case file saying he had witnessed the suspect being subjected to extreme interrogation measures and that he believed the conviction was tainted and tony was sent to lawndale and larry got a promotion i said softly and peter got a big job with ashland meats and then a month before the big snow larry alito brought the baseball over to our house i dont understand why alito didnt hang on to it himself but he gave it to tony he said tony should keep it because he larry had kept peter out of prison there was another silence around the table until bobby asked wheres the baseball vicki in the trunk of my car i think unless george here broke in and swiped it dornick made a gesture a man who cant believe he let the big one get away but he didnt say anything but what happened to lamont i asked lamont gadsden he had the pictures and he disappeared merton mustve killed him dornick said another useless gangbanger whose ma cries that her little boy never did anything wrong in his life oh no it was his auntie you say lamont gadsden came into the racine avenue station early in the morning of january twentysixth detective finchley read from the bulky file in front of him the desk sergeant logged him in with a note that he had evidence in the newsome case the sergeant paged detectives dornick and alito who took him away with them there is no record of him leaving the station the night wore on from there endlessly peter and harvey and george seemed to be fighting over who had done what and i knew in a detached way that that was a good thing because one of them would be forced to admit something pretty soon i wondered what little world elton was inhabiting right now and if it was possible to join him there rather than continue at the table with these men around two in the morning freeman said he didnt think i could be of any further assistance he assumed bobby was dropping the notion that i had anything to do with larry alitos death karen lennon i said before i go i need to know that shes all right she dropped me downtown a hundred hours ago when i saw georges team closing in on us finchley gave me one of his rare smiles she a pastor about as big as a minute shes okay shes been on the phone to the captain all night i felt myself smiling in relief and turned to dornick as i got to my feet you just cant kill everyone georgie theres always going to be someone left behind who lets the truth creep in petra rose to join me she looked small and frail despite her height the two of us roused elton who was murmuring something only he could understand freeman then drove us to my place where we woke mr contreras and the dogs mr contreras had a fine time fussing around us he even let elton use his shower and a razor while petra and i cleaned up in my place when we came back down we found that elton had drifted off into the night mr contreras said he thanked me for the razor and the clean clothes but he said to tell you two gals that he needed to be by himself for a while said youd understand now you come in here i been frying eggs and bacon peewee here she aint nothing but a walking bone right now and v i warshawski you dont look much better i helped mr contreras make up his spare bed for my cousin she was asleep within seconds of lying down with mitch curled up alongside her i took peppy up to the third floor and didnt even remember locking my door the rats attack each other miss claudia went home to jesus in splendid style the women wore the kind of hats you used to see at easter heavy with birds and flowers and ribbons so that the weatherbeaten room looked like a gaudy garden the music shook the rafters and the people spilled out of the small church onto sixtysecond place pastor karen officiated which sent a buzz through a congregation that thought women should be silent in church but sister rose was firm this was what miss claudia had wanted curtis rivers came to the funeral along with his two chessplaying pals the three men wore suits and i didnt recognize them at first sister carolyn and her other sisters from the freedom center were there singing gospel as energetically as any of the regular members of the congregation even lotty and max came to show their support for me miss claudia lingered for almost two weeks after i had found the negatives in lamonts bible i tried to visit her most days just to sit with her talk to her quietly sometimes about my ongoing search for lamont sometimes about nothing much at all harmony newsomes murder had become pageone news once again it seemed as though the whole country was glad to feast on chicagos notorious corruption we were a welcome break from the grim economic news and the predictable disappearance of the cubs bobby mallory was at his bleakest during those weeks he was taking part in a special housekeeping task force and from everything i was hearing he was unsparing in his investigation but it was painful for him to have to recognize the history of corruption and abuse among the men hed spent his life with dornick and alito were by no means the only culprits they could never have treated suspects so vilely without active collusion up and down the chain of command sixteen other officers whod served at the racine avenue station came under federal investigation for allegations of brutality it was shocking to see that the torture of suspects had continued at least into the nineties given the climate of torture cultivated by the us department of justice in recent years some cops apparently felt they had no reason to hold back on their own forays into extreme rendition bobby wouldnt talk to me about it directly but eileen mallory came over to my apartment one afternoon for coffee and told me how betrayed he felt by the relentless revelations of abuse the departments been his whole life hes feeling that he dedicated himself to i dont know you could say to a false god and besides that he always measured himself against your father and he feels it deeply that tony was willing to write a letter protesting the torture and that he bobby did nothing but request a transfer so he wouldnt have to work with dornick or alito that letter ended your fathers career you know he never got another promotion after that but tony didnt stop it i burst out he watched it he went into the room and told them to stop but alito said were doing it for your brother for peter and tony walked out again eileen reached across my coffee table to put a hand on my knee vicki sweetheart maybe you would have gone in and made them stop youre courageous enough reckless enough youre truly your mothers child that way but you dont have a family to support families are terrible hostages for men like your father what other work could he get to support you and gabriella where he knew your health and welfare would be taken care of your mother god rest her soul she wore herself out giving piano lessons to little girls for fifty cents a week you couldnt live on that tony did the best he could under very painful circumstances he spoke up do you know how much courage that took after she left i took a long walk with the dogs trying to digest eileens words trying to reconcile the idea of the father i loved so intensely with the man whod been a cop done a job knowing he was working with men who committed torture i remembered the letter he wrote me when i graduated from the university of chicago it was still in my briefcase all these weeks later waiting for me to get it framed back home i pulled it out and reread it i wish i could say theres nothing in my life i regret but ive made some choices too that i have to live with youre starting out now with everything clean and shiny and waiting for you i want it always to be that way for you after a time i walked down to armitage and gave the letter to a framing shop we picked out a frame in green my mothers favorite color with a gay pattern around the edge i could read it and feel well loved and know what he regretted and mourn that and try to realize that you never fully know anyone that we most of us live with our contradictions i too have my flaws the hot temper hed also warned me about in the letter the temper that had frightened my cousin so much it almost cost her her life could i learn from that terrible mistake of course i wasnt the only daughter trying to come to terms with a flawed father my cousin had more serious issues to face than i did at least petra had her mother and sisters to help her try to cope with the shocks theyd all suffered during the last month the day after our marathon night at police headquarters petra flew down to kansas city to be with them my aunt rachel was bewildered and unsure of what she wanted to do whether to support peter through his upcoming legal travails or take her girls and start over without him peter was staying in chicago for the time being renting a studio apartment on the northwest side petra wouldnt talk to him and he and rachel werent talking often when petra decided at the end of a week that she wanted to return to chicago rachel flew back with her to spend a few days with her at her loft my aunt made me take them to see kimathi at curtis riverss shop rachel wanted to see for herself the person who had suffered on harvey krumass behalf kimathi was in agony in our presence and rivers ushered him out after a few minutes im so sorry my aunt kept whispering im so sorry rivers nodded with his usual grim expression and didnt say anything rachel blinked at him helplessly she finally asked if kimathi needed any financial help would they send him to a good therapist or find him an apartment if she footed the bill were looking after him he doesnt need your help rachel turned to leave her legs unsteady as mine when id been with kimathi and rivers i followed her and was startled when rivers touched my arm just before i triggered the train whistle that red bag ms detective its working well for you is it i nodded warily i had brought the bag with me and a check for five hundred and thirty dollars which id laid on the counter while rivers was taking kimathi into the back of the shop you earned it i figure use the money to help some other poor bastard he stuck the check into one of the bags outer pockets and pushed me through the ropes before i could say anything my aunt was silent while we drove back north but when i stopped in front of petras place she said its so hard to know what to do you think youve married one man and it turns out to be like one of those bad movies where goldie hawn learns the man she thought she married was someone completely different im so so derailed in my life i hired a detective to make sure peter and i were legally married peterd concealed so much from me i thought he was capable of hiding another wife and family what will you do i asked she shook her head i dont know its such a cliché all these wronged women who stand by their men like the new york governors wife im furious with peter i dont want to stand by him and then theres the money we make so much money we have so much and it all came to us because a man was tortured peter got rewarded for that poor man spending his life in prison and turning into that that pathetic her voice gave way but she controlled herself and then went on with an effort petra shes always been so much peters child he wanted a boy he was sure shed be a boy so hes always called her petey and taken her hunting and so on she was always bolder than her other sisters the four that followed her until i told him he had to cherish his girls he couldnt be imagining they were less than a boy would be and now petra is having as much trouble as i am trying to figure out who she is what she thinks about him she gave me a painful smile you did so much for petra and you got badly hurt yourself your body that is but i know youre suffering inside over what your father did i think all peters and my money is dirty but i want to pay you for your oh your time and trouble i know youre not getting a fee for all the hours and days you lost because of us and while im still married and have that joint account you should have some of it she handed me an envelope later when i opened it and found a check for twentyfive thousand i almost threw it out the money was tainted i told lotty i couldnt possibly accept it victoria all money is tainted lotty smiled faintly especially reparations money take it pay your bills go back to italy do something for yourself or something for mr kimathi it wont change his life if you have to file for bankruptcy and cashing the check doesnt put you under any obligation to your uncle i cashed the check and gave part of it to the mighty waters freedom center but the rest i was thankful to use on my bills rachel returned to kansas city and her other daughters but petra stayed on she couldnt go back to the campaign and not just because she didnt want to be around the krumas family brian krumas shut down the campaign once all the charges and countercharges began coming to light his bobbyesque hair in his eyes brian stood in front of a bank of cameras and said he couldnt possibly be a good public servant when his family had colluded in torture to save themselves from the consequences of their own role in killing a civil rights worker of course he looked heroic on television and those of us cynics watching felt sure hed be back on the campaign trail sometime soon still it made me think well of him meanwhile petra was at loose ends she spent hours every day running with the dogs and watching horse races with mr contreras one afternoon she tentatively broached her earlier suggestion that she work in my agency for a time but i didnt think either of us was ready for that i needed a vacation from my family finally i sent petra over to sister carolyn at the freedom center petra owed elton a new home and sister carolyn was able to recruit some people from habitat for humanity who showed petra how to construct a simple place on the river where his old shack had stood carolyn had wanted to give elton sister frankies apartment as soon as it was fixed up but eltons brief moment of heroism hadnt worked any miracles in his ability to be around other people he wanted to be alone away from the sounds and smells of others at night still we capitalized on the desire of every public official in chicago to show what good guys they werewe got the city to donate a piece of land the equivalent of a quarter of a city lot down by the river where eltons shack had stood and when petra and habitat had finished his little house we even got elton hooked up to city water petra still didnt feel comfortable talking to her father although he was cooperating fully with both state and federal authorities in the numerous investigations that were taking place some were looking at the coverup of harmony newsomes murder others were looking into the allegations of torture at the racine avenue station and of course there was larry alitos murder and sister francess later that fall as peter started telling his side of the story he claimed it all started when dornick found out that i was trying to find steve sawyer when harvey realized what petra was saying at the navy pier fundraiser hed gone at once to les strangwell although krumas was afraid his own role in murdering harmony newsome might come to light strangwells only concern was to keep everything buried until after brian made it through the primaries and the general election that meant trying to keep the story under wraps for over a year all summer long while i had felt i was spinning my wheels in my search for lamont and sawyer strangwell and krumas thought i was getting too close to sawyer for comfort and so they called on george dornick dornick with his sophisticated technology and a crew trained at the school of the americas in every known form of combat surveillance and torture was happy to come to harveys rescue once again at the end of the summer as they were coercing petra into helping them break into my home and office dornick had become more brazen and more violent when peter and rachel came to chicago after petra disappeared dornick told them that their other four daughters were as good as dead if either parent told anyone anything about the newsome murder the sawyer torture the death of sister frances the coercion of petra rachel flew back to kansas city and went into hiding with her girls all this emerged slowly of course but terry finchley called me periodically to brief me as the fall wore on a prosecutorial dream came true harvey and dornick began attacking each other harvey claimed it was dornicks idea to blow up sister frances before she could confide in me dornick claimed he knew nothing about it that harvey and strangwell had employed larry alito a loose cannon an alkiedornick had warned them that alito was unreliablewhile strangwell said alito was dornicks goto boy anytime he needed heavy lifting that he wanted to keep private after a lot of hemming and hawing and horse trading the states attorneys office brought charges against krumas for seconddegree murder in connection with harmony newsomes death krumass lawyer had been pressing for involuntary manslaughter and probation but as the national spotlight started shining on chicagos finest the states attorney realized he couldnt afford to let krumas off with nothing but a rap on the knuckles dornicks situation was more complicated he hadnt helped kill harmony newsome but everyone including bobby believed dornick had engineered the subsequent coverup peter sang loud and long on that theme then there was sister frankies death detective finchleys team traced the ford expedition that the bomb throwers drove to one of dornicks personal crew and finchley was willing to believe that dornick had shot alito out of fear that his old buddy would crack and flip for the state if the heat got too intense gabriellas voice returned in the weeks before miss claudia died i was racing the clock hoping to find out what happened to lamont the day i took my aunt to fit for your hoof curtis told me hed persuaded johnny to talk to me he needs to get it off his chest and tell someone and i told him he owed it to miss claudia she needs to know she loved that boy now miss ella if lamont had gone on like our physics teacher wanted been a college professor with degrees after his name shed still have labeled him a failure but miss claudia was pure love down to her bones she deserves to hear and ive made sure johnnyll tell you i wanted to know how curtis and merton communicated i wanted to know if secretly after all curtis was a highranking anaconda but something in his face told me id better not push my luck i got yeoman to organize an emergency visit to stateville for me and met with johnny in the dingy lawyers room one last time id brought one of my photo books with me and laid it between us on the scarred deal table these are the pictures lamont took i said i guess curtis told you i found the negatives merton nodded he showed them to you the night before he disappeared didnt he merton nodded again shut his eyes took a breath another one getting ready to jump off the high dive for me or at least for lamont and miss claudia my man came to me at the waltz right inn just like rose hebert told you he had a set of these prints here and he wanted to go to that piece of shit representing steve show him that some white boy killed harmony and some cop pocketed the evidence we talked it over him and me we knew what went on at the racine avenue station we knew the risk he was running going in there at all but we agreed hed better speak up but i told him to take prints in dont let them have the negatives if they destroy those theres nothing left so off he went the morning the big snow started and the day after it ended later when you could go outside again there he was in my backyard dead his ears had been cut off but hed been killed before that his ears i said so dornick and alito killed him or someone at the station did and they planted his body on you and if you called the cops everyone would agree that it was an anaconda hit dornick would say lamont had turned states evidence against you and that youd murdered him in revenge johnny gave a sour smile youre not so stupid after all are you white girl i have my moments i said drily what did you do i took lamont inside with me and sat with him all daysweating blood youd better believethinking every second that the cops were going to come tear my door down i wouldnt let my wife or my little girl in i made up a big lie a big story and it cost me my marriage my wife she thought i had some other woman in there with me she left in a hurry went to her own mamas i guess because of the storm all the cops were on emergency duty not even that shitbag dornick could come around to check on me and lamont for three days a big warehouse blew down on stony the day before the snow as soon as it got dark i carried my brother down the stairs i got my little girls sled and pulled my man along wrapped in blankets three miles that was hard walking scared every five minutes some damned cop would stop me dont you ever repeat that out loud white girl that the hammer was terrified he gave a mirthless bark of laughter and flexed his arms so that the snakes rippled under my nose anyway i dug through the snow buried him in the foundation of that place on stony no one ever looked in there after the storm i sat by the newsman every day at three when the early edition hit the stands looking but they just built right on top of my boy they never looked they never found him day three up comes that shit alito merry as can be acting on a tip that i had drugs on the premises they had a warrant and they searched high and low but youd better believe the crib was clean i scrubbed that place from window to floorand more than once tooand i had curtis there to watch they didnt plant nothing my only joy was knowing they were going crazy trying to find out what happened to the body they were pissed as hell that the place was clean but they finally took off for months alito would stop by or sometimes dornick now and again but after a while it all died down all died down until you came along nosing into it when i looked at the pictures it seemed to me you might have saved dr kings life i opened the photo book at the shot that showed the tattooed arm shoving kings head down mertons mouth set in a bitter line i saved him for some white punk to put a bullet in two years later thats all and what did it cost miss harmony died took a lot of light out of the south side when that baseball hit her in the eye stevekimathi he calls himself nowthey rearranged his privates and his brain for him and they killed my man lamont thats a high price my homeys paid for one little shove of my arm your daughter might like to know i ventured the anger that was always smoldering behind his eyes lightened slightly yeah take the tale to dayo let her knowhow did you put iti had my moments too against all protocol i leaned across the table and squeezed his hand where the tongue of the snake licked his knuckles when i got back to the city i took the story to bobby but he said he had enough going on without digging under a building on stony island looking for one more dead gangbanger even if lamont gadsdens there even if we find him what am i going to do about it itll be mertons word against dornicks and even if for one day out of my entire forty years on the force i am willing to believe a gang scum over a cop id never sell the states attorney on it dornick has plenty on his plate let it ride vicki let it ride i let it ride but i did cash in some old chips of my own with the state i didnt try to get johnnys sentence reducedhe was in prison for serious and welldocumented crimesbut i did see that he was transferred to a less punitive part of the system and i let dayo see the photos let her see her father had saved martin luther kings life that hot august day forty years ago i was also able to tell the story to miss ella and to miss claudia before she died miss ella seemed almost sorry that id found her son it took away one of her pleasures the pleasure of complaining that i was taking her money and not delivering but miss claudia in one of her final lucid moments told her sister to be ashamed of herself hate and bitterness always wrong ella always wrong lamont with jesus i know it i know in my heart white girl you did good job hard i know hurt burn beaten you stay working i know pastor karen tell me all good good girl she pressed my fingers as hard as she could and then lay back against her pillows at first i thought shed fallen asleep but she was just mustering her strength this time to tell us she wanted pastor karen to preach at her funeral and when ella harrumphed about women being silent in church claudia said men kill lamont men hurt world do war do torture pastor karen preach that was the last time she spoke she died two days later without ever regaining consciousness again after the funeral after the supper in the church hall with everyones favorite casserole and ham and the blackeyed peas with chitterlings that miss claudia so loved max and lotty took me away with them for a long weekend in the country the day after i got back jake thibaut knocked at my door id seen him a few times just passing on the stairs him liking to joke about whether i needed him to get a clarinet case or something to carry my body around but we hadnt really talked this evening he had a cd in his hand those tapes you gave meyour mother singingi had them professionally mastered for you she had an amazing voice im privileged that i got to hear it i had forgotten about the tapes in the chaos id been living in now i put the cd in my stereo as gabriellas voice that golden bell filled my home i felt so overcome with all the grief and loss of the last forty years that i could hardly bear to listen forse un giorno il cielo ancora sentirà pietà di me one day perhaps heaven again will feel pity for me i played it over and over while jake stood awkwardly by at one point he disappeared but then returned moments later with his bass he played the aria through first in company then in counterpoint with my mothers voice after that it seemed natural to bring out her red wineglasses and toast her memory and exchange our life stories and finally to lie together on the living room rug while mozart and my mother filled the room sara paretsky
