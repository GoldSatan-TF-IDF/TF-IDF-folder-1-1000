douglas jackson defender of rome i rome ad they came at him in waves over the crushed summer grass tall and lean bred to war their spear points glittering in the low morning sunlight and the sound of their coming like thunder and as they came he slew them he had been born for this to bring death his mind exploded with the savage atavistic joy of the warrior as the point of the gladius with the power of his strong right arm behind it took out throats and spilled guts each stroke confirmed by the haze of scarlet that is the only true signature of battle one by one he watched them die and he counted his victims by the names of the romans he avenged for lunaris for paulus for messor for falco for valerius the next stroke faltered and the battle froze around him the screams of the dying trapped like flies in a web spears caught at the very moment of the plunge entangled enemies balanced precariously on the razor edge between life and death no not valerius gaius valerius verrens lives i am gaius valerius verrens the words echoed in his head and he wondered if he had joined the gods in their elysian fastness that was when he felt her presence a flare of flametipped auburn at the very edge of his vision piercing green eyes that drilled into his soul boudicca his enemy at her unspoken command battle resumed the spears fell men lived or died but now the tempo had changed always in the past his had been the speed his had been the vision other men had been too slow or too blind other men had died now it was different caught in a trap of his own making valerius moved with the leaden torpor of a man forcing his way through a chestdeep lake the sword was a dead weight in his hand and he struggled to keep the big curveedged shield high the blades of his enemies flashed and darted a blizzard of bright iron that sought the weak points in his armour and the soft flesh of his throat and he was helpless against them the sting of edged metal made him scream in frustration and pain and for the first time he knew the despair of the vanquished he called upon his gods but knew they had already forsaken him valerius a womans hand held the sword that killed him valerius he opened his eyes fabia you were dreaming you cried out it took a moment to resolve the familiar sights and scents of the bedroom with what had gone before his body trembled with nervous energy and the sheets twisted beneath him were damp with sweat it had not been like that at all he had stood back like a coward aloof from the battle a newmade cripple men had died in their thousands and their tens of thousands but he had not killed a single one fabia leaned over him golden and beautiful and safe and placed a cool hand on his brow eyes the colour and complexity of polished sapphire filled with concern and something more than concern a pinprick of guilt speared him and he instinctively reached for the pendant at his throat it was a tiny golden boar the symbol of the twentieth legion you must have loved her very much it was a statement not a question i killed her it wasnt true he had betrayed maeve but the sword that had taken her life in boudiccas last battle had been another mans fabia bent to kiss the mottled stump of his right arm her breasts brushing lightly against his stomach the loss of his hand had been the price of life each day he awoke surprised it was no longer there each day he endured a pain for which there was no cure it was his burden and he would carry it for ever like his guilt he lay back and stared at the painted ceiling plump cheerful nymphs hunted deer and antelope across lush grassland as the goddess diana looked on approvingly fabia sighed and settled half across him her body supple and soft against his angular hardness he was three weeks from his twentysixth birthday and it had been almost two years since he returned from a britain bled dry by romes vengeance to be acclaimed hero of rome the corona aurea placed upon his brow by emperor nero himself the honour had brought him fame which he neither wanted nor deserved and neros favour which time had taught him was a fickle thing and not to be relied upon at first the young emperor had delighted in having a man close to his own age a champion of war close by his side valerius must attend court each day at the gilded palace on the palatine hill to decorate neros assemblies and delight him with his tales of battle and comradeship and sacrifice of course he was flattered what soldier even a soldier as damaged as he would not be great men consuls and generals bowed to him amongst the marbled pillars and painted statues beautiful women sought him out and ushered him to shadowy corners where they whispered of unlikely possibilities and even more unlikely certainties and all the time he felt the emperors hard little overbright eyes following his every move and growing ever hotter he wasnt a fool he had heard the stories in the legion he had lived with men good men and bad and knew that every mans taste did not follow natural lines and that some men knew no boundaries at all as a boy he had known love or something he had believed was love but what was acceptable between boys did not have to be right between men before the offer was made he let it be known that it would be refused to avoid the storm which would inevitably follow he had spent a year living in greece hoping to be forgotten the selfimposed exile gave him the opportunity to resume his philosophical studies under the great apollonius who had halted his wanderings for a time in athens but when he returned his name was still on some courtiers list he continued to be invited to the palatine he was watched but now the watching was different dangerous previously when he had praised the tactics of britains governor his audience had cried out in agreement now his listeners turned away with shakes of the head muttering words like despot and butcher paulinus had gone too far they said he had despoiled the province when he should have revitalized it paulinus was to be recalled now when men stood at his shoulder he understood they were not listening but memorizing and recording for the time when a slim finger trailed through the cooling sweat that had pooled in the hollow of his chest we should bathe valerius dashed the melancholy from his head and smiled at her as she uncoiled herself from his body and led the way to the little bathhouse when they had enjoyed the mixed pleasures of the caldarium and tepidarium fabia wrapped herself in a sheet and ushered him to a polished stone table where she oiled his body with practised hands easing each muscle of his shoulders back and legs then turning him over to do the same to chest and stomach as her strong fingers fluttered over him he felt the hot blood of desire rising again before he could act on it she dropped the sheet and swung herself up to settle over him in a single movement the intensity of her heat made him gasp i suppose this means youll cost me more he grumbled attempting to think of anything but what was happening below his waist oh no valerius fabias voice was the texture of raw silk drawn across rough wood this is my gift to myself stay just the way you are much later she saw him to the door and raised her lips to allow a decorous farewell kiss fabia faustina high class courtesan friend of the empress poppaea augusta sabina and probably the most beautiful woman in rome strange that she should love him when she knew he could never return it and what do the courts promise today are you defence or prosecution or both she asked lightly neither valerius allowed himself a sad smile i must be with olivia fabia stared at him but her thoughts remained concealed in the bluegold depths of her eyes tell her i send my prayers where fabias beauty glowed like an imperial park in full blossom olivias was more ethereal an alpine snowfield touched only by the wind or a sculpture of virgin marble before the artist applied the first brush of paint valerius stared down at his sister as she lay in the house on the clivus scauri regal and pale as an egyptian princess her long almost raven hair framed her face each strand placed precisely by her maid julia his sister had the sculpted features so admired in the family but more delicate than in the male line a slim aristocratic nose a long curving jawline that reflected resolve and strength of purpose and a mouth that before her illness had always seemed ready to smile in fact as he studied her he realized she had changed even in the short time since he had last seen her and he replaced the word delicate with fragile she is wasting away he tried to keep the accusation from his voice the fastidiously dressed man at his side stirred uncomfortably we are doing everything we can the serving girl administers the daily draught as she has been instructed she bathes her mistress only with warm water and serves thin soup three times a day more is spilled than eaten valerius pointed out metellus the physician frowned making his pendulous jowls quiver and the watery eyes narrowed we can only force so much upon her or it will do more harm than good she is thin but not yet skeletal with the gods will there is still hope you have sacrificed to asclepius as i advised valeriuss faith in the gods had been sorely tested by the two days he had spent in the temple of claudius waiting to be torn limb from limb by vengeful british warriors the fact that he had survived had done nothing to restore it but he would do anything that might help olivia i visited the hospital on the tiber island this morning and the priest dedicated a white ram to the god the doctor nodded impressed a white ram was no mere token he wondered if his fee was quite sufficient valerius continued the maid julia has also carried a sacrifice to the good goddess again this was only sensible bona dea the goddess of women healing and fertility could be counted on to intercede on olivias behalf from her temple on the aventine hill then you also are doing everything you can he hesitated perhaps if your father valerius shook his head he wont come here he didnt have to say more his father lucius had staked their familys future on a match between olivia and an indecently rich but very elderly second cousin of the emperor olivia had taken one look at the balding wrinkled figure of her betrothed a man blessed with a single blackened tooth and vowed to cut her wrists there and then luciuss reputation had suffered more from the fact that he had capitulated to her threat than that shed rejected calpurnius ahenobarbus under the law he would have been entitled to sell olivia into slavery or even kill her but for all his stuffy patrician pomposity he had always been a loving father and had chosen disgrace rather than cause more distress to his daughter since the scandal he had locked himself away on the family estate at fidenae and devoted himself to his grapes and his olive trees valerius had contacted him three times with the news that she was sick but on each occasion his messenger had been turned away the physicians who treated her speculated that the gods were taking their revenge for olivias lack of filial devotion but valerius dismissed the theory as a desperate attempt to justify their failure he suspected that metellus a wellmeaning drunkard who claimed to have studied in smyrna and alexandria had now joined their number as he watched olivias eyes opened shale dark liquid and slightly bemused recognition came slowly but when she was certain of his identity her pale lips parted in a faint smile and before the eyes closed again her hand fluttered towards his he sat on the bed and took it it was cool and almost weightless olivia sighed lightly and he felt her fingers tighten it will be like this when she dies he thought this helpless emptiness i will sit here and her hand will grow cold and the room will grow dark and i will beg her to stay but her spirit will fly from her as i have seen it fly from so many dying men he began talking of hope and love and the future knowing she heard him but not whether she understood and as he talked his mind drifted back to a time when a skinny girl with a dirty face and a torn tunic dogged his every footstep forever asking foolish questions he couldnt answer why and how and what everlasting days by the narrow treelined river that provided water for the estate hunting little green frogs among the weeds and plastering each other with slimy speckled spawn other days spent chasing elusive brown songbirds among the vines in the certain knowledge that they would flutter to the next row and the chase would be up again the bitter taste of unripe grapes and the awfulness that inevitably followed watching each other grow and the day that caused him to wonder what kind of man he truly was when his patience finally snapped and encouraged by the slave boys he had locked her in the cellar below the house and walked away he would never forget the look in her eyes when he returned an hour later to find her frozen in the darkness or the note of accusation in the whispered childs voice please never leave me alone again valerius he squeezed her hand and stood up i will do anything to make her well he knew the words alone meant nothing he might have been talking to himself he might have been talking to the gods he no longer believed in instead he found he was addressing the fat physician whose presence he had entirely forgotten metellus felt a thrill of panic at the certainty in valeriuss voice the tall commanding presence and the hard eyes that pinned him like a legionary javelin he had done all he could truly he had he raced through the remedies in his mind as if he was arguing for his life the herbs mixed in warm leaded wine to cool the fever wolfsbane in minute doses to stimulate the blood extract of hemp to calm the regime exemplary each step taken with a physicians care and forethought was there anything more no twice no except there may be a man where can i find him ii rome was changing nero had vowed to turn the city into the kind of modern metropolis befitting the capital of an empire which ruled over forty million people if a street fell into terminal disrepair or an urban slum burned he had dictated that it be rebuilt around an open square allowing space and freedom and light for the residents and providing a barrier against the fires that could spread with such lightning rapidity through the citys fourteen districts in doing so he followed the lead of his uncle caligula but where caligula had forced the residents to pay for the improvements from their own pockets the young emperor increased his popularity by accepting the burden himself unfortunately for valerius some of the worst areas of the city remained untouched he held the torch high as he studied the narrow fetid street ahead from an alleyway to his left came the sounds of raucous humourless laughter and screams that might be ecstasy or terror i should have hired a bodyguard he thought and cursed as he stood in something which could have been animal or vegetable but was undoubtedly obscenely soft and stank like a weekold corpse why must it always be the subura romes cesspit apartment blocks six and seven storeys high towered like cliffs above him smoky oil lamps glowing in windows that held at best the threat of the contents of a night soil pot if not the pot itself twin wagon ruts doubled as an open sewer the contents reeking in trapped heat that barely cooled from one day to the next every step was an invitation to fall into a trap and every darkened entrance a potential ambush still hed had no choice but to wait for julias return and if hed tried to recruit some battered exgladiator or retired legionary from a tavern the likelihood was that hed only be paying for the dagger that tickled his liver or slit his throat left or right he ran the physicians directions through his head as he considered the junction of two identical passageways it had seemed much simpler in the comfort of the villas atrium just follow the old via subura until you reach the via tiburtina and carry on until youre a hundred paces from the esquiline gate he has rooms in the insula on the right ground floor in daylight valerius would have had to fight his way through a surging mass of people at risk from nothing more than carelessly wielded chair poles or bony elbows jostled and hustled melting in the heat but never directly threatened now he was trapped in a pitch dark verminous labyrinth where every street appeared the same and the only consolation was that the hour was so late the few inhabitants hed come across had been rolling drunk he turned sharply at a rustling sound the hand beneath his cloak reaching instinctively for his sword the rustling stopped to be replaced by a low whine and he laughed at himself gaius valerius verrens hero of rome the man who had held the temple of claudius to the last man scared of a scavenging hound left or right right he had pleaded to stay in the legions even though he knew his injury meant he would never again fight in a battle line no his father had said this is our great opportunity the law then the senate make the name valerius ring through the marble halls of the palatine hed obeyed out of duty the same sense of duty that had made him the soldier he had once been and he had prospered thanks to the patronage that the corona aurea attracted every retired veteran be he general or legionary of the third rank wanted to be represented by gaius valerius verrens as with his battles he won more cases than he lost because he took a professional care in his preparations and fought hard for his clients even when he didnt believe a word they told him the street widened and he saw a pale light ahead some sort of open space he is a medical man just arrived from the east metellus had said some say he is a worker of wonders and some say he deals in perfumed smoke and polished mirrors a judaean he works among his people seeking no profit he does not advertise his services you will have to be very persuasive what does he look like how should i know the light came from a noisome drinking den behind an open yard with a stone fountain carved in the shape of a fish valerius hurried by trying to look like just another drunk but the eyes that watched him were the eyes of predators not those of ordinary men a man might survive in subura without being part of a gang paying a gang or owning a gang but his hold on life and his familys would be precarious redhaired culleo bastard son of only jupiter knew whom had been running with gangs for as long as he could remember first as a lookout while others stole then as a thief learning to steal bread and fruit and meat from the streetside stalls while the younger boys distracted the owners with growing strength came greater opportunity and he had become an enforcer he had killed his first man by the time he was fifteen and cut the throat of his predecessor three years later he favoured the knife and he carried two wickedly curved longbladed weapons that he fondly kept killing sharp and which were equally good for stabbing or slicing culleo was short and wide but his build disguised his speed which was usually enough to frighten other men into dying quietly unless a lesson had to be taught he preferred to attack from behind because it was quicker and simpler in subura or at least in the streets around the silver mullet he was the wolf and any man who didnt belong was his prey the torch valerius carried attracted culleo like a moth to the flame why would a drunk carry a torch when he could bounce home off the walls he knew as intimately as his mothers left tit once they had spotted him he was theirs a tall man though he crouched and tried to hide it dressed in an expensive cloak a fool then any cloak waved about the subura was asking to be stolen and a man with a cloak would have other things worth stealing even if it was only his clothes and his shoes there was something else too from a dozen paces away culleos sharp eyes had noted the little details another mans might not the way the fool carried himself the slight favouring of his right side and the strong jaw and sharp planes of his face the description could have fitted twenty other men apart from one important detail that could easily be hidden beneath the cloak but culleo had sensed word had been passed down to him from the invisible network that all the gangs knew to obey even the wolf must give up a proportion of his kill to the hungry tiger culleo knew that if you were to survive in the subura they were to be answered to above all others he smiled revealing a carnage of rotting teeth someone wanted this man dead and was willing to pay handsomely for it he studied his victims speed and direction knowing the cloaked man would increase his pace once he was past the open courtyard who would walk slowly through the subura at night iugolo fimus he called two of his men from the tavern one older and massive with a single eye and a red weeping socket and the other wiry deceptively boyish and even for the subura remarkably dirty take the back road by the tannery and cut him off before tiburtina if were quick we can catch him at the alley of the poxed tart dont move until i get there with the greek four against one was it enough he could gather more men but it would take time to rouse them from their beds and sober them up by then the target might be gone it was enough the mark was a fool a sheep to be shorn no he grinned to himself a lamb to be slaughtered valerius moved fast after he passed the inn but his eyes never stopped searching for danger the street narrowed again and the flickering orange torchlight bounced from filthspattered walls creating the illusion of constant movement so his senses continually reacted to nonexistent threats a pair of almondshaped eyes glowed eerily at him from a doorway strange how a rats eyes reflected red in the torchlight yet the cats which hunted it were like luminous emeralds he almost didnt see the movement it was just the merest glint of light on metal fifty paces ahead in a place and at a height where there should be none his breathing quickened he willed himself to be calm sought the stillness which had always been his before battle let it build slowly a heartbeat at a time the countdown to violence his muscles tensed and his senses sharpened how many of them it didnt matter he couldnt run this was their territory and they would hunt him down in seconds but they didnt know hed seen them and that meant at least for the moment they and not he were the hunted he maintained his pace but his fingers tightened on his sword hilt when they stepped into the street he could have laughed aloud only two a skinny feral child with a gaptoothed snarl armed with what appeared to be a leatherworkers awl and a oneeyed giant wielding a nailed cudgel that was like a toy in his massive hands did they really believe he was so easy to kill onearmed or not he had fought boudiccas champions to a standstill on the field before colonia had walked among the numberless dead on the bloody slope where suetonius paulinus governor of britain had manufactured her destruction he did not fear these men go back to your whores or your sisters whichever it is you bed he spat the challenge but the boy ignored the threat and capered right and left to block the street while the giant smiled and stroked his cudgel the mocking smile gave valerius his warning the smile wasnt aimed at him but at someone behind him he spun letting the cloak billow wide to create a more awkward target knowing the torch in his hand would attract the eyes of whoever was coming for him two more less than five paces away and attacking silently at the run over the cobbles no point in trying to hold them off it would only give the giant time to pound him to mincemeat ready for the boy to take his eyes out with the spike it had to be quick the attacker on the right a swarthy darkbrowed creature had slightly outrun his companion valerius took advantage of the split second it gave him to dash the blazing torch into the brigands face and the man fell back screaming and clawing at his burnedout eyes the momentum of the spin took him into the path of the fourth robber a confident redhaired bruiser armed with a curving blade that slashed at the romans throat valerius brought up his right hand to block the sweeping blow and was rewarded by a puzzled glare as the blade bit into something solid with a sharp snap culleo still wore the look of disbelief when the gladius in valeriuss left hand darted from beneath the cloak the triangular point punched into the soft flesh below his ribs before valerius angled the blade upward into the squealing gang leaders heart he twisted the short sword free feeling the familiar warm liquid rush as another mans life poured out over his hand and turned to face his surviving ambushers but the boy and the oneeyed giant were not prepared to die for a cloak not with their leader quivering in a widening pool of his own blood and the greek mewing for his mother with a face like an underdone steak and eyes that would never see again they backed quickly down the alley and vanished into the darkness valerius studied the remains of the torch smouldering in his right fist it was smashed beyond use he sheathed the gladius and with his left hand pulled the smoking bundle free from the carved walnut replica that had replaced the missing right the artificial hand had been designed to carry a shield but did the job of torchbearer just as well it was a little singed with a deep score across the knuckles where the redhaired bandits knife had struck but it had done its job he checked the bindings of the cowhide socket to which the hand was attached if they loosened the leather chafed against the flesh of his stump but normally a little olive oil ensured it sat comfortably enough hed thought he would never fight again but he soon realized that many men were just as capable of defending themselves with their left hand as with their right he had toured the ludi romes gladiator schools until he found the man he needed marcus a scarred old fighter who had won his freedom by his skills in the arena now he trained with the gladiators most mornings and he prided himself on becoming a better swordsman with his left hand than he had ever been with his right the first thing marcus had taught valerius was how the wooden hand could be used to block an opponents swing and expose him to a counterthrust which way to the via tiburtina he walked on without looking back let them rot it was what they had planned for him the blinded man was still pleading for his mother when someone cut his throat an hour later valerius had noticed a subtle change since he returned from britain where in the same instant he had been both betrayed and saved by the woman he loved for a time death had seemed preferable to the loss of maeve and his hand but as the months passed he realized that she had provided him with a precious opportunity before he had served with the men of the twentieth legion he had been young naive and selfish the naivety and the youth had been soldiered out of him leaving a new valerius toughened both physically and mentally the way the iron core of a sword is hardened by the combination of heat and hammer but he had still been selfish only now could he see how wrong it had been to expect maeve to leave her home her family and her culture and follow him to rome where she would have been shunned as an exotic uneducated and uncultured celt gradually he had resolved to live his life differently that was why he had finally agreed to his fathers demand that he return to the law when he wanted nothing more than to breathe the stink of old sweat and a damp eightman tent eat cold oatmeal for breakfast and lead men into battle and why if it was offered he would take up the quaestorship of a province the next step on the cursus honorum and his road to the senate the road widened as he approached the esquiline gate the apartment block metellus had described could be any one of three dilapidated structures on his right and at first valerius despaired of finding the judaean on closer inspection he noticed that the ground floor of the centre insula contained a shop selling exotic eastern spices and herbs no goods were on show at this time of the night but on the wall below the window the trader had marked prices for his wares since every physician was a herbalist of some sort valerius could think of no better place to begin his search a chink of light at the edge of the heavy sackcloth covering the shop doorway told him at least someone was awake and he could make out the subdued murmur of voices a natural wariness made him hesitate the judaeans were a haughty people from a province that had been under imperial rule for fifty years but had achieved neither prominence nor importance trade with the empire had brought judaea prosperity and drawn thousands of its inhabitants to rome presumably including the man he sought they were respected as drivers of hard bargains and despised for the barbarism of their religion which a dozen years earlier had incited emperor claudius to expel every judaean from the city now they were returning but mostly kept to their own districts it was unusual to find a jew carrying out business in the centre of rome he approached the curtain and took a deep breath iii what hed mistaken for murmured voices turned out to be a kind of low rhythmic chanting from the rear of the building a single oil lamp spluttered in an alcove by the doorway casting a dull light and emitting foulsmelling black smoke that clouded the upper part of the room sacks and boxes lay stacked against the walls and a table with a set of brass scales stood in the centre of the floor beside a chest covered by a white cloth this building was one of the older insulae in rome constructed perhaps fifty years earlier solid at least unlike the shoddy thinwalled skeletons of more recent times but showing its age where the plaster had dropped from the limewashed walls in the far corner to his left was another door and it was from this that the chanting emerged but not he thought directly again he hesitated reluctant to interrupt a family gathering or religious ceremony however barbarous but his sisters life was at stake hello the word echoed from the stark walls silence a sudden total silence that almost made him wonder if the chanting had only existed in his mind hello he shouted a second time feeling foolish now and sorely tempted to just turn and go after a moment the silence was replaced by an odd rumbling sound like muted faraway thunder and a small head crowned by a shock of jet curls appeared round the corner of the doorway two walnut eyes studied him with frank curiosity greetings to you the tawny girl looked about six and he gave her his most reassuring smile i am looking for the physician who lives in your building without a word she took his hand and led him through the inner doorway into a narrow corridor at the end of the corridor they turned into a poorly lit room where a thin greybearded man sat hunched over a wooden bench crushing herbs in a crude mortar each circle of the heavy stone pestle accompanied by the rumble valerius had heard earlier the man looked up and nodded and the girl hurried out they studied each other for a long moment the way men do on meeting for the first time the older man seeking any sign of threat or danger and valerius trying to reconcile the shrunken figure at the table with the conflicting stories metellus had gabbled he guessed the judaeans age at between fiftyfive and sixty the heavy tightcurled beard would be with him until he died perhaps a little whiter deep lines that might have been carved by a knife point etched hollow cheeks and a high forehead providing a permanent reminder of a life of toil trial and valerius suspected physical suffering the folds of a thick eastern coat engulfed his thin frame yet beneath the robe lay a suggestion of power conserved for more important days the eyes solemn and steady and the colour of damp ashes had an ageless quality and their depths contained conflicting messages wariness which was only sensible in the circumstances understanding but of what humour was there held in reserve for a more appropriate moment and knowledge for the time it was needed but a single quality stood out above all certainty this man knew precisely who and what he was salve you are welcome to my home the greeting was formal and the curious lisping accent turned the v into a w valerius bowed gaius valerius verrens at your service i apologize for the late hour and the lack of an appointment but i have come on a matter of urgency the beard twitched but valerius couldnt be certain whether it was in irritation or acknowledgement may i offer you wine thank you no the roman said not impolitely but aware that he was unlikely to enjoy anything served in this household he glanced at his surroundings small cloth sacks each with its clear label were stacked in heaps along the rear wall shelves filled with stoppered jars oddshaped objects whose origin he didnt like to speculate the scent of herbs and spices filled his nostrils but there was something else too a heaviness in the atmosphere that told him other people had shared this room only a few moments earlier he wondered again about the chanting and noted that the judaean had made no attempt to introduce himself the grey eyes studied him and he found himself resenting the frank penetrating gaze my sister he blurted is sick yes and you come to me for help at this hour are all your roman physicians asleep the man smiled gently to take the sting from his words as i say it is urgent olivia i am sorry the judaean shook his head i regret i cannot help you it is forbidden i may only work within my own community you understand with my own people valerius felt a momentary panic please he said at least listen to what i have to say the physician turned back to his work and the rumble of pestle in mortar was an invitation for valerius to leave but he had underestimated the romans determination valeriuss sword came half clear of its scabbard and the unmistakable metallic hiss brought the grinding to a halt the judaean raised his head with a look of regretful distaste so a true roman warrior at his best when his opponent is unarmed you would threaten a harmless old man would it salve your conscience would it make he frowned olivia well again he shook his head spilling blood never solved anything my young friend valerius held his gaze but the grip on the sword loosened he hadnt even realized hed drawn it they said things about you i had hoped they were not true the bearded man gave a humourless laugh they fear me they say i am a fraud and a murderer that i poison husbands for their wives and wives for their husbands they say he stretched for a jar behind him reaching inside to display its contents a slimy piece of offwhite flesh that i use the fruits of our circumcisions in my potions valerius swallowed the judaean smiled the poison sac of a sea snake it has medicinal qualities as you can see all that they say is true they also said you were a magician i had hoped that was true the older man gave a dismissive grunt do you pray then pray to your gods to help your sister valerius had an image of divine claudius immortalized in bronze towering over the doomed fugitives huddled in the grandiose temple built in his name i no longer pray the gods have deserted me for a few moments the only sound in the room was the faint irregular buzz of the old mans breathing tell me valerius closed his eyes and the words came out in a rush she woke up one morning a month ago and had lost the use of her arms and legs entirely no not completely she could move them but not use them properly she made a slight improvement but two weeks ago she could not get out of bed she has been in it since now she cannot raise her head to take food she weakens by the day the judaean chewed his lip has she had convulsions seizures valerius shook his head a long silence developed from seconds into minutes eventually valerius could take the tension no longer can you help us the judaean turned to him the grey eyes serious perhaps please fetch rachel for me she is in the next room when valerius returned the man whispered instructions in the girls ear and she hurried off returning a few minutes later with a small twist of cloth which she handed to the roman you must dissolve this in boiling water and make her drink every drop you understand every drop or it is wasted then then you wait valerius hesitated he looked down at his hand was this all hed come for a tiny twist of grey powder but what more had he expected thank you he said reaching for his purse the judaean shook his head when the day comes to repay me you will know it for some reason a chill ran through valerius at the innocuous words he waited for further explanation but the physician continued do not raise your hopes too high the elixir will help for a time but the effects will not be permanent he ushered valerius out accompanying him through the corridor and into the room which led to the street the white cloth had slipped from the chest which told valerius where the judaean kept the powder he noticed a faint symbol carved into the wood it looked like a large x transfixed by a single vertical stroke with a small halfcircle attached to the top the old man saw his interest the symbol of my craft he said dismissively interesting but unfortunately valueless in rome valerius turned in the doorway will you visit her the judaean sighed my name is joshua yes i will visit her iv the performer gazed out over his audience seeking signs of genuine approval instead all he saw were the imbecilic fixed smiles of those too uncultivated to appreciate the finer points of his art and held in thrall by the singer not the song the song was the tale of niobe which he had performed at the neronia the festival he had endowed and told the story of a woman brought low by her own ambition a queen who had attempted to supplant apollo and diana with her own children only to lose them all he heard his voice quiver with emotion as he reached the point where the seven sons and seven daughters were hunted down by the arrows of the gods and their mother turned to stone a memorial to her own greed a tear ran down the cheek of the emperor nero claudius drusus germanicus his mother agrippina had likewise died of greed hadnt he given her everything palaces gold jewels and slaves influence even perhaps too much influence still it wasnt enough she had to have power she thought he was still a child they were staring at him now mouths open and he realized he had stopped singing before the end of the song how strange she still had such an effect on him he smiled and bowed and the slack faces resumed their grinning and the cheering began washing over him like a warm oily sea sensuous and invigorating how he despised them all yes she had to have power he of all people could understand that when one has tasted ultimate power the power to decide whether a man or a woman lives or dies no other power will suffice he had been weak at first even kind in the years after he had ascended to the throne of rome he had listened to his advisers but when he had spoken those close to him had not listened nor understood that was before he had proved he was capable of wielding true power after a few carefully chosen disposals even seneca had listened he who had never known when to keep his mouth closed but had still managed to survive the wrath of uncle gaius and devious old claudius he liked seneca had even trusted him once but now he was nothing but a nuisance he picked up a flower that had been thrown at his feet it was longstemmed with a fringe of small white petals and he began to pluck them one by one still smiling and acknowledging the cheers kill him dont kill him kill him dont kill him he continued until he came to the last petal and paused dont kill him he sighed seneca always the fortunate one not mother he had tried to warn her but like niobe she just wouldnt listen so she had to be removed they should have been singing about her death for a thousand years a death worthy of the gods themselves only a true artist could have devised it a ship that collapsed upon itself leaving the after part to float off still containing the crushed remains of poor dear agrippina lost at sea plucked by neptune to sit at his side for all eternity they had botched it of course the fools of carpenters and she had lived he hadnt even known she could swim still the deed was eventually done and those who had deprived her of her opportunity for immortality would never make another mistake he walked down the broad stairway to where his wife poppaea waited flanked by slaves holding a golden canopy she looked truly enchanting today her flawless features framed by tight curls of lustrous chestnut smiling she took his arm and they marched through the throng as rose petals fell at their feet and perfumed water scented the air around them he nodded at each shouted compliment a triumph caesar the glory of the world no bird ever sang sweeter lord and knew it was all lies he knew it was lies because he understood he was not the great artist he wished to be did they think him a fool to be deceived by such flattery he who had expended so many millions in the quest to become what he was not oh he improved with every tutor and every hour of practice but he had come to understand that genius was godgiven and not some whim that anyone could command not even an emperor all the hours of practice and the degrading stomachchurning deceits he had resorted to and he could barely hold a note yet when he was on the stage he felt like a god and the sound of the applause lifted him and carried him to jupiters righthand side he would not give up the applause agrippina would have understood but she had abandoned him she came to him in the night sometimes lamenting the ordinariness of her end and still admonishing him for the loss of the snakeskin bracelet she had placed on his wrist in his infant bed her visits left him shaking in terror though he would reveal that to no man he hadnt understood his need for her until she was gone whom could he trust if not his own blood now there was no one he gripped poppaeas arm more tightly and she turned to him with a puzzled frown the limpid green eyes full of concern he smiled at her but he knew she was not convinced by the mask because the frown deepened dear poppaea clever and faithful octavia his first wife had hated her but octavia was gone and poppaea was in her place poppaea had wanted octavia dead how could he deny her but what about the letter the letter vexed him thoughts of the letter brought torquatus his trusted and feared prefect of the praetorian guard to mind and from torquatus it was but a short step to the onearmed tribune the hero verrens a darkness descended on his mind and the noise of the crowd diminished he had wished to be the young legionary officers friend a true friend and had given freely of his devotion and his patronage and what had he received in return rejection did verrens truly believe the slight could be ignored he wasnt even as pretty as the other boys the charioteers and the lithesome young palace servants who squealed so delightfully and were so flexible did this partman think a common soldier was too good for an emperor did the hero believe he nero could not match his bravery he felt poppaea squirm and knew hed hurt her but his grip on her arm didnt loosen well in time the hero would discover the folly of his ways in time but for the moment torquatus believed he could be useful in the matter of the letter v is there any improvement julia the russethaired celtic slave who was olivias closest companion shook her head nothing he read something in her voice you do not approve i approve of anything that makes her well again but these people they are so different we should trust in our own gods that word trust again valerius wanted to believe but everything he saw with his own eyes made him doubt they had given olivia the judaeans potion an hour earlier but so far there had been no effect a thought sent a shudder through him perhaps the gods were punishing him for his lack of piety and he was the reason olivia lay there helpless a pale shadow of the cheerful young woman she had been a few months ago but if he believed that he would go mad we must do everything we can whatever it costs she nodded and as she left she allowed her hand to touch his he knew it was an invitation but that had been a long time ago and his life had enough complications he slept for a while on a couch beside his sisters bed until some inner sense detected movement olivias eyes opened and she looked up at him this time recognition was instant and he saw the wonder in her face but it wasnt only at his presence i feel strange her voice was hoarse from lack of use and he quickly fetched a cup of water from the jug in the corner of the room he felt a moment of panic strange had the judaean poisoned her when he placed the cup to her lips he was surprised when she raised her head to meet it something she hadnt been able to do for a week she surprised him again by gently raising her arm wondering at her own ability to achieve the simple task and again by smiling at him the old olivia is father here she asked i thought i heard the sound of his voice he shook his head he is busy with the estate theyre getting ready for harvest i wish i could help with the harvest the way i once did she said the simple statement breaking his heart you will be able to soon when you are properly well i feel well now she insisted and attempted to raise herself to a sitting position he pushed her gently back one thing at a time baby sister olivia smiled at the old endearment first we have to build you up you need to eat she looked at him as if food was an entirely new notion he backed off all right a little broth then no please its just she shook her head it seems such a long time since i ate proper food im ravenous he called for julia who burst into tears when she saw olivia awake valerius watched his sister eat a little boiled chicken breast with a ripe peach from the garden and studied her the change astonished him a few hours earlier she had been an invalid now she looked almost capable of dancing his joy was tempered by joshuas warning the effects will not be permanent even so this was hope and hope was something he hadnt felt for many weeks when she had eaten she insisted valerius help her sit up i will have a conversation like a human being she said i have had enough of being a corpse she studied him as he had been studying her you are unhappy valerius i can see it in your eyes he shrugged with a little halfsmile but couldnt find the words to tell her what he felt me she said reading his mind you must not mind brother i know i am dying he opened his mouth to protest but she put a finger to his lips no do not deny it even though you have worked this magic today i still feel myself fading but do not be sad i suffer no pain only weakness the gods are calling me and when the time comes i will go willingly all i ask is that you remember me at the lemuria i would like to see father again but i understand but it is not just your little sister i have seen it since you came back from britain she stroked his wooden hand something changed you there and not just this they had never talked of it before but a hollow feeling inside told him this might be his last opportunity i met a girl but she is gone i made a new life as a soldier and i miss it then be a soldier again you are still young still strong she picked up his left hand and ran her finger over the calluses hed earned from the long hours of training with the gladius you were a good soldier yes i was a good soldier then they will find a place for you there is father he wants to see me in the senate she laughed and it was like the tinkle of a delicate silver bell you will never be a politician valerius the first time some greasy aedile seeking promotion tries to bribe you you will throw him in the tiber her face became serious again you cannot live your life for father you must find your own way she lay back and he placed his hand on hers he remembered her as she had been on the day she turned down their fathers marriage candidate her eyes flashing with fire and filling the air with scorn no wonder the old man was afraid to see her tell me about britain she said the request prompted a moments hesitation he had never revealed the truth about his experiences in britain not even to fabia but like the good sister she was olivia eased the path for him but only speak of the happy times so he told her about the fine land the forests and the meadows with their endless unnameable shades of green the bounteous hunting and the pride of the legions about his beautiful maeve and her unscrupulous father lucullus and falco and the defenders of the temple of claudius and of cearan and the fearsome iceni warriors he had led he sounds very handsome she said for a barbarian he was and a good man if you serve in the legions once more where would it be britain again he shook his head britain has too many memories for me so not there at least for now there is always trouble on the rhenus frontier and a good officer would be welcomed even with one arm or up beyond illyricum fighting the barbarians on the danuvius but the most likely place would be armenia in the east where general corbulo is campaigning against the parthians so armenia it is my hero brother tomorrow you must petition nero for a position on general corbulos staff and her voice took on a fair imitation of their fathers pompous tones do not return unless you add new laurels to the name of the valerii he would have replied but she lay back and closed her eyes within a minute she was in a deep sleep he arranged her as comfortably as he could and kissed her gently on the forehead her skin felt fever hot against his lips on the way to his room he met julia in the corridor is she shes asleep but i think the medicine is wearing off tears welled up in the slave girls eyes please ask the barbarian doctor to help my mistress if he touched her arm you can ask him yourself he has promised to visit but dont call him a barbarian he might turn us all into frogs the old joke made her smile and julia yes sir mistress olivia said she thought she heard a mans voice today have there been visitors you havent told me about no master she replied but she took a long time to say it valerius rose before sunrise the next morning the twelfth day of june and the third of vestalia at this time of the day the streets were cool and by the time he passed the temple of vesta a long line of women were already waiting with their sacrifices to the goddess of the hearth the festival was the only time the temple was open to any except the virgins who maintained the sacred flame and then only to women and the pontifex maximus nero himself the scent of baking reminded him he hadnt broken his fast but he smiled at the thought of eating the tasteless salt cakes the priestesses produced as tributes to the goddess the gladiator school was on the flat ground known as the tarentum outside the city wall on the west side of the campus martius he turned off the nova via on to the clivus victoriae and then across the open space of the velabrum until he could follow the river round to the old voting grounds the stench from the tiber gagged in his throat but he knew he would become used to it just as he would become used to the sight of the bloated corpses of dead dogs and deformed newborns floating in its sulphuryellow filth the river flowed sluggishly on his left and to his right the fading grandeur of the pantheon and agrippas baths were highlighted by the early morning sunshine by the time he reached the ludus a score of men were already sweating as they faced each other on the hardpacked dirt under the critical gaze of the lanista the trainer who would hire out his troop to the editores who staged games for the emperor or for rich patrons who wanted to impress their friends mostly they fought for show but occasionally if enough money was on offer these men who shared barrack rooms and meals and sometimes beds would fight each other to the death valerius had once been a staunch supporter of the games with his own favourite fighters but now he stayed away in britain he had seen enough blood spilled for a lifetime most of the gladiators were slaves former warriors swept up by the empires wars and spared the living death of the mines and the quarries for the entertainment value they promised a few were unblooded troublesome farm slaves sold on by their owners because it was more profitable than killing them and bought by the lanista on the strength of their size and fighting potential fewer still were the freeborn who fought of their own free will debtors gambling their lives to release themselves from some financial millstone or men addicted to the thrill of combat and seeking the eternal fame that was a gladiators greatest prize the odds were against them most would never find it only a painful death squirming in their own blood and guts on the sand he saw marcus his trainer working with two fighters in the centre of the practice ground and walked through the gate and into the shade of the barrack building to do the looseningup exercises the old gladiator insisted upon most of the gladiators trained naked but valerius preferred to cover his modesty with a short kilt he removed his tunic and carefully folded it on a bench by the doorway a few of the men glanced at him but none acknowledged him he would never be truly welcome here among the living dead he felt the tension rising inside him he was ready first short runs to simulate attack and retreat then stretches and muscle movements more runs more stretches only when a man had broken sweat and could feel his breath searing his lungs and his heart ramming against his ribs was he ready for the fight as he took a drink from the fountain a shadow loomed over him not too much marcus warned i have a treat for you today valerius eyed him suspiciously every time hed heard those words they had been followed by pain and humiliation the trainer grinned turning the scar that split his right cheek into a crevasse stocky and darkly handsome despite the missing left ear which was a permanent memento of his career he was the fastest man valerius had ever met with hands that could blind you with their speed he introduced the figure who walked up to join them serpentius of amaya valerius looked into eyes that hated you in an instant and a face that said its owner liked to hurt people the narrow white seams that marked the shaven skull told of past battles won and lost the man was thin and dark as a stockmans whip and looked just as tough serpentius valerius acknowledged but the other only stared at him we call him serpentius because hes so fast the snake right marcus explained cheerfully a spaniard even faster than me valerius picked up his wooden practice sword i might as well go home then he spun round to bring his blade down on serpentiuss upper arm only to feel the point of the spaniards own sword touching his throat marcus howled with laughter quick eh valerius nodded his eyes never leaving his opponents quick it looked like being a very long two hours the men around him practised with sword against net and trident sword against sword and sword against spear valerius only ever used the short legionary gladius or the spatha the longer cavalry blade with the gladius a man killed with the point quick brutally effective jabbing strokes and a twisting withdrawal that tore a hole in an opponents guts the size of a shield boss with the spatha it was a combination of the razor edge and brute strength that could bludgeon a man to death or chop him to pieces but today wasnt about killing they would use wooden practice swords and it was about speed and endurance building strength and discovering weaknesses his opponents and his own unless of course serpentius decided differently they took their places in the centre of the training ground and valerius shuffled his feet into the dusty earth to get a feel for its grip his opponent carried only a sword in his right hand valerius always trained with sword and shield sword in the left shield attached firmly to the carved wooden fist that served for his right no point in strengthening his left arm by constant practice if he allowed his right to wither away he would not be a cripple he felt serpentiuss eyes on him when he looked up the spaniard was staring at him with the same expression hed seen on the face of a halfstarved leopard in the circus ready marcus demanded valerius nodded a legionary eh serpentius spoke so quietly that only his opponent could hear legionaries killed my family fight the practice sword was twice the weight of a normal gladius but for all the trouble it gave serpentius it might have been a goose feather somehow the point was instantly past valeriuss guard and only a desperate lunge with the shield knocked it aside and saved him from a bonecrunching thrust to the heart before he could recover the point was back jabbing past the shield at his eyes his belly and his groin he managed to parry the first thrust and block the second with the shield but the third caught him a glancing blow on the inner thigh that would have unmanned him if it had landed square already the sweat was in his eyes blurring his vision and he struggled to keep pace with the dancing figure beyond the shield for the first five minutes it was all he could do to survive he took hits to the shoulder and a strike that might have cracked a rib but he fought on spurred by pain and pride never touching serpentius until gradually his senses came to terms with the speed of his opponent his brain began to match the thrusts as they were launched and the sword and the shield anticipated the spaniards attacks serpentius felt the change and altered his tactics now he used his speed to wear valerius down always keeping him turning to the right so that the romans sword could never reach him constantly changing the line of attack now high now low a painful crack on the ankle left valerius hobbling for a few seconds but the stroke was only a feint serpentiuss real target was the eyes a practice sword might have an edge that wouldnt cut a loaf of bread and a point barely worth the name but it could still take your eye out and valerius saw more of the tip of serpentiuss sword than he cared for by the time marcus called the first break he knew every splinter and notch intimately and it was only good fortune that had saved him from being blinded he crouched down his chest on fire the breath tearing his throat marcus knelt beside him as the spaniard stood a few yards away drinking from a goatskin and barely sweating youve got your sword in your left hand but you still think like a righthanded fighter the older man said youre allowing him to dictate every move and youre a yard slower than he is if you keep going like this hes going to kill you will you let him marcus let out a bellow of laughter hes a gladiator he could die in the ring tomorrow or the next day hes a slave and you are a fucking overfed underworked lawyer he wants to kill you and what are they going to do to him if he does its not a question of will i let him will you let him valerius nodded youre right he started to get up but marcus put a hand on his shoulder dont fight like a onehanded man or a twohanded man fight like a killer serpentius heard valerius laugh out loud and wondered what the joke was the roman wouldnt be laughing in another few minutes he was tired of waiting it was time to finish it valerius waited for the command think like a killer dont think like a cripple think like the man who stood before the bridge at colonia and dared boudiccas hordes to come to him think like the man who slaughtered the bastards by the dozen he remembered the tattooed champions tall and proud whod fallen before his sword he remembered a man with burning eyes who ran a hundred paces to kill him but had died under his shield think like a killer ready before serpentius could move he smashed the shield towards the spaniards body with all his weight behind it and felt the satisfying crunch as the layers of seasoned ash hit solid flesh if the shield had been equipped with a metal boss he might have disabled his opponent and as serpentius retired he kept up the onslaught always following and never allowing him to set his feet for an attack he knew he couldnt maintain this pace for long but it was enough for now to keep him on the run and make an occasional touch with point or edge batter forward with the shield to pull in serpentiuss sword then twist to attack from his undefended side always moving dictate cripple the bastard if you get the chance no kill him if you get the chance serpentius was surprised by his opponents recovery but not concerned his feet would keep him out of serious trouble and he knew he was still going to win a man carrying a shield had to tire before a man who didnt all he had to do was bide his time hed make the roman pay for the bruises but the roman was turning out to be tougher than hed thought valerius was still moving when marcus called the next break even though he could barely speak when the former gladiator came to stand at his side and he didnt dare crouch in case he couldnt get up again instead he leaned on his shield like a drunkard better marcus said youre wearing him down valerius smiled at the joke but it hurt his eyes dried sweat caked them as if he was staring out of a salt mask above the sun beat down from a cloudless sky and his flesh felt as if it was on fire if i dont finish it soon hes going to kill me then finish it from the word of command valerius attempted the same tactic as he had in the second session but this time it was obvious to everyone watching that he was too slow the other fights had come to a halt as the gladiators were drawn to the epic mismatched contest between the crippled former tribune and the born killer who hated every roman they whispered bets to each other and no man put his money on valerius except old marcus who accepted the odds with the distracted air of a gambler who knew he had already lost you could almost feel sorry for him each time valerius attempted to use the shield to pin serpentius back the spaniard was able to skip clear and launch an attack from another angle time and again it appeared he had made the decisive strike but somehow valerius always managed to get sword or shield in the way just enough to avoid what would have been a broken bone or gouged eye but it couldnt last serpentius was laughing now mocking his opponent as a coward and a cripple mimicking the staggering steps as valerius attempted to stay on his feet then he saw his opening it was the shield valerius had held it shoulderhigh all the heatblasted morning his arm a single bar of agony and the pain in his stump long since transformed into a silent scream now the shield wavered and fell to one side and serpentius swept past it with a snarl of pentup frustration the point of the heavy gladius aimed not for the eyes but in a killing blow at the throat that would leave valerius choking on his own blood at least the spaniards mind told him he was past it the roman could barely hold the shield never mind move it so how could the upper edge be slicing towards serpentiuss jaw and his head be jolted backwards with a force that made the sky fall in and darkness come several hours early when he regained consciousness he found he couldnt raise his head and his throat felt as if it had someones boot on it he opened his eyes and far above him at the end of the long pale slope of the shield was a redeyed vision of hades what is it you do with a snake marcus cut off its head serpentius heard marcus laugh the pressure on his throat increased and he said a choked prayer to mars at the same time cursing the fickle god for deserting him valerius stared down at the pinned man he only had to shift his weight to break serpentiuss neck but the killing rage was gone with a grunt of effort he lifted the shield from the spaniards throat die in your own time vi valerius found two men waiting in the atrium when he returned home after a frustrating day at the courts and he glared his annoyance at tiberius the steward who had invited them in his body still ached from his bruising encounter with serpentius and his temper wasnt helped by the fact that the smaller of the two men a greasy overweight youth who couldnt have been more than eighteen addressed him as if he were the owner of the house and valerius a none too welcome guest you are gaius valerius verrens former tribune of the twentieth legion he demanded in a highpitched petulant voice gaius valerius verrens holder of the gold crown of valour valerius corrected winning a smirk from the taller of the two whose broad shoulders and quiet alertness marked him as a bodyguard as did his face which had collided with solid objects more often than was good for it and who might you be the plump youth fumbled beneath his cloak claudius helvius collina he announced brandishing the gold ring bearing his seal of office like a betting ticket imperial messenger valerius reached for the ring and noticed the big man tense he didnt have any doubt it was genuine but it didnt do to make life easy for pipsqueaks with ideas above their station the messenger snatched it away but valerius insisted and eventually collina handed it over although he maintained his grip on the chain when he was satisfied valerius gave the ring back very well what message do you have for me you are to attend the gatehouse at the clivus victoriae tomorrow at the second hour i dont want to hear it i want to read it he held out his hand the message is to be relayed orally this man is here to confirm that it has been done and the wording is correct for a moment valerius felt like someone who hears a rumbling in the distance and knows it is an avalanche but finds he cant move his feet to get out of the way a summons was bad enough but one without written confirmation hinted at trickery or worse this was no invitation to a reception or one of the emperors recitals he considered his options and quickly decided he didnt have any when the two men had left a kitchen slave asked when valerius would want his evening meal but he discovered he wasnt hungry he knew he should go to olivia but he felt as if he were sitting on a volcano and if the volcano erupted it would consume olivia just as it would consume him he needed time to think who knew everything that went on in rome from the palatine to the prison cells below the castra praetoria a silken voice whispered inside his head and he had a vision of a beautiful face fabia how much should she say fabia faustina handed valerius a gilded cup and lay back on her couch when the servant had arrived asking for an appointment her heart had lurched like a fourteenyearold virgins what was it about the young soldier that made her feel this way yes he was handsome with the determined features of a young caesar and he had the hardened physique that only military service or manual labour gave a man but many of her clients were handsome men with fine bodies the missing arm didnt disgust her quite the opposite but neither did it account for this unlikely infatuation he was brave and honest but these were not attributes she necessarily found attractive not his courage nor his looks then it was something inside the melancholy he tried to hide behind his eyes so many of the men who came to this house sought her love but had to make do with her body of them all only valerius would never be able to love her in return and that was a challenge she could not resist but now how much should she say what should she tell him and more important what should she not i do not think you need fear for your life valerius perhaps not yet he agreed but i have an old soldiers instinct for survival and i smell an ambush somewhere along the road old soldier the description amused her how old are you not yet twentysix years it will be a long time before you are an old soldier my dear and you have many more laurels to win before that time comes he smiled with her experienced then experienced enough to know when to watch my flanks as well as my front that is always wise in rome she agreed one pair of eyes will never be enough to guard against the potential dangers here which is why i came to you have you heard word of anything unusual at court it is still only june but the city feels like a boiling pot with a jammed lid you think i am an old busybody who is only interested in gathering gossip valerius she mocked not old nor a busybody he smiled back i think you are clever and wise which are very different things and i think you will always be beautiful and always be desirable she gave a little laugh and bowed her golden head at the flattery pretty words from a simple soldier and words any woman would be happy to hear but time will ever be the enemy of beauty and age the enemy of desire all we can hope is to use what we have well the last sentence reminded him of olivia and she saw it in his face the emperor has many responsibilities and many concerns valerius since the death of his mother he has turned to his astrologers more often than to his advisers he would not be nero if he did not suspect everyone he studies his predecessors and notes that they were destroyed by those closest to them where others revile his late uncle gaius caligula nero admires him for his ambition if not his aptitude for survival he has the same ambition but understands the need to keep his praetorians close he believes his mother poisoned both claudius and his natural father which is one of the many reasons he removed her when he sent seneca away he thought he had cleansed the nest now his augurs speak of an enemy within the gates of rome a sinister force akin to a beast with many heads that is burrowing into the rock of the palatine itself and undermining him they say the very empire is threatened nero wishes to lash out fortunately he has advisers who preach more prudent counsel and reason stays his hand for the moment it is said he is confused and unhappy and it is when he is confused and unhappy not when he is angry that he is at his most dangerous who says this she shook her head people tell me things valerius but do not ask me who or how or why because you may not like the answer accept what you are given do not question the motives or the validity of the source he nodded his trust at least he could give freely i dont doubt that what you say is true but i still cannot see how it helps me poor valerius who does not recognize his own value you look at tomorrow and see only your fears consider the advantages the opportunity to regain the emperors favour the last time i had the emperors favour i did not like the advantages it brought he tried to seduce you and you refused him do not look so shocked valerius of course i could see it and if he had succeeded what fools men are to take the act of physical love so seriously warmth comfort perhaps if you are fortunate a little passion and a fleeting moment of pleasure would it have altered you i have done things valerius that would perhaps change your opinion of me but i have not let them change me she spoke the last sentence with a ferocity that made him wonder if it was true it had never occurred to him to feel sorry for her but fabia was nothing if not an actress and she quickly recovered her poise whatever anger nero felt against you is long past if you had been one of those simpering slave boys he surrounds himself with or one of his lusty charioteers he might have had you killed or put away but you are a hero of rome he dare not touch you because to harm you would risk alienating the legions and he cannot rule without their support my advice to you is this whatever he asks be prepared to at least consider it despite his doubts he knew that she was right he had asked for her advice how could he refuse it will you stay with me for an hour this was different their meetings had always been for all their pleasure in each others company on a purely commercial basis her voice had changed the tone low and husky and filled with desire he knew he should refuse of course as she led him through to the bedroom she wondered what he would think if he knew the truth would he ever forgive her it was late when valerius returned home his head full of that halffloating sensation that comes after long hours with a beautiful sensuous and passionate woman intent on ensuring her own satisfaction and yours his body gave a pleasurable shudder at the memory of the miracles fabia had wrought and the feelings that had accompanied them perhaps he heard the sobbing as he entered the atrium and he rushed to olivias room to find julia lying hunched on the bed beside his sister she looked up it is as if yesterday had never happened she sobbed she hasnt woken or moved all day you must help her shes dying im sorry julia i shouldnt have left you i will find someone else tomorrow a nurse or a companion it isnt a nurse or a companion she needs it is her family the girl said accusingly he stared at her he would never have taken those words from another slave but julia and his sister had been together since they were children she was olivias best friend as well as her servant ill send a message to the judaean he said he would visit olivia the suggestion calmed the girl and he waved her from the room im sorry he whispered taking his familiar place beside the bed i neglected you today for the wrong reasons and tomorrow i will have to neglect you for the right ones do you remember her eyes remained closed but her face told him that she could hear him vii the victory road clung to the side of the palatine hill sloping first from the west then turning to climb across the northern face a faint haze hung in the air but the low sun quickly cleared it and halfway up the hill valerius who had dressed in his finest for the occasion turned to look out over the centuriesold glory of the forum and the shimmering sea of terracotta roofs that disguised the festering reality of the subura he wondered if he would look upon it again at his back soared the marble splendour of neros sprawling palace home of every caesar since tiberius many of the men who had followed this path had entered it and never left in theory no roman citizen could be tortured or sentenced to death unless he was guilty of treason caligula and in his final years claudius had shown that the reality could be very different their blood ran in neros veins but some journeys had to be made even if each step was reluctantly taken he squared his shoulders and approached the gatehouse where he surprised a pair of blackclad guards lounging sleepily against the wall gaius valerius verrens the senior of the two yawned early arent you we dont generally have anyone official at this hour he studied a list pinned to the gatehouse door and shook his head doesnt say youre expected ill need your pass he held out a hand valerius shook his head the invitation was delivered verbally the praetorian noticed the stress on the word invitation and raised his eyes verrens the tone was polite but the way the two praetorians straightened told valerius everything he needed to know about the speaker stunted but solidly built and in early middle age he wore his hair cropped short and had features that might have been crafted with a blunt knife the skin on the left side of his face had the texture of melted candle wax and made valerius wonder if hed been caught in a fire at some point it was a face that would scare children and repel women on another man it might have inspired pity but not on this man you knew instantly that the mind behind the mask was as ugly as the misshapen features he presented to the world at your service valerius kept his voice neutral but didnt bow which made the face twist into a parody of a smile lucius licinius rodan now valerius understood why the praetorians were so nervous officially a lowly centurion of the praetorian guard rodan was the one who if nero had an enemy would ensure he was an enemy no more by assassination if necessary but the praetorian was rumoured to prefer more subtle methods perhaps the mans younger son would be found with his throat cut would he risk the elder his wife might be molested in his house who was to know when the molesters would return if his horses burned to death in their stalls he would understand that his family would be next rodan was one of the most dangerous men in rome and his presence made this meeting all the more unpredictable has he been searched yet no then what are you waiting for expert hands ran over valeriuss body missing nothing the praetorian delicately held up valeriuss walnut fist for inspection it could make a good bludgeon he suggested fool rodan shook his head i think we can leave him his hand after all he did lose it in the service of rome follow me the gateway led directly into the palace gardens where a path wound along an avenue of pear and apple trees through parkland studded with fountains and flower beds valerius walked a pace behind his host whose bearing made it clear that a missing hand and a military honour did not add up to any form of recognition in rodans world rodan provided a reminder of his power a few moments later a group of slaves were working to replace plants near the path when one of them accidentally sprinkled a few grains of soil on the praetorians gold court slippers rodan halted as if hed walked into a wall overseer he shouted this man assaulted me he is to be taken to the castra praetoria for questioning the slave a thin darkhaired boy of about fourteen turned death pale his hands brushed desperately at rodans feet until there was no sign of the offending dirt no sir please sir i beg without warning rodan kicked the boy full in the face with enough force to break his jaw valerius saw three white teeth fly as the young slave somersaulted backwards to lie groaning on the path rodan stood over him casually considering whether to kick him a second time before deciding that the lesson had been absorbed two men picked up the slave boy and carried him away valerius had come across men in the legions who meted out violence as readily as rodan but never quite so coldly he comforted himself with the thought that they were always the ones carried from the fight with spear wounds in the back they walked quickly through a colonnade until they reached a large door guarded by praetorians matched like a pair of thoroughbred horses nero was said to choose his palace guard personally with all the care he gave to the choice of his chariot teams for their looks and physique clearly rodan had been selected only for his talents inside everything was marble and gold ahead of them stretched a long corridor lined with gilded busts of the emperor and his predecessors at set intervals curtained alcoves framed statues of apollo venus or jupiter and other lesser members of the godly pantheon enormous vases filled to bursting with vibrant yellow flowers continued the colour scheme a display of neck and arm rings made of twisted strands filled part of one wall and valerius recognized trophies taken from british kings another held plates and ornaments which could only have come from the east a small part he guessed of the plunder corbulo had gathered as he subdued the parthians in armenia valerius would have stopped to study them more closely but his guide glared at him this way rodan said irritably indicating a doorway to the right they entered a large open room dominated by an enormous statue of painted marble it was incredibly lifelike and portrayed a naked man and two younger male figures being tormented by writhing snakes the man was reaching upwards with one arm half entwined with a serpent while his right hand attempted to keep a second snakes gaping jaw from his body valerius recognized the group as laocoon high priest of troy and his two sons he remembered that laocoon had warned the trojans against greeks bearing gifts and wondered if it was a portent for this meeting rodan ignored the sculpture and turned to his left where a set of six wide steps led upwards to a golden throne the throne was empty wait here without another word the praetorian returned the way hed come minutes passed while valerius stood in solitary silence he knew the wait was designed to make him uneasy but knowing didnt make it any more bearable as his eyes adjusted to the light he noticed detail that had not been apparent when he entered the wall behind the throne was not solid but a silk screen carefully painted to blend in with the garden scenes behind it was almost translucent so that if he looked carefully he could see faint shapes moving behind it a slight rustling confirmed what he already knew he was being watched he measured time by the shadows creeping arthritically across the floor by now tension had developed into a slowburning anger he willed his feet to stay where they were seneca stood here he thought seneca had suffered the same creeping uncertainty the cramping of the legs and the roaring inside his skull lucius annaeus seneca was an old friend of valeriuss father with a country estate in the next valley at the age of fourteen valerius had been sent to study under seneca while the latter endured exile in corsica the philosopher had returned from his banishment to serve as neros teacher and guide he had danced the political tightrope for half a lifetime but his fall now seemed inevitable it was said he no longer had the emperors confidence that his judgement was unsound he was old tired nero needed a younger man to guide him someone who understood his needs someone like decimus torquatus the man who controlled rodan and his praetorian wolves valerius kept his eye fixed on the wall and allowed his mind to drift back to long days on the parade ground with the twentieth nero could not hurt him the best of him had died on that final day in the temple of claudius he might live and breathe but this was merely the long prelude to the afterlife the only people who truly mattered were olivia and his father for their sakes he would endure this petty torture his thoughts were interrupted by a soft giggle from behind the screen and an apparition dressed in startling emerald green appeared its golden hair styled in long ringlets a weak chin with a sparse fair beard bad skin disguised by white powder and heavy sensuous lips painted a rich ruby red this hermaphrodite creature was served by four naked satyrs plump prepubescent children who still managed to exude a nauseating sexuality as they danced around their charge valerius found himself caught between horrified bewilderment and an urge to laugh out loud nero in a womans dress and made up like a common harlot the emperor studied him seriously eyelashes fluttering what do you think there could only be one answer astonishing caesar you recognized me as pandora the others didnt but what do they know about art at the close of the gymnastics i will give a performance then hand out gifts from pandoras box the voice was as valerius remembered it high but not shrill more boy than man it still managed to carry a rulers power and for some reason it sought his approval i am sure they will be gratefully received caesar what more could a man ask than a gift from your own hand the shining eyes narrowed and valerius wondered if hed gone too far in his flattery he found himself holding his breath so a courtier as well as a soldier nero waved a hand and the four satyrs disappeared behind the screen he came closer of course you were trained by seneca as i was we have much in common you and i we have both suffered in romes name we should be friends he raised his hand to valeriuss cheek and the young roman couldnt prevent himself flinching from the manicured fingers neros eyes darkened and the room seemed to freeze the unnatural stillness was broken only by the sound of the emperors hoarse breathing the scent of a strong perfume trickled into valeriuss nostrils and made him need to sneeze he wanted to turn away but the unblinking stare held him like a vole in the grip of a kestrels claws very slowly nero brought his face close valerius tried not to smell the sour breath or see the outlines of the small pusfilled spots that dotted the skin beneath the powder he felt his gorge rise as the painted lips touched his a thick tongue probed his closed mouth and the urge to vomit became almost irresistible he knew that if he gave in to the sensation he would surely die he stood still as the marble statue on the other side of the room and endured after a few moments without a response nero took a step back his tone mirrored the astonishment on his face you will not return your emperors love is this what a soldier calls loyalty or devotion or duty valerius could feel the fear rising in him against any other form of attack he could have defended himself even if it meant his death but this not will not caesar from somewhere he found the right words cannot it is not within my gift or my power neros head swayed on its long neck the cold eyes never leaving their prey but it is within mine his voice quivered with righteous anger i could have you held down and use you as i willed then it would not be love and you would have lost my loyalty and devotion and you would have lost your life my life is my emperors to take though i had hoped to give it willingly on the battlefield for a dozen long moments nero studied him without warning he gave a girlish laugh and flounced away am i not the greatest actor in the world with nothing more than a kiss i have a hero of rome disarmed and trembling in fear valerius bowed his head not in acknowledgement but to ensure that the other man could not see murder reflected in his eyes he had never felt such fury he wanted to reach out and take the scrawny neck in his hand and squeeze until the breath rattled in neros throat like a dying chickens to flail with the walnut fist until the pasty overfed face was smashed into a bloody pulp slowly he willed the rage to subside and when he looked up the emperor had taken his place on the golden throne with the emerald dress ruffed up around his thighs and his thin pale legs hanging ludicrously below now the voice took on a new authority i brought you here for another reason gaius valerius verrens hero of rome will you serve your emperor unto death there could be no hesitation though the words choked him i will caesar nero waved a hand theatrically towards the balcony look out and tell me what you see valerius hesitated there were so many answers i see rome and its people the emperor shook his head flinging the ringlets left and right no he snapped you see a nest of traitors romes laws are flouted romes gods are mocked a disease is already within our midst it is spreading with every hour you will discover the source of the disease so that we may eradicate it you have heard of a man called christus valerius shook his head at the unfamiliar name no caesar a judaean troublemaker from the province of galilee and put to death almost thirty years ago but he makes trouble still before he died he promised the jews eternal life a small number accepted the lie a carpenter came close to setting the province afire those who survived continue to plot in his name they travel the empire holding secret meetings and preaching that he is a god it is said they drink the blood of children and if that is true i will not leave one of them alive but seneca taught me to be just and i will not believe it without proof you will supply that proof we have evidence that they are already in the city you will find the followers of christus and pass their names to my servant torquatus you are our hero of rome now i name you romes defender against this evil and appoint you honorary tribune of the guard if you succeed you will be for ever in our favour here he reached inside the folds of the dress and retrieved a ring on a gold chain similar to the one the courier had shown valerius who walked up the stairs and took it brushing his lips against the back of neros hand the imperial seal use it well and when you are done return it to us and receive your reward torquatus a tall handsome man appeared from the far side of the screen his unlined face set in a mocking smile valerius wondered how long he had been listening torquatus will furnish you with the details the two men bowed and backed away but the emperor wasnt finished and verrens valerius looked back at the greatest actor in the world on his lonely stage fail us at your peril you are very fortunate torquatus said as they left the room what do you mean its not every man who receives a personal performance from the emperor you played your part quite well valerius bit back his anger i would rather not have had a part you are a man who finds it difficult to hide his emotions you wanted to kill him and he knew it but it only made him desire you more if i had wanted to kill him he would be dead the sentence was out before his brain had the chance to consider how potentially lethal the words were torquatus stared at him coming from another man that declaration would have warranted imprisonment and execution but perhaps not this man not for the moment he pointed back towards the balcony you have never been closer to death than you were in that room four of the finest archers in the empire stood behind those windows with their arrows aimed at your back he would have required only to raise a single finger a chill settled on the centre of valeriuss spine why me surely there are others better qualified to carry out this task torquatus stopped at the junction of two corridors because you are available because you have proved yourself brave and resourceful somehow the words brave and resourceful emerged as deliberate insults the emperor commissioned a private report from julius classicanus our new procurator on the causes and conduct of the british war governor paulinus naturally attempted to blame everyone but himself but he was forced to admit that if he had acted upon the information you provided about the iceni the conflict might have been avoided he smiled coldly of course a more politically astute general would have had you killed when he had the opportunity as it was only yourself and young agricola came away from that contemptible little island with any laurels you had the opportunity to rise high in the emperors service if only you had humoured him a few moments ago a small price to pay you might have had a legion he has rewarded other men with more for less and for a resourceful man with a legion no prize is beyond reach valerius found himself staring what was torquatus suggesting that one day he might supplant nero the lazy eyes stared back touched by the shadow of a smile no he was telling him that he would have had him killed this man had spent years plotting the destruction of seneca he would not stand by and watch another rise to take his place at neros side torquatus nodded his pale eyes glittering good we understand each other they entered a room with a large desk at its centre torquatus took his place behind it but didnt offer valerius a seat an opened scroll lay on the desk pinned at the corners twenty thousand judaeans in rome most of them in the district around the capena gate but a few living in scattered pockets in the north of the city twenty thousand suspects but only a few will be followers of this christus the jews despised the man as much as we did probably more however the emperor is minded to go a step further than his stepfather claudius and remove them permanently from the city he has his own reasons for this i have my reasons for advising against it valerius waited for him to expand on this unlikely humanity but torquatus continued to study the document eventually he looked up twenty thousand judaeans and only one of them matters he is the leader of the cult in rome a man known as the rock of christus a melodramatic title for the leader of a few fanatics but he is also a resourceful man because he has thus far managed to elude us you will identify him to me he paused but the seizure of this rock is not your primary purpose the judaeans who follow christus are of little consequence but the roman citizens they have seduced with their lies and their promises are caesar is right to compare this sect with a disease like a disease they spread their poison silently through the population and like a disease they target the vulnerable in this case the vulnerable are not the poor for whom the prospect of everlasting life is not immediately appealing but those who have the means to enjoy it knights aediles quaestors generals and tribunes it is possible this evil has reached the senate here is the greatest danger perhaps even to rome itself hunt them down if you find one he or she will lead you to the next do you have names torquatus sniffed dismissively if i had names i would not need you my resources how many men will i have you have the emperors seal you are his agent in this matter if you need to recruit anyone else you have his full authority they will be paid through the treasury and should be accounted for to centurion rodan whom you have already met this is not a job for squads of soldiers or i would have flooded the city with praetorians it requires subtlety and stealth low cunning if you like which i sense you have in abundance valerius ignored the insult i need all the information you have on this christus and his followers torquatus shrugged there is very little but i will have everything sent to your home when the younger man had left torquatus returned to the paper on his desk it was a letter which contained certain allegations against an unnamed someone in neros inner circle his face had the look of a fisherman who has just felt the first tug on his line viii valerius arrived at the ludus to find the gladiators lounging in the shade of the barracks sipping at goatskins of tepid water and gossiping theyd rest for another two hours until the heat went out of the sun and they returned to their relentless training he approached one group and asked where marcus could be found a heavily built fighter jerked his head towards the doorway and valerius entered to find the scarred veteran muttering over a piece of scroll filled with figures things are a little slow the old gladiator said without looking up too many recitals by the songbird on the hill and not enough blood and guts someone should remind him that hes allowed a bet valerius smiled at the veiled reference to the emperor whose dedication to the finer arts was not always appreciated in a city coarsened by three hundred years of more down to earth entertainment nero had famously banned gladiators from fighting in the arena at pompeii over the small matter of a few deaths in a riot involving rival supporters there had even been a rumour that he planned to stop opponents fighting to the death altogether valerius shook his head at the thought he might as well try to ban the chariot races that were his obsession i always thought you appreciated music what with all the practice you get in the green horse marcus grunted thats only for the ladies and to what do we owe this honour lord valerius come for another sparring match with serpentius or have you finally decided to take up an honourable profession im looking for some hired help valerius pulled the chain with the golden ring from his cloak and placed it on the table two or three men who know how to look after themselves and can keep their mouths shut marcus gave a low whistle when he recognized the ring interesting and dangerous worth good money to whoever signs on though valerius had already decided to fund the men from his own purse he suspected it would be more secure if torquatus remained unaware of the type of help he was hiring do you have anybody in mind i wondered if you might be interested in a change of scenery valerius shrugged well need someone to carry the rations someone to hold your hand you mean marcus growled anybody else i thought id leave it up to you youll be their leader how many four for a start if we need more we know where to come ill compensate the lanista and fund clothes and weapons good quality no auxilary rubbish three meals a day and a roof over their heads in return ill expect military discipline and no chasing women until i say they can he mentioned a sum of money for marcus and a third of that for his men the gladiator chuckled for that much who do you want us to kill nobody i hope but even as he said it valerius had a suspicion it wasnt going to be true call it legal research just a little snooping around on the short walk from the ludus to the basilica julia he took time in the shade by pompeys theatre stopping off as always to read the inscription on the great marblefaced arch dedicated to germanicus caesar germanicus was the father of caligula and the man who but for his untimely death would have been emperor in his stead in his heart lay the true glory of rome unsullied by corruption or dishonour germanicus whom men hailed as the noblest of romans had been valeriuss hero since boyhood and valerius made a habit of saying a prayer to his shade whenever he passed beneath the monument with its golden chariot duty done he doubled back towards the forum his pulse always beat a little faster when he entered the hallowed ground between the imperial palaces on the palatine and the great temple of jupiter on the capitoline summit here was romes beating heart here he was at the centre of the world all around him were tributes to the men who had made rome great emperors and generals consuls and senators some whose deeds were long forgotten but whose names would live on for ever in this sacred place a pair of giant triumphal arches commemorated the victories of augustus and tiberius on the rostra julia the great orators still made their pronouncements above the beaks of ships captured a century before at actium beside the frozen stone figures of scipio and sulla and caesar and pompey here was the little shrine to venus cloacina goddess of the sewers and along the via sacra fluted pillars topped by the golden figures of mars and jupiter venus and minerva and in simple contrast to the manworked grandeur all around the little group of olive and fig and grapevine which marked natures most precious gifts to rome other men would say that the heart of the heart was the curia where the senate sat but for valerius it would always be the basilica julia already though it was only early afternoon slaves and servants were making their way to the shops and stalls on the margins of its pillared aisles he knew the lawyers would be slower to return from the midday meal with their families and took his time he had three cases outstanding which needed dealing with before he could begin neros mission they couldnt be more different an inheritance dispute he was defending before the court of the hundred a complicated civil case involving the demolition of a semiderelict apartment block on the other side of the pons aemilius that would take some delicate negotiation and by far the most pressing an accusation of water theft which he was due to prosecute for the water commissioner fortune favoured him when he noticed quintus fuscus a lawyer he knew a dozen yards ahead on the vicus jugarius valerius explained his dilemma but not the reason for it i can put off the building case and i owe the water commissioner some kind of explanation but i need someone to take the inheritance suit off my hands the case was the most lucrative of the three and fuscuss face lit up id be delighted to oversee it i havent tried a case before the centumviri for years it will be a pleasure valerius thanked him and walked on to his next meeting this is most unusual commissioner honorius complained the case is ready to present and all parties are available if you wish to find another prosecutor i will be happy to withdraw valerius assured him no no its just that i believe you underestimate the importance of this case the theft of water from romes aqueducts has always been a most serious offence and is on the increase the time is right for an example to be made valerius made his apologies and agreed to speak to the representative of the accused a builder with interests all over the city who was alleged to have tapped into one of the main aqueducts feeding the capital to supply his brickworks by now the forum hummed with activity the avenues were thronged with senators each with his guard of bullies and drifting cloud of clients with lawyers and their clerks and the crowds of gawpers who had come to see them win or lose with money changers soothsayers shoppers and worshippers men offering themselves for work and the beggars blinded and maimed who reminded valerius of the ache in his missing arm it was as he fought his way east along the via nova past the house of the vestals that he felt someone brush against him his first thought was that he was being robbed but then he realized that something had been placed in his left hand he looked down and discovered he was holding a torn piece of scroll ix poppaea augusta sabina lay back on the padded couch and took a sip of wellwatered wine from the other side of the wide table in the shaded gardens on the palatine fabia smiled at her old friend two of romes most striking women comfortable in the knowledge that they would never need to rival each other the tone of their relationship had been set by the manner in which they had been introduced a manner which tolerated no shyness or embarrassment on either side they were of a similar age when giggling girlhood was long past but the first true challenges of the passing years still lay in the future as they studied each other they knew they would never appear more beautiful had circumstances been different it might have been fabia who shared an emperors bed and poppaea who endured any rich mans company but circumstances were not and neither of them would ever mention it it is such a pleasure to be able to speak freely and enjoy anothers companionship just for the sake of it poppaea sighed i think palace servants were born with flapping ears even when they are not spies they are gossips for whom no secret is sacred even your ladies in waiting particularly my ladies in waiting then your husband will be told of my visit i hope it wont cause you any difficulty poppaea laughed at her friends naivety has it ever before the very thought of our friendship has my husband panting like a little bull at the sight of a tethered cow he understands that he profits in the bedroom from each little secret you impart she lowered her voice to a whisper i even give you the credit for some of the more interesting ideas i introduce myself because it arouses him to imagine us discussing them together and rehearsing them for his pleasure i thought because you are no longer summoned to join us fabia nodded it had been months now at first she had been relieved but relief had turned to concern and then to outright fear she had known it could not last but the rewards of the relationship had been beyond her imagination and it could be dangerous to be discarded by the emperor and the truth was that poppaea created physical desires in her that were just as intense as any inspired by a man she was certain she aroused the same feelings in the darkhaired woman she studied her now long slim legs peeping from the crimson shift as she lay languidly on her side and imagined her naked and wideeyed on a bed the thought produced a liquid sensation and she shifted slightly she saw a look of understanding in poppaeas eyes resignation too for without neros sanction there would be no more such encounters the emperors jealousy extended to anyone male or female who took their pleasures where he did not and his retribution would be swift and final poppaeas tone changed and she lowered her voice let this be entirely between us fabia you should regard yourself as fortunate that you do not share his bed his appetites grow ever more dangerous even with your experience and inventiveness i think you would be hard put to it to keep him interested for long sometimes more often than i would like his passions do not satisfy my needs and i must watch as he plays with his squealing boys and lisping geldings fabia risked a glance around to ensure no one was within hearing distance this was dangerous territory nero had agents everywhere and she had experience enough of spyholes and listening tubes to know that they were not confined to brothels poppaea saw the look do not think me such a fool fabia we are so far away that not even the trees can hear us and i have checked every inch of the grass unless the dandelions have ears we may say what we like and that man will never get to hear it that man poppaea had harboured an almost irrational fear of torquatus since octavia neros first wife had been first banished then killed the conspiracy had cemented the praetorian prefects power on the palatine now he saw poppaea as his rival for neros affections and trust and any rival of torquatus must necessarily check beneath the bed for vipers outwardly poppaea was like any other rich spoiled roman matron only interested in the latest fashions hairstyles and palace gossip but as their friendship developed fabia had seen a different poppaea one torn by doubt and capable of clutching at any passing fancy and making it her lifes passion parthian mystics astrologers from aegyptus and a smelly bearded gaulish ancient who called himself the last druid had all found refuge in her household at one time or another experience told fabia her friend was for ever destined to be disappointed her fate would always lie in the hands of her husband that night nero stared from his palace window over the city of a million people he ruled centre of an empire of forty million and more the thought as always sent a thrill of panic through his breast and he had to hold on to the balcony so many people so much wealth so much power all his to command so why did they taunt him all these millions he could hear them inside his head a tumult of voices that never left him alone nero does nothing nero has achieved nothing nero gives us songs but what has he given us to ensure he is remembered nero sits in a palace built by other men looking out on a city built by other men caesar augustus tiberius caligula claudius who is this nero who dares to stand alongside them and call himself their equal they taunted him and he had no answer the thought began a chain reaction in his stomach and he vomited over the balcony a choked retching spew that dribbled in strands from his mouth tears filled his eyes he knew the taunts meant his mother would visit him tonight and that made the panic return at first in the dreams she had been beautiful as she had been in life but lately that had changed she had begun to disintegrate before his eyes hair falling in hanks from her skull parchment skin breaking open to reveal rotting flesh eye sockets filled with wriggling milkwhite tadpoles still he could have endured it if only the whispers would stop he had explained why he had to have her killed it had been his time not hers didnt she understand that he could not live in her shadow why not take out her anger on those who had been as complicit as he or seneca who had stood silent as the decision was made they were to blame not him the moonlight fell on the giant table he had commissioned the scale model of rome with the moveable buildings a single beam of white light fell directly on the forum a sign a sign from his mother a sign from the gods he studied the wooden city and decided it was a deceit this glory of rome was nothing but a sham poverty and filth and degradation hidden beneath a veneer they liked to call civilization with one hand he swept buildings from the table sending the wooden blocks clattering across the mosaic floor and leaving a vast empty space in the centre of the city the breath caught in his throat it was perfect he would build a new rome caesar the fury rose in him like a flame not now not when i have just begun to understand he turned ready to bring his hand across her face and was only prevented by the concern in the round frightened eyes he touched her silken hair instead running the strands through his fingers she stood as tall as he lithe and slim as a dancer with the face of an assyrian queen poppaea you startled me i was concerned for you lord she said with the little girls pout she knew made him burn a gossamer robe of the palest blue did nothing to hide her heavy pinktipped breasts or the shadowy secret of her sex he felt his desire stir so different from octavia who did her duty she tried to hide it from him but he knew poppaea revelled in what other men would call his depravity but he was moved to call his pleasure when she offered herself to him the offer was unconditional everything she had was his to be taken as and when he desired he dropped his hand to caress her breast through the thin material and watched the nipple harden then took the ripening bud between his fingers and squeezed it so she gasped i wanted a boy today but i could not have him it vexed me then punish him lord her voice was a husky whisper i cannot punish him he slipped his hand to her other breast and felt her breathing quicken for he is a hero of rome you are the only hero of rome lord her body moved against his now soft and urgent will you reward your hero of rome poppaea his voice could have belonged to a tenyearold he dropped his head to her breast and she gave a low moan yes lord how will you reward him poppaea the desire was thick enough to clog his throat will you be his boy she turned away hiding her face and dropping the robe so the silken flesh of her body turned silver in the moonshadow slowly she bent forward over the table so he could take her in the way he chose yes lord she whispered i will be your boy when he moved over her he wasnt sure whether she cried out in pain or pleasure later when she was gone but he could still smell the raw scent of her on himself he stood at the window again was she betraying him x the message contained a time a place and a name valerius drew breath when he recognized the name why should he be surprised they hadnt set eyes on each other for at least ten years but this was a man who had spent more than a decade at the very heart of the empire close enough to hear every beat should he go what did he have to gain or lose the meeting place was convenient enough for his purposes but they had never been friends their short relationship had been closer to master and servant he remembered feeling used at yet another demand to fetch water from the well or recite from memory a complex argument by apollodorus of seleucia or one of a dozen other wordy overblown stoic texts but he had learned his mind had quickened and his grasp and understanding of the subjects had grown with each passing day he spent in the great mans presence great seneca hadnt been great then a few slaves most of them spying for the emperor a trusted servant who no doubt betrayed him to his enemies his villa had been a rundown corsican chicken farm and the fine court clothes he affected were worn and patched by the time valerius had been sent to him exile had cracked him like one of the eggs his hens laid among the vines but it had never broken him seneca consoled himself with his studies and his teachings and the letters he wrote to his mother and ignored the heat and the filth strange that a life devoted to logic and forbearance should have been almost destroyed by such an enormous capacity for human recklessness the irresponsibility which had brought him into conflict with caligula was bordering on suicidal a woman had been the cause of it that folly might have been forgiven but to argue semantics with an emperor who thought himself the new aristotle was perhaps pushing stoicism beyond its acceptable limits caligulas acerbic dismissal of senecas writings as lime without sand had been more painful even than the threat of execution and how could a man who had fought so hard to resuscitate his career throw everything away for a second time by conducting a flagrant pointless affair with his new emperors niece even benign old claudius couldnt allow that to go unpunished seneca had been fortunate to escape with nine years misery in exile it had been agrippina who finally recalled him and saved him from madness and had entrusted him with her sons education his genius had made him first indispensable and then a liability he was finished but he didnt seem to know it and that made him doubly dangerous of course there was another possibility it could be a trap valerius smiled at the thought proximity to the emperor was making him paranoid the writing was in the same firm controlled hand he remembered but why now this was no invitation to a pleasant afternoon of philosophical debate and discussion the whole tenor of the note and the way it had been delivered was designed to intrigue him it was the bait thrown to a hungry carp in a stew pond yet the bait was so blatantly presented that there was no disguising it could also be an invitation to put his neck on the executioners block so he should be suspicious and he was suspicious but that didnt mean he wouldnt take the bait he went through the arrangements in his mind aware that the dangers ahead could be as great as anything he had faced in britain when he answered neros commission he had laid aside the cosy trappings of civilian life to become a soldier again he just wasnt sure yet what he was fighting for valerius rode out early next day through the valley between the quirinal and viminal hills and then up on to the via salaria with the winding course of the tiber away to his left in the relative cool of the morning even the streets of the subura proved bearable and once he was in sight of the massive red brick praetorian barracks he was able to enjoy the prospect of the open road ahead fidenae lay only six miles beyond the city walls but his fathers estate was tucked in a valley a further three miles to the west of the town a sprawling untidy mix of vine and olives around a villa that had once been fine but like the estate suffered from lack of investment still it would take him only two hours at most and it would be good to see the old man again perhaps this time he could persuade him to visit olivia the road was one of the oldest in the empire the route the sabines had once used to fetch salt from the tiber marshes and later in the day it would be busy with people travelling to and from the city as he rode past the first of the tombs lining the highway the air grew warmer and he allowed his senses to be lulled by the low buzz of insects the bittersweet scent of horse sweat and the murmur of the wind in the roadside trees it must have been close to the third hour when he reached the gateway to the estate he experienced a strange sense of wellbeing as he rode beneath the stone arch this was truly home though he hadnt called it that for years the place where he had spent his childhood carefree and safe among the hills and the streams twelve years earlier hed been sent away to study first under seneca and then in rome apart from a single short visit before he joined the twentieth and his mothers funeral he hadnt been back since he spotted a slave boy in a ragged tunic sprinting through the vines on the ridge above the dirt road and smiled once he would have been on watch up there by the time he turned the corner and saw the familiar low outline of the villa an elderly man with lined careworn features and straggling grey hair was waiting to welcome him with a jug of water and part of a loaf despite his years the old servants limpid eyes were still sharp and they lit up when they recognized valerius granta the young roman shouted you havent aged a day he slid from the horse and ran to his fathers longsuffering freedman stopping short when he remembered he was no longer a child and couldnt greet him with a hug they studied each other for a few moments you have grown into a fine young man master valerius grantas voice which could tear a hole in a barn wall if he found a slave shirking shook with emotion we were so proud when we heard about your great honour the old man was smiling but valerius noticed the familiar shadow that never seemed to be far away whenever he met an old friend britain had marked him as surely as if the iceni had pressed a slave brand against his skin he saw granta eyeing his wooden hand even better than the old one he grinned and pulled back his sleeve to show the carved fist attached to the leather socket that sheathed his arm it can hold a shield or a cup as long as its not one of your best but it cant get up to mischief granta laughed grateful to have the delicate subject out of the way valerius took a drink from the cup and a bite from the bread is my father home the smile stayed in place but granta shifted uneasily he has been out tending the olive trees on the north slope since dawn i was about to send a slave to him with bread and oil when you arrived then ill take it and surprise him he saw a shadow cross the old mans face and laughed dont worry it will be a gentle surprise ill make sure he doesnt have a seizure granta wondered politely whether he wouldnt prefer a bath to wash off the dust but valerius insisted and a young slave brought him a leather waterskin and a parcel made up with vine leaves before he set off he removed his sandals to enjoy the warm earth between his toes but he hadnt gone far before the memory of the big black scorpions he once trapped here made him tread more warily and if he was honest with himself that wasnt the only recollection that invoked a prickle of fear life on the estate hadnt always been idyllic his father had brought him up by an aristocratic code which dictated that any deviation must be punished with the rod he had sometimes hated the old man for it but as an adult he wondered just what it had cost lucius to make him suffer the walk from the villa to the north slope took twenty minutes and he was sweating lightly by the time he reached there he knew he was getting close when the neat rows of vines were replaced by gnarled olive trees his family had cultivated for generations the warm scented air tasted fresh and pure and for the first time he felt able to banish thoughts of neros vile kiss at least here among the shades of his ancestors he could feel clean but he couldnt forget everything senecas estate lay on the other side of this hill and once more he pondered the philosophers motives seneca had always been a leader not a follower and had developed his own flexible theory of selfdetermination virtue might be sufficient for happiness as he had preached but survival was another critical factor how happy could a dead man be the same logic told valerius that seneca had seen a way out of his predicament and the only reason for the meeting was because he valerius had something seneca needed or wanted a flash of blue against the dusty green of the closeranked trees drew his attention and he smiled he doubted whether his father had ever worn anything so vivid even in the days when he was close to emperor tiberius lucius must have brought someone to help him with his inspection in a way it was a surprise to find him out here at all his father had never been a man of the soil running the family estate was an obligation but the task of working it could safely be left to his freedmen and his slaves yet here he was rising at cockcrow and getting his hands dirty as he approached the blue turned out to be turquoise and belonged to a skirt whose owner was part hidden behind a tree valerius saw no sign of his father but he could make out the low drone of a mans voice the twisted olive trunks and low branches disguised his approach until he was a few paces away he saw the girl in the instant she saw him long black hair a pair of frightened brown eyes and a sharp gasp as her hand flew to her mouth she sat at the base of a tree with her legs half tucked beneath her and the skirt draped decorously around his eyes were drawn to the high breasts that quivered beneath her shift and he smiled to show she had nothing to fear he turned to face his father lucius stood directly across from the girl valerius had intended to surprise the old man so a little shock might have been expected but not the anguish that was written plain across his face nor the ferocity of a man ready to kill to protect whatever terrible secret hed been discovered in a pruning knife lay at the old mans feet and valerius realized he was fortunate it hadnt been in his fathers hand father he grinned uncertainly i brought you food after a moments hesitation the old mans face slowly crumpled and the fire vanished from his eyes lucius stumbled forward to take valerius in his arms then stepped back to stare in a kind of wonder at the wooden hand i am responsible for that i sent you there valerius shook his head but lucius smiled sadly no do not deny it we both know it is true but i swear here and now that i will repay this debt before the end the girl had taken herself out of earshot and now sat a few yards away her head bowed and her face concealed behind the dark veil of her hair she was younger than valerius had thought probably no more than seventeen ruth his father called you should go back and help in the kitchen she rose with a dancers grace and still without looking at valerius walked off down the slope luciuss eyes followed her swaying back and his face radiated a kind of awkward bemused contentment with a shock valerius understood the reason for his fathers reaction surely it wasnt possible he was ancient in his sixties the girl could be his daughter his granddaughter and she was a slave lucius the defender of all things moral who would have damned another man for even thinking such a thing yet what else could explain his earlier defensiveness and he had changed already valerius had seen that lucius was more at ease with himself than he had ever been she is very pretty he said she is just a slave lucius replied in a tone that invited no further conversation valerius leaned back against a tree if his father wanted to believe no one knew he was happy to go along with it but it was just as well hed found out ruth was pretty and desirable in a wholesome vulnerable way if he hadnt been aware of his fathers feelings he might have invited her into his bed he pushed the thought aside and returned to the reason for his visit you should see olivia lucius frowned in the past he would have rejected the suggestion outright now valerius was heartened to see he was prepared to consider it but the old man would not give in easily she shamed me he grumbled she should have accepted my choice of husband a womans duty is to obey her father you made the wrong choice valeriuss words had no force behind them this was a subject they had argued to the bones perhaps but still you are always welcome she has been asking for you i will think on it valerius turned the subject back to the estate and they walked together through the olive trees commenting on this one or that did it need pruning was it too old to provide the best quality oil lucius complained about dwindling profits but hinted that a solution was in hand twice on the way back to the villa valerius had the feeling that his father had something important to say to him twice the moment passed will you stay the night the old man asked granta and cronus would enjoy your company as i would i cannot i have an appointment with seneca a shadow fell over luciuss eyes be very careful valerius xi the villa of lucius annaeus seneca filled the mouth of the valley a great stucco palace bordering three sides of a landscaped garden that would comfortably have held the tents and horse lines of a legion and the main part of the complex the building that faced valerius as he approached was as deep as it was wide extending back to the hills two hundred paces beyond in the foreground peacocks and tiny antelopes the size of terriers grazed the irrigated lawns and nipped the heads from flowers beginning to wilt in the heat his host waited for him in the shade of the colonnaded portico seneca looked relaxed overweight and successful his fingers weighed down by gold rings and his puffy heavily jowled face saved from being ugly by a strong nose and shining grey eyes that radiated benevolent intelligence the only sign of anxiety was in the hand he ran across the mottled skin of his bald head as he beamed a welcome valerius my boy it has been much too long let me see you now by the gods you have become a man and what a man those shoulders that chest you exercise every day of course you do and the hand valerius lifted the walnut fist so seneca could see it clearly a masterpiece you have been through the fire and it is the fire that makes us who we are valerius had witnessed a law court hushed by the sound of senecas voice addressing a crowd from the rostra sixty paces away but in conversation the philosopher was softly spoken almost mellow in tone im glad to see you well master seneca seneca laughed but for the first time valerius detected a hint of bitterness i am no longer your master valerius i am no mans master perhaps not even my own he brightened again you have been to visit your father of course a sons first duty is to his family and you were always a dutiful son valerius felt as if he was swimming against a tidal wave of flattery and fought back with a little of his own you have a fine house sir and a wonderful estate and i am forgetting my manners please come inside seneca led him through a large vestibule and across a broad inner courtyard striding out like a man ten years younger and talking as he went they say i am too rich he didnt identify who they were but valerius knew torquatus would be among them they say i could not afford this if i had not been stealing from the emperors purse what do they know of lucius annaeus seneca for the first time in romes history is a man to be condemned for being successful i have lived each minute of my life in the pursuit of profit or contentment and sometimes the two are not exclusive though both i grant you can be difficult to come by they reached a room with large windows and walls painted in imitation of the gardens outside seneca lay on one couch and valerius sat opposite him the philosopher studied him seriously there is a sickness in the air a political sickness that could very well be fatal i do not intend you to catch it valerius though you may feel i have exposed you to its vapours by bringing you here in this room we may speak freely the acoustics are poor and as you see the nearest doorway far enough away to keep the slaves honest you have been clever as i intended you to be a young man visits his fathers estate and makes a neighbourly call upon his former tutor is it not natural your presence will be reported certainly they have six spies in my household that i know of and who knows how many that i do not but i doubt it will arouse suspicions and if it does i believe you are agile enough to allay them valerius found himself caught between admiration of senecas cunning in trapping him in the quicksand of whatever plot he was hatching and alarm at the knowledge that he was already up to his neck and sinking fast clearly if he refused the proposition about to be made it would take only a single word in the right ear to condemn him yet he had always known it would be this way implicit in his decision to come was trust in the philosophers judgement and faith in his integrity he would give seneca the truth the emperor has charged me with investigating a group of judaean agitators he believes are plotting against rome who he fears have infiltrated the highest levels of government seneca nodded gravely i am aware of your assignment indeed it was i who instigated it he saw valeriuss confusion oh yes valerius i am not yet without influence torquatus thinks the suggestion was his but it was i who sowed the seed it has placed you in a position to do both your emperor and your friends a great service for a moment the words lay between them like pieces on a gaming board but valerius was still reluctant to make the decisive move i dont understand why me the question echoed the one he had asked torquatus a day earlier to his surprise so did the answer his host gave a sigh that would have been more at home on a stage i could tell you that you are brave that you are wise and that you have a mind that is never satisfied with the first solution it finds and all that would be true but the real answer is simpler i trust you seneca rose and his voice changed as he began to pace the room now again valerius saw lucius annaeus seneca the statesman do you love rome valerius more important do you believe in rome of course you do the blood of men who lived and died for rome runs in your veins you are the son of a man who once risked everything for rome valerius struggled to justify this vision of his father but seneca was no longer speaking to him he was speaking to the empire rome is an invalid tottering on the brink of the abyss and evil men are gathering to push her over the edge into chaos depravity and ultimately a carnage that will consume her romes emperor is not strong enough to stand in their way he must have help nero cannot rule alone valerius he is no caesar or augustus he was fated to rule but he needs a guiding hand a firm honest hand to steer him in the direction that is best for his people without that hand he will always be the servant of his urges and the servant of those who provide the means to satisfy those urges he will shift with each changing wind and with each shift he will become less of an emperor with every passing hour it becomes more difficult to return him to the true path and the path that could lead him to true greatness the followers of christus are a danger to rome but torquatus and the band of degenerates he cultivates are a greater danger still as long as i breathe i will never plot against the emperor but i will fight to return to his side and you valerius can place me there i will help you find the man known as the rock of christus and you will deliver him to me and help me discredit torquatus and his gang together valerius we will save rome valerius stared at him he knew the speech was calculated to appeal to gaius valerius verrens tribune of the twentieth a call to arms designed to stir a soldiers blood on the eve of battle he wasnt blind he saw through seneca the statesman to seneca the actor but somehow that didnt matter his blood was stirred and he was ready for battle now at least he knew what he was fighting for he didnt need to speak seneca saw the impact of his words he nodded in every life there comes a moment to choose valerius you will never regret the choice you have just made tell me about christuss rock seneca made him wait he called for servants to bring food and it was only after they had completed their meal that they resumed their discussion it is impossible to tell the story of the rock without telling the story of christus when did it begin was it the moment he was born or the moment he died or somewhere in between you will hear that christus was a mystic an insurrectionist a teacher or a criminal but i think the truth is that he was a mixture of them all he came without education or wealth from an obscure galilean village but within two years he had gathered men who had both to his side oh they will tell you that he had made a vow of poverty but no man could have achieved what christus did without substantial resources how else could he have retained what became a small army of followers he claimed he was the son of god and to each man he gave a reason to believe he is said to have carried out miracles all of which can be disputed but none of which can be entirely disproved so why did they follow him why did they believe him because he offered them the chance to live for ever eternal life was in his gift and that of his father seneca shook his head at the absurdity of it the judaeans hated and feared him because he cast doubt upon their own religion eventually they persuaded the governor that he was as much a danger to rome as he was to jerusalem and pilatus ordered him crucified pilatus was foolish left alive christus would have become a figure of ridicule a simpleton who promised everything but delivered nothing valerius nodded but one question intrigued him and how was a person to be guaranteed eternal life seneca smiled that was the genius of christus first a man had to earn the right to immortality by his deeds during his own life deeds determined by the teachings of christus second he would come to eternal life only after he died you see the wonderful paradox one had to die to live for ever and only after death would one know one had achieved it and this rock is a believer in such foolishness the rock simon petrus was the first of christuss followers another galilean though torquatus chooses to band him with romes judaeans a simple fisherman hypnotized by the words of a cleverer man he followed him to jerusalem saw him die there and seneca snorted his disbelief claims he saw him rise again valerius wasnt so certain its not impossible he pointed out ive seen men lying on the battlefield who looked as if they were dead and thought they were dead who rose up to have supper with their comrades most of them died later from their wounds but still a man can be difficult to kill simon petrus simon is his given name petrus the rock is the title christus awarded him for his loyalty many lost their enthusiasm for the teachings of christus after he was tried and crucified but petrus continues to spread his message when the authorities in jerusalem made life difficult for him he moved on to antioch and now to rome where he calls himself bishop but wields no power and has little influence except among his closest followers then why is he so dangerous because he is a master of deception and because of the message he preaches which denies the authority of the emperor because those he now targets are roman citizens with the power to influence other roman citizens even those in the senate petrus is a dangerous man who gathers other dangerous men to him if petrus has his way the only god in rome will be the god of christus he would wipe away the very foundations of our society i am not a religious man valerius but i fear this petrus valerius studied the figure across from him why did he feel this prickle of unease so petrus is the most dangerous man in rome a shadow who has denied the praetorians for months it seems yet lucius annaeus seneca confined to his humble home in the hills appears to know everything about him you have his name perhaps you can tell me where he lives and who he meets or even give me his description senecas ringed fingers stroked his head you are suspicious and so you should be we are swimming in dangerous waters you and i and it is right that we should understand each other fully it is well known that i have maintained contacts in the east since my days in aegyptus while i had neros confidence i wielded a power you would not imagine and that power allowed me to expand those contacts still further you will admit i am a man of some little talent the false modesty made valerius laugh as it was intended to then put your trust in me valerius as i put my trust in you petrus is in his sixtythird year of medium height with the strong features typical of the easterner he wears a full beard not to mask them but because it is his custom he walks with a slight limp and he has a reputation as a healer you will know him when you look into his eyes he raised a hand no i can explain no further you will understand when the time comes valerius somehow kept his face emotionless if i have news how can i get word to you i will have a man watch your house place a lamp in the window above your door at dusk that will be a signal for a meeting at noon the following day at the north corner of the castra peregrina now it was valeriuss turn to frown where better for two conspirators to meet than on the doorstep of a nest of spies seneca chuckled at his own genius the castra peregrina as its name implied was the base for foreign soldiers posted to duties in rome but also the headquarters of the emperors frumentarii messengers who often acted as the emperors spies occasionally as his assassins seneca saw that valerius wasnt convinced if you wish we can appoint another meeting place valerius shook his head no one place is as good as another and the busier the better the emperor will demand a swift resolution but despite what i have told you petrus will not be an easy man to find seneca warned in six months torquatus and rodan have not even come close your investigation must be taken one step at a time this will be your first step he gave valerius a name which surprised him you will wish to begin as soon as possible valerius knew when he was being dismissed he had a dozen questions he would have liked to ask but he doubted seneca would answer any of them they embraced as if they were father and son and as valerius rode off towards the via salaria he pondered the astonishing name seneca had given him and the biggest surprise of all the description of christuss rock the man called petrus who sounded exactly like joshua the doctor in whom he had placed his faith seneca was still standing in the doorway when valerius passed out of sight do you think he suspects the quiet voice came from the shadow behind him no he is an honest straightforward young man he will complete his task or die in the attempt then may he live long enough to complete it seneca turned to face the man who could have been a younger version of petrus you realize what this could cost nero will have no mercy we must all make sacrifices those who die will have died for our lord petrus is a good man but he is too soft to lead us to the promised land and he favours a different path just so you are a hard man just so saul of tarsus said again xii poppaea fought the familiar animal squirm of panic everywhere she went she felt neros eyes on her but he couldnt know because if he truly knew she would be dead or worse yet even that was of no consequence because soon she would be free and nothing they could do to her would matter just one more step one more simple act and it was done loneliness and fear had been her lot ever since her father had married her off at the age of seventeen she had been young and naive a pretty plaything who knew nothing of the natural bounds of marriage or the power a wife might hold if she only understood her strength instead she had submitted because her husband said she should even when she knew it was wrong each night she would endure the pain and selfloathing that went hand in hand with the acts she was forced to perform for him each night she would cry herself to sleep that should have been enough even for him but of course it was not she thought she had married a strong man but events had proved that what she had taken for strength was mere bravado and what she had thought was courage only a disguise for bluster a coward and a braggart who had bragged once too often what a fool she had been the night they were invited to the palace she had been excited proud that the man who ruled their empire should seek the company of her husband even a husband she had grown to hate that was the first night shed felt the little eyes roving over her skin and later the hands cold and clammy the way a snake should feel but does not slithering across her breasts and her belly and and later later he had watched again those same eyes glittering as her husband used her yes used not slept with or made love to used and when her husband was finished with her he was ready she knew that to refuse him was death but she almost did almost when that barrier was broken the rest was just more of the same the servants and the slaves and the soldiers who shared the wide bed and otho her husband had rejoiced because he had the emperors favour and the emperors favour meant power and riches and though he was too foolish to understand it danger three months later torquatus had sent for otho and ordered him to divorce her she remembered the day he returned from the palace his face the colour of dead flesh hands shaking and eyes glazed with terror not out of concern for her not because he was going to lose her but because he feared for his position and his life she had despised him then and she despised him now cowering in his lusitanian exile praying for a speedy return to the inner circle which would never be forthcoming as long as she had influence she had been glad to be rid of him oh what a fool she was now she lived behind a mask as much an actor as the man whose bed she shared a better actor she hoped because her life depended upon it she gave him everything he wanted because it meant nothing to her now these physical acrobatics and pointless almost laughable penetrations but it was never enough it had been her initiative to introduce fabia though fabia wasnt aware of it fabia who had taught her to live with othos demands and eventually how to satisfy them with fabia she could find comfort as well as pleasure a hand to hold when it all became too much and a shoulder to cry on when it was over yet even to fabia she could not speak of the true depths of her despair it had been a mistake to make an enemy of torquatus she had underestimated his ability to slither serpentlike through the long grass of palace politics he had supported octavia against her while neros first wife still retained some of her power and it had only seemed right that she should undermine him a few quiet words in the sultry aftermath of passion should have been enough a suggestion of eyes lingering too long perhaps a touch that could not be disproved and she believed he would be gone but that was not neros way her husbands greatest pleasure was to pitch those around him against each other in a neverending dogfight that ensured the master was always in control now with octavia dead torquatus had made it his goal to either remove poppaea or possess her she didnt know which she feared most she had sacrificed to the gods for her salvation and when it became clear they had failed her she had considered planned her own death cornelius who had been as much a prisoner as she had shown her the path she must take why had she confided in cornelius not because of the puppy eyes or the pretty smiles and prettier compliments no there had to be something more she had recognized it on the night neros degeneracy had reached its shameful low and he had placed her at the disposal of a pair of enormous nubians for the entertainment of the narroweyed perverts who clung to him like leeches on a swollen leg the memory of it made her gorge rise but it had been then that she had seen the pain in cornelius sullas eyes and behind it discovered the tenderness and compassion of a good man here at her lowest most degraded point she had found the only person on the palatine she could trust cornelius had opened her eyes to a world beyond her own world and a god who would not forsake her it had been he who engineered her meeting with the judaean who had spoken to her of christus the messiah who had sacrificed himself for the good of all mankind and of the god the true god who would protect her and keep her safe even as her body was being abused and her mind driven to the edge of madness despite her initial doubts about a religion which at first seemed exotic if not outlandish she had found herself persuaded by the old mans luminous integrity she had feigned illness to create a pretext for the meeting convincing her ladies that if the emperor discovered the true reason for her visit to the greek physician his reaction might endanger them all once inside the treatment room the greek had been replaced by the man petrus she had listened and she had believed the truth was that she needed to believe he had placed his hand upon her and she had felt energized in a way that astonished her she had seen the light she understood the truth now she had only one more step before she would be welcomed into gods company but how would it be achieved petrus had said he would make the arrangements and she had placed her faith in him that had been weeks ago lately she had sensed that the surveillance within the palace had become more intensive was it her imagination or were the slaves hovering a little more closely and her ladies more attentive cornelius would barely meet her eyes and when he did she had seen the fear and the puzzlement in his her saviour was as trapped as she was a tear ran down her cheek as her eyes lighted on the painting that covered the wall of her room it was her escape from everything that happened here in this palace that had become her prison a country scene a sunlit villa on a hill overlooking the sea her villa the villa where she had grown up the place where she had last been happy she closed her eyes and she was back in the long pool in front of the house with the sound of the waterfall soft and comforting in her ears but she couldnt stay there for ever not now she must plan and scheme as if her life depended upon it because it did the shop was deserted the wares removed the only thing that remained was the tantalizing sweetly pungent scent of spice valerius stood in the doorway and pondered his next move what else had he expected the man had survived as a fugitive for thirty years of course he must have developed a sense for the changing patterns around him want us to talk to the neighbours marcus asked valerius nodded its probably a waste of time but it cant do any harm marcus called serpentius and the other men he had hired at first valerius couldnt believe the former gladiator had engaged the man who had made such a determined effort to kill him but marcus made a convincing argument hes the best fighter ive got you saw yourself how fast he is but hes too good a hater to be a successful gladiator he was going to get himself killed now youve saved his life it wont make him hate you any the less but he owes you and spaniards pay their debts three more of the scarred veterans pupils completed the group heracles an oxlike sarmatian with the face of a twelveyearold child who marcus insisted was cleverer than he looked and whose additional talents included the ability to crush a mans skull with one giant paw felix the brindisian a habitual thief whose skills would no doubt be useful and little sextus who could be trusted to wait watch and keep his mouth shut marcus studied the crumbling plaster beside the door what do you make of that it was similar to graffito you could find on any roman street corner but the crude carving resembled a slim bag closed at the neck the bag lay horizontally with the letters mcvii beneath it the design had been recently cut which might make it significant some kind of sign but it could mean anything the number might be eleven hundred and seven or mc might be a street in the seventh district valerius looked at the carving again and something stirred in his memory seneca had said petrus had been a fisherman could it be a fish funnylooking kind of fish but maybe theyre different where he comes from i think its a message from petrus to his followers leave serpentius here and tell him to watch for anyone who comes along to take a look then follow them marcus nodded and us lucina graecina the gladiator looked as if hed just bitten into a lemon is that who i think it is thats right i knew this was going to be trouble lucina graecina romes empress without a throne the woman rumoured to have been claudiuss lover before he had been seduced by agrippina the woman who despised nero more than anyone in the empire is it true nero only keeps her alive because hes worried shell be waiting for him on the other side valerius nodded that and the fact that her husband is the man who conquered britain aulus plautius and lucina have ample reason to hate nero lucina blames the emperor for killing their son lucina seldom showed her face in the city preferring to travel in a closed litter carried by six british slaves the original bearers had been members of king caratacuss personal bodyguard captured by her husband in the great battle which had won britain for rome twenty years earlier lucina was said to have worked them to death in three years since then shed replaced them several times always from the same tribe the warlike catuvellauni naturally rome being rome the gossips whispered that it wasnt only carrying her that had worn the muscular britons out valerius had seen her only once when she had been forced from the litter at a praetorian checkpoint he remembered a narrow glaring face masked by the white powder of mourning a tall bony woman of late middle age with a back as straight as a cavalry spear they couldnt have been more different in appearance but her bearing had reminded him of the iceni queen boudicca he told marcus i want a watch on her house day and night and a report of all her movements for the next two days valerius barely left olivias side listening to the sound of her shallow breathing as she fought whatever demons were consuming her from within since lucius had abdicated responsibility for her it had fallen to valerius to take over his sisters guardianship in theory according to the twelve tables the rules that were the very foundation of roman law he had the power of life and death over her even though she was a respectable widow who had run a married household for five years the thought made him shake his head if he truly had power he would use it to save her from this insidious living death which brought him to his dilemma whether as petrus the rock or joshua the physician the judaeans skills were olivias best perhaps only chance of salvation yet valerius was under orders from nero to deliver him for torture and execution and under obligation to seneca to do the same when he found him he would have a decision to make but first he had to find him what made a man like the judaean leave everyone dear to him to follow a charlatan like this christus he remembered the intelligent eyes and the ageless wornout smile taut selfcontrol and a well of inborn compassion a good man by anyones definition of good no hint of insanity or covetousness or ambition valerius had heard of men who could control the minds of other men through drugs or by weakening them with deprivation could that be christuss magic yet the mystic had died thirty years ago on a cross how did it explain petruss continuing to risk his life to spread the mans words it seemed absurd and yet petrus had believed valerius shivered the room seemed to have gone cold if a man like petrus could be convinced then perhaps dead christus and the men who followed him truly were the great danger nero imagined xiii it would be the glory of rome nero stood over the table and the familiar sevenhilled landscape filled with intricately carved wooden houses and temples today there was a difference in the area between the palatine and esquiline hills now stood a structure so magnificent it gave him a feeling of almost sexual pleasure a single monumental building on a scale with the hills that flanked it which dwarfed every other surrounding construction three hundred rooms miles of lakes and parklands he would fill it with the wonders of the world and cover it with gold and men would come to marvel at it from the ends of the earth aegyptus babylon troy and sumeria had nothing to compare with it this would be his legacy this would be his triumph his and his alone within it would be a great artistic and cultural centre where he would entertain and mesmerize those worthy of his talent music would soothe the blood of his enemies fine words would seduce those who opposed him in this house there would only be harmony of course he thought remembering the hundreds perhaps thousands of wooden dwellings scattered across the mosaic floor there would be obstacles but a good workman could clear away any obstacle if he had the tools he would allow nothing to obstruct his dream they would thank him in the end all those small people who would have to make way for it the people who lived in the cramped dunghills beneath the terracotta tiles amid the oppressive swirling miasma of corruption seneca had taken him there once disguised in the clothing of the common man to let him see his people people animals fighting and rutting and squatting in the mud and the straw and the filth the stink had almost made him faint he had as little in common with his people as he had with cows in a field or the monkeys in the palatine menagerie let ugliness make way for beauty ordinariness for elegance mediocrity for magnificence he ran the last thought over his tongue testing it for quality and rhythm yes with a little polishing he could include it in a song or a poem he picked up his harp and strummed through the scales smiling as the hundreds of songbirds in the cages by the window reacted to his notes here at least he could always find an audience who truly appreciated his music the cage was not their natural element just as the barless cage of duty he inhabited was not his sometimes he longed to fly free and when that melancholy took hold he would open the cages and watch the birds stand nervously on the threshold before taking to the skies trilling blackbirds and song thrushes pinkcheeked goldfinches and drab honeyvoiced skylarks the robins and wrens and redstarts sometimes they would die in their cages and he would mourn them lately he had been pondering his own mortality torquatus had tried to explain to him the tenets of the christus religion but he did not fully understand it in fact he was fairly certain torquatus didnt understand it either he frowned this was when he needed senecas genius seneca could take a subject and peel back the layers until a child could understand its meaning but seneca was old and defeated and had taken to disagreeing with him at the end he could not even outwit a man as dull as torquatus so how could he guide his emperor as he saw it in simple terms a man could achieve immortality only after submitting to the indignity and inconvenience of death to do so he needed to have believed in life that christus truly was the son of the judaean god yahweh but and this was what made it all seem so unlikely how could someone of even average intelligence be convinced of the authenticity of a man who had been dead for almost three decades he had considered having the body of the galilean exhumed surely it would show some signs of his godlike capacity a lack of mortification of the flesh or an ability to speak from beyond the grave he fully expected to become a god himself after all if old claudius could be declared divine surely he of all his line could take his place beside augustus and caligula but he had the blood of gods running through his veins to believe some foreigner born by a muddy puddle in the desert could stand at his side was an insult it was like suggesting a beggar from the slums should have a temple dedicated in his honour the judaeans believed in the same god and he was one of the reasons they despised this christus but they accepted the authority of the emperor which was why for the moment he tolerated their barbarities surely the more gods a man worshipped the better jupiter mars mercury and minerva had all come to romes aid in times of drought and famine and war what could a single god do that many could not do better if one god failed a man he was within his rights to sacrifice to another and another until he found the god who could help him the more he turned it over in his mind the more unlikely the christus claims appeared still he would put the mans followers to the question if they had stayed and worshipped their god and their son of god in some desert cave he would have ignored them but they had not they had come to his city rome the heart of his empire and they had refused to acknowledge his authority worse they had attempted to weaken rome from within suborning its citizens even at the highest level he would test their faith upon the rack and the roasting plate and through glowing iron and blazing fire until they cried out their falsehood or revealed the true secret of their immortality unless the handsome hero failed him he remembered the kiss and valerius shrinking from the touch of his lips and remembered another succulent mouth that had done the same he had found that a reluctant boy could be moulded into a lover through a combination of pain and affection remove the reason for reluctance and he became pliable and cooperative especially if he knew that the next step was to remove his head sporus had been like that uncooperative until hed been visited by the gelding knife when hed quite entered into the spirit of it all nero had been much younger then and it had seemed such fun to set up house but the old men had spoiled it all with their righteous outrage tattling to his mother when they were all just jealous in the end sporus had become tiresome nagging him almost as badly as octavia so hed had to go if the hero failed he would have valerius willing or not xiv valerius couldnt disguise his frustration an entire week and the watch on lucina graecina had produced no new information theres nothing we can do about it he admitted to marcus as they discussed their plans in the house on the clivus scauri we have to be patient the former gladiator pursed his lips patience didnt come easily to him ive sent serpentius and felix out into the streets beyond subura to try to get a feel for the way the winds blowing if youre right these people are fanatics and fanatics find it even more difficult to sit still and wait than we do your man petrus might be lying low but im betting that one of his friends just cant wait to stand up on a street corner and let everybody know why hes in rome valerius was impressed and said so but why beyond the subura why not around the porta capena where most of the judaeans live marcus frowned and tried to articulate what had been an entirely instinctive decision because the followers of christus are more likely to be known among the judaeans their own people than they are among romans they dare not live among their countrymen for fear of betrayal more sensible to stay in family groups in the main population and beyond the subura because i think your physician wont have moved far in the shadow of the praetorian barracks will be as good a place to look as any serpentius will like that ive told him to stay out of trouble and he knows hell go straight back to the arena if he doesnt i doubt it will do any good but it increases our chances from nought to a little more than nought valerius smiled and raised his wooden hand ive faced chances like that before my friend and im still mostly here so ill accept the odds marcus grinned back the deep shadows of his scars creating unearthly patterns on his skin a jar of wine on it then they were interrupted by a shout from the door marcus stood and his hand strayed to his sword but valerius waved him down a slave entered and announced that the old master had arrived ill check with serpentius and report back the gladiator made his exit towards the kitchens but valerius was already on his way to greet his father in the vestibule it is too long since you graced this house sir valerius bowed come through to the atrium and i will have julia bring us some wine his father gave an embarrassed smile i am afraid i cannot stay long i am in the city on business and i have a meeting at the seventh hour i i would like if you permit it to visit olivia valerius didnt attempt to hide his pleasure of course please come you remember the way to her room olivia was as hed left her shed hardly moved for a week valerius felt the pleasure at his fathers visit wash away to be replaced by a new hopelessness if he couldnt find petrus she would die if he did find him the judaeans fate would be inevitable and terrible he looked up to find his father watching him from the other side of the bed her illness is taking its toll on you also i see the old man said i am sorry i should have offered my support much earlier you are doing everything you can everything then all i can do is pray for her the grey head bent over the dark hair and lucius kissed his daughter tenderly on the forehead his fathers unconscious affection made valerius feel as if a fist had gripped his heart for a moment all he wanted to do was carry them off far away from the political cesspit rome had become he reached out for the old mans shoulder but withdrew his hand at the last moment lucius straightened i must go now do not stay away so long again the old man gave a bittersweet smile if the fates allow it valerius had barely seen his father to the street when marcus redfaced and breathing hard rushed in through the kitchens you have to see this he gasped they walked briskly through the streets and marcus explained that hed intercepted a message from serpentius ten minutes after hed left the house he indicated a thin ragged child jogging at their side valerius tossed the boy a silver coin which the urchin caught skilfully his face broke into an enormous grin when he realized what he had it was your fish marcus continued serpentius has good eyes he noticed another that had been freshly scraped on a brick where the vicus patricius meets the via subura at the bottom of the viminal hill it had the number seven scratched beneath it and he guessed it must mean the seventh hour he took a chance on this being the day and it paid off hes there now valerius felt his heart quicken petrus no a young man not a lot older than the messenger hopefully well get to him before the praetorians do by the time they reached the road junction a crowd had gathered where an orator shouted to be heard above the clamour of insults and jeers marcus had been right he was little more than a boy perhaps seventeen with arms and legs too long for his body and dark hair slicked greasily against his forehead and flecked with eggshell his accent marked him as judaean and provoked sneers from his audience but he spoke with a calm determination that belied his age hes a tough little runt serpentius said admiringly as he sidled up beside them theyve been throwing rotting fruit and old eggs at him for twenty minutes itll be rocks soon even as he spoke the boy staggered and a line of blood ran down his cheek where he had been struck bastards the spaniard muttered but the boys eyes lit up as if he had just been offered a gift jesus said let him who is without sin among you cast the first stone and no man among them would throw i am not jesus but i repeat his words let him who is without sin among you cast the first stone have one of these then called a rough voice from the far side of the crowd a stone the size of a hens egg smashed the boy in the mouth drawing more blood and making it difficult for him to speak jesus came to offer you everlasting life the words were thick with pain and as mangled as his lips he died for you will you not live for him jesus valerius looked to serpentius must be his pet name for this christus if he died for me why havent i had anything from his will the voice of the rock thrower was accompanied by cackling laughter from his friends he the guard a cry from the direction of the vicus patricius interrupted the speaker the street led directly towards the castra praetoria and the praetorians were never gentle when breaking up an illegal gathering the crowd quickly dispersed into the surrounding streets valerius saw the bleeding boy dart up a nearby alleyway and ran after him after a few minutes his quarry slowed to a walk and valerius took step beside him you spoke well he said the boy looked up suspiciously the blood still dripping from his mouth you are following me i saw you with the watcher at the back of the crowd yes valerius admitted but i mean you no harm i am not like them the young judaean managed a semblance of a smile do not judge them too harshly they know not what they do you would forgive those who hurt you the boy looked surprised of course it is our lords teaching valerius took him by the shoulder i am looking for a man called petrus he is known as the rock of christus do you know where i can find him the boy glanced down at the wooden hand resting on his arm if you seek the rock of christus for the right reasons you do not have to look for him he will find you with a twist of his body he wriggled from valeriuss grasp and ran off down the alley valerius saw serpentius slip after him and merge into the crowd he turned to look for marcus and found himself staring into the eyes of ruth his fathers slave girl she quickly averted her gaze and walked in the opposite direction but not before he recognized a look of pure hatred xv it has happened again valerius turned ready to defend himself but it was only old honorius the water commissioner bearing down on him from the direction of the circus maximus rheumy eyes bulging in a face the colour of a ripe plum it cant go on no valerius said reassuringly not quite certain what couldnt go on thousands of gallons a day from the water castle up on the cespian height a veritable river siphoned off somewhere between there and the subura stolen from the state larceny on a grand scale it must be stopped it will be honorius glared at him but when when will you prosecute our case i need a little more time he lowered his voice imperial business honoriuss outraged expression softened ah he said knowingly state business two weeks perhaps a month the water commissioner sniffed two weeks then valerius watched him go the man was like a hunting dog he would never lose the scent all he thought about were his aqueducts and his pipes his water castles and his springs but without the aqueducts and men like honorius to ensure they were maintained rome would be a desert and a stinking one at that not only did water from the aqua claudia and the new anio and their like slake the thirst of a million people through private supplies and public fountains it also served to flush out the sewers into the tiber taking the threat of disease and plague with it during the preparations for the case honorius had hammered into him the history of romes waters how the city had been supplied by the tiber and local springs until three hundred and fifty years earlier when the censor appius claudius crassus had brought to rome the waters of a spring on the lucullan estate eight miles outside the city aqua appia was the first of the nine and was followed forty years later by old anio which took its supply from above the falls of tivoli then more than a century later came aqua marcia the first to be carried above ground and her waters travelling an astonishing fiftyfour miles to reach rome emperor augustus had given rome the julia the tepula the virgo and the augusta used mainly for irrigation gaius caligula had begun the claudia which was completed by the uncle whose name it bore and claudius had also ordered the construction of the new anio the most modern and technically advanced if the water castle the commissioner spoke of was on the cespian height between the viminal and esquiline hills it must be on a spur of old anio which entered the city close to the porta viminalis but valerius had more pressing concerns he was certain he was being followed during suetoniuss campaign of retribution in the wake of boudiccas rebellion valerius had lived with the constant threat of ambush from defeated british tribesmen with nothing more to lose he had developed an instinct for survival akin to a third eye the alarm signal was a prickle at the back of his neck and it had been prickling for days now hed tried all the usual methods to detect his watchers backtracking when it would be least expected stopping suddenly as if hed changed his mind about something turning off into some narrow alleyway where a follower would be easier to identify nothing today hed been more subtle when he reached the house he walked straight through the atrium and the kitchens to the garden marcus waited with his backside perched on a stone cabinet where the winter vegetables were stored crunching a pear from one of the trees that lined the walls the old gladiator grunted a welcome you werent seen valerius had installed the five men in a rented house about a quarter of a mile away beyond the city wall marcus shook his head i came by the servants entrance anyone spying on you would watch the front door theyre not interested in the slaves but i was careful in any case we stayed well back knowing your route and the timings helped a lot although the old boy with a beetroot for a nose almost caught us out honorius the water commissioner valerius smiled i couldnt get rid of him well he did us a turn they were good they kept their distance and switched places often enough to make sure you wouldnt mark them he described three men and valerius hadnt noticed any of them i thought there were only the three of them but with you stopped for so long they got a little confused eyeing each other up as if they didnt know what to do next thing theyre having a conference in a doorway with this fourth fellow stocky lad looked as if he knew how to handle himself he had that aware look if you know what i mean anything to distinguish him in a crowd marcus pondered for a few seconds at first i thought he was just another hired thug but there was something about him that didnt fit maybe the way he walked then i got a proper look at him you can tell when a mans been knocked about even if it was a while ago the left side of his face looked as if someone had shoved it in a furnace valerius smiled at the perfect description of rodan so hed been right but what to do about it if i need to can i lose them marcus considered the question theres nobody better at starting a fight than serpentius he nodded towards the far corner of the garden and valerius noticed with a chill the slim figure standing motionless in the shadow of one of the trees hell start on one of them their friends will come running you slip off up the nearest alleyway and ill cover your back we can meet up later if you need us again where are they now snake the spaniard didnt hesitate one watching the house from across the street the other two in the bar on the corner the ugly one left as soon as he saw you home valerius turned to marcus is there anything else i should know the gladiator grinned your old nag came first in the race of the day nag that horsefaced old bitch lucina she thought she was being slippery but i had heracles on her and hes a handy lad for such a big lump she likes her gardens does lucina and theres one shes taken to visiting regularly up on the hill by the temple of diana very private high wall but as i say hes a handy lad and he slips over it sos he can keep an eye on her while shes smelling the pretty flowers lucina does the rounds but shes not taking that much interest heracles thinks maybe shes only there to get away from the old man except shes too watchful and he has to hide in a bush a couple of times in case she spots him after about fifteen minutes it happens out of the trees on the far side a man appears oh ho thinks heracles now the fun starts hes young goodlooking if you like them skinny rich clothes and shoes that wont fall apart in the rain just what a dry old sow like lucina needs to get the juices running again next thing theyll be at it like rabbits on the grass only they arent hes respectful he stands just the right distance away he listens to what she says he bows and he leaves just like that valerius knew from the glint in marcuss eye there was more to come just like that only now heracles has a problem does he stay with lucina who we know is up to something or does he try to follow the boyfriend hes a bright lad thats right hes a bright lad he skips up the nearest tree and over the wall sprints round to the far side of the garden just in time to see the boyfriend disappearing down towards the meat market now your young man is a proper aristocrat begging your lordships pardon who knows how to stay busy doing nothing for hours on end heracles sticks with him as he wanders from shop to shop only looking never buying stops in a tavern and spends an hour over a cup of warm wine and a sausage youre biding your time thinks heracles youre waiting to meet somebody but if he does heracles misses it because all of a sudden its up and were off to a big house across the other side of the via flaminia from the septa julia and so fast we struggle to keep up he owns the house or thinks he does you can tell by the way he treats the doorman and its only a few minutes before hes out in a new tunic and cloak and were off again to the palatine valerius went over the details trying to follow the young mans reasoning he knew he was being followed or suspected he was or he was just making sure he wasnt heracles doesnt think he was seen yes that would fit just as well where did he go on the palatine heracles stayed with him until he walked up the clivus palatinus then he left him did he do wrong no someone would have questioned him and he might have ended up in trouble he did well make sure hes rewarded marcus nodded before he came to report to me he went back to the via flaminia and asked at a stall across the street who the big house belonged to valerius sensed that in his roundabout way the gladiator had just come to the point the name was cornelius sulla valerius remembered languid eyes and a mocking smile across the great receiving room in the domus transitoria cornelius sulla was one of neros favourites who had taken particular delight in seeing him fall from grace an arrogantly handsome boyman with soft golden curls that fell in waves to his neck and a bloodline that went back to the great dictator lucius cornelius sulla yet if the blood held iron cornelius was careful not to display it nero treated him like a pet forever absentmindedly stroking and caressing his flesh while cornelius purred with pleasure and asked for more some of fabias more scurrilous gossip hinted that the young aristocrat was the plaything of the emperor and his wife with torquatus acting as ringmaster and valerius could believe it the question was why a man whose future seemed so bound to nero would risk everything by consorting with the woman who had declared herself the emperors greatest foe i want heracles to stay with cornelius and he can have serpentiuss help if he needs it we need to know everywhere he goes when hes not at the palace and everyone he talks to i want sextus and felix watching my back well leave lucina for the moment its plain she knows shes being watched by torquatus she has taken one gamble this week shes unlikely to take another marcus disagreed by meeting cornelius in secret she has proved shes prepared to risk everything that makes it more likely shell act not less you may be right valerius admitted but theres nothing we can do about it he spent the evening at olivias side just listening to the sound of her breathing he remembered the morning of her eleventh birthday when he understood she would one day be beautiful and the irrational conflict that had raged between pride and jealousy soon she would leave and become someone elses friend it seemed unfair that he would lose her just when she was becoming interesting he had watched her grow from girl to woman and was surprised that the battle inside became all the more intense and that it was accompanied by sensations he would never begin to understand she was intelligent perhaps wiser than he was elegant cultured and refined he resented it for a short time when teenage arrogance overwhelmed good judgement they had hated each other but it didnt last when she was betrothed he had punched a wall with such impotent fury that hed almost broken his knuckles and when she married he went off to sulk among the olive trees the moment the traditional rites had been observed she was part of him and he of her two deaths had brought them back together first when the thing in their mothers breast had eaten the life out of her mamas decline had been long undignified and accompanied by a pain that no amount of courage could conquer or tincture of poppy dull as the ashes were placed in the family sarcophagus valerius and olivia had stood side by side united in their desire to replace the lifetime of love that had been torn from their father on the day of her husbands funeral it had been valerius olivia had turned to for support rather than lucius he wondered now if that reversal of roles after the death of one husband had been part of the reason for his poor choice of her next in the aftermath of the storm that had followed valerius had found himself responsible for her now he had failed her amidst all the uncertainties he knew only one thing he had to find petrus xvi are you certain you possess the zeal your emperor requires of you the summons had come as a surprise and the atmosphere in the room was relentlessly hostile torquatus sat behind his desk with rodan conspicuously armed and in the dark tunic of the praetorian guard smirking over his shoulder valerius stared at the two men on the face of it hed been called to the palatine to explain his lack of progress but he suspected there was another motive in an inquiry of this nature lack of zeal cannot be equated with lack of progress he pointed out as im sure you are aware prefect it is a question of ensuring all the pieces are in place before you make your decisive move torquatus was unimpressed the future of the empire is no game verrens he snapped perhaps the emperor did not impress upon you enough the seriousness of your commission it would take but a stroke of the stylus and you would be no more hero of rome valerius allowed himself a laugh if nero had wanted to get rid of him he wouldnt be standing in front of torquatuss desk he would be having a much more painful conversation in the torture chambers which existed somewhere beneath the hill that thought reinforced his decision to keep what hed discovered about lucina graecina and cornelius sulla to himself there were things he needed to know before he handed them over to torquatuss tender mercies he stared directly at rodan im told youve been searching for petrus for six months without any success is that why the emperor asked for me im sure your zeal cannot be questioned prefect but perhaps the competence of your investigators rodan let out a low growl an attack dog confronted by a rival torquatuss lips compressed into a thin smile so that is what you and seneca talked of i was curious my spies in his household had grown careless they have now been replaced a word of warning do not put your faith in a man whose time has passed gaius valerius verrens seneca will be too busy saving himself to worry about you however his voice changed and it was like hearing a snake speak sibilant and seductive but with the fangs barely concealed if you were to give your undivided loyalty to a man whose time has come you would not find him ungrateful do not look so surprised young man i am not blind i have recognized your talents just as the emperor has but like him i require proof of your devotion what proof the followers of christus are not the only threat to the emperor you are popular in the courts people tell you things perhaps they are occasionally indiscreet you want me to spy on my friends valerius struggled to keep a dangerous edge from his voice and what would be the reward for this service apart of course from your gratitude torquatus smiled we talked of a legion did we not a single word from me to your emperor would win gaius valerius verrens the scarlet cloak of a legate a year perhaps eighteen months a successful command in some profitable but not too arduous theatre of war then a place in the senate why not it is your birthright you would have your seat before you were thirty and with good fortune and the right friends your consulship when you come of age for it valerius relaxed and returned the smile torquatus offered him everything his father had ever dreamed of and more the consulship it was almost laughable the only thing he hadnt placed on the table was a promise to restore his right arm how like this man to overplay his hand if the offer had been genuine a legionary command would have been bribe enough you are too generous he said hoping torquatus was as immune to irony as he was to subtlety i will do what i can but finding the judaean is my first priority i hope you wont have cause to question my zeal again he turned to leave a word from torquatus stopped him valerius yes you are right not to be distracted from your investigation the others can wait for now the emperor is becoming impatient and my offer means nothing without progress in this matter of petrus i urge you not to take too much upon yourself you may call on rodan for what support you require he has already begun to bring together evidence that may assist you evidence what kind of evidence torquatuss tone was almost kindly but it sent a knife point running down valeriuss spine perhaps you should ask your father ask your father valerius left the palace with the words still ringing in his ears torquatus was trying to keep him off balance he understood that but was there anything more politically lucius despite painful experience was still a babe in arms his friendship and position as client to seneca also made him vulnerable the message was a threat but how great a threat olivia petrus and now his father how many more burdens must he carry he almost missed felix among the crowd loitering on the steps of the temple of jupiter stator the spaniard nodded to indicate that he was still being followed as valerius walked back towards the clivus scauri he struggled to work out his priorities he had to find a way to reach petrus the boy had predicted that if valerius sought the judaean petrus would eventually come to him but he couldnt depend on that he had two sources of leverage lucina and cornelius sulla it was a question of who was most likely to provide the information he needed and that was really no question at all the brothel stood at a crossroads in the valley between the caelian and esquiline hills it was one of romes more superior establishments with a pair of muscular watchmen at the door to ensure that the social status of the customers matched the aspirations of its owner the three men stood on the opposite side of the street hes been in there for more than an hour i dont know where these young fellows get the strength marcus grumbled serpentius muttered something from the darkness that made the old gladiator laugh oh theres always money for a good shag snake and this cornelius is obviously prepared to pay for the best valerius laughed with them but he wondered why cornelius sulla who had free access in neros palace to the greatest and most degenerate brothel in rome had need to visit somewhere like this true it was of the better class but with a word in the emperors ear cornelius could have any handsome boy beautiful slave girl or even senators wife who took his fancy the doorkeepers studied the three men suspiciously and valerius could hardly blame them streets around brothels tended to be haunted by robbers and he still wore the cloak and hood hed used to evade torquatuss followers it had been deceptively simple serpentius had accused one of the watchers of attempting to steal his purse and as the others were drawn into the brawl valerius had slipped away to join marcus when he wasnt busy fawning over the emperor cornelius spent a puzzling amount of time at the brothel and it had been no surprise when he turned up this evening valerius sweated copiously beneath the heavy wool of his cloak but he dared not remove it for fear of alerting his quarry for once the rich smell of cooking overwhelmed the usual rancid street scents and his stomach warned him he hadnt eaten since dawn the smell came from a nearby bar where a few regulars had gathered to drink the sour wine and complain about their wives the shouted conversations reminded him that he had only one more year of respectable bachelorhood left but who would want a onearmed cripple strange that fabias face should enter his mind she would have begun her career in a place like this and only a potent mix of beauty intelligence and charm had won her way out she was now more mistress than courtesan although mistress to a dozen men who paid for the privilege most of these women would end their career on the streets used up illtreated and available for the price of a cup of wine could he marry fabia he smiled at the absurdity of the thought in any case a man didnt marry for love he married for wealth or patronage he wondered what she would say if she knew he had linked her name with the word love would it draw some sawtoothed jibe or hes here marcus hissed valerius looked from under the hood to where cornelius sulla loitered by the door of the brothel his golden hair shining in the lamplight the aristocrat held a girl in his arms darkhaired she was blessed with heavylipped sensuous features and breasts that spilled from the front of her dress valerius watched as cornelius attempted to cover her up in a way that was almost brotherly the girl playfully knocked his hands away and bared herself all the more dusky nipples peeping from the folds of material there was nothing brotherly in the way they kissed long and passionate their hands searching each other until they parted breathless cornelius grinning inanely silly bastards in love with a tart marcus muttered who would have believed it eventually someone called the girl inside and cornelius was joined by two men who had been hidden in the shadows one burly and musclebound with a rolling walk that hinted at more time spent on a horse than on foot glared towards valerius and whispered something to the young knight cornelius threw them a dismissive glance and shook his head valerius gave the three men time to move off before he followed keeping pace a few yards behind he knew they were aware of his presence but that was how he wanted it after about a hundred paces they stopped and the two bodyguards drew a pair of lethallooking cudgels and moved protectively in front of the younger man valerius allowed his hood to fall back and cornelius stiffened as he recognized his follower in the flickering torchlight what do you want he demanded valerius lifted the seal on its gold chain so all three could see it this is imperial business he directed the words at the senior of the two guards your master will be safe with me walk on for twenty paces and he will join you in a few moments the men looked at each other then to cornelius who stared at the seal as if hypnotized twenty paces valerius repeated in the emperors name cornelius nodded one guards jaw came up as if he was about to argue but the second man pulled his sleeve and they walked reluctantly away when they were alone valerius directed cornelius towards the shadows at the side of the street but the younger man shrugged off his hand and glared furiously at him valerius decided hed seen friendlier cobras what do you want cornelius demanded again his eyes betrayed no concern because he was neros favourite and he intended to make valerius pay for this insult for his part valerius stared into the handsome face and knew the boys arrogance made any attempt at compromise pointless two days ago you met in secret with the lady lucina graecina you lie cornelius hissed but valerius ignored him in the horti sallustiani the lady was unaccompanied you were unaccompanied the lady reached the gardens first and waited fifteen minutes for your arrival you spoke with the lady for approximately two minutes before leaving by the same concealed door by which you entered corneliuss face shone like a pale orb in the torchlight his flesh took on the look of aged parchment and fear replaced the anger in his eyes i want to know the reason for the meeting and what was said valerius raised his left hand with the imperial seal in the emperors name i its not true the mother of a man the emperor ordered killed meets in secret with a member of the emperors court she she may survive because she is lucina graecina but what will happen to the emperors favourite cornelius sulla nero is not known for his mercy or his forgiveness a single word from me cornelius and you will be a dead man why did you meet her i cannot tell do what you must the boys voice shook but his tone betrayed a defiance that made valerius almost like him he wished there could be another way whether it is true or not he will believe you betrayed him have you seen a traitor die cornelius citizenship will not save you no merciful opening of the veins for you it will be the cross or the fire a slow death and a painful one could you bear it i cannot tell please a tear ran across the fine down of his cheek what was said valerius kept his voice hard cornelius bit his lips as if it was the only way he could stay silent you may be willing to die cornelius but is she the boys eyes flashed white as he realized she didnt mean lucina they will make you watch her die they will remove her beauty a little at a time for your pain and neros pleasure do not make me do it cornelius tell me and you will both live on my honour xvii lucina graecina waited alone in the centre of the garden where was he she hated unpunctuality bad enough that she must wait until he was certain they were alone but to be kept here for she took a deep breath and willed herself to be calm what was it petrus had said impatience is like anger any negative emotion impairs our ability to do gods work she smiled and the narrow pinched face was transformed they were doing gods work she looked towards the trees growing a few feet from the garden walls and the flowers in their beds beside the beaten earth of the path every colour and every shape unique all gods work another ten minutes passed and she retained her inner harmony apart from a single glance at the corner from where she knew he would come she had been dying until they found her or had she found them shrivelling inside like the desiccated occupant of a hundredyearold tomb her mind devoured by rage and thoughts and images of revenge against that man the man who had defiled and then destroyed her son five years locked away in the selfsought oblivion of mourning and never a moments joy then she had met him and he had reopened her eyes to life lady the wrong voice she whirled and speared the intruder with needletipped darts of contempt this is a private garden please leave at once she turned away her back reinforcing the message of her eyes but her heart thundered so she wondered it did not break free from her breast what could have happened the secret way was known only to a few not to this wellset young man with the stern features cornelius is not coming he was to bring me but he has disappeared along with the girl she felt her heart flutter girl what girl she must not faint she put all her strength into her voice i know of no cornelius i will not ask you to leave again perhaps you would like to call your servants im sure they would be interested in what i have to say more interested than i she huffed and turned for the gate i dont want you i wish to talk to petrus valerius persisted almost without realizing it she halted more names more mysteries you are familiar with mysteries i understand my lady lucina but not with riddles young man you waste my time and yours he shook his head you are a follower of the judaean mystic called christus you have taken part in rituals conducted by the man i seek you keep certain religious objects in your home which i will find if i use this authority to enter it he held up the seal and she caught the glint of gold in the corner of her eye enough to make a guess at its identity all this i had from cornelius along with the fact that he had lost contact with petrus and today you were to reveal where he could reach him she turned and her eyes narrowed dangerously a shecat cornered by hounds if you have harmed him you will be damned for all eternity as will your master valerius allowed himself a smile so you admit your complicity if not your guilt you mistake me lady i will keep cornelius from harm if i can find him and i admit to no master but myself you have his seal and you carry his stink i freely admit both my complicity and my guilt death holds no fears for me young man whatever horrors the act of dying comprises i will go to the afterlife willingly in the knowledge that i shall be content for all eternity in the company of those i love do what you will she walked away and he couldnt help admiring her she had fought him to a standstill and when he had placed the point of his sword at her breast she had disarmed him as easily as if he had been a child but he had one more question what does mcvii mean she stopped abruptly and turned to face him her eyes settled on the artificial wooden hand what is your name young man i am gaius valerius verrens then you must ask your father valerius spent the night tormented by irrational fears and tortured by dreams of wild beasts closing in from the darkness he woke drymouthed and with an unaccustomed feeling of helplessness when he set off for fidenae he left marcus with instructions to concentrate on the hunt for cornelius sulla cornelius had taken the girl from the brothel and vanished the morning after valerius had questioned him theyd searched his usual haunts without success and unless he had hidden away on the palatine where marcus and his men could not go it seemed that he had either taken refuge among the alleys of the subura or left rome altogether but valerius had concerns of his own he rode out of the city before dawn taking what precautions he could though he knew there was no guarantee that hed lost rodans watchers his mind was bowstring tight ask your father the same loaded suggestion from two entirely different and equally dangerous sources what did his father know about the christus cult and plots against caesar lucius had never been politically astute but he was no fool either apart from two or three letters which had probably never reached the emperor there was little likelihood that nero even knew his name but torquatus did and it seemed torquatus would use any lever to increase his hold on valerius ask your father he felt dread hovering over him like a thundercloud he left the road a mile short of the gate ensuring no hidden watcher would announce his arrival today his horse plotted its own way through the familiar hills until they met the track leading from the gateway to the house everything seemed normal but his mind sharpened with every clatter of the animals hooves when the villa came into view he reined in beside a clump of black poplars and sat for more than a minute watching and listening nothing out of the ordinary then why did he have this overwhelming sense of danger dismounting he led his horse into the nearest barn and tied it next to a pair of matched roans superior to anything his father had ever owned beside them stood an elaborately painted fourwheeled coach his suspicions growing he walked out into the sunshine and across the courtyard the door was closed but not barred and he entered silently immediately experiencing the intimacy of surroundings hed known since childhood each tessera of the mosaic floor was as familiar as when hed crawled across it as a child he was approaching the interior garden with its open roof and whitewashed columns when he heard the raised voices three men lay on couches around a stone table beside the central pool with his father furthest away facing the doorway despite his relaxed pose lucius gave the impression of being a reluctant member of the group he lay with his body pushed back as far as the couch would allow and with his cup clutched defensively to his chest his eyes darted between his two guests like a dog wondering which was going to hit him first the man to his right could have been the villas owner as he casually picked at grapes from the table he had dark hair that curled back from a wide brow and a neatly trimmed spade beard deepset obsidian eyes seemed to focus upon something interesting in the middle distance the third man had his back to valerius but his bulk and his posture made him unmistakable seneca the dark man turned to lucius with a tight smile it seems we have a new guest lucius looked up and his face froze when he recognized valerius seneca didnt even turn his head welcome my boy two visits within two weeks your filial devotion surprises even me come we are just going he raised himself from the couch with surprising ease for such a big man and turned with a smile as if he found the unwanted intrusion amusing a social call to discuss matters of mutual interest among neighbours he explained may i introduce my business acquaintance saul of tarsus the bearded mans eyes flicked a warning to seneca but the philosopher waved a languid hand we are among friends here he looked to valerius for confirmation discreet friends your work goes well the question was heavy with emphasis but the young roman decided to treat it as a social enquiry life in rome is always interesting as you know master seneca seneca laughed a good answer i taught you well valerius he turned to lucius i bid you good day you will bear in mind what we discussed lucius bowed saul of tarsus approached valerius he was an inch or two shorter than the roman and older than he first appeared something about him stirred a memory your father speaks well of you young man i wish you success in your every endeavour valerius nodded his thanks but when the two guests had left the impression he had of saul was of a prison pallor and an unmistakable prison scent in the silence that followed he realized that the traditional fatherson roles had become reversed lucius stared from the window refusing to meet his eyes and valerius felt a growing certainty that the older man had somehow placed them all at risk what games was he playing that had come to torquatuss notice where was the link between these men and lucina he tried to keep his voice steady but the words emerged roughedged as a saw blade you warned me only a few days ago that i should be wary of seneca why should i take your advice when you clearly cannot on another day his father would have snapped a rebuke but now he only waved a weary hand if a neighbour visits me am i to turn him from my door seneca does not make social visits who was the man with him saul of tarsus is a friend of senecas brother a good man and a roman citizen despite his birth a good man does not carry the stink of the jail on him lucius looked up sharply yes he has been in prison for his beliefs but he was spared to carry on his work valeriuss heart sank at the way lucius pronounced the word beliefs what are you doing to us he demanded dont you understand that you are putting olivia in danger is it not enough that you refuse to help her but you must drag her with you to the executioner i have done nothing i nothing two days ago the emperors praetorian prefect advised me to ask my father if i wanted to know how to get close to a man nero wants to see dead yesterday a woman who condemned herself by her own words said the same thing since then i have been asking myself what it could mean now i understand lucius shook his head soundlessly valerius made no attempt to keep the frustration from his voice i have been ordered by the emperor to seek out the leader of a religious sect accused of spreading sedition in rome they worship a criminal named christus who died on a cross thirty years ago a madman who believed he was the son of a god and could work miracles but you are already aware of that because you worship him too you know nothing of what you speak luciuss tone recovered some of its authority i am still the head of this family leave my house now what does mcvii mean go valerius shook his head tell me where to find petrus father tell me where they meet get out please for olivia if not for me please valerius leave me lucius slumped on the furthest couch i can tell you nothing valerius was suddenly overwhelmed by the same helplessness he felt when he sat by olivias bed he would learn nothing more here he made for the door you are a good man father but you do not understand the danger you are in take your own advice beware seneca and this man saul it wasnt until he reached the barn that he realized they were both caught in the same net he struggled to marshal his thoughts how had the world become this blur of contradictions it seemed impossible yet deep in his heart he had known it since lucina spoke those three fateful words in the garden lucius an intelligent man and a good roman had become a christusfollower he believed believed in a man who claimed to have walked upon water a crazed judaean rebel who thought he was the son of a god a god who must be worshipped exclusively and all other gods abandoned valerius remembered the comforting family routine of daily libations to the kitchen god the coin for the god of the crossroads when olivia married sacrifices to jupiter and minerva bacchus and mars on the appropriate days for the appropriate purposes good harvests good health sweet wine and sweet victory a roman should be surrounded by gods how could his father have changed so much you must not judge him too harshly the soft voice came from above and behind him ruth sat like a seriousfaced meadow sprite on a hillock of grass overlooking the road to his surprise he found he was glad to see her but he wondered how she had known to be there you have not had time to water your horse she rose to her feet and skipped down to a path that led through the trees come i will show you a place he hesitated puzzled at the change from their previous encounter but she smiled and he followed her out of curiosity and for other reasons he would have found difficult to explain the path was one he had used many times as a boy and he knew where it led she slowed to allow him to walk at her side he was lost but now he is found she said cryptically i dont understand he replied knowing as he said it that it wasnt quite true he found her presence disturbing it provoked a kind of asthmatic breathlessness he hadnt experienced for a long time she wore the same blue dress as the day in the olive grove it was loose and unflattering but the generous curves that lay beneath made themselves known in various subtle ways she really was quite beautiful smaller than valerius by a head but lithe and athletic her dark hair hanging long to her waist ruths skin glowed the colour of golden cinnamon and when she smiled her nose wrinkled like a little girls the next words she spoke were an admission of treason but she spoke them without fear in a way that made her very naive very trusting or very brave there is but one god and jesus is his son she said with simple faith when i came here lucius had nothing no family no friends no love he was empty we talked of our fears and i told him about my god who is a loving god and how i was never alone because i believed the talk of love reminded valerius that she belonged to his father he had me he has olivia you were lost to him she said it quietly making no accusation they came to the pool as he had known they would he tethered the horse to a tree with enough play on the reins to allow it to drink for a time there was nothing but silence and the song of the river they stood a little apart ruth was entirely at ease but valerius found himself trying to untangle the knot of conflicting feelings she awoke in him desire was one mixed up with the beginnings of a deep almost brotherly affection but it was not the strongest no the most powerful feeling she inspired in him was a sense of his own inadequacy she had an almost mystical quality a disturbing ability to reach deep into his soul when he was with her he felt ashamed of what he was and what he had done he wanted to tell her everything about nero torquatus and petrus maeve and cearan and the bloody field of colonia but somehow the words wouldnt come ruth saw his confusion but affected not to notice instead she continued her story one day we went to the city and he heard a man speak of goodness and love and of another man who sacrificed himself so that all men could be blessed with them the man came to us and spoke to your father i do not know what he said but your father wept and asked the man to pray for him the man was petrus yes petrus the healer he who was chosen by christus and made holy by him and was my father healed later he asked me to take him to meetings and after a time he took the blood and the body of christus then he was healed valerius felt his gorge rise as he remembered neros chilling warning about drinking the blood of children she saw his look and her face turned serious it is not what you think we only take watered wine and thin bread but god is pleased to consider it the blood and body of christus why are you telling me this you do not know me at all i may be your enemy and i am certainly a danger to you i need to find petrus and i must save my father from the enemies who will hurt him if they can your father has already been saved that is why i am telling you when you meet petrus you will be faced with a choice and only by understanding will you make the correct decision you think of us as the enemies of rome and your first instinct is to strike out against us but what are you defending rome against we seek only to spread the word of god and bring peace and harmony to all men jew and gentile is that so terrible rome can be a hard mistress for a man with a conscience and many a true roman has listened to the word of the true god and been converted he listened to her voice and imagined he heard the sound of another speaking was this some trick of petrus to win him over to the cause of christus yet there was an obvious transparency and honesty to ruth an inner quality he thought must be what men called goodness that convinced him she was sincere he still couldnt afford to trust her but surely he could afford to listen to her it seems i do not know my own father your father is a fine man when i came he was stern but now he knows peace you have been good to him valerius said i have been as a daughter to him she replied answering his unspoken question i dont understand i thought you hated me in the street after the boy spoke we are taught not to feel hatred she interrupted gently only love but i feared you would betray your father i was confused then i saw that you too were a good man beneath the armour you wear to protect yourself along the path god has chosen for you he opened his mouth to deny it but before he could speak she glanced across to where the fast water entered the pool i was baptized in a place like this but i was young and i have only a slight memory of it valerius frowned baptized it is not a word i know it is one of our rituals your father has not yet experienced it i do not truly understand its purpose only that to enter the kingdom of god one must have been first immersed in water and that to be baptized is to be saved jesus was baptized by john beneath a waterfall some say it is enough to pour water over the supplicants head but petrus believes that only by covering the entire body is the ceremony complete wherever he goes he seeks out a waterfall can you help me reach petrus she hesitated studying his face intently before coming to a decision i will do what i can but the final choice must be his she said when i receive word of our next meeting i will contact you she touched his hand and then she was gone the blue dress disappearing among the trees by the river valerius stood for the time it took to recognize the sensation that threatened to overwhelm him loneliness later on the road back to rome he was conscious of a curious mixture of elation and confusion he was lost but now he is found he understood now what she had meant by it but not in the way she meant it a miracle had happened hed found something he believed he had lost for ever but would he be allowed to keep it xviii neros invitation couldnt have been more inconvenient at best it would be an evening of excruciating performances by the emperor and his latest artist friends the braying actors and falsettovoiced singers who jostled each other to inform him how talented he was at worst well valerius would find out the memory of their last meeting was still fresh and the thought of the questing tongue and rank breath turned his stomach he had spent the last hour with fabia in a vain attempt to unravel the mystery of cornelius sullas disappearance and had looked forward to an evening at home the venue the circus caligula had built on the vatican meadows on the far side of the city could hardly be worse placed it made a theatrical or musical performance less likely but with nero it was impossible to tell the arena was mainly used for the horse and chariot races the emperor loved perhaps he was planning to hold a chariot race in the dark still no sign of cornelius or the girl marcus reported as valerius readied himself to leave dont worry theyll turn up cornelius will probably make an appearance at the entertainment tonight do you want us to watch your back he shook his head no i doubt rodan will get up to any mischief take the others to a tavern for the evening well meet tomorrow to decide what to do next he saw the scarred gladiator hesitate what is it marcus shrugged serpentius has offered to stay in the house to make sure your sister is safe thats good of him he can find a bed in the slave quarters thats what hes planning only i think hes become a bit sweet on that girl of yours a pretty little piece valerius smiled hell find julia is a little piece with sharp claws if he tries anything on with her she knows her own mind the snake might have his tail chopped off but i still think it will do no harm to have a man like serpentius about the house he sent a servant to check if his chair had arrived and walked through to olivias room julia sat by the bed where his sister lay as pale as any ghost the girl gasped when she saw the tall figure silhouetted in the doorway im sorry i scared you he said reassuringly i came to tell you that serpentius will be staying tonight to guard you both he may look an intimidating character but he has a good heart she nodded i like him he makes me giggle but i sense a darkness in him he is almost as frightening as you frightening he almost laughed at the thought before he realized how true it was in many ways hed become as stern as his father all the lightness driven from him by his experiences in britain and the strains of olivias illness you have no reason to be afraid of me julia i wanted to tell you im glad you have i promise to change no i dont mean that i mean about your father the room seemed to go very still outside beyond the shuttered windows he could hear the sound of voices and knew the chair had arrived but he ignored it what about my father he made me promise not to say anything when you asked me if we had visitors i lied he has been coming to sit with olivia once or twice each week since she became ill i wanted to tell you but valerius placed his hand on her shoulder and turned her face to him he brushed the tears from her cheek with his fingers poor julia caught between two horrible frightening men no wonder youve been so sad lately and poor father so determined not to appear weak that he couldnt allow the people he loved to know how much he cared for them i have to go now look after olivia for me he bent down and kissed her on the forehead four slaves carried the chair and made good time through the centre of the city and across the pons vaticanus to the west bank of the tiber trees lined the pathway from the bridge to the circus and among them men stacked wood for the bonfires that would light the guests home at the end of the night to his right he passed the curious meta romuli the narrow pyramid that marked where romulus was said to be buried ahead loomed the walls of the circus which was grander but not greater than the mighty maximus on the other side of rome the chair men set him down and he arranged to be picked up by the bridge at the second hour after dark when neros invitation stipulated the evening would end an imperial aide conducted him along a narrow tiled corridor to the far end of the circus other guests were arriving but not as many as he would have expected for an event like this it was obviously to be a select gathering and he wondered again why hed been invited he noted three former consuls and any number of senators and their wives most of whom were pleased to look down their noses at him but a few recognized him as a hero of rome and he exchanged bows with the elegant patrician laecanius bassus who had just taken over the consulship from his deadly rival regulus eventually a crowd of close to a hundred gathered in the grand hall which opened out on to the imperial and senatorial boxes valerius accepted a cup of wine and retired to a corner where he wouldnt need to make polite conversation with people he didnt know hed been standing there for a few minutes when he detected a sweet scent in the air and felt a malevolent presence at his side im surprised you are not showing off your trophy my hero surely this would be just the occasion to impress people with the gold crown of valour rodan wore a broad smile and made no attempt to disguise the mockery in his voice his ego never buried too deep was as inflated as a startled puffer fish rodan was pleased with himself and that didnt bode well for someone valerius ignored him and rodan nodded absently the emperor and lord torquatus are grateful for your efforts a simple statement which contained no overt threat so why did it carry the chill of a dagger point rattling across a skeletons ribs before valerius could react a fanfare sounded and nero in a toga of imperial purple and with a gold laurel wreath clinging to his sparse hair descended the broad staircase with poppaea augusta at his side he smiled benevolently at all around him but his wifes face displayed nothing but coldness and indifference she might have been walking through an empty corridor for all the attention she paid to her surroundings valerius knew fabia enjoyed poppaeas company but he felt an instinctive dislike for the emperors wife she created a barrier around herself that was as impenetrable as a legionary testudo and her eyes hinted at a capacity for petty cruelty she glanced towards him and he noted a flash of recognition before the emotionless mask returned suddenly the room felt a much more dangerous place servants appeared with golden platters of food and the aristocrats fell like carrion birds on dishes of roasted song thrush delicately fried tongue of lark and flamingo and whitefleshed moray eel as the wine flowed the atmosphere became more intense and expectant and the chamber filled with heat and noise valerius slipped away from rodan and found his senses swamped by a sea of scarlet faces bulging intense eyes and ceaseless selfimportant conversation he allowed his mind to return to the pool with ruth and it was a few moments before he realized the room had gone quiet and nero was speaking he was talking about christus the weak and the gullible follow a charlatan cast out by his own people the socalled son of god brought to earth a common criminal tried and found guilty under roman law at the instigation of a judaean council too timid to bring him to justice themselves and now they are among us yes perhaps even among us here burrowing into the very foundations of the empire like rockworms eating away at the stones upon which rome is built these followers of the man christus would tear down our temples and cast out our gods but i will not allow it they believe they are hidden from us but our eyes are upon them the man they revere claimed he could perform miracles and they believed him he promised them eternal life but to achieve this eternal life they must first be willing to experience death i rule rome and i not this christus will grant them their wish at his final words the great doors at the far end of the room were thrown open and nero and poppaea led the way out to the viewing platform which looked along the length of the circus valerius held back but rodan appeared beside him and took his arm oh no my hero he said cheerfully the emperor has ordered a special place set aside for you think of this as a lesson as much as an entertainment reluctantly valerius allowed himself to be led to the front of the great curved balcony that dominated the western end of the arena the soft ethereal haze that heralded dusk was settling over the city but it would not be dark for another hour ahead of him the circus stretched away for five hundred paces a narrow oval of hardpacked sand split by a central spine with a turning post at each end and an enormous carved stone obelisk in the centre to his right was the lavish imperial box where nero whispered into poppaeas ear away to his left were the seven bronzed dolphins of the lap counter tiered stands overlooked every yard of the circuit and the track on either side of the spine appeared so narrow it was difficult to imagine four and sixhorse chariot teams overtaking each other but valerius had seen the reds and the greens matched wheel to wheel at the corner today the spectators were to be treated to a different spectacle the near end of the circus between the closest turning post and the curved platform had been turned into a separate arena by a twelvefoot fence of metal bars as he watched praetorian guards herded a huddle of terrified prisoners into the centre of the open space there must have been close to twenty of them more men than women only six or seven of them are followers of the judaean rodan whispered the rest are condemned criminals but it is the example that matters dont you think do you see anyone you recognize valerius froze what did he mean he frantically studied the men and women but they were massed so close together it was difficult to identify individuals then he caught sight of a hank of silver hair and a slim familiar figure he half rose but a sharp prick at his ribs stopped him he looked down to find rodan holding a small dagger hed taken from the folds of his tunic no heroics today we have more work to do you and i valerius knew rodan wouldnt dare kill him without neros sanction and he was ready to leap on to the sand to his fathers rescue but when he looked again he had a clearer view of the silverhaired man it wasnt lucius but a much older person rodan grinned at him and he reluctantly resumed his place beside the praetorian his heart numb with dread nero stood to address the captives his querulous tones ringing around the empty circus you worship one god to the exclusion of all others where is your god today let him show me a single sign that he loves you and i will spare every one of you he paused studying the sky like a bad actor in a greek tragedy you see there is no sign and there will be none because your god only exists in your own minds which have been warped by those who lead you the man you follow claimed to be the son of that false god but he was a mere deceiver who dazzled simple country dwellers with crude conjuring tricks he rebelled against rome and was a traitor to his own people he promised to save you yet he could not even save himself he offered you eternal life and you believed him he waved his hand with a flourish and a door swung open in the opposite side of the arena his plump perspiring face hardened and valerius had never seen anything so pitiless i grant you your wish a lion roared a thundering growl that seemed to shake the very stones of the circus and was quickly joined by the throattearing cough of a leopard the beasts five lions and two of the spotted cats must have been starved for days because they didnt hesitate as they burst into the light towards the little group huddled in the centre a collective cry that tore valeriuss heart rose from the captives and now the herd instinct that had held them together was broken by sheer terror they splintered in every direction a few sinking to the ground and raising their arms in supplication but most fleeing in mindless panic pleading for mercy they knew would not be forthcoming the old man valerius had mistaken for his father died on his knees as a lioness tore his screaming head from his shoulders with a single twist of her enormous jaws blood sprayed bright across the sand a muscular giant with a red face and heatscarred arms faced up to a charging leopard his features set in a determined scowl but even a blacksmiths strength counted for nothing against a big cats power he went down under her weight and her rear legs stripped out his guts in a dozen frenzied sweeps as he howled in disbelief at the outrage done to his body the wild beasts killed and killed again and the surviving prisoners clawed at the walls and the bars all except one corneliuss girl the darkhaired figure hadnt been visible among the huddle of prisoners but now valerius saw her running for her life crying out for the laughing guards to take the clothwrapped bundle she held in her arms a few paces away a lioness tracked her progress the glowing yellow eyes never leaving her prey the girl knew she was doomed but she refused to give up she ran on round the inner wall until some instinct brought her to the point where valerius now stood hard against the balcony helplessly she looked up at him much too young the face he recognized from the brothel turned ugly by fear among the cries of ecstasy and gasps of horror around him he heard her shouted plea please sir take my baby if not me at least save my child terror made her voice brittle and the words came out in a rush with shaking hands she held the tiny bundle high so valerius could see the small dark eyes and pink grizzling features please the big cat covered the ground in three enormous bounds but the girl was driven by the speed of despair in the very moment the lioness struck she launched the baby upwards with every ounce of her remaining strength valerius saw it come a featureless mass the swaddling wrap fluttering loosely around it the girls dying screams filled his ears as he stretched as far as he could reach with his left hand he felt his fingers close on the coarse brown cloth and for a single heartbeat the babys weight was in his control relief washed through him as he drew the bundle towards the wall but he had reckoned without the bloodhungry gods of the arena and they would not be denied slowly the blanket began to unravel uncoiling one relentless fold at a time from the dolllike figure it protected frantically he reached out with his other hand but the lifeless wooden fist could find no grip on the childs arm a voice screamed inside his head as the soft thud of the childs body on the sand was instantly followed by the snarls of two cats fighting over a morsel of prey for a few seconds his world went dark but soon something nameless and terrible swelled inside him he had never known such anger or such despair a killing rage that was born in his lower body and rose up ready to erupt into suicidal violence still holding the blanket he turned back towards rodan the praetorian held the knife protectively in front of him but fear marked his ruined face harm me and your father dies the centurion cried he dies valerius knew he could kill rodan with a single blow but what was the point when the man truly responsible was sitting a few paces away your time will come rodan and when it does i hope it is my sword that sends you across the styx he turned towards where nero sat his jewelled fingers hooked on to the balcony as he leaned forward to savour every moment of the agony below a dozen black guards separated valerius from his target and every eye was on him he knew that to take a single step in the emperors direction was to commit suicide the killing urge subsided the fleeting moment gone as he walked to the stairs his gaze met poppaeas he expected to see contempt even triumph but instead she stared hard into his eyes and there seemed no mistaking the message she passed he hesitated unsure whether he understood before walking out of the circus into the clean air and the silence they stopped him in the long passageway to the entrance and took him to a room with bare walls which might have been a cell but for the scent of the hay that had been stored there valerius sat with his back to the cold stone and worked the coarse wool of the childs blanket through his hands he had promised cornelius sulla he would protect them but the girl and her baby had died because of him nothing on earth would persuade him to deliver cornelius or lucina to torquatus now even if they killed him for it the thought steadied him he felt no fear but the awfulness of what he had just witnessed had numbed his mind so he had no control over the visions that flew through it savagery in war he could understand terror and selfpreservation made soldiers kill without mercy and constant proximity to death often led to mindless cruelty two men fighting for their lives in the arena had a certain dignity even honour but to feed helpless men and women to wild animals and relish the spectacle seemed to him the lowest kind of barbarism worse even than the druids who threw roman prisoners into the blazing heart of the wicker man they at least had the mitigation of hatred the excuse of religion however perverted he saw again the frown of concentration on the girls face as she ignored her own fate in that last futile attempt to save her infant felt the cloth unwrap one fold at a time as the child fell away from him towards the sand it is not easy to be a defender of rome the softly spoken words came from the darkness you think us cruel you are mistaken it is not a matter of cruelty but of duty we would betray the empire if we did not do what was necessary to counter this threat to our people a cruel man might have exterminated every judaean in rome man woman and child but we did not instead we tasked our loyal hero of rome gaius valerius verrens to seek out the leaders and the followers the job is part done and for that we are grateful to him valerius shook his head was he dreaming the child it was not our intention to harm the child the person who failed in his duty has been dealt with your work is not finished come nero emerged into the light accompanied by his guards valerius raised himself to his feet and automatically fell in by his side as they walked he marvelled at the change in the man the nero of a few minutes earlier might never have existed which was the actor the nero of the arena or the nero of now or were there many neros hidden behind that single mask here was no capricious despot but a ruler reacting to a threat against his people reasoned words spoken in honeyed tones crime must be punished disobedience must be deterred the greater the danger the more extreme the example that must be made rome would accept the worship of alien gods but not to the exclusion of romes gods when he spoke of the paradox of power valerius might have been speaking to seneca when he spoke of his hopes for rome he might have been speaking to himself it made what was to come all the more shocking they had just reached the path back to the bridge when the first fire was lit and the screaming began the victim had been tethered to a wooden stake and coated with gleaming black pitch from head to foot in seconds all that was visible was a writhing column of flame with a tortured spectre at its centre emitting a sound no human had been born to make valerius steeled himself against the horror knowing this was merely another part of the emperors sadistic game but he could not prevent himself from flinching as the first pyre was joined by another then another until ten of the ghastly pillars lit the way the flames burned red then gold then red again as the fire consumed the final remnants of the human form then they came to cornelius neros executioners had left cornelius sullas face and head clear of the pitch so valerius instantly recognized the handsome features and golden hair bruises marked his flesh and blood flowed scarlet on to the shining black tar on his chest where he had bitten through his lip in his terror the slight youthful body shook uncontrollably in its bonds and he kept his eyes tight shut valerius thought he saw the aristocrats lips move and he asked the gods he didnt believe in to grant a merciful end to the young man he and he only had placed on this stake nero moved closer so he could study the bound figure he was braver than he seemed he uttered only a single name when put to the question and he must have understood that name was already known to us he nodded to an unseen presence in the darkness and a torch flared close to corneliuss feet for a moment nothing appeared to happen before with a soft sputtering roar an inferno engulfed the tethered body valerius saw corneliuss face twist and contort in the heat and the long golden hair was transformed instantly into a halo of golden flame at last the clenched teeth parted and his dying screams tortured the night he makes a better candle than a friend dont you think nero said almost absently he turned so valerius could see the flames reflected in his eyes cornelius sulla has a brother publius torquatus will give you instructions where to find him you will bring him to us he nodded and was gone leaving valerius to stare at a blackened skull with startling white teeth and burning eyes that were still alive xix forget cornelius sulla hes no longer our affair marcus looked up startled but the raw edge to valeriuss voice barred any further questions can serpentius and heracles ride the old gladiator eyed him suspiciously of course were all trained to fight on horseback as well as we do on foot i want you to use the emperors seal to purchase three horses preferably cavalry trained and two pack mules well need them in three days are we going to fight a war i hope not but we are going to join a legion marcus laughed in disbelief which legion the seventh a week later they stood on the dock at aternum as the horses were loaded on to the merchant ship on which valerius had arranged passage to dalmatia sextus and felix remained in rome to watch lucina graecina cornelius sullas death made it less likely she would provide them with a link to petrus but with so few leads valerius couldnt afford to ignore the possibility the fourday ride over italias mountainous spine had saved them at least another weeks sailing and had the added bonus of accustoming them to the saddle which would be vital for what awaited them on the other side of the mare adriaticum why is publius sulla so important the question was from marcus and valeriuss reply had been simple because he is the next link in the chain but nothing in the clandestine world he now inhabited was so straightforward the truth was that cornelius had revealed under torture that his brother was an even more important figure in petruss organization than cornelius himself publius sulla is building a network of christus followers in the legions torquatus had grudgingly revealed if he succeeds it will provide them with a platform to combine a military attack on rome with a rising in the city itself their numbers may be small but the one thing we have learned is that this cancer spreads quickly it is possible that he has already involved the general of a legion if so we need to discover who this traitor is and destroy him that is why it is so important to reach publius sulla and return him to rome why not get the commander of the seventh to arrest him it would be much easier torquatus had tried to avoid the question but valerius persisted very well general vitellius has the emperors confidence but we must be certain a legions loyalty and its control lie in the hands of a few senior officers if we are wrong it could bring the traitors out into the open before we are ready to act that would weaken the frontier and worse open up the possibility that other disaffected or ambitious commanders might join the rebels you have romes future in your hands and your own do not mistake me verrens this is a test of your allegiance as well as your ability marcus and the men accepted their new role without complaint but valerius kept his next surprise until just before they boarded the ship you are now honorary members of the praetorian guard he made the announcement in the dockside tavern where they were waiting serpentius looked horrified when valerius produced the black tunics silverplated chest armour and helmets he had requisitioned from the praetorian barracks but heracles the musclebound youngster who had tracked lucina grinned with anticipation the tunics and helmets should do well enough and if the breastplates dont fit well get the armourer of the seventh to alter them as they waited to board serpentius fiddled with his helmet strap valerius doubted the spaniard would ever look comfortable in a roman uniform he explained again why it was so important to wear the armour you have to understand what it is to be part of a legion the seventh claudia pia fidelis is one of the elite units of the roman army it fought with julius caesar in the gallic wars a century ago and won its title putting down the scribonianus rebellion to keep claudius in power its men are fighting soldiers whove just moved from their base on the rhenus to viminacium right up on the dacian border they wont welcome anyone who looks like a ration thief and a nosy civilian investigating one of their officers could end up having an unhappy accident but if hes a praetorian tribune with an escort of toughlooking veterans hes at least going to have their respect the voyage took them three days and nights and if any sea journey with all its attendant threat of shipwreck mishap or monster could be described as pleasant this one was balmy winds lightly ruffled the wave tops and the only sounds were the occasional barked command the gentle rush of the waters beneath the bow and the rhythmic creak of ropes and timbers that is the heartbeat of a ship on the morning of the fourth day the captain shook valerius awake and he rose to find a greygreen strip on the far horizon land the seaman explained were a little north of where we ought to be but with these winds we should make port at acruvium before noon two hours later they were sailing directly towards what looked like a continuous stretch of unwelcoming mountainous coastline just as valerius was doubting the captains sanity they turned into the hidden entrance to a broad inlet which narrowed widened then narrowed again before opening into a curiously shaped bay with a small harbour at the southern end a circle of rugged peaks loomed over them like the walls of a gigantic prison cell and valerius noticed his companions warily eyeing the mountains serpentius whose tribe inhabited the inhospitable hills of northern hispania met his eye hard just like home takes hard people to live in a place like this hard as the rocks they know how to survive and they know how to kill and they know how to hate why would you romans want a place where they sleep in the snow and learn to chew stones before they learn to speak because of what lies beyond it valerius explained patiently since caesars time the barbarian tribes have been moving westwards increasing the pressure on those who already hold the lands along the danuvius and the rhenus the empire doesnt have enough legions to contain such a huge migration of peoples so she uses what she has rivers and mountains to hold the danuvius rome must first hold dalmatia pannonia and moesia thats why we want a place like this serpentius spat what did he care for romes ambitions acruvium turned out to be a small anchorage which was one of the few sheltered landing points on a hundred miles of coast valerius presented his travel warrant to the port prefect and requested an escort the officer laughed when he read their destination he was one of the young men rome always sent to her far frontiers polite educated capable and expendable if he lived a fine career awaited him when he returned home if he didnt only his family would mourn him i have two clerks and a dozen thracian auxiliaries who are good for stopping bar fights i can give you one of them to guide you as far as doclea but my advice would be to wait here for the next ship back to italia and get on it viminacium is six days east of here if you happen to be a bird but youre not birds and that means at least twelve days along the river valleys through the mountains which is the only way to get anywhere in dalmatia first south then east baked by the sun during the day chilled to the bone at night and thats if fortuna smiles on you and if she doesnt if she doesnt youll end up dead or worse not dead among the cruellest people on this earth see those two over there valerius followed his glance to a pair of squat hawkfaced villains seated on boulders near the landing place the men had the watchful intensity of hungry vultures and wore their dark oily hair in braids their outer clothing was fashioned from partcured goatskin that valerius could smell from twenty paces away illyrian bandits the young man explained but then everyone around here is a bandit when hes not trying to scrape a living from soil thats an inch deep and only grows rocks theyve seen your armour and your horses and they reckon they could barter them to their chief for enough provisions to feed their families for a year that makes you worth a risk but then again they would probably have a slap at you just for fun their favourite method of passing the time with a prisoner is to flay him alive an inch at a time and then impale him on the branch of a thorn tree valerius shrugged hed heard such tales before why dont you kill them we do the port prefect smiled wearily weve been killing them for a hundred years the only problem is you cant kill them all they left before sunrise after a night in the prefects quarters with their swords never far from their sides the narrow mountain tracks confirmed their hosts information and they moved cautiously at one point their guide stopped and studied a narrow gully ahead his eyes scanning the rocks and scrubby bushes without a word he turned and they rode two miles back to where another poor road branched off rejoining the main track an hour later they reached doclea just before nightfall a substantial and surprisingly sophisticated city laid out on roman lines cupped in a broad bowl in the mountains near an enormous lake which provided the local people with their main diet of fish this time the administrator was a harassed older man who answered to the legate at burnum a hundred and eighty long miles to the north and valerius was forced to show the seal before he agreed to provide an escort but only as far as naissus thats where the traders gather to carry their goods up to the market at viminacium youll be able to join a convoy there they believe in strength in numbers they crossed the border into moesia superior the next day but no one noticed the difference the mountains still crushed down on them with all their dangerous intimidating beauty a cursed grandeur that could kill you even as you admired it occasionally they would hear the sound of muted thunder and see the dust cloud over some distant valley that marked an avalanche or the ground beneath their feet would tremble and valerius would make the sign against evil in the knowledge that in this godsforsaken place hades could not be far below when they joined the convoy at naissus and took the river road east he relaxed for the first time here they were surrounded by men who knew their business as well as any legionary mercenaries former auxiliaries contracted by the rich merchants who had organized the caravan hed seen men like these before scythians with long curved swords thracian mounted archers who lived in the saddle and could put an arrow through your eye at fifty paces tough little raetian spearmen with constitutions like camels and legs that would march forty miles in a day more exotic still was a group of strange goldhaired bearded men from some chilly northern land carrying lethal doubleheaded axes they wore a motley collection of uniforms or partuniforms that appeared to represent half a dozen countries and fifteen or twenty different units plumed and spiked helmets exotic fishscale shirts or armour made of padded cloth they looked tough and uncompromising the merchants kept their goods covered partly to avoid attracting the bandits who watched with greedy eyes from the hills and partly to avoid tempting the escort who had been known to cut a few throats and run off with some particularly rich cargo at first merchants and escort alike suspiciously eyed the black tunics and silver breastplates that marked them as members of the emperors elite but gradually the barriers fell as they mixed around the campfires as honest travellers do and tested their languages against each other of them all serpentius was most at home among the escort exercising with them in the cool of the morning and testing the legionary gladius against the curved swords of the scythians or hefting the heavy axes of the northern giants you would have done well as an auxiliary serpentius valerius advised him as they rode side by side at the head of the convoy in the dusty heat of the afternoon you could still you are young enough twentyfive years and a pension and roman citizenship at the end of it the spaniards look darkened i am an honoured member of my tribe even now though i am a slave the romans killed my family why would i wish to fight for rome and become a roman sometimes it is more sensible to put the past behind you than to allow it to control you as long as i have the emperors seal i can arrange it there is no need to die in the arena serpentius solemnly lifted his bald head and the dark eyes glittered serpentius alone chooses where he lives and where he dies his face broke into a grin wasnt it you who told me i could die in my own time he whipped up his horse and rode on to range ahead of the column but almost in the same instant whirled and screamed at valerius ambush valerius used his knees to turn his horse towards the column about two hundred paces back down the rough dirt track the reins were wrapped around the wooden fist of his right hand and with his left he drew his sword arrows zipped past his head and he ducked low in the saddle as he frantically scanned the roadside for threats a running figure armed with a long wooden spear came at him from his right and he swerved to avoid the point as it sought out his mounts undefended flank the manoeuvre brought him close to a raised bank on the opposite side of the track and he heard serpentius shout a warning too late a second ambusher launched himself from the top of the mound and smashed him from the saddle valerius landed with a sickening crash that knocked the wind from him and rattled the helmet from his head he was stunned by the impact but his years of training took over for most military tribunes service in the legions was merely a step towards a career in politics they stayed six months making themselves useful or not and if they didnt die in some brigantean forest or german swamp they went home but not valerius he had discovered to his own surprise as much as anyones that he was a true warrior a natural soldier who enjoyed the challenges of campaigning and could kill without hesitation or conscience two years in britain and the boudiccan rebellion had taught him to survive he rolled away from the threat and came to his feet in a single movement crouching to meet his attacker with his sword held low ready to stab at guts or groin this wasnt the battle line it was gutter fighting but valerius knew all about gutter fighting it was about doing whatever it took to win he noticed with only mild surprise that his opponent was one of the illyrians who had been waiting at the dock in acruvium dark and feral the bandit held a long curved knife hed be fast and hed be confident a scuffling from behind alerted valerius to a new danger and he half turned to find the spearman fifteen paces away and running towards him the spear held no fears for the roman but the man with the long knife was an added complication by now valeriuss horse had struggled to its feet and he backed away placing the frightened animal between himself and the enemy who had knocked him from the saddle the move won him vital seconds and he advanced on the spearman to provoke an attack the illyrians face broke into savage grin and he thrust the point at valeriuss throat which was what the roman had counted upon he stepped towards the point angling to his left and used the walnut fist of his right hand to parry the blow the spearman had been forced to aim high because of the breastplate protecting valeriuss chest and stomach and it allowed the roman to knock the point clear of his right shoulder at the same time he spun down the length of the spear shaft slicing the gladius edge into his enemys skull the shock surged up his arm as the iron blade met solid bone and a smear of crimson stained the air his opponent dropped like a stone but he had no time to celebrate victory the spin brought him face to face with his other foe who by now had worked his way round the horse and was preparing to plunge the knife into his back the sight of the bloody gladius made him pause but he jabbed the bluegreen blade at valeriuss eyes as he sought the weakness that would give him an advantage he had to get close but the romans skill with the short sword kept him just out of range for a decisive thrust the illyrian danced right and left seeking an opening and valerius was reminded of his bout with serpentius dont fight like a onehanded man or a twohanded man fight like a killer marcuss words made him smile the assassin saw the grin and for the first time he felt doubt hed seen what had happened to his companion but that only meant the spoils would be all the greater all he had to do was kill as he had killed many times before the smile made it different the smile meant he faced a man who wasnt cowed by his speed and who would meet his aggression with aggression the smile meant he needed a way out but valerius wasnt going to give him a way out fight like a killer he used his own speed and the lefthanded sword to keep his opponent off balance always looking for the opening he saw the wild eyes flick to the left as a scream told him serpentius too was keeping his attackers busy the illyrian was ready to run when valerius gave him his opportunity a slight stumble left his right side open to the knife the blade flicked out like a vipers strike but the roman met it with his wooden hand designed to hold a shield it was shaped like a partially closed fist and now the fist caught the knife blade and twisted in the same movement a normal hand would have been cut to the bone but this was no normal hand the seasoned walnut bent the inferior iron of the knife and trapped it in its grip the illyrian frantically tried to tug the blade free even as valerius drove the gladius deep into his body the point entered below the breast bone and the force of it drove a grunt of agony from the assassins throat still he kept his grip on the dagger only when valerius twisted the short sword free and the blood spurted from the terrible wound in his abdomen did the dying man collapse to his knees valerius turned to find serpentius calmly leading his horse towards him his sword bloody to the hilt a dozen men came running from the direction of the convoy the illyrian spearmans heels still twitched in the dust and someone cut his throat as valeriuss horse snickered nervously over his body the other man rocked back and forth on his knees his dark head bowed over his chest and his hands attempting vainly to hold in his insides as valerius watched he vomited a fountain of dark heart blood and rolled slowly forward on to his face two riders appeared from beyond the bank where the ambushers had struck and threw a filthy ragged bundle at valeriuss feet a boy of about ten who immediately began pleading in a language the roman couldnt understand the scythian veteran commanding the escort spat on the sprawled youth he snarled an order to the two men and followed them as they dragged the boy away valerius tried not to hear the screams a few minutes later the scythian returned he was holding the ponies back there and would have had his share of this he tossed a leather bag to valerius who caught it in his good hand silver enough to make them lords of these hills who paid them and why he said he did not know who these people learn to lie with their first breath but i doubt this one lied he claimed it was a roman who gave them the order and the silver and they all look the same to him as to why it is simple they were to kill the officer with the missing hand they have followed us for a week to ensure they had the right man the cargo was of no interest to them my roman friend only you xx strabo the greek geographer wrote that the inhabitants of upper illyricum now moesia created caves beneath their dung heaps and lived in them but valerius saw without surprise that the seventh legion claudia pia fidelis had made itself much more comfortable at viminacium in a short space of time on a rise above the meeting place of the danuvius and one of its larger tributaries the soldiers had demolished a town of mud huts and replaced it with a fortress that made him feel almost as if he was coming home he could have been approaching colonia glevum or londinium or any of the great military encampments in the empire inside the deep triple ditches and the palisade lay the principia the administrative heart of the legion surrounded by the long lines of wooden barrack blocks and beyond it the workshops marked by the smoke from their glowing braziers the stables and the supply area legionaries patrolled the walls and a cavalry wing exercised in a separate annex on the east side on a flat piece of ground to the north of the fort merchants from the surrounding area had created a great market and below was the reason for it in the mouth of the smaller river the seventh had built a new harbour and from here trim oared galleys of the roman navy patrolled to north and south guarding convoys of supplies for the legions and trade goods from the east and south on their way to noricum raetia and eventually italia but the most astonishing thing at viminacium was not the fort or the naval base but the bridge downstream from the fortress legionary engineers had built a slender wooden crossing over the danuvius that must have stretched half a mile across the rivers narrowest point each end of the bridge was guarded by a section of bricktunicked soldiers and valerius noticed that on the far side a crowd had gathered waiting for permission to cross marcus serpentius and heracles rode up from the rear of the convoy with the pack mules dust had stained their tunics grey and dulled their armour and valerius insisted they stop for a few minutes to beat the worst of the dirt from their clothing and polish breastplates and helmets no amount of cleaning could wipe away the weariness that etched their faces four days earlier the perpetual dangerous mountains had given way to endless plains with barely a landmark to break the horizon since then the monotony had worn down man and beast alike inducing a hypnotic heavyeyed exhaustion that even sleep could not conquer it was as if the very land was fighting them and valerius had never been more relieved to complete a journey as he said his farewells to the leader of the caravan marcus nodded towards the fort where a group of riders had just emerged from the gateway the natives dont look too friendly they trotted up the slope to meet them your name valerius inspected the unsmiling young auxiliary prefect and suppressed an urge to tip him from his saddle into the dust not only was a praetorian entitled to the respect his position demanded he outranked the man and it was customary for officers to exchange names and pleasantries he looked over the cavalry officers shoulder towards the fort where he had no doubt keen eyes were watching the outcome of the confrontation someone was sending him a message i asked you your name this time the question was more brusque almost an order my name is not your concern but your legates valeriuss tone might have been reprimanding a recruit on his first patrol and he saw the first seeds of doubt in the prefects eyes it is enough for you to know that i am a tribune of the praetorian guard and that i am on imperial business my men and i have travelled from acruvium and i will require accommodation and rations for at least one week see to it that this is done the young officer frowned his horse caught his uncertainty and jerked beneath him so he had to haul back on the reins to control it i are you questioning my orders prefect valerius snapped impatiently perhaps it is you who should give me your name i doubt the legate will be pleased to discover that the emperors personal representative has been obstructed from doing his duty the officer swallowed hard and saluted i apologize sir flavius genialis prefect of the second tungrian wing at your service we have had trouble with spies and dacian infiltrators valerius heard serpentius snort at the lame excuse and suppressed a smile of his own i doubt many of them were wearing praetorian uniforms prefect he urged his horse up the shallow slope and his grinning companions followed inside the fort a servant ushered them to the officers mansio the temporary accommodation for senior guests flavius had wanted to billet marcus and his companions with the legions other ranks but valerius insisted they stay together you think therell be trouble marcus asked when the prefect had left them alone were as welcome as a turd in a punch bowl but i doubt theyd try anything here not with us being the emperors personal representatives an all valerius grinned lets just say that after all the time weve spent together id miss your company he washed and donned a clean tunic this was an encounter hed anticipated but hed heard so many differing views of the man he was about to meet that he was uncertain of the outcome serpentius gave valeriuss sword a final polish and handed it to him he replaced it in the scabbard on his right hip lets hope i dont need it gaius valerius verrens tribune of the guard the aide announced his presence to the commander of the seventh legion valerius saluted the man standing at the far side of the room by rights aulus vitellius should have been leading an army not a single legion he had no record as a military commander but that had never been an impediment to a military career a decade and a half ago he had been consul and a favourite of emperor claudius under nero his fortunes had first thrived then waned and now it was said were about to thrive again in his midforties his handsome features had a florid slightly pasty look as if they had been modelled from damp clay and he wore his hair brushed forward over a wide forehead to cover the growing expanse of bare scalp his enemies said he was a drunkard who never held a thought long enough to make a rational decision his friends said he was a misunderstood genius who would one day sit at the emperors right hand as valerius stood to attention the general studied him with a hint of amusement in the light blue eyes i had expected you to be older the voice was deep the accent cultured perhaps exaggerated to counter the detractors who said his family came from rough plebeian origins a year ago seneca talked of you as the next scipio a general in the making i see a young man with little experience but a surfeit of conceit enough in any case to force his way into my command and embarrass one of my officers the general paused but valerius didnt respond to the implied rebuke and yet the young man is a hero of rome vitelliuss eyes took in the wooden hand and he has made great sacrifices for the empire they tell me you fight as well with the sword in your left hand as you once did with your right now how did he know that valerius wondered perhaps we should put on an entertainment a hero of rome against my best swordsman what do you think for answer valerius pulled the imperial seal from his tunic and held it out so that vitellius could see exactly what it was i think i am not some twoheaded snake to be paraded for your garrisons entertainment general i am here on a mission from the emperor and i will carry it out with your support or without it you have it of course vitellius nodded untroubled by the lack of deference from the younger man but first i must know the substance of this mysterious assignment perhaps you wish to march out at dawn with my legion at your back i am sure the emperor would be most pleased if you were to add dacia to the list of romes provinces valerius smiled politely they both knew the last thing the emperor wanted was more barbarians to worry about you have a tribune on your staff publius sulla a fine young officer diligent and ambitious i would like to talk to him he may have information of value to my investigation it is possible that he will have to return with us to rome with your permission of course the lines on vitelliuss broad forehead deepened i am afraid that may be difficult he walked to a cloth map pinned to the far wall and pointed to a position beyond the winding blue ribbon of the river the boy has been pining for an independent command as you young men do you know our situation valerius shook his head the seventh soon to be followed by the fourth has been sent here to curb the ambitions of coson the dacian king across the river there who seeks to annex land for his tribe on the west bank coson knows rome will not countenance it but for reasons of internal politics he must be seen to make the attempt a number of small parties have crossed by boat to the east here here and here some of them made up of warriors others entire families of dispossessed farmers we have sent them all back peacefully where possible by force if not your barbarian young verrens appreciates force at present however we are in a period of negotiation coson has withdrawn his warriors ten miles from the line of the river in return for a substantial subsidy to ensure this bargain is adhered to i have set up an outpost here the position he marked was well into dacian territory publius sulla commands there he smiled apologetically some wine why cant he just send a messenger and bring publius back serpentius wondered suspiciously valerius adjusted his bedroll its a matter of face his and mine hes testing us to see how far were prepared to go to complete neros task maybe he doesnt want to lose a promising officer maybe he cant afford to lose any officers it happens a legion is never at full complement and this is a complicated command i dont like it i dont like it either but the only power we have is the power of this seal and these uniforms if we sit and wait for publius to come back and the chances are hes been warned not to that power diminishes every day first well be sneered at then well be laughed at and after that well well never get publius sulla out of here so we cross the river marcus sounded thoughtful we cross at dawn we ride to the outpost and we bring publius back what if he doesnt want to come hell come but if he doesnt thats why youre here and well have an escort of twenty auxiliary cavalry from the fort but that wont be necessary hell come for his familys honour and because if he doesnt he knows his career is finished vitellius will eventually be forced to send him back in chains marcus looked at the two others they hadnt signed up to go beyond the empires boundaries heracles nodded immediately serpentius hesitated then followed suit dawn then marcus said and wrapped himself in his blanket valerius sat for a few moments before dousing the oil lamp he pulled his own blanket over his body and closed his eyes but he didnt sleep because tomorrow they were going into the unknown xxi poppaea was alone now and she had never felt more frightened cornelius sulla had been her only link to petrus and now he was gone she shuddered as she remembered how nero had delighted in showing her the avenue of obscene lumps of charcoal that were all that remained of the blazing pyres he had taken particular pleasure in pointing out corneliuss grinning skull and recalling details of his agonies that had brought her close to fainting away at first she had feared he was singling her out and that at any moment a squad of praetorians would arrive to arrest her but this was nero he took a perverse pride in the unmasking of the christian at the heart of his court and the way the onehanded tribune valerius had been duped into achieving it another triumph for torquatus the master spy the more her husband revealed the clearer it became that someone close to valerius must be a traitor nero laughed as he told how the praetorian commanders useless louts had lost all trace of valerius and his men as they tracked lucina graecina yet within a few hours of valeriuss confronting cornelius sulla the young aristocrat was locked away the only explanation was that fabias friend was being betrayed by one of his own men her heart quickened as she recalled the glance she had shared with valerius she had been aware of him from the moment she and nero had walked down the stairway into the crowded room his youth and stern features marking him among the inebriated laughter and pink grinning faces she had sensed a power in him that in its own way rivalled the power of petrus the artificial hand fascinated her although she would not have noticed it without fabias prompting because he carried it so naturally she had never witnessed such a magnificent combination of anger and torment as valerius had shown when the beasts were unleashed on their helpless victims here was a man to be taken seriously a man to be feared a champion and she had never needed the services of a champion more she had convinced herself that valerius was the only man who could help her she told herself he had responded to her mute appeal but what could he do caesar had commissioned him to hunt down the very man who had given her hope it was impossible with that thought came despair she felt her world crumble a fracturing of the mind that walked hand in hand with panicstricken terror what did a single glance mean she was deluding herself no man alive could help her now slowly she walked out to the balcony and leaned across the parapet far below she could see the temples and the columns and the basilicas and the figures scurrying between them she raised her arms and pushed her upper body forward until her toes barely touched the floor and the worked stone of the balustrade cut into her waist one more inch and it would be finished one more inch and there would be no turning back the weight of her head and shoulders would carry her over the edge and she would plunge on to those stones so far below her head spun one more inch she must have the courage just one more inch she took a breath poppaea the moment was gone poppaea she turned and the mask resumed its customary position i am here caesar she allowed a smile to touch her voice as she walked back into the room where nero awaited her he was breathing heavily and the shining pink face made her think of a freshly washed pig i was concerned for you my love and i am grateful for your concern caesar but as you can see it is not necessary im so pleased he said his tone told her what was coming next because i have a special treat for you tonight he took her gently by the hand and led her towards the room she thought of as his torture chamber xxii valerius noticed that the tungrian escort commander was nervous and that surprised him vitellius had insisted that such patrols beyond the river were routine still he doubted that the legionary commander had ever ventured into dacia with an escort of fewer than a thousand men this was different perhaps the man had reason to be concerned valeriuss hand automatically reached up to stroke the golden boar amulet it had become his talisman since the day he had taken it from maeves neck as she lay amongst the countless thousands of dead on the field of boudiccas last battle he had convinced himself the glittering metal was invested with the indomitable spirit and fierce pride she had carried to her grave it had never failed him and he had a feeling he had never needed it more than he did now they were gathered in front of the fortress gates twenty auxiliary cavalry wearing chain link vests over tunics that had once been red and four in the black and silver of the praetorian guard they waited in uneasy silence for this was the hour that forced each man to face his thoughts and fears alone in the chill darkness just before dawn a ghostly blanket of silver drifted around them in the torchlight the mist hid everything beyond ten paces but the everpresent rush of vast waters pinpointed the rivers position away to their left the auxiliary leader festus had briefed his men the previous night but now he repeated the orders for the benefit of valerius and the others it should be simple we will cross the bridge and ride south to the base of the hills then on to the fort eight miles two hours at most stay alert listen for orders with fortunas favour we wont even smell a dacian when we get there we do what we have to do and then we ride home any questions valerius shook his head curious that there was no mention of publius sulla but he supposed the decurion was being sensible no point in inflaming an already awkward situation they walked the horses across the bridge their hooves rapping on the thick wooden planks and echoing eerily in the fog in the darkness the slim structure seemed to go on for ever and the danuvius oily black and swirling ran worryingly close below the awesome power of that huge volume of water made valerius feel a little unsteady a minute later they stepped from the end of the bridge on to dacian soil they were beyond the edge of the empire at first the country on the east bank of the river mirrored that which they had just left a great flat plain stretched into the distance with only a thin line on the far horizon to give the impression of rising ground the cavalrymen rode in pairs at the trot the points of their sevenfoot ash spears glinting in the first rays of sunlight and the coats of the big horses steaming in the cool air festus positioned valerius and his men at the rear of the little column which surprised the roman normally the less experienced men would ride in the centre where they couldnt get into trouble the tungrian dismissed his concerns if they hit us in the open well see them in plenty of time to run and i want you at the back where youll have a head start if we have to run my lads wont slow up to hold your hands so put your heels to your horses and your heads down and ride the dacians what kind of fighters are they valerius asked animals the decurion spat if they arent fighting us theyre fighting the sarmatians or the thracians or each other you kill all you can find and still there are more like ants and each one who dies thinks he goes to sit at the right hand of their heathen god zalmoxis wholl give him twenty bigtitted wives so he doesnt give a fuck they fight with long curved knives not killing knives gutting knives and they like to decorate their spears with roman balls you understand valerius felt an involuntary tightening in his stomach the only good thing about them is that their horses are no match for ours and their warriors have no discipline valerius attempted to draw him on publius sulla but with no success cavalry and infantry dont mix i saw him about the fort just another beardless roman boy the kind the dacians eat for dinner he gave a sour smile just like you as they travelled further south the terrain changed and the country became dotted with bushes then stunted thorn trees the ground began to rise the trees closed in on them and the feeling of being vulnerable pieces on a flat gaming board was replaced by the nervejangling tension of never knowing what might be round the next bend in the track valerius noticed the knuckles gripping the spear shafts go a little whiter and carefully tested the draw of his sword after less than two hours the column halted at the head of a small treelined defile and festus rode back to them one of the scouts thinks he saw something ahead im going to take the patrol to investigate wait here and ill send a man back for you once were clear valerius felt marcus bridle at his side but he put a hand on his arm this was festuss command he knew the enemy and he knew the ground only a fool would question his orders he nodded agreement and they watched uncertainly as the spear points disappeared into the trees ahead minutes passed and the only sound was the irritating whine of insects and the heavy snort of horses breathing valerius waited for the clink of brass that would herald the patrols return but gradually it became clear they were alone and likely to stay that way he felt the hairs on the back of his neck bristle and exchanged glances with marcus anyone else feel like the lamb thats separated out and made to feel very special just before saturnalia serpentius asked conversationally the tumble of trees and bushes around them was suddenly much more sinister even the birds which had been singing a few moments earlier were silent now we can go on or we can go back marcus said but we cant stay here valerius had already made his decision we go on we have a job to finish with or without them without theyve fucked us valerius nodded no point in discussing it for whatever reason festus had abandoned them the only question was to what he saw serpentius fumbling in the large cloth bag tied to the pommel of his saddle the spaniard extracted a short curved bow and a sheath filled with arrows valerius raised an eyebrow serpentius shrugged a gift from the thracians in the caravan escort ive never used it from the back of a horse but it might put one of the bastards off their stroke valerius took the lead and they moved ahead cautiously marcus covering the right flank heracles the left and serpentius continually glancing over his shoulder to check the rear the heat of the morning had become oppressive thickening the air around them every tree and every hummock concealed a potential threat and valerius felt the tension growing in his arms and neck he adjusted the strap of his helmet and wiped the sweat from his eyes what if the outpost has been abandoned marcus asked keeping his voice low well give it another half an hour and then turn back serpentius sniffed the air theyre out there i can smell them valerius searched the treeline which opened out on the left before converging again into a narrow funnel the immediate threat seemed to come from the opposite side the right and that made the funnel a natural escape route a welcoming refuge from the storm to his front was an area of boulderstrewn slope that might have been designed as a trap for their horses he sensed a dark shadow spreading through the trees ready he called they came with a howl a mass of barechested bearded warriors carrying painted oval shields and the wicked curved knives festus had described swords too of similar design but heavier and wielded twohanded now ride on the three men reacted instantly to valeriuss roared command the opening to the left was where the dacians wanted him to go which meant that beyond the gap would be a carefully set ambush better to take their chances in the open he kicked his mount to the gallop aiming for an almost imperceptible break in the line of boulders ahead and heard a welcome roar of frustration from behind but his enemy hadnt entirely neglected the hillside and a line of warriors rose from the scrub in front of valerius he heard the zip of an arrow and felt the wind of something past his right ear at first he thought it was a near miss but the arrow took one of the dacians in the centre of the chest and he realized serpentius was shooting from behind his shoulder another horse might have checked at the howling barrier ahead but this was a trained cavalry mount time and again on the practice ground he had been forced to ride through alarming screaming men like these until he had become certain of his own invulnerability without any urging from valerius the horse surged ahead teeth bared and screaming his own battle cry valerius kept his head down and his sword ready and concentrated on staying in the saddle a sickening crunch followed by a momentary check a snarling face appeared below and to his left and he felt hands scrambling for his foot the sword sliced down and the face disappeared in an explosion of bright blood more faces among the rocks mouths gaping in surprise then he was through and into the trees beyond the boulder line he glanced over his shoulder and felt a surge of relief marcus galloped a few paces behind a broad grin on his leathered face behind him serpentius roared with laughter heracles rode at his side wearing a grimace of concentration and holding a severed dacian head between his teeth by its long hair youve never seen anything like it serpentius called a single cut and it spins up into the air then the crazy bugger catches it with one hand i told him to get rid of it but he seems attached to the bloody thing marcus shouted something at the young sarmatian and with a grin heracles allowed the head to drop free valeriuss heart still hammered from the mad charge but his mind was frantically attempting to work out where they were he recalled some details of the map in vitelliuss quarters but the tracks festus had followed had twisted so much it was difficult to know just what direction they had taken he looked up at the sun which was over his right shoulder late morning perhaps approaching noon which meant it was now in the south if they turned back and travelled due west they would eventually reach the river but that would take them straight to the dacians the safest way back was to ride northwest take a wide arc to avoid the ambush and work their way through the hills until they reached the plain after that they should be home free but he hadnt ridden all this way to give up now publius sullas outpost cant be more than a couple of miles ahead he said we go on marcus wiped blood from his sword with a piece of saddle cloth do you think hell still be there i think theres only one way were going to find out valerius said grimly he had no doubt that the patrols vanishing act and the dacian ambush were linked to the man he sought but he would worry about that later his first priority was to survive he ordered the three men to conserve the contents of their water skins and marcus handed out the food hed brought the rest of the rations had been with the patrol after about ten minutes they came across a path serpentius studied the ground old tracks but too big for native horses roman cavalry mounts probably a few mules they followed the trail for a mile and a half before they came to a broad manmade clearing at its centre stood a small temporary fort surrounded by three wide ditches and a sixfoot turf rampart mounted with sharpened wooden stakes the only entrance was across an earth causeway and the wooden gate was protected from direct attack by a raised bank that restricted the approach the defences looked pathetically inadequate against the primeval forces theyd met earlier as valerius studied the fort the blast of a horn was followed by shouting and a line of polished helmets appeared above the palisade valerius drew to a halt short of the triple ditch couriers from general vitellius he shouted with orders for the fort commander from behind the earth barrier came the sound of a gate creaking open xxiii a powerful voice called from the rampart approach friend but do it slowly and keep your hands where we can see them valerius heard marcus laugh it was a typically cautious frontier welcome better to be nervous than dead he took a deep breath and kicked his horse forward to meet publius sulla at first sight the interior of the camp was as unimpressive as the exterior he doubted whether familiarity would improve the experience lines of worn leather tents sufficient to house a full century filled the centre beside a larger tent which would be the commanders quarters horse lines and latrines had been set up beside the turf banks of the parapet all contained within a dusty space sixty paces square a painfully small squad of men went about the daily business of the fort while the rest manned the ramparts two weeks in this place would wear down any soldiers morale two months would drive him mad publius sulla tribune of the seventh and brother of the traitor cornelius waited alone in the centre of the dirt square that passed for the parade ground a terrible melancholy overcame valerius as he recognized the man he had come to take back to rome when last hed looked into those pale eyes theyd been staring at him from a blackened skull hed expected a likeness but no one had warned him that publius sulla was corneliuss identical twin different characters certainly publius was leaner harder and more earnest than his brother yet in looks they were indistinguishable a vision of a writhing column of flame engulfed valeriuss mind and whatever he had meant to say died stillborn in his mouth is this all the young commander broke the silence i was expecting a column with a months rations what i see is four more mouths to feed valerius handed his reins to marcus and the veteran gladiator led their mounts to the horse lines gaius valerius verrens at your service i apologize tribune but we were parted from our escort and ambushed a few miles south of here ambushed publius instantly forgot the missing rations thats impossible we have a truce with the dacian king and i spoke with his representatives not five days ago if the situation had changed my spies in cosons camp would have informed me before now clodius a veteran legionary appeared from his place at the parapet increase the alert and send out a patrol i want to know if theres any movement within a mile of the fort its possible we have a renegade band trying to stir up trouble but tell them to act defensively i need information not heads valerius was impressed by the young mans professionalism he issued his orders without any sense of panic or confusion the ambush was just a new dimension of this complicated command to be dealt with an interesting posting to volunteer for tribune he ventured volunteer publiuss laugh betrayed his bitterness he led valerius up a set of wooden steps to the top of the rampart no one would be foolish enough to volunteer for this youve seen our position this should be an auxiliary command instead those men lining the walls are the dregs of the legion the moaners and the shirkers and the brawlers i have eighty of them plus twenty horse to cover fifty miles of frontier and they stay alert because ive managed to convince them that if they do not they will die here not that they should need much convincing were ten miles beyond the danuvius and any chance of reinforcement and weve been down to half rations for five days the moment coson decides to break the truce which he will the dacians will gobble us up like a wolf pouncing on a newborn lamb this post is meant to be a show of romes strength the reality is that it is a sacrifice to my generals vanity he looked directly into valeriuss eyes now to your business praetorian even a lowly junior tribune knows that it does not take four men and an auxiliary escort to deliver orders valerius nodded distractedly he had been wondering why vitellius had lied to him about publius sullas posting if hed lied about that what else had he lied about he had planned a quick dispassionate arrest the moment he arrived at the post any hope of that had disappeared when he saw corneliuss eyes in his brothers boyish face the longer he was with publius the more he found himself liking this young man he was about to destroy perhaps we may discuss it in private he suggested quietly publius caught something in the other mans voice and produced a bleak smile as you see privacy is in short supply in our little home from home join me in my tent my orderly will see that your men are fed what little we can offer he pulled back the flap and they entered a dusty humid interior lit by vents in the ceiling which allowed in the sun the tent was perhaps five paces wide by ten long with a floor of beaten earth the only luxuries were a portable desk and stool to one side which were faced by a second chair and a campaign bed set against the rear wall the tribune removed his helmet and gladius and invited valerius to do the same valerius realized he should have insisted that marcus and serpentius accompany him but he could hardly refuse now he placed his sword belt on the bed beside the other mans publius took his seat at the desk and valerius sat facing him please the tribune nodded for valerius to begin i am here to escort you back to rome valerius saw the colour drain from publius sullas face but otherwise there was no reaction to what they both knew could be a death sentence and may i know the reason somehow the young tribune kept his voice steady only that it is by the direct order of the emperor the younger man breathed out a long sigh so that means cornelius is taken and he looked to valerius for confirmation of his unspoken question valerius nodded for a moment publiuss face twisted in pain and he shook his head like a man fighting the iron of a sword buried deep in his vitals he struggled to regain his composure but when he spoke again his voice held only defiance the earnest blue eyes drilled into valerius our work will continue you know all through the empire men like cornelius are spreading the message of jesus christus every day more and more are willing to do gods work and i doubt that even nero can kill us all he seeks to destroy us because he fears us and he is right to fear us because no matter what he does to us we will only become stronger you might think that the legions are stony ground in which to plant the seeds of change praetorian but you would be wrong who needs his god by his side more than a soldier about to march out and die tell him they are out there waiting for the day when the day comes it is gods will that must prevail but then i doubt you understand what i am talking about i understand publius looked up in surprise and something flickered in his eyes hope you know about the great forces at work here yet you still do his bidding valerius straightened like you tribune i am a soldier and soldiers follow orders publius rose to his feet and walked in three strides to the bed too late valerius remembered where he had left his sword he heard the familiar almost musical hiss of a gladius being drawn from its scabbard publius kept his face to the tent wall so that valerius couldnt read his expression cornelius was strong but he lacked physical courage it was something he was always ashamed of he said softly he did not lack courage at the end valerius remembered the crimson streak running down the tar from the young aristocrats torn lip i have never seen a braver man publius nodded to himself yet he would not have fought them he would have gone with them like a lamb a lamb to the slaughter well know this gaius valerius verrens he turned at last the naked blade bright in his hand publius sulla is a soldier and will die like a soldier i will not go gently like a lamb to neros slaughter valerius tensed ready to meet the tribunes attack he knew he had little chance of surviving if publius was as comfortable with the sword as he appeared but he vowed to die trying when he was dead publius would have marcus serpentius and heracles arrested on some trumpedup charge perhaps even for valeriuss murder and there would be an unhappy accident on the way back to viminacium maybe this was the way general vitellius had planned it all along but publius hadnt finished senators soldiers and slaves men and women of all ranks aye to the very highest even in the heart of the monsters lair at the very centre of neros court are already waiting to replace me i have only one last request praetorian and i make it because i sense a decency in you that belies your words and your mission do what you can for my family with his final words publius sulla placed the point of the gladius against his sternum and used all his strength to drive its length up into his heart no valerius dived across the room but it was already too late with a sharp cry publius fell back on the bed his whole body shuddering hands still locked on the sword hilt and eyes bulging as his boyish face turned old in a heartbeat valerius knelt at the young mans side and cradled his head publius he whispered urgently i will help your family if i can i will help them all but you have to tell me how to find petrus i must find petrus publius opened his mouth but valerius would never hear his answer dark blood welled up in the tribunes throat and spilled like wine from his lips he gave one last convulsion and was still with a sigh valerius looked down on the dead boy gradually it dawned on him that with his emotional final words publius might have revealed more than he had intended senators soldiers and slaves men and women of all ranks even at the very centre of neros court cornelius had been a member of neros court but a peripheral figure never at the very centre it meant that someone at the highest level had a powerful incentive for thwarting the investigation and more important the power to ensure that happened he pulled the tent flap aside and looked across the parade ground marcus serpentius and heracles were talking together by a rampart where the cooks fire had been set into the dirt mound valerius called them across inside the tent serpentius produced a low whistle and marcus gave the sign against evil heracles just stared with his mouth open we dont have much time valerius warned them i suspect publius was a popular officer and the likelihood is that the men will take their officers death badly we are going to call the senior legionary when he gets here flank me and for the gods sake try to look like praetorians he went to the door and asked a passing legionary to send clodius to the tent the man shot him a puzzled look but saluted and ran off in search of the duplicarius when clodius appeared valerius drew him inside seeing the dead man the veteran gave a low growl and his hand went to his sword before he could draw it he froze with the needle tip of marcuss gladius against his throat soldier valerius kept his voice steady do you recognize what this is he held up the chain with the imperial seal clodius had to look twice but eventually he nodded publius sulla was an enemy of rome and has paid for his crime with his life my name is gaius valerius verrens tribune of the praetorian guard and i am taking temporary command of this outpost valerius paused and clodius clearly expected the next order to be for his execution but when i leave the fort will be your responsibility do you understand clodius frowned but he risked another nod valeriuss next words surprised him i cant order you to abandon your position but with your officer dead and rations running out you would be justified in returning with us if you choose to leave the men have an hour to demolish the fort and pack up their gear my report will state that the decision was made with my full support clodius hesitated this wasnt the kind of judgement he expected to have to make he shot a frightened glance towards publiuss body whatever you decide nothing will happen to you valerius assured him the duplicarius shook his head no ill stay and if i stay the men stay i was accused of cowardice after i discovered my officer had been selling horse feed to the merchants at the river market for his own profit thats why i am here if i stay i have a chance to win back my honour general vitellius is not a bad man just badly advised ask him to send a months rations and a new commander can you control your men when they hear that the tribune is dead i think yes he wasnt their regular officer they liked him well enough but most of them had only really known him for a few weeks if i can assure them that help and food is on its way theyll behave will you stay the night sir valerius shook his head there was still enough light left to reach the river no well leave as soon as were ready put together what rations you can for us ill speak to the men before we go they felt like deserters as they rode from the fort with the demoralized garrison watching from the walls for all his fine words about honour and courage and his pledge to send reinforcements valerius doubted any of the legionaries he left behind would ever return to viminacium he kept his eyes to the front behind him came marcus and serpentius and at the rear heracles led publius sullas horse with its masters body across its back wrapped in a bedding sheet eight of the forts cavalry troopers escorted them for the first mile and when they left valerius felt as vulnerable as when theyd been abandoned by the patrol the others sensed it too if i ever see that bastard festus again ill cut his throat serpentius spat valerius shook his head vitellius will make sure hes tucked away somewhere safe i doubt if youll ever see him again he couldnt have been more wrong they rode for close to an hour before they found the first body the dacians had hung it by the heels from a tree with a leather strap cut through the tendons of both ankles he had been stripped naked but the pale torso and walnut brown arms tied behind his back marked him as a roman soldier his captors had suspended him head down a few inches above a large fire and valerius didnt like to think about the agonies he had experienced before his skull had exploded do we bury him marcus asked valerius shook his head it would only tell them where we are and we dont have the time and where there was one there would be more could have been us serves the bastard right serpentius muttered without conviction festus was recognizable when they found him if you looked carefully and alive if you could call it alive strange that the young port prefect in acruvium had described the tungrians fate so accurately the words had been chilling enough their favourite method of passing the time with a prisoner is to flay him alive and then impale him on the branch of a thorn tree the reality was fit to drive a man to madness festuss eyeballs danced in his skull like white beads in a jar as well as his skin his dacian torturers had removed his lips his eyelids his nose and any other useful protrusions he was no longer a human being but a mess of blood and tissue wriggling obscenely on a fourfoot stake valerius wondered why he hadnt mercifully bled to death until he noticed that the gaping wound where his genitals had hung had been stuffed with earth to stop the bleeding and prolong his agony ill do it the spaniard said serpentius dismounted and approached the shivering horror that had once been a man with a short prayer and a single almost tender stroke of his sword he sliced through the vertebrae at the base of festuss neck the tungrians head flopped forward and his body went still after that they rode on in silence each man alert for the first sign of danger and at the same time alone with his thoughts and fears it was marcus who heard the shouts away to their left the survivors of the cavalry patrol must have believed theyd reached the relative safety of the plain when they were caught from a nearby ridge valerius saw immediately that their surviving leader had chosen to go to ground rather than fight his way out it had been a mistake now the patrol was surrounded on three sides of a bare hilltop by a jeering horde of dacians who danced among the trees and darted out to hurl spears scream insults and no doubt threaten them with the same fate as festus the only thing keeping them at bay was the wall of cavalry spears the tungrians had set up on the approaches to the hill which backed on to a sheer cliff face the dacians seemed in no hurry but how long that would last only the gods knew at least the auxiliaries still had their horses hobbled together in a shallow dish at the base of the cliff he slithered back to where the others waited what now marcus whispered valerius looked at each of them in turn he had brought them to this they owed him nothing they owed rome nothing take publius sullas body once youre out of the hills keep riding west and youll arrive at the river just follow it upstream until you reach the bridge what about you serpentius asked the question had only one answer im a roman soldier i cant leave other roman soldiers to die not even these bastards serpentius and marcus exchanged a glance of agreement this uniform says im a roman soldier too the spaniard said even if im not happy about it besides if you get killed whos going to pay us and you heracles if it wasnt for you i would probably already be dead then this is what we will do xxiv valerius looked out from the cliff top into the black void below a ring of dacian fires blazed around the hill where the tungrians were trapped but they shed no light on the perilous descent he was about to attempt hed studied the cliff face while there was still daylight and thought hed chosen the safest route but now seventy feet above the sheer drop he was almost unnerved by niggling uncertainty what if he reached a point where there were no holds what if he became trapped until the power in his fingers faded and he plunged on to the rocks below but there was no point in delaying he allowed himself to slip backwards over the cliff edge his feet searching for the first toehold he was barefoot the better to find the tiny cracks and hollows that would support him on the descent the face of the cliff was composed of curious honeycombed rock which provided plenty in the way of hand and footholds but the stone was soft so he had to test each one to ensure it would take his weight there would be no second chances just one mistake and hed end up smeared over the valley floor and that wouldnt do the auxiliaries any good at all when hed explained his plan marcus had stared at him as if he had lost his mind a onehanded man climbing down a sheer cliff in pitch darkness it is beyond foolishness you are committing suicide let me try valerius shook his head and continued unbuckling his armour with serpentiuss help how many cliffs did you climb in all your years in rome old man he saw marcus flinch at the reference to his age and smiled to take the edge off the jibe you could do it marcus so could serpentius but only i can do what needs to be done when i reach the bottom they are soldiers and they will only be led by another soldier but your hand when i searched the cliffs on my fathers estate for pigeon eggs i often had to climb down singlehanded if anything this is simpler which was easy to say but now that he put it into practice not so easy to do it was true that hed climbed onehanded but hed always carried the eggs in his left hand and hed had the option of dropping them if he got into trouble now he edged his way downwards in the certain knowledge that if the fingers of his left hand lost their grip nothing would save him he was sweating heavily and not because of the warmth of the night yet the further he descended the more confident he became he might only have a single hand but it had gripped a sword every day for the past six years the skin had the texture of partcured leather and the fingers the strength of an iron claw the walnut fist of his right hand could be used to jam into cracks in the rock and even where there were none to steady and balance himself at first he clung close to the surface but gradually he became more confident as his bare feet unerringly found one toehold after another he was a third of the way down when his boldness betrayed him valerius knew hed made a mistake the moment he allowed his weight to settle on the outcrop beneath his left foot the soft rock crumbled just as his left hand loosed the grip that anchored him to the face he felt himself falling away and flailed desperately at the rock for some kind of hold the cliff flashed past his face and he knew he was dead he would never understand how he did it as he fell his momentum took him in a halfturn away from the wall of rock which was now out of reach of his left hand yet somehow he managed to lunge forward with his right a jagged slash of pain tore at him as the walnut fist jammed into a narrow cleft and the leather strings binding the socket sliced into his flesh driven by the entire weight of his body a heartbeat later even that agony was overwhelmed by a sickening jerk that threatened to pull his arm from its socket he bit his lip to stop himself from crying out and for a few awful moments hung suspended praying the cowhide would hold him gradually panic receded and he was able to reach out with his sound hand and pull himself back to the rock face once there he drew himself upwards to take the weight off his arm and managed to unjam the wooden hand from the fissure he spent the next minute clinging to the face frozen by a combination of shock and pain but eventually he willed himself to resume the descent when he reached the base of the cliff he crouched for a few moments in the darkness attempting to get a sense of his surroundings ahead he could see the hilltop silhouetted in the glow of the dacian fires the soft snicker of a cavalry mount confirmed that the horses were picketed somewhere to his right but had the tungrians set a guard that was the next hurdle to make himself known without getting a spear in the throat he ghosted his way past the tethered horses if they were watched the sentry must be asleep because he saw no sign of him on the brow of the hill prone figures lay scattered like oddshaped rocks the only sign of life the almost imperceptible movement of their breathing and the occasional animal whimper he chose a shape on the outer edge of the group and drew the dagger hed carried at his belt careful soldier he whispered as he placed the point beneath the sleeping auxiliarys chin a pair of dark eyes flicked open and the mans mouth gaped before immediately closing as valerius increased the pressure valerius nodded slowly and allowed himself a smile i want you to call whoever is in command do it in a normal voice and ask him to come over nod if you understand valerius lifted the knife point and the tungrian complied by now puzzlement had replaced the fear in his eyes good now say it lucca the call was hesitant but loud enough to elicit an illtempered response what the fuck do you want fabius if you havent thought of a way to get us out of here go back to sleep please i need to talk to you i hope its not what i think it is the auxiliary grumbled bad enough were all going to die tomorrow without you suddenly deciding youre in fucking love with me a dark figure rose from the ground a dozen paces away and scratched energetically before walking stifflegged to where valerius crouched beside fabius valerius stood as lucca approached he heard a sharp hiss of indrawn breath and the sound of a sword being drawn id have thought youd lost too many men to go around killing your only reinforcement friend the mans face was lost in the darkness but valerius sensed him relax youre supposed to be dead festus said festus is the one whos dead valerius said brutally but we can discuss that later for the moment lets talk about our position how many men do you have left lucca hesitated but only for a moment fifteen no fourteen brigio died after we got here three of the others are too badly injured to fight but they can still ride horses enough for everyone and two spares but we only have fodder for another day and the water wont last till noon valerius accompanied the auxiliary while he outlined the position as they walked in the darkness luccas manner transformed from belligerent suspicion to a subordinates wary respect id have ridden for it but wed lost two men among the trees and festus ordered us to hole up while he went back for them an idiot but a brave idiot he never came back but we heard him screaming at least i think it was him by then we were already in the shit hundreds of vermin crawling among the trees and no way out and now we were due back before dark i thought maybe theyd send someone out after us valerius laughed and lucca joined him i know but ah shit his shoulders slumped an admission of defeat how did you get here we all thought youd been killed festus said what did festus say he said you were here to arrest the legate and return him to rome and we couldnt let that happen we were to take you out in the woods and lose you the dacians would do the rest thered been some kind of arrangement and we were to ride away free and clear only it looks like nobody told the gets the gets getae the dacians anyway the bastards ambushed us about half an hour after we left you valerius considered the story it made sense in a perverse soldierly sort of way if someone had convinced the tungrians their respected general was under threat they wouldnt take much persuading to mislay four of the despised praetorian guard and hope nobody back in rome noticed an unfortunate accident on the frontier by the time any investigation was launched the evidence would be a pile of wolfgnawed bones if the dacians left any evidence it also reinforced his suspicions someone had known in advance where they were coming and why theyd tried to stop him on the way east and now theyd tried again but gaius valerius verrens was not going to be stopped publius had unwittingly given him another piece of the puzzle but he needed to get back to rome if he was going to use it what happens now the cavalryman asked valeriuss eyes glinted in the darkness i suppose i could arrest you and your men and when we get back to the fort i can have you roasted over an open fire only there are fifteen of us and one of you and were all going to be dead in the morning anyway exactly or i can get us out of here and we can forget this ever happened the auxiliarys teeth shone in the darkness i dont know how youre going to do it but i like the second option a lot better valerius looked out beyond the fires and tried to imagine the dacian positions as hed seen them from the top of the ridge they surrounded the approaches to the hill but the keys to this trap were two slight gaps in the trees that potentially provided an escape route for the horsemen an organized force would have barricaded the openings but from what hed seen the dacians were happy to fill them with warriors and invite the tungrians to try their luck what he needed was to draw the dacian warriors away from one of those gaps hed outlined his plan to marcus before hed set out on the treacherous climb the signal will be a burning brand waved three times from the top of the hill count slowly to one hundred then create the diversion to lucca he said get your men ready in the saddle and prepared to fight in five minutes assign one trooper to each of the wounded fabius sir i want a small fire on the rear of the hill where the enemy cant see it and prepare a torch as he waited for the flames to take hold a young trooper approached with a saddled horse and valerius ordered him to hold it until he was ready he ran to the fire picked up the torch fabius had laid beside it and thrust it deep into the flames the dried grass and twigs caught immediately and he carried the flaming brand to the top of the hill and arced it three times above his head in a blazing rainbow all mounted lucca called now he asked as valerius leapt into the saddle valerius shook his head wait it seemed to take an eternity but it must have been less than two minutes there one of the troopers behind him hissed quiet do nothing that might alert them a tree exploded into flame two hundred paces away on the far side of the dacian ring marcus and serpentius had done their job well the blaze began in the lower branches but quickly spread to the dry leaves in the canopy and jumped to its neighbour which instantly added to the fiery spectacle wait valerius ordered the burning trees were close to the further gap and he was gambling that the diversion would draw the dacian blockaders to it but he had to give them time to react he could hear the tension in his own voice wait remember follow me straight to the trees and once were through turn along the line of the hills we stop for nothing or nobody slaughter anything that gets in your way now the horses had been sawing at the bit for minutes and the moment their riders gave them their heads they lumbered into motion across the upper slope picking up speed with every stride the tungrians plucked their long spears from the makeshift palisade as they crossed the bank and ditch instantly bringing them to the ready valerius felt the ground falling away beneath him no question of worrying about fox or rabbit holes just pray the trot swiftly developed into a headlong gallop he could hear the thunder of hooves all around him but he focused every ounce of his concentration on finding the gap it was out there somewhere in the darkness beyond the dacian fires if he had his directions wrong by even a few yards his men would ride straight into the trees where theyd be swept from the saddle and butchered but the fires would be his guide from the top of the hill hed noted that the near gap lined up with a large boulder at the base of the hill and the midpoint between the second and third pyres the pale blur of the boulder swept by on his right and he set his horse for the narrow opening between the fires with unnerving timing the wind came up flames and sparks shooting high in the air before they swept across the space he was aiming for but valerius dared not check his life and those of the tungrians depended on this mad dash through the fires like his own mount the animal beneath him had been bred for battle and trained for war flame smoke and noise held no fears for her shouts of alarm came from his left front and in the fiery light he saw a small army of dacians racing to cut the riders off it would be very close but there could be no stopping now he dug in his heels and pushed the mare to her limit feeling her surge beneath him all around him the tungrians did the same by now the space between the fires was filled by a wall of flame and it passed in an explosion of yellow and red a blast of heat and the stink of smoke and singed horse hair they were through and if hed calculated correctly the gap in the trees and the relative safety of the forest should be fifty paces ahead the dacian warriors had lost the race and they howled in frustration as the riders galloped past but they had bows and spears and the air swiftly filled with flying missiles a spear hurtled across valeriuss front a foot from his nose he heard a sharp cry accompanied by a sickening thud as a body hit the earth at high speed but he had no time to think of reining in the dark line of the forest was only half a dozen strides away he almost shouted in relief as he realized hed struck the treeline exactly where hed planned in the same instant he saw shadowy figures moving hurriedly among the trees and as he charged through into the deeper darkness his horse smashed into one hurtling a dacian warrior aside with the sickening crunch of broken bone and a shrill scream of pain the impact knocked the mare off her stride allowing the surviving cavalrymen to pass them an agile clawing savage with a knife between his teeth scrambled at valeriuss legs and hauled himself half into the saddle behind him valerius knew he was dead the instant the warrior retrieved the knife and using all his strength he smashed back with elbows and skull in an attempt to knock the dacian clear at the same time knowing that to lose control of the horse would be just as fatal but nothing would shift his assailant valerius heard a cry of triumph as the man hooked an arm around his throat and screamed in impotent fury as he anticipated the deadly sting of the knife point in his exposed back with a crack like a branch snapping the grip on his neck weakened he darted a glance back just as the dacian tumbled clear with the shaft of an arrow buried deep in his skull at the same time a welcome presence loomed out of the darkness and serpentius appeared grinning at his side the thracian bow in his right hand his horse matching stride with valeriuss own they were clear xxv this is an unexpected honour aulus vitellius might have been greeting a guest at his townhouse on the esquiline hill instead of in the heart of a rough frontier fortress valerius had to remind himself that this man had just tried to have him killed when he burst into the legates headquarters still dressed in a tunic stained with dacian blood he had fully intended to kill him if it became necessary but vitellius met him with a disarming smile and graciously proffered a cup of wine it was difficult to stay angry in the face of such charm i came here on the emperors authority to question publius sulla valerius said you deliberately put him out of the way vitellius shook his head regretfully he was a good officer but i had my doubts about the boy it seemed safer to isolate him and you sold us to the dacians of course the smile never faltered its not what i would have chosen but one does what one must why five of your soldiers are dead festus the decurion auxiliaries vitellius tutted dismissively as if the butchered men were chickens from the quartermasters store if they had done their job properly they would still be alive and we would not be having this inconvenient conversation why valerius persisted you could have kept us in the fort for a week and sent us away without meeting publius vitellius took a deep draught of wine but valerius knew the legate was only taking time to think when the answer came it was a surprise for both its frankness and its tone i could tell you that i feared you would be persistent they said give him a challenge and he is like a hound with a bone he wont stop chewing until he reaches the marrow but that would not be entirely true you have powerful enemies young man and the orders from those enemies were quite specific they wanted you dead valerius felt cold fingers settle on his neck i am on a personal mission for the emperor any man who raises a hand against me does so at his peril even as he said the words he realized how impotent they sounded five hundred miles from rome at the mercy of a man who could have him killed with a single word the legate laughed at his innocence but which emperor there is the emperor who sits upon his gilded throne but as i am sure you have noticed my good friend nero can be many emperors perhaps the emperor who sent you and the person who wished you to have an unhappy accident are one and the same and there are those around him who wield an emperors influence and who wish rightly or wrongly to protect him from what the irritatingly persistent gaius valerius verrens may find then there is the additional possibility that someone with access to the emperors power is protecting not nero but himself valerius straightened was vitellius confirming what publius had said you must know who issued the order vitellius reached to his desk and picked up a document with a wax imprint in its bottom right corner the imperial seal very similar to the one you carry one does not question the instructions which accompany it you will note that i was also instructed to have publius sulla killed the moment he returned to viminacium valerius looked down at the dark liquid swirling in his cup the legate smiled at his edginess dont worry it is not poisoned that would be a terrible waste of a remarkably good wine but you are still under orders to kill us valeriuss voice had a hard edge to it and his hand hovered beside the dagger he had smuggled past the guards vitellius gave a delighted shiver why you almost frighten me young and hard and dangerous if i had been the type of man you are valerius verrens i would not be ruling this dusty outpost i would be ruling the empire valerius stared at him those were dangerous words words that could very easily get a man killed and now and now i am afraid indolence is ingrained too deep if it was offered to me upon a silver platter i would refuse it i find work of any kind tires me and it is such a large empire these days i meant what now for us he saw vitellius frown genuinely disconcerted what now gaius valerius verrens hero of rome has lived up to his warlike reputation and defeated two attempts on the lives of himself and his associates it would be remiss of me to allow a third attempt whoever ordered this can only expect so much cooperation with publius sullas death your mission is completed and you should return to rome to make your report you may leave at your leisure or you may return with me as part of my bodyguard he noticed valeriuss confusion i too am to return to rome but for a rather more pleasant interview nero has awarded me governorship of africa where the opportunities for a man of talent are suitably wideranging the smile grew broader and valerius understood he was imagining the huge profits to be made from manipulating africas vast grain exports but his next words came as a surprise i will be allowed to appoint a military aide of my choosing it would not be surprising if i were to select a holder of the corona aurea the gold crown would add lustre to any proconsular retinue the truth is that i value your soldierly talents and as a student of seneca your conversation of course this cannot happen until the emperor dispenses with your services but as im sure you understand africa for all its rustic provinciality might be more conducive to your longterm health than rome in a way it is a pity i have had my legion for less than a year and my enemies will say i have not served because i never fought a battle but still valerius studied him searching for the lie but he suspected that even if it existed hed be unable to detect it if the offer wasnt a trap it was remarkably generous as the governors military adviser he would share his power and his profits and when his term was complete return to rome a wealthy man in addition and despite his doubledealing and readiness to see him killed valerius found he liked vitellius someone to be wary of certainly but likeable none the less he doubted he would ever be bored i appreciate your kindness he said noncommittally and it would be an honour to serve as your escort but i would be neglecting my duty if i didnt return to rome at the first opportunity well spoken vitellius rapped his fist on his desk and you will return by the quickest route i promise you we leave by fast galley in three days and reach vindobona six days later at vindobona i will release you from your duties and you can ride to the emperor immediately in the meantime you will be able to update me on what is happening in rome valerius bowed his agreement it seemed there was no escape from vitelliuss relentless pursuit marcus serpentius and heracles were waiting for him outside the headquarters he could tell from their faces that they expected the news to be bad but they brightened when he explained the generals plans marcus nodded approval better to be rowed halfway home than to be tied to a horse for two weeks true valerius agreed but we leave vitellius at the first opportunity he might be entertaining but hes also dangerous to know even when he isnt trying to kill you that feeling was reinforced on the long trip upriver a journey punctuated by the occasional shout of command the measured swish of the oars and mesmeric rush of the waters beneath the hull vitellius had been a member of the emperors inner circle during the early years of his reign and he had an inexhaustible supply of scandalous and almost certainly treasonable gossip about nero he was a fine young man the general mused one warm afternoon as the oarsmen powered them towards aquincum on the rivers broad bend with all the usual young mans enthusiasms drink syrian strumpets and vicious amusement it was unfortunate that he came to the throne before he was fully formed power changed him as it does any man at first he was happy to be advised by seneca and burrus and he surprised us all by his grasp of the complexities of empire but not even seneca could compete with agrippinas meddling she whipped up a whirlwind when she tried to play the palace aides and the senators off against each other eventually it consumed her he shook his head at the womans folly in the meantime the emperors passion had moved on from chariots to the overpaid musclebound youths who drive them valerius learned more than he wanted about neros carnal appetites the boys girls and women of course he had heard whispers but vitelliuss attention to detail when he was in his cups could be stomachchurning three sumerian giants two virgins and his own aunt you have never heard such a caterwauling the rape of rubria of course the debauch of a vestal virgin was beyond even caligulas excesses we tried to keep it quiet but at the next inspection when he wasnt captivated by the sound of his own voice the general had a voracious appetite for tales of the british rebellion and suetoniuss reaction the tactics he had used and why hed used them the deployment of auxiliaries and cavalry valerius who was no storyteller found it increasingly hard to satisfy in the end he had to repeat the epic of the last stand of the colonia militia and the final hours of the temple of claudius five or six times by the gods what an end to make you may think differently now but you will learn in time that a hand is a small price to pay for having been present suetonius was wrong though to take such a terrible retribution i am not too old to learn from his dispositions but i know that a general or a politician for that matter cannot be motivated by anger or hatred he should have made an example of the woman and her chieftains enslaved a few hundred noblemen and kept the rest happy by parcelling out the confiscated lands among them now tell me again about the last battle the slope was where by the time they reached vindobona valerius had fought the last battle until he was ready to jump overboard and take his chances in the river it was a hasty farewell delayed only by the legates obvious reluctance to be abandoned do not forget my offer valerius he reminded him offering his hand we would do very well together you and i and they tell me that africa is not such a bad place rich but quiet and the women are willing and beautiful by the end you might well have a legion an african legion but still a legion think on it valerius said he would reflecting that a great many people seemed to be tempting him with a legionary command they agreed to meet in rome before vitellius left for his province as they rode out of the city he felt serpentius studying him what is it the spaniard shrugged i was just thinking you got on very well with the general considering he tried to get us killed valerius laughed isnt that what every general does you cant fight them all serpentius grinned and they kicked their horses on towards the great wall of whitetipped peaks to the south to rome and nero and a stark choice xxvi it was strange this sensation of being one of the walking dead he could almost feel the executioners breath on the back of his neck of course nothing was certain in neros world but there was no denying he had failed and in neros world death would always be a potential consequence of failure on his return to rome valerius had spent a few minutes with his sister before dropping into his bed exhausted after four days in the saddle julia was nowhere to be seen but he sensed an unease among his household staff that might have been prompted by olivias condition she had made little progress and it was clear that if he didnt track down the judaean healer soon it might be too late when he woke next day he decided against going directly to the palace but rather to test the political temperature with fabia first the beautiful courtesan welcomed him with an embrace that almost crushed his ribs and a kiss that didnt seem respectable at that hour of the morning you must never leave me for so long again she scolded making him feel guilty the way only a woman can vitelliuss suggestion intrigued her he has powerful friends and it is a good offer you could be a combination of general administrator and politician thus satisfying your own ambitions and your fathers valerius nodded but before i give him his answer i have to survive and that seems less likely with every passing day she turned pale as he told her about the mountain ambush in moesia and the trap the legate had set for him you must be careful valerius if you have truly made an enemy of nero you will never be safe if it is nero then i am already dead and there is little point in worrying about it i will put my affairs in order and act as if every day is my last but if it is not then i need to find out who it is and why i dont trust torquatus but i cant see why he would want me killed if cornelius sulla had still been alive i might have suspected him but rome still whispers of corneliuss execution fabia said the emperor went too far the rest were slaves and criminals but cornelius was born a roman citizen and a patrician to put him to death without trial and in such a fashion went against everything the empire stands for if it can happen to cornelius then no one can feel safe publius sulla hinted that nero had a christus follower at the very heart of his court these people operate in the shadows but they are not solitary their worship is a communal affair whoever it is must have the freedom to come and go from the palace unless they used cornelius as a channel to petrus its possible that is why he took the risk of meeting lucina i need to find out who of the inner circle was most friendly with cornelius and you want me to help you of course i will try but it sounds so unlikely you have experience of palace occasions but you cannot imagine how suffocating it is to be part of neros inner circle you were part of it he pointed out a shadow fell over the sapphire eyes oh valerius you can be so naive the reality is that i was nothing more than an object to be used and discarded i neither listened nor spoke because to do so would have put my life at risk i played my part in their little games and left but you know who they are fabia nodded too many to make your task simple cornelius made himself accommodating to many torquatus for one epaphradotus the emperors secretary for another poppaeas ladies in waiting menecrates the harper and spicillus who is the new darling of the arena are the latest targets of neros affections cornelius was close to both any one of them could be a candidate for your christus follower but after what happened to cornelius they are even less likely to stand on the rostrum and shout about it if you are right and it was one of them who tried to engineer your death they would have to feel very secure someone like torquatus fabia laughed bitterly i cannot think of anyone less likely to be seduced by the rantings of some obscure judaean mystic than decimus torquatus i would never have suspected cornelius he said she shook her head not torquatus he studied her she seemed very certain and he wondered why fabia had always been well informed about what happened on the palatine when hed occasionally asked where shed heard some of the things she told him shed passed it off as malicious pillow talk but when he thought back there had been times when hed wondered how she could know quite so much still every detail could help him understand the nature of the threat against him i cant delay reporting to the emperor any longer tell me what has been happening at the palace while ive been gone when she sulked she looked like a little girl always business these days valerius you must come for a little relaxation soon galba is still out of favour he left twenty minutes later and made his way through the forum to the palatine the day had started bright but while he was with fabia grey thunderclouds had gathered low above the city piled up like untidy pyramids over the rumpled expanse of ochre white and gold that was rome the gloom cast by the clouds suited his mood here in the monsters shadow his stoic acceptance of his fate was exposed for the sham it was six stonyfaced palace guards who collected him at the summit of the clivus palatinus appeared to confirm his intuition the soldiers escorted him down a set of steep steps to a marblelined tunnel that cut beneath the palaces and the gardens it was long and curved and floored with beautiful mosaics with curtained alcoves set at intervals along its length the alcoves contained the usual gilded collection of emperors generals and gods and it wasnt until he noticed the long neck and soft boyish features of one of these figures that he realized this must be the passageway where caligula had been assassinated by men just like his escort the thought sent a shiver through him it seemed an unlikely place for such an act of savagery but it would take only a single word of command and he would follow the former emperor to the otherworld in a blizzard of swords he was sweating by the time a second set of steps took them back into the open at the southern edge of the hill once ordinary men had lived here if you could call men whose names rang down through the ages like cicero and catulus marcus antonius and quintus hortensius ordinary their mansions had originally lined the hilltop but they had been driven out by money and power and by death every man had to die but of all the men he had named only one had died in his bed a lone figure in white stood silhouetted against a sky which grew darker by the minute valerius flinched as a bolt of lightning ripped the far horizon and its flash lit the sky a few seconds later a crash of thunder shook the air and the emperor turned to him with a smile that was belied by the unnatural light in his eyes even an emperor cannot command the elements he said regretfully the augurs say it means the gods are angry do you believe that valerius hesitated before deciding it would do no harm to tell the truth no caesar i think wars are the way the gods show their anger nero nodded it seems to me that we blame the gods for the things we fear you are a warrior do you fear war i do not fear war but no sane man welcomes it just as no man welcomes death the emperor frowned as if the thought had never occurred to him yes death you allowed publius sulla to kill himself before you could question him valerius heard the praetorians moving in behind him and he saw neros eyes flick towards them it seemed someone was a step ahead of him again he had rehearsed this moment in his mind a dozen times determined to show no weakness but reality was different the words stuck in his throat and he felt shame at the fear he could hear in his voice yes caesar then you have failed me failure requires punishment do you agree the last three words were snapped out like nails hammered into a cross valerius raised his head and looked directly into the pale eyes he would not plead a faint rattle of metal told him the men behind him were preparing to strike and he knew knew that the other man was imagining the swords rising and falling the haze of scarlet as the blades hacked into his body he closed his eyes and waited for the first blow an eternity passed before the emperor finally spoke valerius winced as another clap of thunder shattered the silence when he looked up he found nero studying him i said you have ten days to hunt down this petrus valerius opened his mouth to protest but there was worse to come at noon on the tenth day i will have every judaean subject in rome driven to the circus nero waved a hand at the great arena a hundred and fifty feet below and put to the sword and you with them he walked away leaving valerius to stare down at the oval of sand that would be stained with the blood of twenty thousand innocents if he failed valeriuss feet took him back through the forum but the real world only existed inside his head where his mind wrestled with the terrible implications of what he had just been told surely not even nero but yes he could valerius saw again corneliuss screaming flamefilled mouth the girls pleading face the merciless glow in a leopards eyes it was the same glow he had seen when nero turned to greet him but twenty thousand people somewhere to his left were the gemonian stairs where executed criminals were left to rot soon his body could be lying among them he stumbled blindly through the crowds bumping into hurrying figures who cursed him or thrust him aside valerius he blinked and the scene about him came into sharp focus including the concerned features of marcus what now lucina graecina is taken he closed his eyes how many more obstacles could the gods place before him when he demanded where is she two weeks ago in the prison marcus pointed across the forum towards the base of the capitoline hill in the carcer may the gods help her people who went into the carcer seldom came out but he had no choice he had to find a way to free lucina standing in the shadow of the great men who dominated the forum caesar pompey and augustus he suddenly felt very small and wearied to the bone he was a soldier he was not equipped for plotting and conspiracy but what else could he do too many lives depended on him to give up now it was unlikely any acquaintance would have recognized valerius when he returned to the forum the next morning now he wore the sculpted silver breastplate of a tribune of the guard with the black cloak covering his shoulders and his helmet low over his brow to hide a face which wore an expression of grim resolve behind him equally stern marched his escort one tall and swarthy his face set in a sneer as if everything and everyone around him stank and an older guardsman patently nearing the end of his sixteenyear commission with the scars of his campaigns etched deep on his face keep your backs straight and try to look like soldiers valerius warned them serpentius set his shoulders and glared defiance at anyone who looked like getting in his way marcus muttered something about strutting peacocks and did his level best to stay in step they were approaching the doorway of the imperial prison on the east side of the capitoline hill valerius like all his countrymen had heard the tales of what happened inside those walls now he was going to bluff his way into the most feared building in rome he walked up the steps and hammered on the door of the prison open in the name of the emperor tribune verrens to question the prisoner lucina graecina with a clatter a small shutter opened in the doorway to reveal a pinched suspicious face with the features of a cornered rat tribune verrens to question the prisoner lucina graecina valerius repeated the rat yawned ill need to see your orders valerius leaned close to the opening and almost gagged on the stink of the jailers breath nothing written down for this one he said confidentially the orders came direct from prefect torquatus himself thats right soldier he nodded to marcus nothing on paper tribune verrens to question the prisoner about crimes against the roman people marcus confirmed results to be communicated direct to the praetorian prefect without delay without delay valerius echoed the jailer sniffed noisily and sighed suspicion was replaced by a look of pained confusion his job wasnt supposed to be like this it was meant to be simple no one got in without orders unless they made him a decent offer and even then he wouldnt take a bribe if he smelled trouble but the tribunes obvious authority and the praetorian uniforms made it complicated what made it more complicated were the special instructions hed been given for the care of the prisoner a moment sir he whined he disappeared only to return a minute later with an expression of resigned failure the shutter slammed shut and they heard the rattle of bolts before the door swung open bringing with it a waft of stale sweat dried urine and sour wine stay here valerius ordered the two men our pleasure marcus grinned valerius removed his helmet and stooped to enter the doorway inside the heat was stifling and the stagnant air thick enough to chew his stomach rebelled at a combination of filth and suffering and despair that reminded him of the last day in the temple of claudius the jailer proved to be taller than he had appeared but he walked with a permanent crouch as a result of his long service in the lowceilinged chamber for a place with such a terrible reputation the carcer was surprisingly small and made more so by the wooden partition which hid the rear of the chamber in the centre of the floor a dark noxious hole had been sunk and for a moment valeriuss spirits quailed at the thought that lucina was being held in the notorious tullianum below him was the pit of horrors where the catiline conspirators had met their end the african king jugurtha had been starved to death and the executioners had strangled vercingetorix the rebel gaul who had defied caesar the jailer saw his look and his face twisted into an unpleasant grin nah we dont keep mother rome down there not yet anyway shes marked for special attention she is mother rome valerius was mystified youll see tullius a curtain opened in the partition and a second man appeared unshaven and as filthy as the first gentleman wants to see the pretty lady ill have your sword sir if you dont mind rules are rules valerius reluctantly complied not that youd hurt her im sure i was a bit surprised you being sent to question her though what with all them others being here day after day the stench from the rear of the chamber was even more noxious than that emanating from the tullianum and at first valerius found it difficult to see in the gloom a figure stepped out of the darkness and he cursed the ruined face grinned mockingly rodan was dressed in a stained white tunic and stank of old wine but his hand held a sword a gladius like the one valerius had surrendered a moment earlier i thought youd be here sooner the praetorian said conversationally torquatus was very keen you should get a chance to talk to the lady he ushered valerius forward but the young roman wasnt fooled by the show of manners rodans wild eyes and the way he held the sword were utterly at odds with the softness of his voice he took two cautious steps into the chamber when he saw what waited in the darkness he felt the blood drain from his face who did this he had seen war in all its awfulness and cruelty and death that had reached its height on the night hed watched cornelius sulla burn but the humiliation nero had devised for lucina graecina somehow overshadowed them all shes been in there for more than two weeks rodan reflected shes a tough old bitch they had placed lucina graecina in a low barred cage of the type used to transport wild animals from africa for the arena gone was the haughty noblewoman he had met in the garden she had been replaced by this naked filthstreaked crone her stringy body patterned with burns and bruises and her face hidden behind the matted curtain of her hair the pen was too short to allow her to lie down in any comfort and too low for her to sit up instead she was forced to crouch on all fours with the bars cutting agonizingly into her knees mother rome rodan laughed with her dry tits hanging down like that she looks just like the old shewolf who suckled romulus and remus valerius remembered the pride and defiance of the woman he had met in the garden and restrained the urge to smash his wooden fist into the grinning face you did this the praetorian spat on the soiled straw at his feet on the orders of the emperor lucina graecina is a traitor to rome and is to be questioned to reveal her associates and anyone connected with the sect of christus the galilean you are to take any steps necessary to ensure her full cooperation he laughed any steps i should kill you here and now and the jailers it would be a month before anyone noticed the stink from that hole if they ever did you could try rodan said weighing his sword and moving between valerius and the doorway maybe thats what the emperor had in mind all along i want to talk to her the praetorian shrugged amusement in his eyes you dont want to kill me let me talk to her alone rodan disappeared through the partition valerius could hear the mans laughter ringing in his ears when they were alone he crouched over the cage where lucina knelt her body shaking with terror and pain she felt his presence and cringed away like a beaten animal my lady he whispered i will do what i can for you but first you must help me i need to know who betrayed you and i need you to tell me the significance of the numbers mcvii the time for saying nothing is past please the bowed head turned towards him and the tangled mass of hair parted he looked into a face made unrecognizable by her suffering and recoiled from two redrimmed eyes that mirrored the deepest pits of hades lucina graecina noblewoman of rome threw back her head and howled like the shewolf she resembled she was quite mad xxvii find sextus and felix i want to know the names or descriptions of everyone lucina has met since they started following her between them they shouldnt have missed anyone marcus nodded shes not talking i doubt if shell ever talk again valerius said wearily he described lucinas ordeal at the hands of rodan watch out for him i have a feeling theyre much closer to us than we think like a conjuror serpentius produced a long dagger from his belt i hope he comes close enough just the once valerius shook his head there may come a time for that but this is not it if we can discover how he knows so much about us we can use it against him now killing him wont solve anything torquatus will just find some other executioner what good is a list of the people shes met marcus said we cant follow them all and the chances of any of them being involved with the christus sect are slim look at the trouble she took to hide her association with cornelius much good it did the poor bastards do you get the feeling that every time we get close to anyone they suddenly die on us privately valerius agreed too often he had felt he was one step ahead of his enemies only to discover that he was actually one step behind was it possible that someone in his household was a spy or even one of these men he had come to trust with his life he met serpentiuss fierce wolfs eyes and dismissed the thought as quickly as it had appeared all i know is that whatever information lucina had is now in torquatuss hands and we have to do something i dont understand why but this has turned into a race and he doesnt want us to get to petrus first well meet later at the house that evening before he looked in on olivia valerius placed an oil lamp in the window above the front door the change in his sister astonished him julia held her hand as she sat up in bed the young slave lowered her eyes i wanted to surprise you master i hope i was right she has been like this since your father left this morning father he had business in town he said but he spent more than an hour with olivia i knew he was here because i could hear his words and they comforted me olivias voice sounded weary but she held out her other hand to valerius when he had gone i opened my eyes and everything was so much brighter than i remembered julia brought me a cushion and i was able to sit up i have eaten some fruit valerius you should be proud of me i am he said but he was prouder still that she had somehow found the strength to fight the thing that threatened to destroy her now tell me about your latest case she said brightly he thought about the water theft for the first time in a month old honorius would be foaming at the mouth it would bore you back to sleep he said but fortunately i have put it aside for a while lately i have been working for the state is that why you are so tired she asked as julia crept from the room he smiled no it is running after my baby sister that makes me tired then i must make sure you do not have to for much longer they both knew the sentence had a dual meaning but valerius chose to ignore it olivia continued julia tells me you have a new companion she says he is dark saturnine and dangerous but her voice makes him seem kind i think she likes him valerius nodded i think she does she said you have been travelling if you cannot tell me of your work you must tell me of your adventures she lay back on the cushion and closed her eyes he took olivia on the journey through moesia the harsh jagged mountains windwhipped gorges and unfordable rivers and the proud savage people who struggled to survive there he didnt mention ambush or betrayal but made her smile with his tales of the trip north on the legates trireme and vitelliuss host of earthy stories and irrepressible optimism still with her eyes closed she said quietly how fortunate you are to be a man valerius it was something hed never considered of course he was a man and she was a woman how else would it be she must have felt his confusion because she smiled a man is free to travel where he wishes to buy what he likes and to drink when he wants to a woman must ask permission to do all these things do you understand he laughed i think a woman at least this woman has had too much time to think so she said and a catch in her voice told him he had offended her a woman must even ask permission to think i meant i know what you meant brother and that you meant well many of my sisters would agree with you but she hesitated for so long he thought she had gone back to sleep but i have been thinking thinking of my life and of death death seems so eternal my life so short and so she struggled to find the word valueless if i had a child it might have been different valerius squeezed her hand and she opened her eyes he knew that one of the reasons she had turned down luciuss choice of husband had been the unlikelihood that he could father a child there is still time he assured her knowing that there was not no it will not happen she said her voice grave i visited the good goddess before i became ill and it is not my fate you see valerius i am only part woman part roman woman a roman woman belongs to her father then her husband whom she cannot choose herself father could have put me away or had me killed because i would not do his bidding she is worth less than a slave because a roman woman cannot work as a slave works she must sew and entertain but she must never labour i have never cooked a meal or cleaned a room valerius shook his head you are not a roman woman you are a roman lady you have slaves to cook and clean and that is the way it is meant to be you do entertain and you do manage our household if it had not been for you half of my clients would she puffed out her cheeks and let out an exasperated explosion of breath julia manages the household as she has always done i am as much an ornament as that vulgar crown of gold you are so proud of she smiled to take away any offence i only wish i had been given the opportunity to win it win your battle and you will have it he said and meant it my little sister is as brave as boudicca and as hardy as any legionary centurion and she makes me proud get well again and it will mean more to me than any honour she lay back and he could see she was fading again but she had the strength for one last whisper that he wasnt sure hed heard properly i almost forgot who was the terrible man who was here while you were away when he was certain she was asleep he unhooked the boar amulet from his neck and fastened it gently round hers if his own gods could not help her perhaps maeves could it was only as he left that he realized what had been nagging at him olivias recovery had been so rapid so unexpected and so brief that it was almost as if she had been given another measure of the healers wondrous draught the gladiators arrived as the plumtinged sky of dusk gave way to the inky blue darkness of the roman summer night valerius had stationed a servant by the garden door to let them into the house and another in an alley at the end of the street to check for any followers they waited until the man reported everything clear before they went indoors valerius had debated whether to tell his companions about neros threat but he had decided it was a burden he must carry alone it would make no difference to their efforts or to the outcome six couches were set out around the central pool of the atrium and he allowed the others to awkwardly take their places before he lay down himself he ordered a slave to send wine and serpentiuss eyes lit up but not until we have completed our business the spaniards face fell but came alive again when it was julia who set the flagon and six cups on a table by the doorway it was almost an hour before valerius was satisfied with the list produced by felix and sextus several names were duplicated or at least it seemed so because the spelling was similar a number were only vague descriptions of people who could also have been on the other mans list and sextus seemed confused as to what constituted a chance meeting how many seconds would i have to count for it to be an encounter would they have to exchange words sometimes her chair would stop next to someone but it was impossible to tell if anything was said because i had to keep my distance in the end they came up with a list of twenty it included one consul two possibly three former legionary officers who had served with her husband and a number of merchants including one who owned most of the bakeries in the north of the city the consul might be promising marcus ventured valerius shook his head petronius lurco has just been elected a pontifex of the temple of neptune christus only allows his followers to worship one god you said she singled him out felix thats right hailed him in the middle of the clivus argentarius he looked proper put out she knew she was being followed for years she lived like a recluse avoiding contact with anyone only ever leaving her house in a covered chair suddenly she is approaching people she barely knows and scaring them half to death in the street she was trying to lay a false scent we need to look for someone she didnt want us to know she was talking to serpentius shrugged that could be anyone she passed on the street close enough to exchange two words with hundreds maybe thousands of people true valerius agreed but this list is all weve got we have to start somewhere what about the soldiers heracles suggested publius was a soldier i think were wasting our time the spaniard grunted use the emperors money to hire people to search every street for more fish signs and tell the whole of rome what were looking for petrus would burrow so deep wed never find him marcus frowned and took the list from valeriuss hand what is it i just remembered something you said she avoided contact with everyone the merchants on this list are all suppliers to the household or her husbands estates she got her servants to pay them but then insisted that each of them approach her chair to thank her personally why would she do that if she didnt want to meet people intrigued valerius retrieved the list from him wine sellers butchers bakers and builders mere plebeians the old lucina would have despised them all even the rich ones yet she went out of her way to exchange words with them that is interesting but there are how many ten and any or all of them could be involved we need something else they broke up another hour later without making further progress valerius acknowledged that serpentiuss suggestion had some merit but it was without much hope that he dispatched the spaniard and heracles to search the surrounding streets next day for any signs related to christus marcus felix and sextus would check out the premises of each of the merchants on the list it was like trying to pin down smoke but at least they were taking action he went to sleep that night with the nagging feeling that he had missed something xxviii valerius spent the next morning working on the household accounts he had neglected for the past month and after an early meal he slipped out by the garden door and took the short walk across the lower slope of the caelian hill to the castra peregrina the barracks overlooked the old porta capena and were hidden behind a sturdy wall and it was by the north corner that valerius waited for his contact from seneca just when he was beginning to think hed wasted his time a lumbering figure approached from the direction of the city gate valerius had to look twice had the man lost his mind seneca saw the expression on his face and laughed allow an old gentleman a little indulgence and give him some credit my boy i have played these games before and i believe i can still outfox a fool like torquatus you are mad to come here the philosophers brow creased not mad i think but in a man in my position the senses can be aroused beyond the normal and that heightened arousal may have an effect on judgement yet precisely because of that effect the subject himself could well be unaware of his predicament an interesting proposition he smiled but i believe you have a question for me first valerius reported his progress or lack of it seneca sniffed his distaste yes i wasnt aware of the peril in which i was placing lucina when i gave you her name though she did lead you to cornelius who in time im sure would have led you to petrus the question i believe we must ask is whether they betrayed themselves or whether some outside influence brought them to their fate you have not for instance told anyone of our arrangement valerius stared at him you think someone in my household is a spy oh i am certain of it but im also certain you would not trumpet this business to your slaves and your servants but i trust marcus and his men with my life indeed you do seneca said significantly i merely urge caution in all things corneliuss death was a warning not only to his fellow christians he saw valeriuss look of puzzlement christians my boy is what petrus and the other members of his sect call themselves these christians use some sort of code among themselves to indicate the place and time of their next meeting i thought with your contacts in the east it might be possible to discover its nature seneca stared out over the valley towards the great tiered palace complex on the palatine and his nose wrinkled with distaste you may be asking too much but i will make enquiries what form does the code take do you have an example reluctantly valerius told him about the inscription scratched on the doorpost of the physicians insula the philosopher frowned these people are weaned on secrecy i can make nothing of it but i will see what i can do i will send a courier to your house tonight at dusk with the answer if there is one not to the house valerius gave him the address of the block where marcus serpentius and the others were billeted seneca was wandering off in the direction of the capena gate when valerius remembered what else he had wanted to ask he hurried to intercept the older man you spent ten years as part of neros inner circle who among them is the most likely to be attracted to this christian god the philosophers brows furrowed as he dissected the question evaluating and discarding eventually he burst into laughter open to new ideas impressionable unstable and prone to instantaneous and illconsidered enthusiasms why the man most likely to become a christian is nero himself he was still laughing when he vanished towards the road valerius spent a frustrating evening waiting for word he called for wine and by the time he was ready to sleep he knew hed had more than was good for him still even his mood couldnt account for the way tiberius the steward and his other slaves worked so hard to avoid being in his presence even julia disappeared the moment he entered olivias room something was wrong and it nagged at him like a woodpecker inside his skull he remembered the feeling that he was missing something whatever it was it had happened since hed returned from dacia he went over everything in his mind even though reliving the horror of neros ultimatum and lucinas torment sickened him not that something else something to do with the household he must remember every whisper he was almost asleep when it came to him every whisper that was the answer what had olivia said who was the terrible man who was here while you were away tiberius he roared it took a few minutes for the old man to answer the call and when he did the fear that showed in his eyes was enough to convince valerius that his suspicions were wellfounded master someone was here while i was gone someone i am not to know about who was it tiberius shook his head i cannot do you think i am a fool tiberius valerius kept his voice low but the menace in his words was clear this is my household and you are part of it whatever is making you stay quiet is nothing compared to the power of my anger if you do not tell me i have never whipped a slave but i am prepared to start you have always been loyal to me and my family do not betray me now he said they would kill the old mans voice shook and tears ran down his face who said we could not stop them they had an imperial warrant who tiberius i have to know praetorians tiberius sobbed a centurion and six men he said they were here to make an inventory of all your possessions everything a man with a scarred face master i could not stop them rodan of course he said we would die if we told he went to olivias room he in an instant valerius felt the blood boiling inside his head and his vision went red he reached out blindly and his hand caught the front of the slaves tunic tiberius let out a cry of terror he did what tiberius the old man darted a scared glance towards the doorway and valerius followed the look to where julia stood her eyes wide with terror and something else shame rodan made his way from the castra praetoria to the palace at dawn the next day accompanied by six of the guard it was a fine morning and he took pleasure in the fact that everything was going so well his retirement from the guard was only a few years away and apart from his centurions pension which wasnt paltry hed amassed a small fortune in bribes from people he had led to believe they were on the emperors little list he was still a relatively young man with a bright future and if things went to plan his finances were about to improve even further when the tall figure stepped out into the street ahead he was surprised but not concerned why should a man with six armed guards fear one with no sword not even a belt valerius wore a longsleeved tunic against the morning chill but he was clearly unarmed youre out early today my hero whats wrong the ghosts keeping you awake the words were accompanied by a sneer but the mocking grin vanished as the young roman marched silently towards him valeriuss face might have been carved from stone and his eyes glowed red in the morning sun before rodan was aware of it he was only feet away and for the first time the centurion felt a thrill of fear wait he cried two of the praetorians drew swords but valerius brought his left hand up to rodans neck above his wolf breastplate and by some piece of trickery a blade twinkled in the morning sunlight its only a very small knife valeriuss voice was soft but it held the pitiless chill of the grave but it will make a very large hole in your throat youve seen a mans throat cut rodan of course you have they might kill me but ill still have the satisfaction of watching you bleed out tell them to put the swords away rodan hesitated but only for a moment he nodded and the two praetorians stepped back if i hear youve been anywhere near my house again centurion i will rip out your guts and hang you with them from the nearest tree do you understand stay away from my family or i promise ill kill you and you know me well enough to believe that i keep my promises the praetorian looked into the dark eyes and saw only certainty there a shiver ran through him as he remembered the day in caligulas circus when he had looked into those same eyes and seen his death rodan had fought on the german frontier he was no coward in his mind he drew his sword and rammed it deep into the other mans belly but he remembered the stories he had heard and his hands stayed by his side valerius studied his enemys face and knew hed won but it was a small victory and he had no doubt it would come at a price he turned his back and walked away hed only gone ten paces when rodan found his voice did i hear a donkey breaking wind the centurions harsh shout broke the silence no im mistaken it was the last gasp of a dying man do you hear that my hero of rome youre a dead man valerius turned to face him but rodan was back with his guards and every one had his sword clear of its scabbard hatred made the ruined face uglier still you dont understand do you it doesnt matter whether you succeed or fail youre going to die its all arranged you and your father and sister are all going to die xxix it wasnt until early afternoon that valerius received word from marcus when he arrived at the apartment he was surprised to find their visitor was saul of tarsus the darkvisaged easterner who had been with seneca at his fathers house my apologies for the delay my lord seneca did not wish to entrust a servant with such an important message nor did he feel it should be carried in written form my profession requires me to memorize quite complex pieces of information therefore he decided it would be prudent to await my return he asked for a wax writing block and on it drew the letters mcvii and a narrow outline that valerius recognized the christians use it as a symbol of recognition saul explained you were correct in your assumption that it represents a fish the men christus chose as his original followers were fishermen so the symbol seemed appropriate see how easy it is to draw he ran over the outline again merely a single straight line then a curve back to cross the initial line and create the tail think of two men talking in the street the one believes his companion is also a christian but he cannot be certain he scuffs his feet in the dust two simple movements and we have a fish if the other man does not recognize it he is not a member of the sect in this instance it is the orientation of the fish that is important was the head pointing up down right or left indicating north south east or west the head was to the left west then the meeting place you are looking for is west of the inscriptions position valerius shook his head in frustration that still leaves a quarter of the city part of the sixth seventh and ninth districts at least saul nodded gravely ah but there is more to learn the seventh district heracles cried see m c vii not necessarily saul cautioned yes the numerals are significant but not in such an unsubtle way the initials m and c indicate a person or a place but to identify this person they must be transposed so cm to those who know cm the name will provide a location so we find this cm and go to his house marcus suggested the bearded man allowed himself a slight smile vii seven the ceremony will be held within seven blocks of the house of the man or woman cm a bitter laugh emerged from the gloom at the back of the room where serpentius had been listening you talk in circles and make as little sense as a temple priest seven blocks in any direction youre telling us to search four hundred houses this is just foolishness saul turned to valerius you must understand that petrus lives in constant danger of discovery or betrayal and has done so for thirty years and more deceit and subterfuge are second nature to him on the one hand he cannot pass on his message without placing himself at the mercy of those he is forced to trust on the other he protects himself by concealing his true identity from all but a few of his followers and those few will be unknown to each other i doubt there are four men in all rome who know who and where he is then he is impossible to find not impossible not for a man of resource the fish pointed west so the meeting place will be to the west of the house you will recognize it by another fish inscription petrus is at his most vulnerable when he is spreading the word of christus this he does once each calendar month on the sabbath day closest to the nones beginning at the seventh hour sabbath valerius didnt recognize the word holy day saul explained these christians have trouble agreeing many things those who wish to distance themselves from the judaeans favour a sunday petrus who is a traditionalist prefers saturday but that means yes my young friend it means that you have less than three hours to locate cm and the building where the meeting will be held three hours to find petrus and deliver him to lord seneca valerius recognized the subtle threat in the final five words but he barely registered it his mind raced lucina graecina knew what the sign meant if not petruss true identity and if lucina graecina knew torquatus now had the information he had three hours to get to petrus before the emperors secret police did they waited until saul had left the building the list valerius demanded serpentius placed it on the table beside sauls drawing of the fish they crowded over it but valerius had already noted the significance of one name cerialis what do we know of him cerialis marcellus the baker one of the merchants who had regular contact with lucina graecina marcus said decisively he has a house in the seventh district beyond the campus agrippae on the via pinciana i was out there yesterday he owns four bakeries in and around the city how long will it take to reach there an hour at most then we need to find the meeting place its a busy area marcus admitted a warren of shops houses and workshops but i have an idea one of the bakeries he owns is also in the seventh district quite close to his home people come and go from a shop like that all the time plenty of room there for a meeting and the place will be empty because bakers tend to work in the early morning i doubt it will take us more than half an hour to find it cloaks and swords valerius said decisively making for the door well meet at the house when youre ready serpentius find your way to the bakery and wait for us there i want to know who goes in who comes out and if the place is already being watched he rushed back to the clivus scauri his mind calculating the possibilities if they could reach the meeting place before torquatus and his thugs if they could get petrus away what then he would be gambling with the lives of twenty thousand innocents did he have the right to do that did he have the stomach he would only find out when he got there when he reached his door he almost collided with a hurrying figure coming the other way father the old man smiled distractedly you mustnt shout valerius you will disturb your sister and now i must bid you good day i am late for an engagement it took a heartbeat for valerius to realize what lucius was saying he heard the shake in his voice youre going to a meeting of these christians the benign mask fractured and the possibilities flew across his fathers face like a flock of disturbed partridge truth lie bluster each second of delay making an answer less necessary you cant go father i wont allow it valerius placed his arm across the doorway to add a physical edge to the appeal cannot will not allow it the words emerged as a whisper of disbelief must not for all our sakes you my own son think to forbid me are you mad not mad father valerius kept his voice low i am trying to save your life lucius hissed with suppressed anger my life is mine to spend where and when i wish and i will not be dictated to in my own in this house your life perhaps but not olivias and not mine torquatus knows they will take you and they will hurt you father and you will tell them everything they want to know everything i have seen it you will give them your friends and your family to stop the pain you will give them petrus and seneca and the man saul i cant let you go the older man stared at him and for the first time in his life valerius saw contempt in his fathers eyes if you believe that young man then you do not know me perhaps you are not my son after all he shrugged his cloak around him raised his head and tried to push past valerius will you physically restrain your father i think not valerius closed his eyes what could he do short of wrestling lucius to the ground he had no option but to let him go then he heard the sound of running feet behind him marcus he pushed his father back to clear the doorway marcus he called i need you in here send the others after serpentius i cant stop you father but marcus can and will he will keep you safe here please do as he says he reached out a hand to touch lucius on the shoulder but the old man flinched away from him like a child avoiding a blow master tiberius the steward appeared from the kitchens and his frightened eyes flicked from valerius to his father do not concern yourself tiberius valerius reassured the elderly retainer it is only a minor disagreement he nodded and turned to walk out into the sunshine but master tiberius insisted the darkhaired slave girl who was here earlier she insisted i give you a message valerius froze yes she said today at the seventh hour tiberius added the address of a street in the seventh district and valerius felt the world stop he turned to his father will ruth be there lucius didnt reply but his ashen face answered for him valerius ran for the door by now it was past noon and he found his progress impeded by citizens returning to their families for the midday meal his way took him beneath the palaces of the eastern palatine past the temple of divine claudius and towards the forum where he turned left through the familiar temples and pillars when he reached the beginning of the via flaminia the road became more open and he was able to pick up his pace but by the time he reached the gardens of the campus agrippae and turned up the hill the streets had closed in on him again and he was forced to push through the crowds as he ran his mind was filled with ruths serene face and he prayed he would be in time he tried to understand what would make his father take such a risk of course one man would be more dedicated in his worship than another and some gods demanded more dedication from those who worshipped them but for most romans the strength of devotion was in direct proportion to the magnitude of their need if a trader was desperate for a big grain contract naturally he would sacrifice a fine ram to mercury to encourage his support each day julia poured a libation to the kitchen god to insure against culinary disaster and valerius would gladly go on his knees before any god he believed could help cure olivia even though he knew deep in his heart that such help was unlikely to be forthcoming but why would a man who had spent his life in the service of rome defy roman law betray his roman friends and risk his life and that of his family for a condemned criminal and a band of ragged judaean fishermen it defied logic he acknowledged that the offer of eternal life qualified and flawed though it was would attract those who despaired of their current circumstances or were naive enough to enter into a pact that effectively sacrificed their free will for a place in some unlikely elysian paradise ruth had been raised to believe but his father perhaps petrus was a magician who kept his supporters in thrall by spells or potions yet he had seen the judaean in his guise as joshua the healer and nothing would have led him to that conclusion lucina graecina a roman to the tip of her exquisitely manicured fingernails had been prepared to sacrifice everything in the cause of christus and cornelius sulla had stayed silent under the most excruciating torture lucina had been no fool and neither though he had acted one was cornelius eventually valerius was forced to give up on a puzzle to which his brain could find no answer valerius here he turned to see serpentius emerging from a side street his narrow face flushed with concern were too late the praetorians have the place surrounded the spaniards words stopped valerius like a hammer blow and he fought the paralysis that threatened to overwhelm him how far to the bakery he demanded however bad the situation there was always the possibility of salvaging something if he had learned nothing else from the disaster in britain he had learned that just up here but we will have to be quick valerius followed the spaniards tall figure through the throng as serpentiuss long strides carried him swiftly ahead they were approaching an open market place when they heard the commotion to one side a crowd had gathered to watch a young black bear dance at the end of a chain serpentius quickly slipped into the anonymous fold but valerius stood transfixed dashing down the roadway was a slim figure holding her blue dress up around her knees to allow her to run more freely it seemed she must be stopped by the wall of people ahead of her but the power of her fear gave her passage now she ran directly towards valerius her long black hair flying and he could see the panic in her eyes and feel the pounding of her heart ruth thirty paces behind and gaining with every step followed four praetorians their ironshod sandals clattering on the cobbled surface and the swords rattling in their scabbards stop her valeriuss heart stopped as he recognized rodans voice with anyone else he would have taken his chances and tried to talk her out of trouble but he knew there would be no mercy from the praetorian rodan would kill ruth just to spite him he lowered his head but not before his despairing eyes had locked on hers for a fleeting second it was enough for the judaean girl to recognize him and through her wild panic ruth felt an impossible surge of hope the christians had been waiting for petrus to make his entrance when rodans soldiers burst in by good fortune she had been standing in shadow on the stairs and the explosion of violence had frozen her in position as the praetorians lashed out with clubs at the small band of worshippers she had recovered enough to slip quietly away to the upper room where cerialis kept his grain it was from there through a narrow window that she made her escape she had been a few feet from safety when one of the praetorian guards noticed and made a grab at her arm somehow shed managed to slip from his grasp tearing her dress in the process but his shouts alerted the others she bit back the impulse to scream out valeriuss name knowing that it could condemn them both the terror that threatened to explode her brain eased somehow she knew he would save her stop that bitch valerius took in the scene in a heartbeat ruths long legs flying as she closed the gap between them the praetorians just twenty paces behind rodan at their head impossible to outrun and even with serpentius at his side impossible to outfight behind him he heard more shouts they were trapped the day by the river flashed through his head in the same instant he saw the flames climbing cornelius sullas body lucina naked in the cage a girl and her baby torn to pieces by wild beasts there was no time for panic no time for indecision the despair that was tearing him apart had to be pushed to the darkest recesses of his mind he had only seconds he reached below the cloak ruths body collided with his her arms searching for him he caught her and held her felt her softness and her warmth and the agitated fluttering of her terror she looked into his eyes and behind the tears he saw a mixture of fear and love and hope he wanted to tell her how he could have returned her love he wanted to tell her instead he thrust the dagger in his left hand up below her breastbone and felt the moment it entered the pulsing life force of her heart the hazel eyes opened wide as she felt the cold iron and a numbing blow to the chest that froze her rigid valerius watched the light within first brighten then fade im sorry the whispered words were the last thing she would ever hear valerius twisted away and melted into the crowd in front of the still dancing bear for a few seconds ruth stood swaying kept upright only by will before her body collapsed just as rodan arrived at the head of his men valerius would have stayed tortured by the need to be close to her but serpentius dragged him cursing towards the main road before they were out of sight he turned to take one last look at the pathetic bundle lying in the street like a heap of blue rags he heard rodan raging at the dead girl before the praetorian pulled back an ironshod foot and kicked her unprotected face christian whore somehow the assault on her lifeless body seemed more of an outrage than the thrust that killed her valeriuss heart turned to stone and his mind cried out for revenge beneath the cloak he drew his sword from its scabbard and moved towards the praetorians no serpentius caught his shoulder no point in throwing away your life as well as hers he dragged valerius towards safety behind them rodan belatedly realized the girl couldnt have killed herself close off the street he shouted no one is to leave the area but it was already too late xxx i had no choice he remembered an earlier valerius a whole valerius who had told himself those very same words and done what was right in the end the result had been the same they would have taken her and burned her or fed her to the wild beasts i had no choice but he did have a choice he could have fought and he could have died saving her and when they had killed me they would have put her to the torture still he could have chosen to kill ruth and die avenging her that at least would have been an honourable end but it would have meant abandoning olivia and my father and condemning twenty thousand innocent people coward the word rang through his brain like a clash of swords maeve the british girl he had loved and betrayed had called him a coward was it true no coward valerius the voice came from a different world and ended with a choked gasp as his left hand found the speakers throat he opened his eyes to see his fathers face darkening above him the rheumy eyes bulging just for a second he blamed lucius for ruths death and might have squeezed harder but the moment passed and he loosened his grip the old man retreated from the bed massaging his throat he stared at valerius as if he didnt recognize him six years earlier he had sent a boy to become a man with the legions the boy had returned a warrior now he realized just what the warrior was capable of and it frightened him but it wasnt the hand on his throat that had frightened him most it was the look in his eyes valerius had become a killer im sorry father you startled me lucius forced a smile not so much as you startled me i think the closed shutters kept the room in darkness but the temperature and the light squeezing through the gaps indicated some hour around midmorning you must not blame yourself valerius shook his head i killed her how could i not blame myself she went of her own free will and knew the risk she took he felt the anger rising within him again did they also take petrus i do not believe so lucius hesitated someone would have sent me word it was his way to let the faithful gather before he arrived it was more secure valerius didnt hide his bitterness so he used them as bait in a trap he used ruth as bait in a trap what would your compassionate christus have made of that lucius turned his face away petrus is more important than any of us than all of us without petrus the faith would wither and die he is the keeper of the truth tell me about him the old man hesitated keeping the secret had become a habit when your mother died at least i still had my ambition and my son who would make that ambition a reality olivia married well you went to britain with your legion and i was content he saw the look in valeriuss eyes i know what you think of me valerius i know that you laughed at my hopes and only accepted your part in them out of duty this family once figured among romes great and i was determined that we should do so again seneca who is my friend said he would help me seneca valerius thought like a spider at the centre of a web manipulating all around him and at what price then olivias husband died and you returned from britain a hero but a partman i looked at you and i saw a candle starved of air a life flickering on the brink of extinction you have recovered your health but when i look into your eyes i know that they have seen too much and you have suffered too much you will never be the same again my son and for that i blame myself you were changed but you were not quite lost to me not yet valerius opened his mouth knowing what was coming but lucius raised his hand no let me speak i will come to petrus in my own time i searched rome and the provinces too to find a suitable husband for your sister but i did not have enough to offer them who would want an alliance with an old man who last had influence in tiberiuss time without mortgaging the estate the dowry i could offer was not attractive olivia is beautiful but that means nothing to the powerful families i courted it was seneca who found calpurnius ahenobarbus valerius sighed a man as old as you are he pointed out with a face like a starved warthog and a reputation for degeneracy that would not have shamed caligula a rich man lucius countered a man with connections to the emperor she should have obeyed me i am her father instead she shamed me and you supported her valerius nodded and support her still finally i had lost everything a razor and a warm bath seemed more welcome than another day of life next morning granta brought the girl to the estate a gift from a friend ruth valerius struggled to keep his voice steady she was different from the other slaves something inside her shone lucius sniffed how does one define goodness she sensed my emptiness and she came to me when i was alone amongst my olive trees at first i sent her away i did not want whatever it was she had to offer but she persisted she too had lost everything she said but her god for ever walked by her side and she would never be alone he protected her from the evils without and within the temptations of the earthly world and the weakness of her own body i too could receive her gods protection she spoke of a man called petrus and she took you to him lucius shook his head not at first petrus must be protected she had to be certain of me and i had to be certain of myself i had never heard of christus but i knew enough of rome and nero to understand the danger there was a moment when i considered handing her over to the authorities and i think she knew it she believed the risk was worth taking to save me that was when i was at my lowest she told me she forgave me and i wept on her shoulder two days later she took me to meet petrus valerius remembered ruths instinctive compassion and her fearless certainty and knew that nothing would have stopped her she had recognized something broken in his father just as she had seen it in him the path she walked would eventually have ended in her death whatever happened that day in the street was it blindness or foolishness that made her ignore the danger no it was much simpler than that she was too good for the world too brave and too honest the purveyors of pain and depravity like torquatus could not afford to have their deeds questioned by the bringers of peace and love eventually only one voice would prevail he saw again cornelius sulla tied to his stake his eyes squeezed shut and his lips moving in prayer and he knew it was not death the young man had feared but only the method of his dying lucius and ruth had travelled to rome together the city was dark and she had led him through streets he didnt know but ruth walked without fear and lucius had taken strength from her strength eventually they had reached a house marked in some way that she recognized she whispered the name of christus and we were shown into a small room where ten others stood cloaked and hooded as we were he shook his head how can i describe the atmosphere in that room at first i believed it was fear because that was what i felt but now i think it was anticipation a desperate need for what was to come then he was there he drew back his hood and looked upon us an ordinary man but with extraordinary presence his eyes sought mine and in that moment i felt as if i was filled with light my fear vanished and i was lifted up and was able to look down upon my own poor corrupt body and those of my fellows before he placed me back among them when petrus had spoken his words had reached out to each person in the room as if he had taken them aside individually but when his father recalled what had been said valerius was transported back to the vicus patricius and the young man with the smashed lips god who created all things sent jesus to die for you and bring you everlasting life follow the teachings of jesus and you will become closer to god petrus had created a network of preachers to carry his message each trained in the precise wording valerius remembered publius sullas words before he died and saw the genius of the plan truly it was like a disease for each messenger was capable of infecting tens or hundreds more with the teachings of petruss god and from these he would select yet more messengers who would in turn carry the message to a new audience worse according to the teachings of christus each slave was of as much value as any knight or senator unless rome could stamp out the new religion it would eventually overwhelm everything romans now believed in if they could no longer worship jupiter and mercury and minerva why should they worship an emperor who was of no more individual merit than the savage who tended their dogs he heard his fathers voice change and take on an almost awed reverence petrus told how his life changed when he was approached by the messiah while he was fishing with his brothers the messiah gods messenger jesus christus when he spoke he spoke the word of god petrus was first amazed then transformed from that day onward he followed the messiah and he has never turned back he witnessed the miracles valerius noted a slight hesitation and realized that some parts of the jesus legend still taxed his fathers credulity he saw the messiah walk upon water the idea was so absurd that valerius laughed and immediately regretted it his father huffed do not make fun of me do you wish to hear the story of petrus or not he didnt wait for answer of all christuss followers petrus was the foremost and when christus died upon the cross he became the leader in his stead he was forced to flee judaea and preached in antioch and caesarea before he understood where the greatest need and the greatest glory was to be found rome since he arrived here he has been tested many times as all our faith must be tested so that it may retain its strength valerius thought again of ruth and asked the question he wasnt sure he wanted answered and has your faith been tested father lucius swivelled his head so he wouldnt have to look in his sons eyes i have been tested yes did your faith survive now the old man turned back so valerius could see the damp sheen on his cheeks god will be the final judge of that xxxi the next morning valerius went downstairs to discover a package had been delivered for him it was of a type only rich men sent to each other wrapped in waxed calfskin and stitched to ensure the contents wouldnt be damaged in a rainstorm he studied it suspiciously in the current circumstances it was as likely to contain an angry cobra as anything more welcome a bright red seal fixed to the leather confirmed his suspicions the imprint was a mirror image of the golden bauble he kept on the chain beneath his tunic it meant the package was from nero he reached for it but drew his hand clear why five days had passed since the emperor pronounced his suspended sentence of death each minute without progress represented another step towards the execution block at first he had been energized by the challenge but with every setback the road became steeper and the weight he carried heavier first lucina graecina then ruth two channels to petrus sealed for ever without petrus he could not save olivia his father brave fool that he was now appeared to provide his only hope but he sensed that lucius had revealed as much as he was ever going to he had never felt so tired or so defeated a voice he hadnt heard for almost four years whispered inside his head cant take it pretty boy i always said you were too soft just a rich boy playing at soldiers valerius laughed short and bitter seneca had once said that the greatest battles are fought within oneself but seneca had never seen a real battle valerius had been in more fights than he could count and he knew that there came a point when it was easier to give up than to stay alive and make the next sword cut that was when true heroes were made he was a hero of rome though he had never wanted or deserved it now was the time to prove he was worthy of the honour he picked up a fruit knife and began working on the stitching it wasnt until he had the package open in front of him that he remembered torquatuss promise more than a month earlier to send him what he knew about the christus sect on his desk lay four scrolls cracked and ragged with age and use and twice as many scraps of parchment the first scroll he picked up was a greek transcript of the trial and conviction of jesus christus by the governor of judaea pontius pilatus he scanned through it and found that it contained little of interest the charges of sedition against the roman empire were far from conclusive but it was clear the man had caused unrest among the judaean community and in the end the priests of the temple had competed to condemn him even so pilatus had been reluctant to convict but the defendants outrageous claims and conduct in court had given him little choice valerius unrolled another of the scrolls and found himself reading an earnest and rather dull treatise on the jewish religion and its offshoots of which the christus sect was only one of a remarkable number it outlined the history and practices of judaism in substantial detail but disappointingly gave little space to the new and rather obscure christians the writers conclusions were given in a dismissive tone as if he had no doubt the sect would fade away in its own good time now that its leader had been disposed of on the face of it there seemed few differences and many similarities between the jewish and the christian religions when the document was written christus worship had been practised exclusively by jews who clung to many of the old religions rites it was said that the coming of a messiah had been foretold by jewish prophets although the man jesus was only one of three or four possible candidates the main distinction between the two religions appeared to be the question of sacrifice which played a central role in judaism but was abhorred by the christians who carried it out only symbolically through the substitution of wine and bread for the blood and body of christus he discovered more of interest among the fragments of parchment which had plainly been cut or torn from scrolls of much greater length they contained intriguing insights into the early life of christus and highlighted a number of contradictions which valerius found fascinating there was little doubt that he had been born in galilee probably in the village of nazareth although another account had bethlehem an unlikely seventyfive miles away laying claim to him the only reference to his childhood was a torn and crumpled scrap of poor quality parchment which had evidently been cast aside and picked up by someones spy or passed through many hands until it reached the emperors intelligence services it had apparently been written in good faith as evidence of the child jesuss power but valerius doubted it would ever find its way into any christian account of their heros life petrus would hardly want to claim that the messiah had either killed another boy or been responsible for his death when he was just five years old little more was recorded until his midtwenties when some transformation had taken place in his life now he was a healer and a teacher a man who believed he was the son of a god travelling across judaea and preaching against the temple authorities railing against sacrifice and the worship of idols according to the source you chose christus could be a man torn by his desires and overcoming them or one untouched by earthly temptation confusingly his supporters seemed to be unsure whether he was man god or some mixture of both in fact this jesus christus appeared to be a remarkably convenient shapechanger who could dazzle and bewitch at will a man or a god if he so chose capable of being all things to all men unless your name was simon petrus petrus and the brothers john and james had been the constants in christuss early life and though they were later joined by other acolytes it was they as far as valerius could ascertain who had been responsible for creating the jesus legend firsthand accounts of miracles came from either one or all of the trio they and they alone had witnessed the anointment of christus by his father god the only discernible evidence that he fulfilled the messiah prophecy from what valerius read without petrus jesus christus would have remained an obscure mystic wandering through the desert in search of his next meal it was petrus who had built up and organized a following of thousands who believed in christus and his god and had so terrified the judaean authorities that they had convinced pilatus to kill him and it was petrus his organization disintegrating around him who conveniently witnessed the unlikely resurrection of christus and restored the nerve of his few remaining followers and petrus who with most jews unwilling to continue their support for a dead messiah received a message from god that the time had come to bring gentiles into the christian fold valerius could barely believe what he was reading true much of it was the work of government agents with a talent for dissembling and an interest in exaggerating the organization they had been sent to infiltrate but even so petruss accomplishments were astonishing jesus christus might be the figurehead but the sect which worshipped him was the creation of one man simon petrus he shook his head half admiring and half in frustration it was all very interesting but it wasnt bringing him any closer to his man he turned over the last piece of parchment another learned discourse on the christian rituals and he was about to cast it aside when one passage caught his eye the christian rite of baptism involves full immersion in running water whereas the judaic is merely a washing or cleansing the christian messiah is said to have been baptized beneath a waterfall in the upper reaches of the river jordan and each of his followers must undergo a similar ritual before they can gain entry to the kingdom of heaven since the christian faith has been proscribed baptismal rites have generally been carried out in larger groups and in great secrecy for a moment he was back by the pool on his fathers estate ruth had been baptized in her homeland and he hoped she had been welcomed into the christian heaven but where were petruss roman converts baptized not in the filth of the tiber that was certain and not in any public place it would attract instant arrest ruth had said that where possible petrus would seek out a waterfall and petrus hadnt struck him as someone who would be diverted by a minor difficulty such as the fact that none was available so what would he do gradually an idea formed in his mind he remembered the ornamental waterfall in neros reception hall not there certainly but for a man of enterprise like petrus an artificial waterfall would not be too difficult to find or perhaps even create the problem was in a city that accounted for each and every drop of its water where would he source the volume needed to supply it the answer came from a harsh braying voice that echoed through his head thousands of gallons a day from the water castle up on the cespian height a veritable river siphoned off somewhere between there and the subura xxxii valerius sent a message to honorius requesting an urgent meeting at the commissioners offices he could imagine the reaction when the engineer discovered that his lawyer was still neglecting his court duties he wasnt disappointed you are a disgrace to your profession young man honorius spluttered we agreed a twoweek suspension yet it has been almost two months since i last laid eyes upon you the villain should have been long since whipped and his supply capped now you have the audacity to come to me seeking assistance in some foolishness but the old mans eyes brightened when valerius explained what he needed so you think these christians are stealing my water its possible if they are it will be in large amounts the last time we spoke you talked of a veritable river that is true from the supply controlled by the water castle on the cespian height but the source is a mystery my investigators have been unable to discover a leak or a deliberate breach valerius hid his disappointment he had hoped the break would be obvious but if honorius and his men were mystified it must be well hidden the water castle on the cespian height overlooked the ancient temple of juno lucina which was an omen if you liked it was one of many dozens ingeniously sited across rome to control the supply of water from the citys aqueducts to the palaces mansions baths and public fountains the ironworks and the tile factories and the state farms that thrived within the city boundaries each castle was sited on high ground and distributed water where it was needed through lead pipes and stone channels as their name suggested they were enormous structures constructed in two or even three sections and each contained a substantial reservoir in case of drought or interruption of the supply from an aqueduct honorius reached below his desk and produced a map of the water system an enormous scroll formed of many different sections of parchment he unrolled it and weighted it down with short sections of worn lead pipe see here a plump finger indicated a point in the centre of the map the castle is one of the thirtyfive supplied by the old anio which takes its waters from the tiber above the twentieth milestone and enters the city close to the viminal gate like every roman valerius knew that the old anio as opposed to the new anio was notorious for the poor quality of its waters known universally as rats piss and of similar colour and taste but honorius insisted on elaborating only six per cent of the supply will ever reach an imperial building and that for the latrines most is used for industry or irrigation the rest ends up in the subura where they are less inclined to complain about a little cloudiness mention of subura reminded valerius that the warren of streets overlooked by the quirinal esquiline and viminal hills provided a perfect refuge for a secretive cult like the christians it was here petrus had set up his herb shop and surgery and close by that they had stumbled upon the young man preaching at the crossroads he noticed honorius frowning now that i consider it the water commissioner mused this would be the perfect supply to tap if one needed any great quantity we treat old anio with a little less respect than we give to the other aqueducts precisely because of the quality of the water and whom it supplies he shook his shaggy head regrettable but understandable it may be that the engineer i sent to investigate this leak did not treat it quite as diligently as he would if he had been inspecting the virgo or the aqua claudia he let out an unlikely chuckle and valerius recognized the enthusiasm of a true professional perhaps it is worth taking a second look honorius summoned a work detail and they set off for the cespian height their route took them through the bustling heart of the subura but honorius was a magistrate whose rank warranted the accompaniment of six lictors and their progress was swift as the crowds parted before the heavy ash rods of the bodyguard as they walked with the lictors at their head and the water gang behind valerius studied the narrow streets and wondered if he was wasting precious time was it really possible to find one man in all of this twenty minutes later they reached the base of the slope and it took another five to climb to the water castle in scale though not in splendour the castle resembled its religious neighbour this was clearly a working building massive and brickbuilt perhaps forty feet in height and forty paces long supplied from the north by a main spur of the anio the water commissioner came to a halt in the shade of the tower and instructed his men to check the exterior for leaks or signs of theft by the by he turned to valerius you must pass on my congratulations to your father he waited for a reaction but none was forthcoming bassus the geologist mentioned it only yesterday strictest confidence of course surely he must have told you valerius nodded distractedly wondering what the old man was talking about honorius shrugged and returned to the matter of the tower you see he explained how it supplies four main channels and numerous smaller ones he called for a ladder as valerius studied the stone conduits and lead pipes i do not normally do this these days young man but needs must and truth be told your little mystery quite invigorates me i havent had so much excitement since the marcia collapsed during the consulship of hosidius geta he hauled his substantial bulk up the ladder puffing noisily and resting every three steps while valerius hung on behind him with his good hand and tried not to look upwards a gentle breeze ruffled the tree tops and from his perch valerius noticed a hawk arc across the city seeking out some sleepy pigeon or sparrow from this height they had an unsurpassed view across the shimmering rooftops to the marbled glory of the forum and the columned temples of the capitoline the heart of rome laid out like some childs toy or commanders sand model valerius was reminded of the wooden table he had seen in neros palace and he wondered again at its purpose did the emperor look upon the cityscape as valerius did now and glory in its colour and diversity and magnificence or were its people only so many ants striving to supply his imperial coffers doubtless both knowing neros capricious nature plus a rulers paranoia that below each roof lay a potential enemy honorius reached a narrow terrace running around the castle and clambered awkwardly on to it over the low wall valerius joined him in front of a wooden doorway set into the brick the water commissioner searched in a leather pouch at his waist and came out with a large key good he frowned absently it wouldnt be the first time id forgotten you the key turned easily in the lock and the door opened with only the barest squeak honorius ducked his head and ushered valerius into the cool of the interior where the rush of water echoing from the stone walls instantly assaulted his ears barred windows set high in the walls provided enough gloomy light to allow them to see each other and as his eyes adjusted valerius was able to make out the inside of the building they stood on a walkway which encompassed three sides of a massive tank of dark swirling water supplied by a foaming torrent at the far end the constant movement and a sensation that something was about to emerge from the bottomless depths and swallow him made valerius instinctively step back and make the sign against evil honorius saw his reaction and grinned it affects people like that the first time he roared above the noise of the water but dont worry we dont lose many still shouting honorius pointed to the wall and valerius caught the shine of metal he made out a number of strange levers of different sizes the smaller levers operate the opening and closing of separate pipes the larger the outlets for baths and factories and the imperial gardens it is a simple system involving pulleys and axles in theory the leakage could come from any of these pipes in practice it is most likely to come from the outlets with the biggest capacity so the leakage doesnt come from this castle valerius found himself shouting even louder than honorius not from the castle itself but certainly from this system we have measured the flow above and below the tower and the supply is down by as much as a tenth i have the men checking each of the four major channels four what valerius took the older man by the arm and led him through the door into sunlight and relative quiet you said four channels no need to shout young man that is correct valerius walked around the terrace leaning out to study the exterior of the castle and the channels running from it i believe i count five large outlets honorius glared annoyed at the attempt to contradict him yes but the fifth is no longer in use it is the conduit which once supplied the glabrian baths see he pointed through the door the opening mechanism has been removed the line has been dry for years valerius was roman born and bred but he had never heard of the thermae glabrianae they were built i believe in the consulate of marcus acilius glabro more than two hundred years ago honorius explained in his dry voice but they were demolished in the time of augustus the family hadnt had the money to maintain them for years the land was handed to the state which naturally sold it to some unscrupulous property developer for housing what land the land where the baths had stood no i meant where honorius thought for a few moments and then walked to the northern end of the castle there he said on the lower slope of the quirinal hill by the vicus longus valeriuss face lit up not the subura proper but close enough to make little difference honorius shook his head i see where you are going young man but it is not possible i assure you the apparatus has been removed and the conduit sealed only the commissioner and his staff have access to these towers come i will prove it to you he led the way back inside and retrieved another piece of equipment from the leather pouch this was a metal tube about a handspan in diameter which he handed to valerius he then lowered himself on to his belly with all the elegance of a collapsing water buffalo before shuffling to the edge of the walkway at a point close to where the glabrian mechanism had once been fixed pass me the ocular young man honorius grunted and be careful with it it is the only instrument of its kind valerius gave him the tube noticing for the first time that one end was closed by a circle of remarkably clear glass the water commissioner shuffled forward until he was able to place the closed end in the water and put his eye to the opening the dogs what is it valerius asked what can you see the dogs honorius repeated this time in admiration how did they do it do what they have jammed the gate open and theyre stealing my water by the lakeful but the glabrian baths were demolished more than half a century ago where is it going valerius stared at the dark waters he didnt yet have the answer to honoriuss question but he was going to find out lucius looked down at the sleeping figure sleeping no not sleeping olivia was dying the draughts of elixir he had smuggled into the house had given her strength and him hope but now both were almost gone lucius closed his eyes and for the first time truly felt old he had been a failure in so many ways convention and tradition dictated that he should regard olivia as a chattel over whom he had the power of life and death but convention and tradition could never prevail over love he had loved his daughter since the first day he had held her tiny body straight from the birthing room porcupinehaired and squealing the dark eyes sparkling even then with the intelligence and curiosity that would never leave them he had loved her as child girl and woman and when the day came to give her away to another man he had wept in the privacy of his tablinum how then could he have allowed his ambition to come before her happiness the truth was that he had looked upon old ahenobarbus and seen not a man but an opportunity where the reality was foulbreathed gaptoothed and potbellied his mind had shown him a glittering reintroduction to the emperors court on the arm of a man he could call son even when the horror on olivias face opened his eyes to reality his pride had not allowed him to acknowledge it he was a roman and he was her father he had the right to command obedience olivia gave a little whimper and he felt as if his heart had been chopped in two he remembered a long night with claudia at his side bathing their daughters sweatsoaked brow when she had fought some childhood sickness as she fought now and the tears of relief when the fever broke the next day surely there must be a way he prayed then for gods help as he had prayed every night since she had become ill he still felt the pain like some halfhealed sword wound of the day he had disowned her as his daughter yet she was his daughter and she had walked from the villa without another word her chin held high and with an expression he had believed was contempt but knew now had been pity the true contempt had come from valerius and how could he blame his son when he himself had been in the wrong yet still his pompous patrician concept of dignity would not allow him to admit it he had withdrawn to his villa and his hills and his olives an empty husk of a man empty of feelings of dreams even of hope there he had wandered aimlessly and become old he touched olivias head and recoiled at the clammy texture of her skin of course she could never have come to him he had no right to expect it but he had dreamed of it every night every night he would go to the door of the villa and she would be there smiling and asking his forgiveness and in the dream he gave it and each morning when he woke he would despair because he knew that even if she came his true self would never allow him to do what was right when news came of the sickness his first thought had been to go to her yet as his horse was being saddled all he could see were the longnosed disapproving patrician faces of men he had called his friends and he heard a voice telling him that if he went he could never again call himself a roman that was when the girl ruth had been sent to him she was only a slave but her presence had opened a door and he had walked through it into the light of god where petrus had taught him that to forgive was a strength not a weakness he was still too proud to reveal his change of heart to valerius but from that day onward he had visited olivia whenever it was possible he had been planning to ask petrus to help her when valerius had tracked the healer down lucius had felt certain the judaean would be able to cure her yet even that had not been enough now all hope was gone what did they have left but despair he bowed his head listening to the laboured rasp of her breathing as his tears stained her coverlet a thin shaft of sunlight moved across the wooden floor to spotlight the deathly ivory of her features it was only then that he understood gods message when all else is lost a man will always have his faith he still had his faith and now he knew what he must do xxxiii they arranged to meet back at the water castle early the next morning and valerius hurried to look in on olivia before he gave his orders to marcus and his men when he reached the house he was surprised to find a slave holding a scroll which invited him to call upon fabia faustina by the time he returned home the sun was coming up for reasons he didnt understand the encounter had left him with the same feeling a blind man has on hearing the final piece slapped into place on a gaming board not knowing whether he has won or lost he had learned long ago in britain not to ignore these instincts but within minutes of reaching the house it was driven from his mind by a new crisis olivia was gone he found julia weeping on the bed and at first he feared the worst the slave girl saw it in his face no master not that it is she shook her head almost overcome with emotion but valerius didnt have time to allow her tears he took her by the shoulders and forced her to look into his eyes tell me julia what has happened to olivia she sniffed and blinked her eyes clear your father took her he said she would die otherwise i didnt know what to think he said this way we will both be saved and gain entry to the kingdom of heaven what did he mean valerius felt his face harden the old fool but he had to be certain those were the exact words he used julia we will both be saved you are certain she nodded certain master the exact words the same expression ruth had used to describe the rite of baptism lucius must have been driven mad by olivias plight if he believed that to dip her beneath a freezing waterfall would save her now he had even more reason to track down honoriuss water thief by the fifth hour he was back at the water castle with honorius glowering like a man who had better things to do valerius had been tempted to go directly to the site of the former baths but when he considered the matter further he couldnt see any reason why the water should not have been siphoned off before the glabrian link ended and several reasons why it should the water flows down through that closed channel just below the parapet he told marcus and serpentius whom he had asked to accompany him you can see that it runs above ground for about two hundred paces down the hill before it disappears among the houses ive had a look and theres no set pattern to its course sometimes its buried beneath the street and runs under the buildings sometimes its a miniaqueduct and passes over or even through them it depends on the terrain thats why we have to follow it the only way well know if the waters still running is to check at one of the inspection hatches he showed them a key honorius had given him to help lift the big capping stones so well inspect at regular intervals when we get the opportunity there has to be a fair chance that the channel has collapsed somewhere along the line so it may be quite close but if it isnt well follow it to the end what happens when we get there serpentius asked maybe its time to be praetorians again valerius shook his head at the spaniards sudden enthusiasm for what he had once despised we have no idea what well find if its what i think it is it will be hidden in some kind of building but probably not a public one we may have to knock on doors or we may have to go through windows you wouldnt want to do that in armour marcus grinned i doubt hed mind one way or the other its never stopped him before honorius will have men here if for any reason we need the supply cut off if we have time well send someone back with word but if not we use the old legionary signal system valerius pulled a polished metal disc from the sleeve of his tunic and raised it in the air so that it caught the sun very simple one flash for off two flashes to restore the supply the people here will give one flash to confirm understand they nodded the tower is in direct line of sight from the south slope of the viminal hill so that is where well make the signal the two water men in the tower have been told to watch for it and theyve rigged up a new mechanism to open and close the gate with a bow to the commissioner they set off down the track that ran alongside the conduit this was a mere side line of old anio but it had been built to last with arches of mortared stone ten feet tall carrying a single channel two and a half feet wide it was also in remarkably good repair with signs of recent masonry work that made valerius ever more certain they were on the right track they found it simple to follow the undeviating course down the slope of the hill but then their problems started once among the houses the aqueduct maintained its line but sometimes between the apartment blocks and sometimes directly through them where the builders had made the water channel part of the structure itself at last they came to a halt its gone the spaniard said looking at the building in front of them as if he expected the aqueduct to make a surprise appearance it goes in the back but it doesnt come out of the front maybe this is it valerius studied the insula it was one of the smaller blocks in the area i suppose its possible but it doesnt feel right he walked to the rear of the building where the aqueduct undoubtedly entered at first floor level and returned to the front where there was no sign it existed they were about fifty paces from the vicus patricius and he followed what he thought was the channels line out on to the street until he found what he was looking for he took the key honorius had given him and placed it in the hole in the stone block which covered the inspection shaft it was heavy but even onehanded he could lift it far enough to see the water flowing beneath for the next two hundred paces they moved from shaft to shaft scrabbling on the ground among the stinking open sewers random dog shit and rotting fruit for the next one until without warning the glabrian link took to the air again and marched in arched leaps to the lower slopes of the viminal where it disappeared once more directly into the hill you think these people are moles marcus asked valerius didnt reply he led them through the alleys at the base of the hill and round to where honorius had told him the thermae glabrianae once the pride of one of romes greatest families had stood they were on the far edge of the subura now on a slight rise where an infrequent unlikely breeze ghosted its way among the houses to take the jagged edge off the intense heat here the apartment blocks were larger and an occasional sumptuous villa clung to the edge of the hill valerius turned to study them and his eye settled on one villa in particular thats it he said thats the one watch out marcus made the gladiators secret sign that warned of danger to the rear valerius forced himself not to look round the place is crawling with praetorians and that bastard rodan is nosing around looking for trouble has he seen us i dont think so then we go back the way we came be natural dont make a fuss a few minutes later they sat together in the shadow of one of the aqueducts arches on the opposite side of the hill how were they waiting for us serpentius demanded they werent waiting for us theyre looking for petrus rodan knows what we know and hell have every rathole in and out of this district sealed tighter than the stopper in a wineskin we cant get in and the christians cant get out hell scoop them up like fish in a net and then theyll go the same way as sulla and lucina does it matter if rodan gets to petrus and a few of these christians burn marcus asked the emperor cant blame you just because the blacks got there first valerius said bitterly it matters to me he told them about his father and olivia well you were right marcus said we might get in but wed never get back out with an old man and a sick woman they have the house watched from every corner anyone who tries to leave will be picked up the minute they stick their nose out of the door valerius looked up the hill past where the channel disappeared into the rock what if i could get in would it be possible to create enough of a diversion to allow me to get my father and olivia away we could try the scarred gladiator said but i dont see how you can get in unnoticed the place is guarded as tight as a mouses arsehole there must be another way valerius began to climb the hill minutes later they lay flat on the ground looking over the edge of the hill above the villa which had caught valeriuss attention the viminal was occupied mainly by a patchwork of apartments and small allotments but here where the hill was steepest and the soil thin and worthless it had been left clear the slope fell away sharply almost a cliff and the roof of the building was probably fifty feet below them well thats that marcus said if you try to get down there youll be lucky if you only break your legs valerius had studied the face with equal care and he realized that marcus was right this was no conveniently fractured dacian rock it was weathered almost as smooth as glass what was more it was visible from the streets below where rodan and his men waited there had to be another route they searched the edge of the hill for an alternative and valerius was beginning to despair when he noticed something unnatural in the dried yellow grass it took a few moments before he recognized it he was standing over yet another of the inspection shafts he walked back to the far side of the hill and did his best to work out the course of the aqueduct when he was satisfied he stood for a moment with his head bowed he tried to visualize the interior of the channel below his feet could it be done when he looked up marcus saw the same look in his friends eyes as he had seen in gladiators making their final appearance in the arena a confused mix of fear resolve certainty and confusion valerius handed marcus the polished bronze disc and reached down to place the key in the capstone signal the water tower to cut the supply the two gladiators looked at him in disbelief you cant just do it valerius barely recognized his own voice he knew that if he hesitated for even a second he would turn and walk away with rodans praetorians surrounding the villa there was only one way into the baptism chamber through the subterranean passage ten feet below him he was more frightened than hed ever been in his life more frightened even than in the final suffocating hours of the temple of claudius there he had persuaded himself he was already dead here he had to live for olivia and for lucius reluctantly marcus used the bronze mirror to send the single flash that warned the men in the water castle to stop the flow help me with this serpentius hesitated and valeriuss fear made him snarl help me or by the gods ill send you down there instead the spanish gladiator scurried to valeriuss side and together they heaved the stone aside serpentius took an involuntary step back as the shaft opened up at his feet valerius stared into the dank black opening the inspection holes theyd checked at ground level had been perhaps three feet deep with the water clearly visible at the bottom this disappeared into the darkness like a wormhole leading to the river styx it was two feet in diameter with rough steps cut into the rock to allow a man to descend safely a lamp and a rope at least serpentius pleaded i will fetch them quickly we dont have time if the christians finish their ceremony theyll walk out into a trap and my father and olivia will be taken valerius stripped to his loincloth and handed his clothes to marcus but took the belt with his dagger and hung it from his neck he sat on the lip and closed his eyes his father had talked of faith in his god now valerius called upon his own faith faith in himself faith in his courage he was a hero of rome he wasnt frightened by a little dark passage messor had given him the idea messor the skinny legionary his comrades had nicknamed pipefish who had shown more bravery than all the rest put together when he had slithered into the sootblackened hell of the hypocaust below the temple of claudius the attempt had been doomed of course and poor pipefish had died nailed to the temple door as the flames of boudiccas fire ate at his flesh but he had got through the hypocaust and that was what gave valerius hope hope but how much pipefish had been whip thin and greased with olive oil valerius was probably twice his breadth and his shoulders were heavily muscled from his daily training with sword and shield how wide was the tunnel how deep he heard the water sound change below him from a violent rush to a musical gurgle soon how wide how deep he wouldnt know until he got down there at least if it was too narrow he would be able to turn back with his honour and his conscience intact his father and olivia might die but he would have done his best he tried not to hear the voice in his head willing the shaft to be impassable the gurgling faded to a whisper it was time he turned and his foot searched for the first step wait it was marcus what now the diversion how will we know when you are ready to come out of the villa valerius cursed himself of course he should have thought of that one more mistake that could kill him he cast his mind back to the front of the villa it was a large building surrounded by a walled garden with a heavy door set back from the street he remembered three windows at first floor level all of them visible from the alleyway where he would have to make his escape give me my cloak and tunic marcus handed over the clothes and valerius bundled the heavy cloak into a ball with the tunic at its centre ill wave the cloak at the window above the doorway count to one hundred and then start the diversion i dont care what you do just get them away from the alley but dont set the city on fire though the sun was high above them he had never felt so cold chilled to the very centre of his being with a last glance towards his companions he climbed into the shaft xxxiv the chamber stank of damp and the steps under his bare feet felt as slippery as if they were coated with ice he had to grip tight with his single hand until his toes found and secured each foothold whilst holding the bundled cloak in the crook of his right arm at least he had the comfort of the circle of light above him and the anxious faces of marcus and serpentius that almost filled it he reached the bottom of the channel identified by thick oily weed between his toes the fear was more palpable now as if someone was gripping his legs and pulling him downwards he filled his head with olivias face and fought the feeling with all his strength carefully he manoeuvred so that he was facing in the direction of the villa before dropping to his knees there was just enough space left to allow him to wriggle his legs backward into the opposite section of the tunnel his nose was two inches from the brick face of the shaft and still he couldnt bring himself to break free from that lifegiving circle of light for a moment he felt a wave of claustrophobic terror and his bladder filled with ice water rope serpentius had been right he should have waited with rope he could have tied a line round himself and they would be able to pull him back if he became jammed if he went without rope he might be trapped down here for ever he could go back coward he heard the word ruth had never spoken ringing in his head he closed his eyes i call on messor and the spirits of colonia to aid me the whispered words sounded hollow in his ears but the very act of saying them had the effect of the herbinfused ale the britons drank before a battle he felt warmth again and his courage returned he lowered his head and inched his shoulders forward into the pitch black of the tunnel mouth it was tight very tight he had to hunch his shoulders to avoid being wedged against the ragged masonry but was it tight enough to give him a reason to turn back he wriggled to make himself more comfortable how far maybe seventy paces to the villa and what then but he knew there was no use thinking about what then because that could drive a man mad what then meant the channel narrowing to a tiny pipe or diving deep underground where a man would die screaming with no hope of ever being heard he felt for the hilt of the knife to make sure it was still attached if dont think just go at first he tried to use his hands to haul himself along but the walnut of his right could gain little purchase on the weedcovered stone and he made slow progress eventually he discovered that by pushing the bundle of his cloak forward then digging his elbows into the walls and wriggling as if he were a snake he was able to create a rhythm that gained him a few precious inches at a time the tunnel roof was so low he felt it pressing down on his back and he suddenly realized that there truly was no going back from nowhere the raw acid of panic filled his throat and poured like liquid fire into his chest his head roared he couldnt breathe he couldnt move his limbs thrashed helplessly in the confined space and he knew that if he didnt stop now he would truly go mad think his mind screamed the word think his brain frantically clawed for some memory that would save him a face no faces meant people and people died faces meant ruth and maeve and cornelius and publius sulla and the girl whose baby he had promised to save faces meant people he had failed suddenly he was in a battle line his shield tight against the next mans a sword firm in his hand death was all around him but it meant nothing here for this was the brotherhood of the warrior the brotherhood of the shadow and in the shadow he felt calm return he was still trapped in a dark airless tomb but he was valerius again a hero of rome he gritted his teeth rammed his elbows into the walls and edged another six inches time and space meant nothing in the dark even the urgency to save his father and olivia was diminished to a distant white spot at the entrance to a halfforgotten world where light and air and life actually existed all that mattered was effort and motion push the bundle dig in the elbows squirm push he was chilled to the bone but the sweat coursed from his brow into his eyes he imagined a galley slave hauling interminably at massive oars the muscles of his arms fiery bars of glowing iron knowing that his agony could only ever end in death push the bundle dig in the elbows squirm push again something whirled and danced in the dust storm that was his brain and men came from the darkness to greet him legionaries who would tear a mans throat out with their teeth and then share a bloody wineskin with you men you could despise for their depravity and love for their loyalty lunaris who had stood beside him to the very end at colonia laughing zama who had taken a returned roman pilum in the eye in boudiccas last battle even crespo who had hated him more than any man before or since yet had earned his respect for his fearless savagery in a fight not so tough now pretty boy soldiers and from each of them he took a soldiers strength and a soldiers ability to endure an ability he had all but forgotten push dig squirm push the air was thick now almost solid in his throat and he found it ever more difficult to breathe he stopped for a moment to rest he was glad if gladness was an emotion permitted to a man buried alive that he had declined serpentiuss offer of lamp and rope the one would have killed him and the other made a coward of him the flame of the lamp would have eaten the air he had heard of it from slaves who had served in the deep mines first the light dimmed then vanished then the men started to die as he realized the significance of that thought a split second of panic returned like a lightning bolt through his brain the air couldnt reach his mouth and nose from the shaft because his body was blocking the tunnel but there should be air from ahead because if there was not it meant there was no way out if he had had a rope around his waist at that moment he would have tugged on it for dear life and screamed to be hauled back to the shaft but he didnt have a rope so he endured and pushed dug and squirmed he tried to concentrate his waning mind on what he would do when he reached the outlet kind jupiter let there be an outlet but it was impossible to know what to expect a simple drop from the level of the inlet channel something more elaborate and therefore more dangerous what if there was a grille they would be wondering by now what had happened to the water and he prayed that they wouldnt simply call off their meeting no they wouldnt do that first they would investigate petrus would not gather his people at so great a risk only to abandon this most sacred of rites at the first sign of a problem for the first time he realized there was a possibility they might kill him he didnt think petrus was that kind of man but who knew about the others christus had led a band of rebels there would still be men among his followers who had fought well he would give them rodan to fight that was where the greater danger lay thats what he would do and while they were fighting the bastard he would escape with lucius and olivia as long as there was an outlet back on the surface marcus and serpentius had watched horrified as valerius disappeared into the narrow shaft the way a man might make the first steps on his journey to hades now they tried to work out what to do next we cant just walk away and leave him in there what if hes stuck serpentius demanded marcus studied the black hole in the earth and what if he is are you going to go in after him ill face anything man or beast in the light of the sun but i wouldnt go in there for all the gold in mars ultor serpentius had faced death many times in the arena and lived to spit in its face he had known fear although he would never admit it to anyone but when he stared into the mouth of the shaft it was like looking into his own grave we should never have let him go down how could we have stopped him did you see his eyes valerius is like a gladiator who has had one fight too many and goes out on to the sand seeking death he would have gone down that shaft even if it was filled with fire the spaniard smiled sadly and shook his head he isnt looking for death old man hes challenging it your friend valerius will die some day but he will die fighting for his last breath and screaming defiance in deaths face it doesnt matter the veteran gave the inspection hole a final glance hes beyond our help now all we can do is come up with a diversion and pray that he lives long enough to need it serpentius nodded agreement thinking about the diversion would stop him thinking about the poor bastard stuck down in that black tomb he pulled the dagger from his belt and held it up to check the edge he didnt notice when it caught the sun a mile away in the water tower on the cespian hill a man noticed two flashes of light valerius knew he must be close to the end of the channel he didnt have any evidence for the assumption only the knowledge that he was nearing the last of his strength and if he wasnt near the end he was going to die no one who hadnt experienced it could comprehend the strengthsapping toll of being able only to move a few muscles at a time for what seemed like hours on end in reality it could only have been minutes but if his strength ran out now he knew he was finished he felt it before he heard it a rumbling in his lower belly and a compression in his ears that made him wonder if the tunnel was about to collapse then the noise like muted thunder and a pressure from behind like a gathering storm desperately he began to wriggle forward real fear giving him new strength he didnt know what was behind him but he knew whatever it was meant danger and the only way to escape it was to go forward the pressure built around his legs until it was something almost physical and the thunder grew ever louder a powerful wind whistled in the gaps left between his body and the tunnel walls at last he understood what was coming and the knowledge turned fear to outright gutwrenching terror this was death he scrabbled desperately at the tunnel walls anything to advance him by a few more inches but he knew it was pointless there was no escape from the flood the shock as the freezing water smashed into his lower body paralysed him in a heartbeat it was all around surging in powerful jets past his shoulders and head with a force that would have knocked a cow off its feet he screamed with the despair of defeat and closed his eyes and waited for the end but although the water continued to pour past him above and below it didnt immediately cover him and he found he could continue to breathe slowly his mind informed him that his body blocked most of the pipe and was acting as a dam the force was so great it even pushed him along a few inches he began to haul his way forward the water gushing past his face in frothing spurts and he found he could move faster all he had to do was stay alive and pray but disaster lay a few feet ahead when the water channel had been pushed into the hill more than two hundred years earlier slaves had chipped their way through every foot of the unyielding rock from either side and from the centre where the inspection shaft had been sunk the surveyors did their work so well that the diggers from each section met exactly where they had predicted almost when the tunnellers from the baths side met the tunnel from the centre they found that they were slightly off line and compensated by making the final twenty feet slightly wider than had been specified it was only a few inches but when valerius met the joining place he started to drown in a second the water was all around him he became one with the flood and entirely at its command his mouth and nose filled and he began to first choke then suffocate he held his breath until it felt as if his chest was about to explode before finally giving in to the inevitable the darkness all around crept into his body and his bones an inner darkness that he knew preceded death suddenly it didnt matter any more he was free of responsibility free of pain free of life the last time he had felt like this had been in the final moments of the temple this time there would be no escape and in a way he was glad he felt himself floating as the gods carried him off to whatever otherworld the fates had prepared for him then he wasnt floating but falling and a second later the euphoria was knocked out of him as he smashed into something solid and his eyes snapped open to see a bright light he lay on his back spluttering as a cascade of water battered his chest gradually he realized he was lying in some kind of pool he knew he should get up but his head didnt seem to be connected to his body and there was something else something he had to do for a moment his mind continued to whirl then everything came back in a burst of clarity the cascade meant he was in the baptism chamber he struggled to his knees and turned a ring of astonished faces stared back at him he recognized a lawyer from the basilica julia and his plump little wife among the ten or so men women and children his unorthodox arrival had scared into a frozen tableau of terrified eyes and gaping mouths the room had been prepared for the ceremony but they must still have been waiting for petrus the ultimate survivor he saw with relief that there was no sign of his father or olivia an oil lamp flickered in one corner and the scent of some kind of burned spice hung heavy in the air on a table in one corner a loaf of rough peasant bread lay beside a sevenbranched candelabrum and an overturned flagon of wine which had stained the stone floor beneath blood red the walls were windowless and bare apart from a single device painted on the white plaster above the oil lamp it was another of the pieces of symbolism the christians were so fond of a large x cut by a vertical stroke with a small half circle attached to the top the symbol stirred a memory in him and he recalled seeing it once before it was the same as the one that had been scratched on the chest where petrus kept his healing powders this must have been part of the old baths complex possibly a holding tank before the water was distributed to the caldarium and tepidarium when the villa had been built it had been kept as a storeroom at some point the outlet had been stopped up but the owner no doubt one of petruss christian converts had reopened it and somehow they had gained access to the water tower on the cespian and restored the supply a moment of unnatural silence was followed by a clamour as they all started speaking at once valerius pushed himself to his feet and picked up the sodden bundle of his clothing hauling the tunic over his head and wondering why he should be concerned about his nakedness when they were all likely to die in the next twenty minutes meanwhile the flow from the inlet above him slowed to a trickle serpentius and marcus must have heard the thunder of the water from the inspection shaft and signalled for it to be cut off again by now they probably thought he was dead but that wasnt important all that mattered was to get these people out of here quiet he used the soldiers voice that had once cowed a legionary parade ground you are all in danger but im here to help you i need everyone to stay calm the cries dropped to a subdued murmur whose house is this a wiry balding man raised a hand at his side a woman clutched a halfgrown girl who stared at valeriuss wooden hand his was another familiar face valerius searched his brain for a name probus no pudens that was it aulus pudens who had made a fortune supplying the arenas a merchant notorious for cheating his suppliers and as unlikely a christian as any man in rome im leaving you in charge which way to the house pudens hesitated for a moment it looked as if he was about to protest but his wife whispered something in his ear he pointed to what looked like an alcove in the far wall and pushed his daughter forward praxedes will show you through there it leads to a corridor valerius picked up his cloak and followed the girl this way she said she had long blonde hair and a sweet voice made sweeter by the little whistle that punctuated her words through the gap in her front teeth she explained what had happened someone said the soldiers were here we were praying to our lord jesus for salvation when you popped out of the pipe like a giant water vole everyone screamed even daddy but i thought it was funny why is your hand made of wood she led him to a door which took them through a storeroom into the villa he left her playing with a doll and dashed upstairs where he could look across the square to where marcus and serpentius should be waiting for his signal he dropped beside a window and opened the shutter just a crack and saw disaster marcus had said the praetorians had a guard on every corner that had been an hour ago now the open area in front of the house was flooded with soldiers a small army it had never been a very good plan now it was exposed as a hopeless one rodan had the christians in a sardine net it was only a matter of time before he lost patience and sent his men to storm the villa valerius slumped down by the window and closed his eyes what had he got himself into think there had to be a way out he remembered the building as he had seen it from above could he climb the cliff it was possible but not with the fools he had left down in the baptism chamber the idea burrowed into his brain like a tapeworm leave them then what did they mean to him hed come for his father and olivia he wasnt responsible for a rabble of sheep who hadnt the wit to save themselves yes he felt sorry for them but that didnt make him their keeper he heard a shuffling noise and looked up to find praxedes standing a few feet away holding the doll out so he could see it this is my sister her name is olivia he shook his head at the madness of the world when the gods called the tune there was really no option but to dance along he reached out and took the little wooden figure with its black wool hair does your father have any rope by the time he got back to the baptism room the men had recovered some of their nerve valerius studied the wall of belligerent faces he knew he had to take control but he waited long enough for praxedes to whisper to her father the bald man frowned but with a puzzled glance at valerius he followed the girl from the room when they were gone the young roman called for silence there was no point in shirking the truth this is an illegal gathering of a sect proscribed by the emperor and if you do not do what i say you will all die he met each of their eyes in turn as he spoke have you any idea of the fate nero has in store for you there are a hundred praetorian guards out there waiting it would be better to throw yourselves on to their swords we are not frightened to die for our beliefs it was the lawyer of course it would be the lawyer i watched cornelius sulla burn valerius saw the man go pale are you prepared to watch your wives burn or your daughters no then follow my orders without question if you want them to live all eyes turned to aulus pudens as he returned to the room carrying several coils of rope praxedes had shown valerius the thousands of fathoms her father imported from gaul for the circus maximus where it was used to haul in the great sails deployed to keep the sun off the customers i need as many sections of rope spliced together as it takes to make three hundred feet clear that table and bring it across here valerius looked up at the black hole which had almost claimed his life hed discarded the idea of climbing the cliff and then using the rope to pull the others up because the climb would have to be made in full view of the praetorians who would simply send a patrol to meet them at the top that left only one option he pointed at the outlet this is the way i came in and this is the way we will all leave he heard a man gasp and a womans scream was stifled by her husbands hand across her mouth all of us i will lead with the rope and when i shout each of you will follow me into the tunnel in turn holding the rope it is dark and it is frightening but it is passable and you must call on your god to banish your fears no i cant i cant ill stick the whimper came from the lawyers buxom wife valeriuss decision had been made easier by the fact that whether through abstinence or good fortune most of the christian adults seemed to be as thin as skinned rabbits he went to stand beside the woman who though a little plump barely reached his shoulder see how large i am compared to you lady if i can fit you would go through twice he gave her a reassuring smile and patted her husbands shoulder help her she will need your support there is an exit midway through the hill just thirty paces away the distance was at least double that but he told the lie boldly and nobody challenged it once i reach it i will begin to pull you through you will be able to push with your feet and your hands and i will need all the help i can get but do not lose your grip on the rope with your gods help you will only be in the tunnel for two or three minutes now this was the moment of truth the moment that decided whether they lived or died who will be first behind me no one would meet his eyes and as the seconds passed he knew hed failed i will praxedes broke the silence as long as i can bring olivia valerius could have kissed her thank you lady you are as brave as you are beautiful we will wrap olivia in your hand he looked towards her father tie a loop to her waist and set her in the tunnel after you have counted to fifty when ive reached the exit shaft i will pull her in a short way so that you can follow he turned to the others when pudens shouts i will haul them both along so the next person can follow then the next the slippery weed in the tunnel will help me but you must also use your strength he saw eyes drifting to the damp shaft and sensed the reluctance growing if you stay here you will certainly die if you have courage and faith you will live wait valeriuss heart sank at the call from praxedes father but pudens only raised his arms and called on their god to protect them when he had finished they all looked towards the young man with the wooden hand we are ready valerius went to where the table had been placed below the outlet he stripped off his tunic and tied the rope around his midriff just for a second a voice screamed in his head not to go but with a grunt he hauled himself into the stinking blackness it was only when he was inside with the damp stone pressing in around him like the walls of a tomb that he wondered why none of them had asked what would happen if the flow resumed he supposed it was because the answer was obvious this time he had the benefit of familiarity and he made good progress once he got back into the rhythm that had carried him to the chamber he had one moment of minor panic when the walls closed in where the tunnel narrowed but it passed quickly true every time he pushed himself along another few inches he thought he could hear the distant thunder of water coming to swamp him but the rope barely hindered him and in a few minutes he saw the light of the exit shaft ahead he felt a tug on the rope and realized praxedes was telling him to pull her along he hauled six feet of line into a coil and moved on stopping to repeat the manoeuvre when he heard the shout from her father the rest would have to wait until he reached the shaft he only hoped he had the strength to pull them all with a few feet to go he froze at the sound of voices had rodan sent a patrol to the hill after all if he carried on they would arrest him worse they might replace the stone cap and trap him in here with the others keep that bloody knife in your belt he recognized the gruff welcome tones of marcus and he could have wept what difference does it make hes drowned anyway or he would have signalled serpentius replied we didnt stop the water quickly enough nobody could survive for that long youll be dead if you dont help me out of here you idle spanish bastard valerius shouted his words magnified and made ghostly by the shaft the call was followed by the long silence of two men pondering a voice from the otherworld hello valerius had never heard serpentius sound frightened he clambered up blinking into the sunlight marcus stood back from the shaft eyeing him warily serpentius was a yard further away and looked ready to run for his life are you going to help me valerius said or must i wait until rodan does with a shout the two men ran forward and pulled him out to lie gasping by the shaft entrance we thought he waved them away untying the rope from his waist weve no time for happy reunions haul on this line but gently now and i promise you a catch the like of which youve never seen before they stared at him and he knew how mad he appeared but he didnt care pull he said we have souls to save praxedes was first her golden head appearing in the bottom of the shaft valerius descended a few steps to help her but she refused to come out until he had rescued olivia first she was followed by her father and mother and then one after the other the christians emerged filthy and bewildered to fall on their knees and give thanks to their god the lawyers wife was second to last her eyes tight shut and finally her husbands face appeared some thanked him most just gave him wary glances before they set off towards their homes pudens was last to go i have nothing now he said running his hand through his daughters hair except my life and my family for them i thank you valerius asked him if he had somewhere to stay and he said he did praxedes gave him a gaptoothed smile and the little family walked down the hill hand in hand may your god protect you valerius whispered he turned to find marcus and serpentius looking at him as if he had just come back from the dead which in a way he had what now marcus asked respectfully first serpentius can steal me some clothes then we go back to work an hour later they set off back towards the forum valerius noticed a crowd lined up outside one of the government buildings behind the senate house whats going on marcus spoke to a vendor at a nearby fruit stall and returned with the information its some kind of census posters have gone up all over the city ordering the judaeans and a few of the other provincial groups to register with the state or theyll lose their rights to stay in rome valerius closed his eyes time was running through his fingers how long had it been six days and he was still no closer to the rock than he had been on that first morning he looked at the long line of men women and children if he didnt succeed these people would all die he had asked pudens for information about petrus but the villa owner had sworn on his familys life that he didnt know where he could be found others organized the baptism ritual petrus came and carried out the ceremony then he left today the location of the ritual had been betrayed but by whom are you feeling all right marcus looked at him as if hed grown an extra eye valerius shook his head wearily how could he have taken so long to make the connection today ive been buried alive and almost drowned but ive just realized that the worst is still to come xxxv theroom looked and felt different how could that be in so short a time murals he had always regarded as artistic and exotic now appeared merely vulgar and lewd in the harsh light of day the wall hangings and the furniture seemed tired and worn the scents which had once made his senses reel were no longer sweet but cloying and only just masked the unmistakable musky odour of the aroused men who queued here to couple with her fabia looked different too she had lost the last bloom of youth in a few short weeks the powder on her face was no longer to enhance her beauty but to camouflage the lines in the corners of her eyes flesh that had been taut and firm had taken on the pasty texture that came with separation from the fine bone structure beneath a new face a middleaged face she sat on a couch opposite him straightbacked and refusing to meet his gaze you had no right to come here without an appointment her voice sounded like ice cracking in a frozen stream you have never complained before you have never come here coated in filth and stinking like a sewer cleaner you have never forced your way past my doorkeeper while i was entertaining a friend now i will have to have him whipped for failing in his duty valerius laughed remembering the scene the outraged underling and the semitumescent senator making his escape still dressed in the distinctive robes of a vestal virgin your doorkeeper or the friend she hissed like a snake it was clear that everything theyd had was gone but now he asked himself if it had only ever existed in his imagination you called me here last night for a reason she darted a glance in his direction but looked away before he had the chance to read its meaning to enjoy your company and exchange gossip you were once an entertaining companion although it is difficult to believe now i remember the verbal exchange as very onesided now his voice was as cold as hers he should have felt hatred or perhaps pity but instead an empty space lay where his heart had been you were keen to hear the latest news of my quest for petrus and interested in each and every detail about the theft from the water castle we were friends then friends are interested in each others lives what we talked about was known only to honorius the water commissioner and two men i trust with my life hired thugs you mean perhaps but men i can trust as i once trusted you he saw her face go pink beneath the powder but was it anger or fear then she smiled at him and he was almost disarmed as the beauty shone from her like the sun breaking from behind a cloud oh valerius is that what this is about she said lightly you would take a mercenarys word against mine who is to say that old honorius a man who has never been known to speak one word when ten will do did not blurt out your plans as he devoured one of his legendary midday meals surely that is not enough to break up our friendship valerius rose from his couch i suppose it is possible that honorius might have talked to someone but how did the praetorians react so quickly they were exactly where i thought i would find petrus an hour before we were he was behind her now caressing her neck as he had once done to give her pleasure but of course they would be torquatus does not want you to get the credit for hunting down the christian yes he said and she knew a thrill of fear as his voice hardened again and his left hand twisted in her hair and yanked her head round to face him but that doesnt explain why torquatus has been one step ahead of us ever since nero gave me this task it doesnt explain why cornelius sulla and lucina were arrested when the only people who knew what was said were gaius valerius verrens and the lady fabia faustina thats right fabia i didnt even tell marcus and serpentius what passed between cornelius and me only you you betrayed them his grip grew tighter and she cried out with pain you condemned them to the stake and the cage you condemned ruth to death too because lucina told torquatus where the next meeting was to be held she struggled but he kept his grip and you betrayed olivia and my father and for that i can never forgive you i saved your father fabias shout echoed from the walls valerius hesitated reluctant to believe her but he knew the truth when he heard it he relaxed his grip and she collapsed sobbing on the stone floor you saved him she raised her head and her eyes were filled with an explosive mixture of pain and shame and righteous fury yes i saved him saved him from nero saved him from torquatus the doddering old fool would have been dead a month ago if i had told torquatus everything i knew i saved him today when i sent a slave to warn him not to go to the christian ritual but she fought to regain her composure its true that i told torquatus about cornelius and lucina just as i have told him most of what you tell me valerius shook his head hed known it since the moment hed seen rodan waiting for them and perhaps for much longer but part of him still didnt believe it why why would you betray me we were friends i thought that once valerius but would a friend have accepted my love without any intention of returning it while i lay there thinking of you as my lover you never thought of yourself as anything more than my client a caring affectionate client perhaps but a client all the same think does that make you better or worse than a degenerate like posthumus in his pretty dress he pays me and takes what he has paid for you pretended you were my friend and used me just the same which of you made me more ashamed of what i am im sorry he said and he truly was but there were things he had to know that still did not give you reason to betray me no it did not i have known shame since the day seneca destroyed my father and forced him to send me to that place but i buried my shame deep and i disguised it with a smile i had manners and beauty and i learned quickly and that saved me from the worst of it the lowborn and the dangerous with their stinking breath and their dirty crawling hands and hungry mouths they kept me for people like you arrogant perfumed patricians with power and money i learned about power and i learned how to part you from your money and in time i was able to buy myself out and set up here but the shame remained valerius i knew i had lost my honour and that i would never marry and i gave up hope until i met you when you came to me i understood that here was someone as broken as i britain had come close to destroying you just as what i am had come close to destroying me your missing hand was as much a burden as my lost virtue so i allowed myself hope until i realized that hope was in vain i didnt know about seneca if i had it might have been different her face transformed into a bitter smile no valerius because you think of seneca as your friend and gaius valerius verrens stands by his friends if you learn only one lesson from today let it be never to trust your friends but seneca didnt betray me you did and seneca is not my enemy so who is she shook her head again still so loyal valerius who has most to gain if your father dies and his son is implicated in his plotting ask seneca about the marble ask him about the geological survey he has just had carried out on his estate the estate which borders your fathers valerius remembered the day honorius had congratulated him on luciuss good fortune and another building block fell into place fabia nodded now you understand but you are right seneca is not the man you must fear most that man is torquatus the name was hardly a surprise but it still didnt explain the lengths to which the praetorian prefect had gone to sabotage a mission for which he was partially responsible i can understand why torquatus dislikes me even hates me but not why he would want to destroy me i am no threat to him and never could be why would he want me to fail when he was instrumental in giving me the mission to hunt down petrus and the christians in the first place because if you fail torquatus succeeds he cant allow you to find this petrus when he could not that is why he has had rodan dog your footsteps ready to pounce on petrus with the christian in his grasp he would denounce you as a traitor who knew all along that your father was one of the people you sought if your enemies have their way you and lucius will die on neighbouring pyres valerius and the emperors greatest amusement will be in deciding who burns first that still does not explain why torquatus should be so determined to have me killed or what i have done to earn so much hatred she laughed short and sour you mean apart from being you so handsome and so strong and always so certain he mentioned it once quite casually as if he was discussing a horse that needed disciplining a family matter he said some cousin who had served with you in britain the man was a centurion in the twentieth legion who sent torquatus a letter claiming you had destroyed his career and demanding help to gain reinstatement he died in the british rebellion but our praetorian prefect was left to salvage the familys honour such a trivial reason to die dont you think valerius stared at her it didnt seem possible crespo rapist bully murderer and thief the man had been a senior centurion in valeriuss cohort it had been valeriuss accusation which had forced crespo into the service of catus decianus britains procurator who had made the decision to strip boudicca of her lands and her people crespo had vowed revenge for that humiliation before he could fulfil his promise the centurion whose rape of boudiccas daughters helped ignite the rebellion had met a terrible end at the hands of the iceni queen now crespo had reached from beyond the grave to destroy valerius he could almost hear the gods laughing he shook his head you could have come to me instead of betraying me some of the old spark returned and her eyes flashed you can be such a fool sometimes valerius if i had come to you we would both be dead while you are close to finding petrus torquatus has to keep you alive so that he can take the credit he tried to have you killed in dacia because he already had lucina and thought he no longer needed you you must believe me i have always tried to protect my friends whatever torquatus has asked of me and however he has asked it her voice was close to breaking and valerius realized how much anguish lay behind those words a man like torquatus had many ways of inflicting pain so that the wounds did not show she recognized the look on his face yes pity me valerius for there is no escape for me in this life if you can find petrus and present him to nero you can still thwart torquatus but the only escape for fabia faustina is death no he said come with me and we will fight him together you mean die together if i leave rome without torquatuss permission he will know that i have betrayed him perhaps he knows it even now if i stay it will give you the time to do what you must do he hesitated but he knew she was right the only chance he had to find petrus was to leave her another friend failed he got up to go all his anger forgotten wait valerius there is more you need to know she told him about poppaea in many ways she is very like me trapped in a loveless world and forced to sell herself to stay alive perhaps that is why we became friends you think you know nero but you do not his subjects see a charming young man who wants to be loved for his talents yes he can be irrational and even vicious if the mood takes him but men look at his line shake their heads and ask how could it not be but in the night in the privacy of his palace he is different more beast than man and willing to couple with either if torquatus is able to provide it poppaea is not a wife to him no woman could be she is flesh as we all are and she survives by being willing flesh but not too willing for she must be seductive as well as available compliant but a challenge for his talents in the bedchamber and of course she must entertain as we all must entertain who enter beyond the doors of his personal quarters what sordid piece of theatre will torquatus provide tonight will it please him will we be able to suffer it with a smile will we survive it fabia stared into the distance and valerius knew that she was only telling him part of what went on in the palace she wore the same look as a soldier who has stared death in the face lost in the otherworld that is at the centre of every human soul poor poppaea she confides in me all unaware that i am part of the trap torquatus has set for her he knows that she hates him more than she hates nero and he fears her because her access to nero makes her powerful to torquatus that combination is a threat which cannot be ignored he too is like a beast and will lash out at anything which endangers him she confides in you and yet she has come to no harm her voice took on the fierceness of a mother leopard protecting her cubs believe me valerius fabia faustina values her friends torquatus may have me by the throat but there are things that i tell him and things that i do not then with your protection she will survive she does not need me he said it with finality and she shook her head at his failure to grasp what she was saying you dont understand only by saving poppaea can you save your father and olivia and only by saving poppaea will you find petrus how can that be it is very simple poppaea augusta sabina has become a christian the room seemed to suddenly go cold nero knows she shook her head nero suspects then torquatus knows torquatus believes he knows but he has no evidence yet and without evidence he cannot denounce poppaea if he does and nero does not believe him his own life will be forfeit how cornelius sulla first intrigued her then seduced her he opened her eyes to a world beyond the pain of this world somehow he arranged that she meet petrus and from that day onwards she was a different poppaea a poppaea prepared to challenge neros tyranny to fight him from within his own palace still valerius was not entirely convinced you protect her but you gave cornelius to torquatus he could have exposed her with a single word if you had known cornelius you would know that he would never betray her he sacrificed his brother to blind torquatus to poppaea then went through the torments of hell to ensure she stayed hidden that was the kind of man he was if he gave his life for poppaea he gave it gladly valerius remembered the burning red eyes in the blackened skull and wondered at the strength of will it had taken to stay silent nero was right not to underestimate the christians an enemy without fear is an enemy to fear and you fabia am i a christian she laughed surely valerius you understand by now that i am beyond saving i have sent too many to their deaths for an unguarded word to believe i have any value yet i hope i still have some honour in your eyes each time i provided torquatus with an opportunity to bring you down i provided you with one to thwart him he studied her wondering if that was true and knowing that in the end it didnt really matter he had to trust her how do i find petrus by finding poppaea and where is poppaea she sailed for neapolis this morning she will visit her people at the family villa while nero makes his preparations for his great performance at the theatre in the city he shook his head you are talking in riddles what does a trip to neapolis have to do with petrus you have spent days looking for a waterfall valerius is that not true then perhaps it will not surprise you that the villa at oplontis has the finest ornamental waterfall in the empire she laughed at the sudden flare of comprehension poppaea has yet to be saved to be saved she must be baptized by petrus who has persuaded her that everyone who was to take part in todays ceremony should be sanctified along with her including your father its madness yes valerius but there is a joy in such madness is there not they are prepared to risk everything for what they believe do you believe in anything that much he shook his head once he had believed in the empire and would have been happy to die for it but not now only my family then go to neapolis and reach them before torquatus perhaps by saving them you will save yourself torquatus do you think i am his only spy xxxvi pay off sextus and felix and thank them for their services then take the seal and find a boat that will carry us to neapolis what about you marcus demanded ill join you at ostia i have some business to deal with before we leave he rode north taking the via salaria towards the estate at fidenae but on this occasion he rode past the gate and into the hills behind the neighbouring villa seneca lay on a couch in the atrium relaxed after his afternoon bath and close to falling into the shallow mesmeric sleep he found conducive to deep and stimulating thought this was his favourite time of day and the servants had orders not to disturb their master on pain of dismissal when the arm closed like a band of iron round his throat he had just begun to reflect on the most interesting contradiction between friendship and trust which in itself raised an interesting philosophical debate in other circumstances he would have liked to continue the internal discussion but the chill of a dagger against the voluminous folds of skin at his neck quite drove it from his mind he had only a basic knowledge of anatomy but enough to know that the point was less than an inch from the big vein pulsing in his throat one thrust would bleed him dry in less time than it takes a person to swallow a cup of wine he didnt understand why the analogy came to mind but it was oddly comforting to know that a man could still think logically at the moment of his death give me one reason why i shouldnt kill you the harsh nasal voice cut through his musings when he tried to reply all that emerged was a bullfrogs croak the arm loosened but only a fraction allow me enough time friend he spluttered and i will give you a thousand reasons why you should not kill me i am lucius annaeus seneca and therefore the act of dying and what lies beyond hold a certain fascination but i have voluminous works to complete before i am ready to explore that particular avenue whether you live or die is beyond your control old man the arm tightened again and seneca was embarrassed to hear himself give a little squawk of fear he had often pondered the inevitability of death and hed concluded that clinging to life must be mere folly when it only postponed the inescapable but now when death appeared on his own doorstep he was unable to take his own advice it seemed that no matter how brave the outer man an inner man existed with a more fully formed sense of his own mortality whoever is paying you to kill me i will triple the offer he choked what makes you think i wouldnt gladly do it for nothing seneca sighed inwardly it had been worth the attempt but that voice despite the gruff disguise he believed he recognized the tone and inflection with the little thrill of fear which accompanied the knowledge came also a tiny chink of hope how fortunate to have a murderer who might be open to logical argument valerius you would not harm an old man who taught you all you know it would be a pity to extinguish so much learning would it not but not to extinguish so much corruption i could have forgiven you your avarice and your duplicity but not the way you used my father the tone offered no reprieve but the words hinted at a possible avenue of escape your father is a very foolish man valerius seneca risked the criticism knowing that it was only the truth foolish valerius agreed and vulnerable he should have been able to rely on the support of his friends and family but both failed him and for that i am sorry but his family did not betray him only his friends did that the words were accompanied by a slight tightening of the arm muscle and a liquid squirt of fear shot through senecas bowels now he knew how the hangmans rope would feel i would know nothing of that he blustered no but i would seneca began to mumble a denial but another increase of muscular pressure silenced it he was close to choking a hairs breadth from a crushed windpipe valerius continued i know how my father was led towards a new and dangerous enthusiasm the way a blindfolded bull is led to the sacrifice and i know that the judaean girl ruth was inserted into his household to ensure his conversion i also know who was responsible for these things i this time valerius used the knife to stifle the words he knew seneca too well to get into a semantic argument with him if any man could talk his way from beneath the executioners axe it was neros former mentor what i couldnt understand at first was why was it possible my fathers neighbour and friend was acting in his best interests an argument could after all be made that a certain comfort was to be derived from the teachings of the man christus particularly for a lonely old widower who had lost his way the girl ruths involvement was entirely innocent driven by her faith and an inborn goodness valeriuss muscles tightened involuntarily when he mentioned ruth and it was only when seneca squirmed that he realized he was killing the philosopher he forced himself to relax his grip that innocence led to her death but that would mean nothing to you she was just another piece to be used then discarded in this greedy game you were playing please shh there is more surely you are interested it is a fine story of a man who became too clever for his own good my father was not the only fool when you summoned me i came and when you charmed me i was convinced i was working for the interests of rome and not those of lucius annaeus seneca it was only after i walked in on your visit to my father that i began to realize the scale and subtlety of the web you had snared us in better to have kept saul hidden there is too much of petrus in him and he shows too great a knowledge of the christians not to be one himself he is petruss rival for the christian leadership is he not he released his hold long enough for seneca to nod so a perfect alliance seneca uses sauls information to persuade his old pupil valerius to bring him petrus and thereby save his career and his life in the same instant saul becomes the undisputed head of the christians a man more ably equipped to spread the word of christus than a simple fisherman the only flaw was petrus who was too clever for us all he paused just long enough for seneca to be certain that his time was up once valerius had felt something like love for this man but there could be no pity for an old fraud who would sacrifice every friend he had to recover his position even then i might have forgiven but that was not enough for you you had to have more where is it he felt seneca freeze i dont understand the hint of pleading in the philosophers voice told valerius that he understood very well seneca gave a little squeal as the knife point drew blood how you must have rejoiced when the surveyor handed over the report about the marble deposits on the border of your estate you would keep it close you never were trusting seneca and i doubt you have started to be now tell me where it is or i really will have to kill you and find it myself a shaking arm pointed in the direction of a nearby cabinet valerius drew the other man to his feet never relaxing his grip together they walked until seneca was close enough to reach the polished wood the cabinet had two doors but seneca ignored them instead he reached below the top on the lefthand side and worked his fingers until valerius heard a distinct click and some internal mechanism sprung the lid back to reveal a pair of scrolls pick them up the philosopher did as he was told and they worked their way together back to the couch unroll them with his left hand valerius took the papers the first was the surveyors report on the hills to the south valerius gave a low whistle as he read the sums involved congratulations master seneca it appears you have substantial deposits of marble beneath your property with a conservative value of tens of millions of sestertii and a possible value of hundreds of millions but what is this by some misfortune the bulk of the deposits enough to make a man as rich as crassus and pompey combined lie beneath your neighbours land oh what a temptation that must have been for a man who has never known the meaning of the word enough that was when you saw the opportunity to ensnare your friend lucius and when his trusting son naively followed him into the net you had exactly what you wanted as soon as petrus was taken the father and the son were to be denounced the one as a christian the other for failing to report him he dropped the survey and picked up the second document how fortunate then that trusting old lucius has already mortgaged the estate to his old friend seneca see he has even signed it although the signature is a little blurred and shaky but then he is an old man he threw the second scroll beside the first you even made common cause with your worst enemy to ensure nero did not snatch it away from you does torquatus know how much it is worth of course he doesnt if he did both estates would be confiscated by the state and torquatus would already be sleeping in your bed but did you really think you could trust him let seneca think the praetorian prefect had betrayed him the truth was that torquatus liked to boast even to a woman he believed he owned body and soul seneca was too astute to deny the fraud he knew the two papers screamed his guilt as clearly as a written confession all that remained was the courts sentence it would be a pleasure to kill you old man a little more pressure and you will lose consciousness then it would be a simple act to drag your carcass through to the bath and slit your wrists and allow the fates to choose whether you drown or bleed to death the philosopher bridled if i am going to die he spluttered then at least do me the courtesy of making it look like murder thrust deep and let no man believe lucius annaeus seneca took his own life in despair i have a friend who would beg me to take that advice but i have another use for you he loosened his grip and seneca collapsed forward coughing valerius showed him the dagger to let him know the respite was purely temporary and produced another pair of scrolls from inside his tunic he picked up a block of wax from a table at senecas right hand and allowed it to melt over an oil lamp so it would drip on the top scroll your seal quickly now seneca frowned but complied he tried to read what was written on the parchment but valerius whipped it away before repeating the process with the second two scrolls he explained both witnessed by you and two others both recounting the tale of your deceit including the parts played by saul of tarsus and torquatus commander of the praetorian guard enough to have all three of you executed if anything happens to me or my father one scroll will go directly to the emperor the other to the senate seneca flinched but a surge of relief made him feel quite giddy he was going to live valerius picked up the geologists report and the forged transfer paper and held them over the candle only dropping them when the flames reached his fingers the philosopher watched with a puzzled frown what will you do now valerius you are a rich man or at least a rich mans son the money that lies beneath that hill would guarantee you a place in the senate with your intelligence money and the right friends who knows what you could achieve a consulship given time certainly valerius marvelled at the conceit of the man i will do what nero has commanded me to do i will find petrus and i will deliver him to the emperor he saw the disbelief in senecas eyes not for you or for him but for the twenty thousand innocents who will die if i do not deliver him do you think he would count it a good bargain your christian his life for twenty thousand others would that not place him even above his master the messiah yes he would count it a bargain the deep voice came from behind them how long had saul been listening had he been prepared to watch seneca die without calling for help valerius decided he had never met anyone quite so ruthless the cilician continued of course petrus would welcome the opportunity to give his life for others my brother in christus has so much to atone for after all but jesus died for all men my young friend not for a mere twenty thousand if you can find him petrus will be a willing sacrifice but first you must find him xxxvii the earth was angry today snorting steam like breath from a hardridden horse quintus corbo often rode out to the little height two miles from neapolis to gaze across the garlanded crescent of the campi flegrei perhaps great homer had stood here looking out to puteoli and beyond over the glittering expanse of emerald and blue waters to the pretty little harbour town of baiae and the naval base at misenum certainly the poet had known of the phlegraean fields because he had written of them in his odyssey where they had provided the inspiration for the forbidding lair of polyphemos the cyclops more recently puteoli had known fame as the harbour from which the emperor gaius caligula had built his threemile bridge of ships in a show of manic extravagance that had done as much as anything to bring him to his just and painful end emperors and their peculiarities were on corbos mind today but that was not what brought him here he regarded himself perhaps unjustly as little more than an enthusiastic amateur in the science of natural phenomena but the gods had placed him in the best position in the entire empire to witness it here in the gigantic boiling pot of the ash fields epicurus of samos had first expounded the theory that the explosive underground activity in and around the mare nostrum was a direct effect of air penetrating deep into the earth and taking on a new and ferocious energy which made it more dangerous than any other element the only reason the entire world did not explode was because of the phenomenon he was witnessing at this very moment when a certain amount of violently disturbed air had amassed in cavities below the surface the earth allowed it to escape through fissures and boreholes thus relieving the pressure he had walked in the foulscented hills behind baiae and seen the hundreds of hot springs and sulphur pools where the escaping gases created great jets of superheated steam that dotted the landscape which the uneducated sometimes mistook for giants normally this manifested itself in a low fog but today it appeared the entire peninsula was on fire a slight shudder made his horse skip beneath him that was another sign that the trapped air was attempting to find a way out but it was such a common occurrence that he barely noticed the tremors had become more frequent in the past few days but even corbos scientific mind had failed to register the fact that might have been because of his other concerns everything had to be perfect for the performance the following night corbo had recently been appointed one of four aediles in neapolis and good fortune had given him responsibility for presiding over public entertainments rather than the gods forbid the workings of the sewers the city boasted one of the finest theatres in the empire and he took great pride in the events he sponsored there neapolitan audiences were notoriously difficult to please and regarded themselves as the most cultured of the empires citizens and the emperor undoubtedly agreed because tomorrow night he would be performing in front of them if anything went wrong corbo knew it would be the death of him he frowned and scoured his mind they had been preparing for months but was there anything else he could do the theatre manager was an arrogant pedant but he knew his job and was as aware as corbo of the price of unforeseen disaster he had made certain that every seat would be filled and filled with men and women who had reason to love their emperor to doubly ensure the reception was nothing less than rapturous corbo had recruited a thousand young men of artistic disposition who had been tutored in the various proper forms of applause bombi imitating the drone of bees imbrices the beating of a hollow vessel with a thin stick and testoe which was similar to imbrices but with a more bass sound these he would strategically position in groups of fifty around the theatre to sing the emperors praises at the appropriate moment members of the city guard would be on each of the gates to bar known malcontents the programme itself was a carefully guarded secret with each performer sworn to silence they had been chosen for their aptitude rather than their brilliance there could be only one star in this firmament he sighed and turned his horse back towards the city no there was nothing he could do but say a prayer and sacrifice a lamb to the goddess if minerva could not help him no one could the scent of juniper drifted to him on a light breeze from the great conical mountain on whose lower slopes he rode he smiled it was a comfort to live in the shadow of such a beautiful benign and fertile giant lucius dabbed at his daughters brow with a cloth as the covered wagon lurched through the mountains the sheet covering olivias body had become soaked with sweat and heat radiated from her flesh as if from an open fire from time to time small moans of discomfort escaped her desiccated lips and he felt the guilt like a nail scraped across the inside of his skull for the hundredth time he repeated the prayer calling on his lord god to give him the strength to endure of course he regretted her ordeal but he couldnt regret the impulse that had made him bring her it would have been much easier if the ceremony had gone ahead in rome but the message he had received had been unequivocal olivia moaned again almost a squeal and he placed a jug of water against her cracked lips and poured a little into her mouth he knew her suffering increased with every mile they travelled on this rutted track but she must endure as he must endure they were being tested but if olivia survived the test she would be saved one way or the other neapolis was within a days drive and the villa an hour beyond it another bump made him groan his aged bones were not suited to this primitive form of travel he thought of petrus and the judaeans burning eyes immediately relieved the pain that racked every part of his body petrus would be waiting for them lucius didnt fully understand why they were travelling to the villa but rome had become increasingly dangerous for a christian would he have the strength to die for his faith when he was in the presence of petrus and worshipping with the other members of the sect he drew courage from them alone he found it more difficult to be brave ruth had helped him to understand his weakness and to fight it he didnt realize how much he had needed her until she was gone seneca had sent her to him he was fortunate to have the philosopher as a friend at first ruth had been just another slave but goodness and beauty shone from her like the light from the sun the moon and the stars combined he had become infatuated with her but he would never have admitted it to anyone now he was alone again and death frightened him he smiled sadly not quite alone valerius was a good son who cared for his father if it were not for valerius he would have died along with ruth at one point he had even believed his son might be brought into gods community and saved but the day of ruths death had revealed a valerius he could never reach a man estranged from every god roman or christian his son would have prevented him from making this journey if he could and might even now be attempting to overtake him that was why he had ordered the driver to avoid the main route from rome tomorrow god willing they would reach the villa olivia would be saved and his own soul placed for ever in gods keeping twentyfive miles to the west poppaea augusta sabina struggled to conceal her nerves she had been sick twice already but her illness had nothing to do with the motion of the enormous liburnian galley the ship was the fastest vessel afloat and could outrun any pirate who decided that the riches of an imperial convoy were worth the risk of taking on the heavy naval escort no the problem was what she had agreed to do was nero really studying her with concern or did the pale eyes hide a more sinister interest fear made her mouth dry and she took another sip of wine she lay on one of a pair of ornate cushioned couches in the shadow of a wide awning of gold cloth cooled by the gentle salt breeze created by the ships motion all she could think of was petrus was he becoming reckless bad enough that the most hunted man in rome had somehow infiltrated her quarters in the guise of a dealer in fine jewellery but to ask her to host this ceremony she had pleaded with him but his voice and his eyes were so persuasive only by testing our faith and our courage can we truly come to god he had said only by sacrifice will we gain the keys to the kingdom of heaven and she had agreed it was as if he had hypnotized her with his talk of a new and better world beyond the pain of this one she so wanted to be brave but all she felt was trapped even if she went on her knees and confessed nero would kill her along with the rest he would do it quietly out of the public eye but she remembered the christians her christians being torn apart by the wild beasts the girl trying in vain to save her child at least that monster torquatus wasnt accompanying them he had stayed behind in rome to deal with some crisis but that didnt mean his spies would stop watching her you are very pale my dear perhaps you would like to sleep poppaea flinched at the voice even though this was nero at his most charming she declined his offer to have the sides of the pavilion dropped to give her privacy she preferred to see the sun sparkle on the waves like a million tiny diamonds watch the yelloweyed gulls squabble over scraps in the wake and feel the soft breeze on her skin suddenly each second of life seemed more precious than before how had it come to this nero studied his wife with the detached interest of a collector of fine statuary torquatus had hinted at a dark secret but with torquatus it never did to accept denunciation without proof unless of course it suited your own ends one had to admire the praetorian prefects commitment to the destruction of others at another time he might have found the power struggle between them quite entertaining but in his own way he had grown fond of poppaea perhaps it was an effect of becoming older but increasingly he found it difficult to maintain his enthusiasm for a life of constant excess all he truly wanted was to sing upon a stage and receive the adulation he deserved instead the gods had burdened him with responsibility for an empire that encompassed more people than the census takers could count or perhaps not the gods it was his mother who had set him on this path with her limitless ambition the galley and the sea reminded him of agrippina and he felt that familiar twinge of regret that she was gone not guilt the fault was her own but yes regret that she was no longer here to guide him if only she had supported him instead of trying to control him it would all have been so different agrippina would have recognized the christians for the threat they were foul creatures spreading their filthy philosophy across the land like so much manure each dropping encouraging a new crop of rabblerousers what was it that drew people to them how could men risk their lives at the behest of an obscure criminal whose words should have died with him on the cross he had personally questioned cornelius sulla in an attempt to understand them better but instead of begging for his life the man had tried to convert him it was a kind of madness for which there was only one cure the soldier valerius had been given his opportunity to find the leader of the sect but he would fail a strange choice of investigator but torquatus had been most persuasive in urging his appointment these christians lived among the judaeans like diseased cattle hidden in a herd so the judaeans would die and the christians would be wiped out with them without the leadership of the judaean christians the sect would undoubtedly wither and die but he intended to make an example of the roman converts he would squash them one by one the way a beggar crushes lice between his fingernails poppaea lying back pale and beautiful on the padded couch watched as he resumed his place in the bow and took up the first of the songs with which he would astonish the people of neapolis she preferred the screaming of the gulls xxxviii white smoke wreathed the rocky headland a mile to the east and for a few moments it looked as if the whole length of the peninsula was ablaze the captain of the small cargo ship noticed valeriuss interest the fields of fire he said morosely a terrible place where people say giants walk at night a good landmark for a sailor though even when you cant see it for the mist you can smell the sulphur a mile away valerius thought the bay beyond the headland must be one of the most beautiful places he had ever seen a sweeping crescent of rugged cliffs and sandy inlets stretched almost as far as the eye could see dominated by an enormous steepsided cone of a mountain clad in a ragged cloak of greens and browns at the foot of the mountain nestled the city of neapolis a glittering ribbon of cream and ochre surrounded by the scattered white dots that represented the grand villas of rich romans escaping the furnace of a roman summer beyond the mountain rugged peaks stretched into the distance and formed an imposing backdrop that glittered in the heat of the morning the sea around the ship was a restless blanket of blue and aquamarine broken by the outline of three islands which dotted it like jewels laid out on a piece of shimmering silk to valeriuss surprise they sailed past the main port too many tax collectors the captain grunted see that floating brothel he pointed to a golden ship larger than any other craft moored in the harbour it means your masters in town and the place will be crawling with his guards thats the place you want over there he pointed to a spot on the shoreline directly ahead where a river flowed into the sea creating a natural harbour oplontis they landed thirty minutes later and serpentius and heracles unloaded their gear while valerius and marcus walked from the harbour into the town to find horses they were directed to a stable beyond the walls where valerius negotiated the hire of four reasonably sound mares and asked directions to the villa owned by poppaeas family a mile south on the pompeii road overlooking the sea big place youd have to be blind to miss it the stableman laughed eyeing valeriuss expensive tunic they might even offer you a job it being harvest time harvest time of course why hadnt he considered it earlier all the way south valerius had been trying to work out how petrus would get his christians into the villa unnoticed now he had his answer groups of itinerant farm workers would be travelling up and down the country from estate to estate supplementing the work of the local slaves petrus could turn up at poppaeas gate and her overseer would allow them in feed them and house them in the slave quarters it was perfect they could pass olivia off as a wife who had been taken ill on the journey fabia had said poppaea would complete the journey overland while nero stayed in neapolis to prepare for his performance the following night she would travel with only her own personal retinue stay at the villa for two nights then return to celebrate his triumph with him if valeriuss calculations were correct that meant she was already at the house they walked back to the harbour through narrow streets that sloped down towards the sea stopping for a drink at a public fountain close to a bakehouse the water burbled and trilled as it fell from the pipe into a cistern and valerius drank deeply from a cup scooped from the pool his nose caught the scent of baking bread and he bought two loaves and handed one to marcus as they emerged from the arcade into the sunshine he felt a slight tremor what was that marcus felt it too but he only shrugged they must be milling the grain sometimes you can feel it in the next street when one of those big grinders is working as they walked away they didnt notice that the flow from the pipe supplying the fountain had slowed to a trickle the steward stared suspiciously at the travelstained bearded figure in the thick robe if his mistress wished to speak to the man alone there was little he could do about it but what she had to say to an impoverished wandering labourer was entirely beyond him petrus allowed himself a smile as the man bowed low and backed out of the room am i really so repellent he asked poppaea you said no one would be aware of your presence yet the first thing you do is ask for an audience poppaea tried to hide her anger her feelings for petrus alternated between something close to worship and intense irritation at the casual way the judaean played with other peoples lives that was hardly the act of someone who wished to keep his existence here a secret remember you do not only place your own life in danger but mine and many others he bowed in acknowledgement of the rebuke i merely wished to pass on my thanks for your hospitality poppaea frowned she would never accuse petrus of lying but sometimes omission could be just as great a sin what he didnt say was that his presence in this chamber increased his hold on her and her reliance on him in equal measure she could never deny knowing him as long as the steward lived once that complication might have been swiftly dealt with but petrus taught that all human life was sacred when will you carry out the ceremony your mother and father are already on the way to neapolis to greet the emperor and the servants i have made arrangements only one or two remain and unless i call for them they will not dare to come near the pool then the ceremony will take place once the moon has risen you will be baptized and brought into the community of god and your soul will be taken into his keeping god will live within you and you will live for ever with gods blessing poppaea closed her eyes and a wave of relief washed over her never again would she need to fear nero and the others will know nothing of it they have never heard the name poppaea he assured her nor do they know exactly where they are only that i have been given the use of the villa while the owners are elsewhere they will be taken into gods keeping in a separate ceremony she sniffed blinking away a tear i still do not understand why they needed to be here because baptism carries with it duties and obligations his voice was gruff but gentle by agreeing to share your salvation with others less fortunate and allowing them to witness it you have proved yourself worthy of inclusion in gods church by your willingness to place your life in peril you have already become closer to god we will be gone before sunup and you may tell your steward that i vexed you in some way and you dismissed us all poppaea nodded tonight then he smiled tonight they like their privacy serpentius said that usually means they have something to hide marcus agreed valerius studied the villa complex from the hillside serpentius was right a high wall surrounded the buildings but the owners had ensured they could not be overlooked from the hill by planting large trees at regular intervals around the inner perimeter of the wall the combination looked daunting but he knew it was an illusion the twin barrier had been created to stop people from looking in not breaking in the three men were dressed in civilian clothing with light summer cloaks to hide the fact that they were fully armed heracles joined them after leaving the horses fed and watered in the shade of a nearby olive grove how long to get us over the wall serpentius valerius asked about twenty seconds the spaniard grinned the trees mean we cant see them but also that they cant see us i can get us inside just about anywhere valerius focused on the little he could see through the trees he guessed that every olive tree barley field and vineyard between here and the town was owned by the people who lived in the villa and that was where most of the slaves would be working a twinkle of reflected sunlight alerted him to a potential threat not the sun glinting on a blade or spear point but on water a pool which meant now he saw it camouflaged against the same grey stone that formed the hillside an aqueduct that cut through the trees about five hundred paces away an aqueduct that supplied the pool and its waterfall we go over there valerius pointed to where the aqueduct met the wall he looked up at the sky which was a clear blue dome when the sun reaches its highest as they rested in the shade valeriuss eyes never left the villa complex below somewhere down there behind the white wall and hidden by the trees lucius and olivia waited he had cursed his father as a fool for getting involved with the christians but could he really blame him for doing what he believed was right to save her life whatever happened he had to get them out safely he reached for the boar amulet at his neck then remembered he had given it to olivia would he live to regret it if fabia had been wrong and poppaea had brought her imperial bodyguard the whole thing had the potential to turn into a bloody disaster xxxix deep beneath the mountain in a process which had begun many millions of years earlier the western tip of one of the fourteen major plates which make up the worlds surface had reached a point where the pressure creating its momentum was insufficient to overcome the resistance of the crust through which the fiftymiledeep slab usually travelled at a rate of one inch every year normally the tip would have been pushed deep underground to be melted into fiery magma by the heat from the earths core in this case it would remain locked in place until the pressure behind it could build up a force powerful enough to shift it into motion again already the pentup energy was making the earths crust creak with the strain when the shift happened the giant plate would cover in a single instant the distance it would normally take ten years to travel that moment was fast approaching they made their way diagonally across the hillside to valeriuss left the mountain with its coat of vines and olive trees rose steeply until the peak was lost in a shimmering haze to his right the slope became gentler as it fell away towards a turquoise sea that had never looked more welcoming the intense heat was suffocating even serpentius who had been brought up among the sunbleached hills north of astorga complained that if it became any hotter he would melt away rocks scorched by the sun reflected and magnified its power until it seemed every drop of moisture was being sucked from their bodies sweat soaked their clothing and ran into their eyes creating salty deposits that quickly turned to grit and made them squint all the harder into the unyielding glare after what seemed like an eternity they gathered in the shadow beneath the final stone arch before the aqueduct crossed the wall into the villa gardens valerius turned to the others he had come to a decision im going to do this alone he said wait here until i get back if theres any sign of trouble give a single whistle and go back to the horses ill join you there if i can but this is my fight now marcus youve risked your neck for me often enough already serpentius and heracles made a cradle with their joined hands that allowed valerius to boost himself to the top of the wall he ran his fingers along the top course half expecting to feel sharpened spikes or the jagged coral landowners sometimes used to protect their property satisfied it was clear he used his elbows to lever himself up so he could peer through the trees the elevation gave him a wonderful view across the villa complex to the sea beyond and the island of capri lying like a sleeping giant ready to wake and march off into the distant haze the villa made senecas house look like a modest family home a sprawling twostorey masterpiece of pale stone white marble pillars and terracotta tiles extended for at least four hundred paces down the slope the centrepiece flanked by two separate colonnaded walkways was an enormous rectangular pool of sapphire blue surrounded by white marble dotted with equestrian statues at the near end just below him an ornamental waterfall fed the pool the fall had been created by diverting part of the supply from the aqueduct across a wide marble step to form a foaming cascade to his left exotic trees provided shaded refuges among the geometric pattern of pathways the rush of water apart the only noise was the hum of insects struggling through the overheated air he slipped from the wall using the trees for cover and made his way down the slope now he was screened from the villa by the selfcontained wings that flanked the pool he stopped and listened again hed decided that his first priority must be to familiarize himself with the layout of the complex somewhere among the labyrinth of corridors rooms and private gardens poppaea awaited her salvation at the hands of petrus he doubted the judaean himself would be in the house if he was right that the christians had come in the guise of farmworkers the area he sought was the slave quarters ever since fabia had revealed poppaeas secret he had been wrestling with the question of what to do next at first hed approached it like a military problem but quickly realized that the situation called for subtlety not strength he could not go charging up to the door poppaeas first instinct would be to protect petrus even if he could get inside she would deny everything and hed be no closer to the judaean his father or olivia somehow he had to reach them without her being aware if the ceremony had taken place already so much the better but he doubted it journeying overland petrus would only have reached neapolis late the previous night or early this morning giving poppaea little opportunity to ensure the privacy they needed for the ceremony no it would be at night tonight he stopped in the cover of a group of laurel and oleander bushes still he wasnt far enough round to see beyond the angle of the massive building as he waited ready to move again he remembered the pale almost ghostly aura that had surrounded olivia the last time hed been with her for some reason her features were indistinct as if he was seeing her through a thick fog he had once been told by a priest that the memory faded as the loved ones soul faded was he too late he shook his head to rid himself of despair and as he did so he caught a whisper of leaves he rose and turned in the same moment his left hand automatically reaching for his sword too late something smashed into the side of his head and the world turned first grey then black his last thought was that he had failed them again waking was too gentle a word for the endless struggle through the tormented darkness when he finally opened his eyes he became aware of a darkened room with unpainted plaster walls and rough peasant furniture and voices which faded as the owners realized he had recovered consciousness he heard a door close and at first he thought hed been left alone you are very tenacious my young friend and very fortunate the soft voice came from close to his right ear i dont feel fortunate valerius could barely hear his own words unless its because i am in the hands of a healer my head feels as if it has been crushed by a bear your head i can cure petrus smiled a slit throat would have proved a much greater challenge valeriuss left hand made an instinctive movement towards his neck before he realized how foolish the action was my throat feels better than my head he assured the physician true agreed the judaean but isaac who acts as our guardian would have had it otherwise he is a former soldier he added as if that was explanation enough valerius raised his head but petrus placed a gentle hand on his shoulder you should rest i am sure you have many questions but perhaps they can wait a great weight seemed to be trying to drag the young roman back down into the darkness then he remembered olivias features fading before his eyes no he said urgently there is no time there is always time petrus said we are all in gods hands but perhaps you came here for your father and your sister valerius shook his head i came for you you are the man they call jesuss rock petrus gave a sad smile of course and you have soldiers no troops three friends you will come to no harm from me not from you the judaean sighed wearily but the very fact that you are here means you are a threat and not just to me valerius heard the unspoken question should i have you killed your christus taught humanity and mercy i have read it petrus gently lifted valeriuss right arm studying the walnut fist he also said if thy right hand offends thee cut it off you i suspect sacrificed your right hand to save your life or perhaps to save another sometimes a man must make sacrifices for peace sometimes he must be prepared to sacrifice something he loves for a cause he would be prepared to die for himself there was a deep reluctance in his voice but the words reminded valerius of another man in another place that is what saul would have said petruss head rose and for the first time valerius saw emotion in his pale eyes you have met saul he says he is your brother in christus but i believe he means to betray you petrus drew himself up and for the first time valerius saw the true stature of the man in that second he understood why the christus sect had survived its founders death here was a leader other men would follow to the ends of the earth there is but one god and one jesus his son the judaean said solemnly but each man views god in his own way just as each of us has his own view of the path ahead three times i denied him and still jesus appointed me his rock and his keeper of the truth but the truth can be like poor wine acid on the tongue and difficult to swallow to understand the true jesus and become closer to god one must ignore the unreliable accept the unbelievable and embrace the dangerous saul would take those parts of jesuss teachings which are least palatable and consign them to the darkness never to be spoken of again he would sweeten the truth with honey so that it becomes acceptable to all men in this way he would ease the path into gods household for those who find their minds troubled or their faith tested but for me valerius there can only be one truth and that is the whole truth two men two roads but only one path can be chosen but saul would have you dead saul sees the road ahead in his own way petrus said calmly at heart he is a soldier just as you are and his methods are a soldiers methods whatever the future it is gods will and i will be bound by it there can only be one leader of the faith they sat in silence for what seemed a long time you talked of sacrifice valerius said there have already been so many sacrifices cornelius sulla burned on a pyre for refusing to renounce his faith or betray his friends your followers his brother publius who died upon his own sword in the service of your god and lucina graecina a great lady humbled and humiliated who once told me that she would gladly go to her death for the love of jesus christus but they did not die for christus did they they died for petrus christus is gone you have taken his place he looked up and saw a glint that might have been tears in the old mans eyes fear of the answer he would receive made him hesitate before asking what he had come to ask they sacrificed themselves for you would you be prepared to sacrifice the lives of twenty thousand innocents for your faith petruss face hardened as he heard for the first time of the emperors threat to the judaeans so many lives for one man he shook his head it is no idle threat to this emperor human life means nothing he will do exactly what he says i must think on this he studied valerius intently how did you know to come here valerius explained about fabia and the hold that torquatus had over her then we must act quickly i believe torquatus underestimates poppaea she is already strong and she will be stronger still when she has been anointed by god i believe she will prevail and torquatus will fall faith can move mountains come i will take you to your father and sister wait valerius struggled from the bed i must know will you return to rome with me petrus stared at him but the certainty had returned to the grey eyes and valerius knew the answer before he spoke yes i will come but first i must finish the work i have begun here xl they placed olivias bed on the marble walkway by the pool when he saw his sister valeriuss heart dropped into the pit of his stomach in the few days since he had left her the thing that was killing olivia had eaten away what little excess flesh thered been hollow pits dented her cheeks and dark circles rimmed her eyes her lips which even a week ago had been full and warm were now pale lines covering teeth gritted in pain if he had not known better he would have thought she was already dead lucius stood by his daughters side wheyfaced exhausted in body and spirit yet despite his condition valerius noticed an unusual radiance behind his eyes as if someone had lit a slowburning fire inside the old man sensed his sons presence and looked up wearily only petrus can save her now by now it was quite dark but the clouds parted above the pool and moonlight danced on the rippling waters like glittering shards of broken glass a singsong chanting announced the arrival of petrus at the head of a small procession escorted by four torchbearers valerius was astonished at the transformation in the judaean the careworn old man in the ragged fleabitten coat had been replaced by a commanding figure dressed in the golden robes of a high priest of a judaean temple his majesty exaggerated by a padded crown and his glory enhanced by a breastplate studded with precious stones behind him in a simple white robe and accompanied by two handmaidens poppaea glided serenely across the marble pale as a water nymph her head high and her eyes fixed on the cascade at the end of the pool valerius stepped back into the shadow but not before the dark eyes flicked towards him and widened in surprise the little procession arrived at the end of the pool where the ornamental fall turned the waters white it was shallower here and steps had been built to allow the decorous access fitting to an empress before poppaea entered the water petrus proclaimed her ready to undergo the ceremony as valerius watched a tall bearded man in a priests robe emerged from the shadows and placed a hand upon her forehead there was something familiar about the priest but he couldnt be sure what it was his father whispered that poppaea was being asked the series of questions that must be answered before the sacrament could proceed eventually the man nodded gravely and led her down the steps into the pool when they were kneedeep in the water he took her hand and walked with her to the gushing cataract the moon had disappeared behind the clouds but now a single shaft of light illuminated the two people by the waterfall valerius drew breath and he heard gasps all around him it was as if he had known the man with poppaea all his life yet he knew he had never set eyes on him before tonight poppaea hesitated and a shocked hush fell over the watchers but the hesitation only lasted for a second before she plunged into the foaming deluge with a cry of ecstasy as she did so the man raised his hands to the sky and in a voice charged with emotion called out an invocation lord our god cleanse this unworthy woman of her sins and take her into your house in keeping with your covenant write your law upon her heart place your almighty spirit within her and take her immortal soul into your keeping when poppaea emerged from beneath the fall her robe clung to her body revealing every curve and shadow but valerius only had eyes for the man who stood beside her was it a trick of the light no he had seen enough injury to be certain in the centre of the priests palm was the puckered scar of an old wound he turned to his father but luciuss gaze had never left poppaea valerius touched the old man on the shoulder did you see but when he turned back to the pool the figure in the white robe had vanished poppaeas handmaidens quickly covered her in a white sheet and petrus placed his palm upon her forehead saying you are reborn now in the name of jesus christus i name you maria god is within you you are his temple go in peace when poppaea walked from the pool she seemed taller and her eyes shone with the wonder of what she had just experienced even with her hair plastered against her skull she radiated an inner beauty that transcended anything she had possessed before she walked within feet of valerius but gave no hint of recognition valerius studied the men and women around him looking for the man in the white robe they included the lawyer from the baptism chamber in rome and his plump wife who stared unwaveringly towards the waterfall valerius felt the ground shudder beneath his feet but none of them appeared to notice it lucius tugged at his sleeve his eyes bright with rapture you saw it he demanded she was reborn gods spirit came in a shaft of light and entered her do you understand what it means olivia can be saved but only if we place her soul in gods keeping the grip on his arm tightened will you join me valerius and accompany her as she makes the journey towards salvation did you see him valerius demanded petrus no the man with the wounds in his hands his father opened his mouth but before he could reply a shout rang out from the hillside above riders riders from the north xli the walls of the villa shone like a beacon in the moonlight as decimus torquatus urged his mount along the metalled road with rodan at his side and twenty duststained batavian cavalry at his back it had been a long day and promised to be a longer night the information had taken more time to extract than he would have believed but his anger was somewhat assuaged by the outcome of the interrogation if he had calculated correctly poppaea should still be here with her parasitic friends and he would sweep them up like songbirds in a net her treason plain for all to see in her association with the bandits she had succoured in a perfect world he would be accompanied by more troops but the century of praetorian infantry marching behind wouldnt reach the villa until after dawn he consoled himself that a force of twenty veteran cavalry was more than enough to cow a few religious fanatics a man of little emotion he was surprised by the flare of pleasure with which he anticipated their meeting she would go on her knees to plead for his forgiveness perhaps she might even be persuaded to offer up a little more the thought brought a smile and he kicked the horse into a gallop the only thing sweeter would be the moment when he presented her to nero and forced her to confess her guilt quickly get olivia into the house valerius shouted to his father but lucius stared back at him as if he was mad the christians waiting beside the pool milled around like chickens who have scented a fox but have nowhere to hide marcus serpentius and heracles appeared at a run the house valerius snapped he took one end of his sisters bed and signalled marcus to pick up the other at last at petruss urging the christians began to move towards the villa it was the only way he couldnt get them out before the cavalrymen arrived but he might be able to protect them in the great warren of intersecting rooms that made up poppaeas villa with luck they would somehow find a way to escape he felt a hand pluck at his arm olivia lucius cried we must wait she must be baptized do you want to see her burn father valerius shrugged off the clutching fingers because she will if we stay here dont you understand torquatus wants poppaea but the only way he can prove her guilt is to take you as well and make you denounce her in front of the emperor lucius recoiled as if he had been struck we would sooner die than betray our faith serpentius running past them with a child in each arm laughed its easy to be brave before you feel the heat of the fire old man by now they were at the far end of the pool where a doorway led to a corridor connecting the pool complex to the main villa valerius led the way at the run he found himself in a room with a large fishpond at its centre next door was the lararium where the family performed their daily homage to the household gods and beyond it a room lined with the terracotta death masks of poppaeas ancestors finally he reached a wide hall with stairs leading to the upper floor close by was a short passage to the villas main entrance he hesitated tempted to take his chances in the open but he couldnt leave without poppaea and it might be too late in any case he made his decision take olivia upstairs he handed his end of the burden to heracles and get the rest of these sheep up there petrus bridled at the insult but valerius ignored the old man what about you marcus demanded ill fetch the empress if i dont get back hold on as long as you can i doubt theyll dare to burn the place but if they do youll have to get the christians out any way you can marcus nodded depend on it valerius turned to go but a strong hand gripped his shoulder i will go with you petrus said he brushed the judaean aside your place is here with your flock get them to make themselves useful remember our bargain and stay alive petrus didnt argue and serpentius herded the judaean and the other christians up the stairs marcus and heracles followed with olivia and carried her into a nearby room where her father took his place by her two of the christians offered to help and marcus set them to collecting beds and couches to barricade the stairway and anything heavy that could be used as a weapon the others held their wives and children and stared dumbly at the walls like cattle waiting for the slaughter marcus studied the stairway it was perhaps four paces wide and quite steep anyone who attacked up it was going to have to be quick and brave but that suited the veteran gladiator well enough the faster and braver they were the quicker theyd die but he understood that he couldnt defend the stairhead for ever he called to serpentius i need to know whats up here check out every room and every potential way off this floor four of us can hold the stair as long as we can hold a sword but only if they dont get behind us what if they have archers the spaniard identified the flaw in marcuss reasoning a single bowman would pick the defenders off from the stairwell with all the ease of a child plucking peaches in an orchard marcus spat against bad luck and pointed to the christians tell those bastards to pray that they dont he growled one way or the other were going to find out tonight if their nailed god is any fucking use serpentius set off along the balcony marcus heard a soft cough and turned to find the two christians carrying a padded couch about six feet long and of heavy construction good he rasped put it here he indicated the top of the stairway with the feet outwards where theyll make life awkward for anybody trying to get close but we need more couches chairs beds cupboards get those other sheep to help you he grinned to give the men confidence well make them fight for every inch of stairway and by the time they get up here theyll be begging us to kill them but not yet he thought he needed to leave the stair open until valerius returned with poppaea but where was he valerius slipped silently along endless lamplit corridors at every turn he expected to meet a slave or servant but it was evident poppaea had found some scheme to empty the house while petrus and his christians were here he passed through the family shrine and the lararium back to the indoor pond and paused to get his bearings where were poppaeas private apartments not near the pool certainly or he would have come across them already so they had to be on the ocean side of the villa he turned right towards an opening on the far side of the room and stopped in his tracks the fish in the pond were dancing it was the only word for it hundreds of the tiny rainbowcoloured creatures leapt and flipped walking on their tails and somersaulting across the surface of the water below them hundreds more jerked erratically and swam elaborate patterns as if waiting their turn to escape natural curiosity made him hesitate but he didnt have time to be distracted by the antics of a few fish as he neared the rear of the villa the sound of a soft voice alerted him in a luxuriously appointed room with broad windows overlooking the sea poppaea empress of rome knelt before a painting of the christian symbol valerius had seen on the wall of the baptism chamber poppaea had changed from the simple white baptismal dress into a heavy robe of imperial purple and her long chestnut hair was tied neatly in place she looked up in confusion a week earlier she would have felt nothing but relief to have the reassuring figure of valerius by her side but now she had a more powerful protector what do you mean by entering my private apartments she demanded why are you here i dont have time to explain torquatus is coming she lifted her chin and the dark eyes flashed then let him come i have no fear of torquatus valerius couldnt believe what he was hearing why are you people so eager to die isnt it possible your god is giving you a chance to live come with me and i may be able to save you stay here and you give torquatus everything he wants she shot him a venomous glance and he started for the door wait she ordered he bit back a comment as she gathered up the painting and placed it face down below a couch better that she should have burned the evidence of her new loyalty but there was no time at least she was prepared to follow him which is the quickest way to the stairs he followed her as she made her way unerringly through one corridor after another one room after another as they walked she questioned valerius how did torquatus know to come to the villa valerius guessed that fabia had betrayed him but he saw no profit in paying her back in the same coin at the moment lady that is less important than the fact that he is here perhaps you can ask him when you meet although im sure he has many more important questions for you do not play games with me she snapped would he be content with me alone valerius shook his head even if he was satisfied with you today he would come for the rest of us tomorrow or the day after we would never be safe and when he has you he will use you to get to others nero will slaughter the judaeans in rome and your new religion will wither away the faith will go on she said with certainty jesus did not suffer and die on the cross for nothing then let us hope it isnt put to the test serpentius returned from his reconnaissance nothing to worry about up here theres a big room at the back with a balcony that looks out towards the sea a couple of sitting rooms and a couple of small rooms for guests the rest is servants quarters he held up a thick gold chain a man could get rich by mistake in a place like this marcus shook his head but he didnt order the spaniard to replace the jewellery if you were about to go to war with the praetorian guard what was the point of worrying about a necklace this balcony how high is it can they climb to it serpentius pushed the chain inside his tunic not without a ladder plenty of ladders on an estate lad you he pointed to the roman lawyer who was sitting huddled beside his wife get out to the back and shout if you see any movement below the balcony the christian hesitated now marcus roared and the man scurried off leaving his wife whimpering mars arse what have we got ourselves into the gladiator muttered the two foragers returned with another couch their fourth this time laden with a pile of marble and bronze busts marcus picked up a head that was instantly recognizable as nero pouting lips and a weak chin that even the sculptor couldnt hide nice to know hes good for something a few more wouldnt go amiss the younger of the two men stepped forward i am isaac he said i can fight marcus looked him up and down taking in the athletes physique and nodded good he handed the man neros head when they come give them this with my compliments they were interrupted by the sound of hooves clattering into the courtyard at last valerius recognized the stairway he gestured to poppaea to go ahead but in the same instant a crash shook the walls and the front door smashed in as the first praetorians burst into the house get back he whispered ushering her behind him we need to find another way where she demanded first we need to get out of the house you valerius looked up to find rodan standing next to a cavalryman in the doorway a dozen yards away with a triumphant grin on his burnscarred face he waited for the moment when the praetorian would recognize poppaea but rodans expression didnt change and he realized the empress must be hidden by the angle of the wall make for the sea he whispered i will join you there if i can go he felt her hesitate please go lady with relief he heard a soft shuffle fading into the distance and he turned his attention back to his enemy xlii three more cavalrymen had joined rodan all wearing armour over their black tunics rodan carried the short legionary gladius but the other men were armed with the big spatha cavalry swords valerius had seen used to such good effect in britain the spatha could be fearsome when wielded from horseback and the weight of the sword cleaved helmet and skull but it was cumbersome if the user was out of the saddle their armour and weapons made them slower which was to his advantage but more difficult to kill which was definitely not valerius had no doubt he had to kill these men the only way any of them were going to get out of this alive was if he defeated rodan and torquatus if rodan had been alone he would have taken his chances and rushed the praetorian but five opponents called for a more cautious approach he had to hold them long enough to give poppaea time to escape hed worry about what came next later if there was a later we dont need this one rodan ushered the cavalrymen forward kill him too frightened to fight me yourself valeriuss challenge made two of the men hesitate and look to their leader theres no glory in killing a cripple the praetorian sneered or a whore i gave your pretty whore to my century after torquatus finished questioning her it was very instructive i had her first of course she was a good fuck your whore at least then im not sure if it was the fortyninth or the fiftieth that killed her the image of fabias obscene death lit a fire in valeriuss brain and he had to curb the instinct to hack the smile from rodans leering face poor fabia caught between torquatuss threats and loyalty to her friends when she had been forced to make a choice it had cost her her life from somewhere deep inside he found control revenge would come in its own time now he knew without doubt he was going to kill rodan and torquatus too or die in the attempt he kept his voice steady so that the praetorian wouldnt know he had reached him im no whore rodan he taunted the other man and i only need one arm to beat you old women and children are more your style thats why youre afraid to face me valerius retreated half a step as he spoke the corridor was only wide enough to allow two men to approach simultaneously and even then they would hamper each other but no matter how well he fought he couldnt stay in this position for long because rodan would soon find a way to outflank or get behind him he was close to the corner now one step from his escape route he tried to recall the layout of the ground floor where could he make his next stand and the one after that if he could disable one or even two of them it would take some of the fight out of the others but first they had to come to him are you women he goaded the two cavalrymen he spat in the direction of rodan if this coward wont fight me you will have to i am gaius valerius verrens hero of rome and i hold your deaths in my hand he recognized the moment of decision the trooper was lanky and spare and the mail of his auxiliary armour hung on him like an oversized tunic valerius guessed that he would have quick hands but that the mail would slow him if he had attacked alone he would have had a chance he could have pinned valerius in place and worked an angle to allow the second man to reach his undefended right side but the soldier sensed the danger in this onearmed civilian and he urged his comrade with him valerius saw them come and it was as if he could predict their every movement he slid to his left and took two steps forward so that the tall man half shielded him from the second attacker his enemy had expected him to run or at best try to hold them and the advance surprised him the cavalryman was a veteran of the german frontier wars but his most violent duty in the last five years had been putting down civilian bread riots though he wasnt aware of it he had lost the edge that means the difference between life and death on the battlefield he was wary of the confident young man in front of him but not frightened valerius saw the calculations going through his mind two against a cripple it would be over in seconds but he had never faced a lefthanded swordsman or a man who had been trained by gladiators speed was as great a weapon as the gladius in valeriuss hand in the split second it took the cavalrymans mind to work out how to deal with the unfamiliar threat valerius was already inside the point of the long spatha roaring with the fierce joy of mortal combat he brought the gladius in a raking cut across the cavalrymans eyes that left him blinded and shrieking in disbelief as the man clutched at his ruined face valerius smashed a shoulder into his chest throwing him back into the second soldier ignoring the second man had been a gamble already he was swinging the big cavalry sword in a wide arc that would bring the edge down on valeriuss exposed neck his comrades reeling body had slowed him a fraction but still the blow should have been deadly all the long hours of repetition on the hot sands of the ludus had conditioned valerius to meet any threat from the right with his shield today he had none but the reaction of his right arm was automatic he brought his forearm up to meet the attack and the edge of the sword bit deep into the seasoned walnut of his artificial hand carving off a long splinter and slicing its way across the leather socket valerius screamed as his arm dissolved in a fiery bolt of pain that seared all the way to the centre of his brain his mind told him to deal with the insult that had been done to his body but he knew that to hesitate was to die he had one chance the block had opened up the cavalrymans guard valerius speared the point of the gladius upwards into the pale flesh of his exposed throat spraying a dark rainbow of blood across the white walls of the corridor as the man fell a shout of dismay rang out from rodan but valerius didnt have time to savour his triumph he ran xliii torquatus marched into the villa and studied the unaffected opulence around him perhaps when he placed poppaeas treason before the emperor he would be rewarded with something similar nero could be very generous to his friends where is she he demanded were searching the house but we think shes on the upper floor the decurion in charge of the cavalry detachments tone was respectful but not deferential which torquatus found slightly irritating theyve barricaded the stairway slaves and servants the praetorian commander said dismissively it will be the work of a few moments to sweep them aside the decurion bit back an unwise comment hed seen the barricade and didnt like the look of it at all one thing was certain torquatus would not be the first to the top of the stair testing the defences privately he considered his commander a fool for not waiting for the infantry but he knew there was no point in arguing he nodded and drew his sword torquatus accompanied him to the bottom of the polished wooden stairway he smiled coldly as he saw the pathetic jumble of couches with two or three frightened faces visible behind them at his back the decurion formed up his men for the assault in the name of the emperor hand over your mistress and i will spare your lives the prefect shouted above him marcus hidden by the christians he had told to show themselves at the barricade exchanged glances with serpentius if the praetorians believed poppaea was with them he wasnt going to tell them differently at least it meant valerius was still free why dont you come and get her he shouted torquatus recoiled at the challenge then in the name of the emperor i sentence you to death the words brought another disapproving glance from the decurion he had experience of fighting men who had been given no hope and therefore had no fear better to make them think surrender was possible even if it wasnt get on with it the praetorian commander ordered the decurion drew his sword and turned to his men fourteen the others were searching the rest of the house he pointed to the barricade its nothing but a few pieces of furniture with unarmed slaves behind it theyll shit themselves when they hear you coming so lets hear you roar when we hit the stairs now they ran at the stairway in two columns with the young officer in the lead he took the steps two at a time screaming at the top of his voice but the scream died in his throat when he saw the heavy wooden cabinet being manhandled over the top of the barrier no he shouted too late five feet of lacquered oak caught him in the chest on its first bounce and crushed his breastplate he felt his ribs splinter as he was hurled backwards along with two of the men in the righthand file a moment later the cabinet was followed by a bed that smashed the first soldier in the left column over the banister to plummet head first on to the stone floor below the man just had time for relief that his helmet had taken the impact that would have crushed his skull before his neck snapped like a rotten twig the setback won marcus and serpentius a moments respite but the cavalrymen were experienced enough to know that the key to victory was ignoring their losses and maintaining momentum there were still plenty of them to do the job and theyd make these slaves pay in blood when they got to the top the first man to reach the barrier grabbed at the legs of the nearest couch and tried to haul it clear marcus had watched with satisfaction as the missiles thrown by heracles and isaac the christian smashed into the attacking ranks four down eleven to go when the praetorian started tugging at the couch he rose to his feet reached over the barricade and swept his sword downwards the soldier screamed and stared at the blood arcing from the stump of his wrist he looked up into the scarred face snarling down at him and threw himself backwards away from the glistening blade to marcuss left another praetorian hacked at the barricade throwing lumps of horsehair stuffing into the air until serpentius stabbed him in the eye and he fell back spouting gore over the stairs something round sailed out over the barricade and hit the helmet of a third a glancing blow that sent him staggering to the rear the old gladiator turned and found valeriuss father ready to throw a second marble bust from the pile behind them fall back the hoarse shout brought the first attack to a halt and the remaining praetorian cavalrymen retreated carrying their wounded and dead with them are your men cowards or just fools torquatus demanded as the decurion hauled himself to his feet gasping as the ends of his broken ribs ground together the young soldier ignored the insult he knew hed been guilty of underestimating the men holding the barrier but torquatus had been at fault for insisting on an immediate assault now he looked up at the barricade and saw it as a military problem instead of an inconvenience the answer came to him quickly grappling hooks he gave the order through gritted teeth pointing to one of the men recovering from being hit by the cabinet get rope and anything we can use to haul this clear and call up as many of the others as you can find torquatus looked on impatiently as the decurion groaned while one of his men strapped his broken ribs with cloth torn from a bed the injured cavalryman returned with another four men each carrying a length of rope to which was tied the snappedoff top of a pitchfork with the tines bent at an angle that turned the implement into an improvised hook the decurion tested one of the forks for strength not perfect but it would only take one of them to hold and the men defending the top of the stairway were finished on the landing above the tense silence worried marcus more than the earlier assault theyre up to something and its not going to be pleasant fire serpentius suggested not much we can do about it if they do heracles get the christians to find sheets and start twisting them together and tell them to be ready to retreat to the balcony at the back of the house what about the girl marcus looked behind him through the open doorway where lucius now crouched holding his daughters hand as petrus led the christians in prayer shell just have to take her chances like the rest of us valerius was a soldier he would understand the giant sarmatian went to pass on his instructions petrus looked up at him expectantly heracles shook his head no point in giving false hope he crouched beside lucius as he sat holding his daughters hand what a waste she was beautiful as an alabaster statue and her helpless innocence moved something inside him but heracles had seen enough death to make him a practical young man marcus was right there was nothing to be done he handed his dagger to the father if it comes to it he said it would be a kindness things will not go well for us if they succeed the look on the old mans face reminded him of one of the tragic masks they used in the theatre heracles left them together and returned to marcus and serpentius now all three reacted to the shout but marcus was momentarily distracted by the lack of action that followed it when something fell beside him with a metallic clatter he instinctively jumped away as it was pulled back to hook on to the couch in front of him in quick succession four more hooks landed and two of them caught their targets too late marcus realized what they were and reached to free the hooked claws the barricade began to disintegrate in front of him heracles was the only one of the defenders to get a hand to one of the grapples and immediately used his enormous strength to fight the power of the men on the other end of the rope if he won the deadly tug of war at least part of the barricade would survive and give the defenders something to fight for lose and the way would be open for the attackers serpentius ran to his friends side but it was impossible to get his hands on the rope or the metal hook without obstructing heracles the praetorians too understood the significance of the rope and three men sprinted to add their weight heracles face reddened and the muscles of his enormous shoulders bulged as he put every ounce into the struggle at first it appeared he was holding his own but slowly inch by painful inch the giant sarmatian was forced to give ground the feral snarl that twisted his face never altered as the incredible pressure on the rope first pulled him upright and then toppled him down the stairs along with what was left of the barricade now the cavalrymen attacked with the bandaged decurion at their head dodging the furniture that tumbled around them heracles was stunned by the impact of his fall and he struggled dazedly to his feet as the soldiers reached him the first man stabbed the young giant through the body and wrenched his spatha free in a savage gutspilling twist the blood drained from heracles face but still he stayed upright his hands vainly trying to contain the coil of blue intestines bulging from his torn stomach as he swayed on the bloodsoaked stair a second cavalryman swung a cut at his neck which almost severed his head at last the big man fell and as they passed him each of the enraged attackers hacked at his defenceless body until it looked as if he had been mauled by a pack of wild beasts prisoners the decurion roared we need prisoners marcus and serpentius had watched heracles die now they fought for their lives as the praetorians reached the top of the stair the attackers outnumbered them six to one but marcus had won his freedom with the speed of his sword the men who faced him were astonished by the whirlwind of glistening iron that met them and two wounded in the first few seconds taught them to respect the lightning blade serpentius fought with a cold smile and matched his opponents cut for cut the swiftness of his strike had earned him his name and now he lived up to it keeping the praetorians at bay as they vied for the opportunity to kill him with a twist of his wrist he sent one of the long spatha swords spinning from its owners hand the blade dropped by the door of the bedroom where the terrified christians watched the fight with wideeyed horror serpentius heard a shout and when he looked up isaac had picked up the sword and was running at the praetorians surrounding him two of the spaniards opponents turned away to meet the new threat and now he was able to take the fight to the startled cavalrymen he laughed as one of the men reeled backwards holding his arm but a quick glance towards marcus told him the older man was tiring at last the veteran gladiator was forced back to the door of the bedroom along with isaac serpentius allowed himself to be pushed back alongside them a highpitched scream told them that isaacs brave fight had run its course in a daze lucius walked forward to take his place and his hand closed over the wooden hilt of the fallen sword xliv valerius ran through the corridors with his right arm a throbbing mass of pain blood wept from beneath the leather socket but he couldnt be certain how serious the wound was if he had the opportunity he would stop and tighten the laces and hopefully slow the flow but that didnt seem likely the curtained doorways of the house passed in a blur and he heard shouting and the sounds of running feet as rodan and the two unwounded praetorians pursued him he knew he wouldnt be able to fool the cavalrymen twice this time theyd take their time and work him into a position where rodan could kill him at his leisure rodan would enjoy that his only hope was to lead them as far from poppaea as he could he thought of his father and olivia but there was nothing he could do for them now except put his trust in marcus serpentius and heracles he found himself back beside the indoor pond and noticed indifferently that the dancing fish were now belly up on the surface their vibrant colours dulled by death his racing mind told him this was some kind of omen if he didnt lose his pursuers in the next few minutes his future was just as bleak he turned left into a walled garden surrounded by marble pillars among the flowers and herbs stood a polished bronze statuette of a wild boar cornered by dogs that gave him a queasy feeling of fellowship for a fleeting moment he considered hiding among the flower beds but the cover was too thin and he would rather go down fighting than be dragged skulking from behind an oleander bush and butchered among the roses the next turn found him back at the swimming pool he ran along the marble tiles past the sitting rooms for poppaeas guests the waterfall was in sight and he knew precisely where he would cross the wall when he climbed the slope the only question was whether he could reach the trees before rodan and his men arrived two more cavalrymen appeared from nowhere in front of him no time for hesitation swerving to the right between two marble pillars he hit the water in a shallow dive that took him halfway across the pool and launched into the overarm stroke he had been taught as a child the sword hindered his technique and his tunic slowed him further but he knew that the praetorians in their chain armour were unlikely to chance the water he hauled himself out on the far side and turned for the slope only then did he realize how close to exhaustion he was as he hit the incline his pace slowed and each step became agony he would never reach the trees in time desperately he turned to face his pursuers there were four of them now with rodan just coming into view from the main villa he searched for some weakness or alternative escape route but there was none out here in the open any one of the spathas outreached the gladius they would surround him one or two of them would attack and while he was occupied the others would chop him to pieces but he was gaius valerius verrens hero of rome and he would not die like some tethered lamb he thought of ruth and fabia and with a roar of defiance he charged the five men preempting their attack and praying for the chance to take rodan with him the first praetorian caught his attack on the long blade of his sword but with a twist of his gladius valerius raked the mans wrist and he let out a howl of pain as he turned he knew the other swords were coming for him but the battle madness was upon him and nothing mattered but to kill blood for blood let the god of battle decide he spun sweeping another sword aside but the flat of a blade caught him on the side of the head and he went down hard with the strength of despair he twisted and tried to get to his feet lashing with his sword until a boot stamped on his back and he felt iron at his throat dont kill him yet the shout came from rodan but valerius took no hope from it three cavalrymen dragged him back to where the praetorian stood among the marble columns smiling rodan pulled a dagger from his belt maybe ill let you live after all it will be a pleasure to watch you and the old man burn and the girl of course but first he raised the dagger so valerius could see the gleaming point im going to take your eyes the earthquake had its origins in the convergence of the african and eurasian tectonic plates as the two giants met the larger forced the smaller towards the earths core where it had recently become stuck many miles below the surface of the planets crust in the area just south of neapolis for weeks elemental forces had been at work as the power of billions of tons of remorselessly shifting rock the motion of an entire continent built up behind the stoppage now a single sudden movement broke the deadlock this massive bolt of energy pulsed outwards in a series of enormous shockwaves much of the force would be dissipated in the mass of the planet but for those inhabiting the crust above the epicentre of the quake it would seem like the end of the world rodan froze like a rabbit confronted by a foraging stoat the initial shock broke with a roar as if all the gods cried out in pain together and the earth began to lurch like a bucking horse the men holding valerius instinctively tightened their grip as the marble pillars around them first shook and then swayed alarmingly bringing roof tiles and pieces of the portico down on them they looked questioningly at rodan but the centurion snarled at them to keep valerius pinned and advanced over the rocking ground with the blade glittering in his hand the last thing youll ever see is the point of this knife another shock made the ground flow in waves under valeriuss body and he used the moment to try to break free his captors cried out in terror but they maintained their hold and for a moment he feared the movement of the earth would break his back rodan stumbled as the marble mosaic beneath his feet began to disintegrate but he managed to stay upright and now he was only feet away valerius felt his bowels loosen at the thought of the knife biting into his unprotected eyes he would never see again never look on the ocean or a cornfield being dusted by the wind never look upon a womans face he struggled desperately against the force pinning him down and called on the gods to come to his aid rodan screamed as the ground vanished beneath him and for a fleeting moment valerius thought his prayers had been answered but the hole was a mere four feet deep and the praetorian waved the knife mockingly as he prepared to climb out he had barely moved when another thunderous roar seemed to twist the world on its axis the two ragged lips of the gap slipped obliquely across each other with rodan pinned between the praetorian let out an inhuman cry as his lower body from the hips down was caught between two unrelenting surfaces his flesh torn and his bones pulverized by the primeval power of the earths fury from six feet away valerius heard the sickening sounds of snapping and grinding the cry turned to an animal shriek as rodan realized exactly what was happening to him his eyes bulged from his head the blood drained from his face and his upper body began to shiver and flop like a newly landed fish another shockwave rippled through the ground adding to the doomed praetorians involuntary gyrations the three men holding valerius exchanged wideeyed glances and fled in the direction of the villa as the tremor reached its climax the fluted columns holding the portico collapsed one by one valerius knew the whole structure was about to come down on him but he was paralysed by fear and exhaustion only when rodans body gave one last convulsive shudder was the spell broken and he found the will to crawl towards the open ground of the garden inside the villa marcus and serpentius fought back to back in the doorway of the room where the christians cowered their swords creating a whirling arc of iron that was the only thing keeping them alive marcus felt his strength draining and the veteran gladiator had already resigned himself to death he was only being kept alive by serpentiuss speed but even that could not last much longer the earthquake saved them when the first tremor shook the villa like a rat in a terriers mouth the praetorians around them froze serpentius took advantage of the moments indecision with a savage lunge that sliced into his assailants windpipe as the man fell backwards the wooden stairway began to fall apart and his comrades retreated past his body the way theyd come the injured decurion was the last to go shaking his head at the folly that had brought him here at the base of the stairs torquatus roared in frustration but the ground beneath his feet tossed like a choppy sea and he felt the whole building creaking around him as the stairway collapsed he took to his heels with the rest and rushed for the safety of the open air xlv a womans scream split the doomladen silence between a pair of shockwaves poppaea valerius struggled to his feet picked up his sword and stumbled towards the death trap of the house flames poured from the ground floor evidence that at least one oil lamp had been upended to set the villa on fire tumbled pillars and broken statues added to the stygian confusion in the corridors he ran blindly through the choking smokefilled darkness until he reached the room where hed found her praying it was empty but a second scream drew him to the open window and out into a blizzard of falling tiles one of the clay missiles hit his shoulder a glancing blow but his mind was too focused to register the pain he followed a path that took him downwards towards the ocean he guessed that there would be access from the villa to the sea an estate of this size must have a harbour where fishermen delivered the days catch or favoured guests could be landed by boat there would be a road and it was the road valerius was looking for when the earthquake struck poppaea would have been terrified he had sensed an immense well of courage within her but the tortured writhing of the earth created a spastic panic that even the strength of her faith would not have been able to overcome she would instinctively have sought refuge outside the walls yet the safety of the open air was an illusion this was where torquatuss men would come driven by those very same fears he found a gateway the door standing wide and ran through it into the open the narrow road ran parallel to the cliffs and he almost didnt see the glint of reflected moonlight it caught the corner of his eye and he turned without thinking abandoning the cobbled pathway for the anklebreaking tussock grass of the cliff top the glint he had seen was silver the silver of a praetorian officers sculpted breastplate a hundred yards ahead close to the cliff edge he could just make out the purple sheen of poppaeas dress as she struggled with a darkclad figure torquatus the praetorian had poppaea by the shoulder and was attempting to drag her back towards the roadway as she spat and scratched her dark hair flailing around her head valerius saw torquatus draw back his hand and whip it across poppaeas face as she sank to her knees stunned by the blow he felt the rage rising inside him like a storm ready to break he remembered fabias sapphire eyes and saw them go dull lucina her nobility crushed and driven beyond the edge of madness the dying flutter of ruths final heartbeat his anger gave him new strength and he charged through the grass and bushes torquatuss head came up at the sound of a nailed sandal on stone and his lips drew back in a snarl as he recognized his attacker he lifted his sword to meet the assault valerius crabbed to his left forcing torquatus to turn with him his sword in his right hand and his left still gripping poppaeas dress the refusal to release his prisoner left the praetorians flank open and valerius was confident he could take advantage of the mistake but torquatus was no innocent he had served in the legions and five years at the centre of neros court had taught him how to use power he brought the edge of his blade within a hairs breadth of the pale skin at poppaeas throat make one more move and she dies here and now valerius froze i am the emperors representative here the praetorian rasped tonight i will present the traitor poppaea sabina to my lord along with the evidence of her guilt when she watches the man petrus and his ragged crowd of renegades put to the question i have no doubt she will exhibit that pleasing christian trait of sacrificing herself to ease their pain it will be most instructive for her and for you because i intend you to be the first to feel the kiss of the glowing iron the words were confident enough but torquatuss eyes kept flicking towards the house and valerius knew the praetorian commander was only bolstering his own courage he was also bluffing you wont find any help there torquatus your friends will be halfway to rome by now valerius took a step forward just as another shockwave rumbled through the earth it threw him off balance and the movement was exaggerated by his weakness in the same instant torquatus noticed the blood dripping from his opponents right arm and saw his opportunity the point of the gladius snapped out in a perfectly executed lunge that should have pierced valerius through the body in his mind torquatus was already withdrawing the blade in the twisting gutting stroke that would leave a man screaming for a merciful end he was quick but not quick enough the years of training on the hot sands of the ludus had given valerius a gladiators instinct for survival at the last second he pivoted and allowed the sword to slide across his body so close that the razor edge sliced through the cloth of his tunic a righthanded fighter would have been forced on the defensive but the movement positioned valerius to counterattack with a rising backhand cut designed to take torquatuss head from his shoulders the praetorian cried out as the sword sliced towards his exposed throat but loss of blood had slowed valeriuss reactions and that gave torquatus the heartbeat he needed to step back out of the arc of the younger mans sword valerius knew he had to finish the fight quickly every second left him weaker each moment of delay made the outcome more certain his legs felt as if they were moving through deep sand torquatus shimmered in his vision as if he was seeing him through a haze now a giant now a midget but never clear enough or close enough to find with the point poppaea stirred in the grass at the praetorians feet and torquatus laughed as he sidestepped another pathetic lunge of valeriuss sword not so heroic now my friend he circled away so that valerius had his back to the crumbling cliff edge just a wounded beast with nowhere to run without warning he darted forward and forced valerius to meet blade with blade the clash of iron singing in the night torquatus was the stronger and faster now and the younger man was forced to take another step back as the praetorian hacked at his weakening guard he felt the ground falling away beneath his feet and knew the cliff could only be paces away a smashing blow numbed his fingers and the gladius dropped from his hand torquatuss face twisted into that familiar mocking smile one more attack and it was finished valerius might have succumbed to despair but instead cold fury sharpened his mind death had no fears for him but victory for torquatus would mean death for those he loved he would not allow that he saw torquatuss eyes narrow the way a hunting lions do the instant before the charge when he came it was with a savage swing at his victims defenceless head but in his eagerness the praetorian had overlooked the young romans artificial fist the block was too feeble to stop the blade entirely and valerius felt a line of fire slice across his cheekbone but it gave him the opportunity he needed he grabbed torquatuss tunic with the fingers of his left hand and threw himself backwards the praetorian commander flailed desperately as their combined momentum vaulted him over valeriuss falling body and the weight of his armour carried him beyond the cliff edge valerius watched the shrieking figure disappear into the darkness his cry of triumph was as shortlived as it was pointless for in killing his enemy he had also killed himself the impetus hed used to throw torquatus was unstoppable and now it combined with gravity to somersault him too towards the void he felt the instant the world vanished beneath him and a moment of weightlessness which was the prelude to death but his fall was short sharp and ended with an agonizing tug that ripped through his wounded arm and tore the tendons of his right shoulder he opened his eyes surprised to be alive the dusty earth of the crumbling cliff face stared back at him from a foot away he twisted his head and looked upwards the bindings for the leather socket had tangled among the roots of a small bush to halt his plunge but for how long his saviour was a very insignificant clump of leafless twigs and a single unwise movement or another shockwave would pull it free blood dribbled down his arm in a warm stream from beneath the cowhide socket he could feel the life draining from him he allowed his head to drop and closed his eyes the passage of time had no meaning only the dreadful fire in his arm and shoulder he couldnt be sure how long he had been hanging when he felt the light brush of a hand clutching at his arm he looked up into a pale face with wide frightened eyes half hidden by the dark hair that cascaded over them leave me he whispered save yourself no the word was fierce almost a snarl poppaea squirmed further over the edge determined to get a better hold if i sacrifice you to save myself what does that make me in the eyes of my god valerius let out a groan alive he said and alive you can save the others petrus he hesitated but he couldnt lie not petrus petrus must die to save the judaeans but you must live to save my father and olivia he felt the bush shift please all you will do is kill us both and you will die for nothing listen there was a plot against you rodan led it he came to the villa and threatened you tell the emperor tell him torquatus heard of the plot and died a hero protecting you do you understand but the soldiers will know the truth he shook his head and another bolt of pain shot up his arm no rodan will have given them their orders they were duped they are leaderless now act like an empress and they will say anything that will save their necks warm salt tears dropped on to his face and he knew he had convinced her the fluttering hands left his arm and he waited to die when the new hand closed on his arm like an eagles talons he was already halfway to elysium he had a vision of apollo reaching down from his chariot to pull him into the heavens but when he looked up the savage weathered face staring back at him was far from godlike you didnt think youd get away that easily serpentius growled as he hauled valerius effortlessly to safety theres still the matter of my outstanding wages the last rumblings of the earthquake had subsided marcus and serpentius used twisted sheets to lower their charges from the wreckage of the upper floor the living and the dead why he died fighting to save your sister valerius stared down at the shrunken figure and felt a curious mixture of guilt and disbelief grief would come later he knew but for now an empty void occupied the space his soul normally inhabited he pulled back the sheet that covered his fathers body the old mans face was set in an expression that mirrored the moment of his death a frown of indignation a grimace of pain a single stroke directly to the heart serpentius said from a soldier who knew his business and had himself been cut down a moment later the other casualties including heracles isaac and the dead praetorians were lined up alongside lucius outside valerius could hear poppaea coldly informing the surviving praetorian cavalrymen that her word was the only thing that stood between them and a painful death at the hands of the emperors torturers we couldnt stop him one minute he was as meek as a lamb and praying with the rest of them the next he had a sword in his hand marcus explained he was a hero you should be proud of him he was just a harmless old man your father sacrificed his life for those he loved what greater gift can a man give valerius stared at petrus at that moment he hated the christian leader more than he had hated torquatus my father died because he was foolish enough to follow you petrus studied him the day had taken a toll on valerius that even his fathers death didnt explain did he realize how fearsome he appeared this young fighter with the mark of his suffering stamped on the sharp planes of his face and the fresh scar still bloody on his cheek he came here for a reason the judaean pointed out gently he wanted to save your sister would you deny him in death something he risked everything for in life olivia lay deathly pale on the bed marcus and serpentius had placed by an open window for answer valerius gently picked up his sisters body and despite the lancing pain of his injured arm carried her towards the garden pool who will be her sponsor petrus looked to the christians but a voice from the doorway answered him i will valerius turned to meet poppaeas steady gaze and petrus smiled at her you understand what this means my child she nodded and took her place by valeriuss side as they walked she said quietly do you understand what this means valerius he nodded i think so we are linked in life and in death by faith i am not a christian but you will always support olivia as long as she lives then that is enough the water had drained away through a wide crack in the pool bottom but the aqueduct had survived and a steady stream still poured over the artificial waterfall petrus went first and valerius waited while poppaea whispered the sacred words in his sisters ear when she pronounced olivia ready he took his place beside the judaean belatedly he remembered the questions poppaea had faced she cannot answer for herself he muttered and i cannot answer for her petrus the healer smiled his gentle smile your father has already answered for her he placed his hands on olivias brow and valerius felt his sister twitch in his arms as if some force had surged through her he looked into petruss face and saw fierce concentration there the face of a man fighting with some troubled spirit or perhaps with himself eventually the judaean was satisfied and valerius carried his sister into the foaming cascade where the waters surged over them sharp and cold from the mountain above he heard petrus repeat the words that had been spoken earlier for poppaea this time there was a subtle difference in the name of jesus christus cleanse these unworthy souls of their sins and take them into your house in keeping with your covenant write your law upon their hearts place your almighty spirit within them and take their immortal souls into your keeping his life had changed for ever xlvi nero frowned as he studied the darkhaired figure kneeling before him in the throne room of his commandeered neapolitan palace poppaea had sent word by messenger of the troubling news and now she was here to provide him with details of rodans treachery and torquatuss lateflowering and ultimately fatal heroism it was perplexing but he would not let it spoil his mood the praetorian centurion planned to abduct you and sell you to the pirates of sandalion just so caesar she said quietly he admitted as much before good torquatus killed him her voice choked as she spoke the praetorian prefects name and nero could see it distressed her rise my dear you must not kneel before your caesar a chair for the empress he ordered strange that torquatus had shown such concern for poppaea after so many years of enmity then again perhaps not he had hinted at some great coup in the offing this was undoubtedly it he waited until she was seated before he resumed his questioning and the traitors accomplices all dead caesar the praetorians who rode with torquatus were most thorough of course he mused they must be rewarded for their diligence a pity though that none was spared to be put to the question a second figure had been waiting in the shadows now nero waved him forward valerius marched across the marble floor and knelt before his emperor neros tone changed imperious and harsh each word a challenge you accompanied torquatus here in search of the traitor rodan why when i had given you such an important mission to complete you understand it is death to disobey your emperor poppaea drew in a sharp breath valerius raised his head and nero felt a shiver of unease as he saw the angry reddened eyes and the raw scar that disfigured the drawn features here for the first time he was seeing the gaius valerius verrens who had stood before colonia and defied the hordes of the rebel queen my emperor honoured me with the title of defender of rome the voice was as hard as the face from which it emerged what is rome if she is not the man who rules her a threat to caesars wife is a threat to caesar himself when i discovered that threat i did what any soldier would do and moved against it with all the forces at my disposal if that means death so be it nero scowled at the provocation and wriggled in his golden chair he was already becoming bored with this conversation all he truly wanted was to let his mind return to the triumph of the previous night he had defied the earthquake to entertain the people of neapolis even as they fled in terror from the crumbling theatre as the rest of the world panicked he alone had stood firm and his sweet voice had never faltered it had been the finest performance of his life for the first time he knew that he no longer needed to stand in the shadow of the gods that knowledge allowed him to view the events poppaea had just related and valerius had confirmed with more equanimity than might otherwise have been the case in torquatus he had sensed a growing problem a boil which might at some point require to be lanced there were questions of course but they could be kept for another time however there was one more matter to be resolved you were tasked with finding this rock and the time you were allocated ends at sundown you are aware of the consequences of failure valerius nodded slowly this was the true reason for his presence and now the moment was here his throat felt as if it was filled with sand twenty thousand lives depended on his next words i plead for caesars indulgence he saw neros eyes harden but he kept his voice steady the man called petrus known as the rock of christus is in my custody in rome to be presented in chains at the emperors convenience this was the great gamble if he delivered petrus to nero at the same moment poppaea announced that rodan had turned traitor and torquatus had died the emperor would undoubtedly link the events yet by not doing so he risked neros insisting that his deadline had not been met and ordering the massacre of the judaeans in any case neros cold eyes studied him intently and valerius felt sweat break out on his brow as he saw the calculations going through the other mans mind he would never realize his good fortune from the moment the emperor had announced his decision to a trusted group of officials he had been bombarded by concerns about the inconvenience and the expense of the massacre romes judaeans formed a small but crucial element of the citys economy and their loss would have a significant negative effect on imperial finances at a time when the financial forecasts were already poor twenty thousand executions would necessarily require to be carried out by a full legion so the victims must be gathered and marched to the circus with all the organizational and security implications that entailed and did he understand the effort required to dispose of twenty thousand bodies i am inclined to be merciful valerius felt the room spin the judaeans will be spared you will deliver this man to me on the nones of june it was only when the emperors voice rose that valerius realized he hadnt heard a word of the rest of the speech he looked from poppaea to the man on the throne i said gaius valerius verrens hero of rome has the emperors thanks and is free to return to rome valerius rose shakily to his feet and bowed he walked towards the sunshine and freedom and a day he had thought would never come and verrens he froze perhaps it would be wise if you took up the offer from my friend vitellius a spell in the provinces might be beneficial to your health nero turned away and valerius found he could breathe again come my dear the emperor led his wife towards the scale model of rome which had accompanied them to neapolis i will show you my plans for our new home poppaea smiled sweetly she immediately noticed a change in the landscape between the two hills of the palatine and the esquiline in the valley the land currently occupied by ten thousand romans was buried beneath the largest palace the world had ever seen nero saw her startled look do not worry my love he said cheerfully the gods will provide xlvii fourteen months later on a hot august morning with the scent of old smoke still heavy in the air valerius stood beside a sombre darkhaired woman close to the place where cornelius sulla had died they were on the far edge of a large crowd who had gathered to witness another execution he had last seen petrus on the day he delivered him up to nero now he watched as a team of executioners erected an inverted cross in the soil of the vatican fields and placed the elderly christian against the rough wood valerius flinched when he heard the old mans shrill cry as the first of the iron nails pierced the flesh and fragile bones of his feet there was a moment of consternation as the executioner realized a single nail would never hold his victim in this unheardof
