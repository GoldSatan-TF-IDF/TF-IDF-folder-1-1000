cut and run jeff abbott ellen who became eve this is how you disappear first you make sure you dont go anyplace where you ever went before if you can help it you like vegas forget about slots and wayne newton for the next five years love shopping in new york uhoh no way baby your shadow dont darken broadway because when you step out of life when you step away from the world you made you dont step back into any old footprint no thats where they look first so those many years ago when i left babe and my sons behind in port leo i went to montana i cant stand cold weather never liked it im a coast girl love the kiss of the sun on my skin but coasts were forbidden to me right off babe knew i loved to fish and lie on the warm sands i dont think i had ever said the word montana out loud before i ran not sure i could find it on the map although i wouldnt mix it up with wyoming because i know wyoming is square i changed my hair color to red because back then nobody ever thought you dyed your hair red on purpose you usually dyed it brown to get away from red and i dropped the texas drawl fast tried to talk like a newscaster said you guys instead of yall which was harder than it sounds told people i was from california because its full of people originally from somewhere else and hid a loaded gun in an old suitcase because insurance is a necessary evil in this world jim was useless and he didnt like the cold he said it made his balls hurt he was afraid to look for a job saying that the dallas papers would have put his face all over the news wires and the tv i sure never saw jacksquat about him in the bozeman paper twice i drove over to the university library where they took the dallas morning news but after the first week of headlines like missing exec allegedly embezzled half million there was no talk of him no pictures of him the one picture they ran of him was when he got made svp at the bank and his smiles too tight his hair a little too big and never a word about me the library didnt take the corpus christi paper where i might have been mentioned so i wrote the headlines in my own mind mother of six missing its less glamorous than embezzling and ten times worse but in those dallas papers never a mention of me in connection with jim the embezzling banker which was how i liked it after reading the paper in bozeman i would drink a cup of coffee and smoke and try not to think about the boys not think about my four oldest going off to the movies with my friend georgie me kissing them for the last time and them not knowing it not think about my littlest babies mark and whit running around in the backyard chasing each other and laughing trying to get them settled for a nap in their beds whit standing on the stairs saying he didnt want to nap asking me where i was going i put him back in the bed and i didnt look back cried once on the drive north for twenty minutes all i allowed myself if whit had asked once more where i was going maybe i would have stayed i thought walking away from the boys would be easy the shackles of their grasping little hands falling off my wrists and ankles hardest thing i ever did i wanted for one terrible second to take one with me take whit he was standing right there a little mirror of my face finally one who looked like me after five copies of babe but then the police and babe never would have given up on looking for me ever and jim wouldnt have wanted a toddler making the most of his terrible twos with us on the run popping out six you think thatd be seared into my head pain and happiness hot to the touch but with each passing day they seemed more like little ghosts boys that belonged to someone else i tried not to remember them because its easier i had a new resolve to make my life easier but easy was not jim he started drinking one afternoon in my motel room crying after the fifth of whiskey was half gone moaning and bitching about missing the warm sun of dallas missing his favorite mexican restaurants missing his bigass house in university park missing his old comfortable life hed stolen from himself i watched him sip his whiskey i lit a cigarette i quit smoking when i had the boys and now i liked a little knife of flame in my hand shit shit shit jim said he had the soul of a poet jim lacked always a certain selfcontrol required for living in the world he stole a half million from his bank and now was too consumed by guilt and regret to move if youre gonna take an action be ready for your own reaction id agreed to go on the run with him and id left a family behind hed left a cokesnorting bachelor life behind i was coping a lot better than he was i got to go in a few minutes i said i worked at an old neighborhood bar serving beers to bozemans inert nothing to do with money or bookkeeping my old job from before i got married my barcrows were not questionaskers i liked it gave me a few hours escape from jim and his moods go he said go and ill be fine fine at the bottom of the bottle im depressed ellie i noticed i got up and made instant coffee for him knowing hed let it cool in the cup and then pour it down the sink the money he said i didnt just steal it from the bank i waited the instant coffee jar in my hand i stole most of it from the bellinis he said sort of who are the bellinis people i worked for on the side theyre from detroit he swallowed hard ran a hand along his lips i cleaned up money for them at the bank people from detroit i said with an italian surname you better be kidding me im not theyre gonna be looking for me i sat down on the mattress why didnt you tell me this before i thought you wouldnt come with me he took a deep swig from the whiskey bottle left a little amber drop sitting on his lip he had the palest lips id ever seen on a live person the money was evidence he said of me making it legit for them transferring it through a series of accounts the feds would have nailed me so i took it jim maybe we should go back to dallas then give the money to the feds the mobs gonna chase you harder than the feds ever will he looked at me and an ugly silence hung in the air and the frown on his face turned mean he grabbed my wrist and flexed his thin fingers back and forth digging his nails into my flesh my veins and bones jim stop that hurts i kept my voice calm you want to go back to texas that what you saying ellie its one option let go of my hand please you know what tommy bellini will do to me he tightened the vise grip on my wrist grinning like nothing would give him more pleasure than to break my bones i wont be a smear on the wall when hes done please let go you dont give a shit about what happens to me he pulled me into his sour breath you missing those brats of yours no a cold sharpness slid along my ribs my guts you are he said youre missing those brats of yours you want to go home you go home youre gonna talk about me youre drunk i grabbed the bottle of whiskey to bring it down on his head he stood yanked the bottle away from me let go of my wrist pushed me down onto the bed and i thought this doesnt do not for one goddamned minute you get this straight ellen jim said you made your choice you arent going to see your kids again i know that you more than know it you liye it he took a hit from the bottle worked the hooch along his gums and teeth like mouthwash and he looked so sad and ugly and pathetic i nearly laughed at him i dont want nothing to happen to those kids he said that burntsmell silence got thick again i quit rubbing my wrist you threatening my kids jim i said it soft like i didnt quite understand like it was an idea too leftfield for human talk you get an idea ellen about calling the feds going back to texas i call a buddy of mine in corpus hes good at a pause creating situations beaches are real dangerous for little kids cramps while swimming riptides he even gave me a smile the drunk i may be a bad mother but im still a mother and i stared at him in rising horror as i rubbed my wrist dont do that jim please then dont you screw with me okay he said i let him believe i was afraid of him theyre little kids and youre the mother of the year now i heard a twitch in his voice shame that hed had to resort to threatening children he favored himself with another big gulp of tennessee juice so dont talk texas we stay here the bellinis arent ever going to find us here okay i said but not okay i headed for work and left him drinking i wondered what if hes not bluffing the thought preyed on me like a fever i decided to call babe tell him to take the boys away from port leo picked up a pay phone dialed no answer i couldnt decide if that pissed me off or not shouldnt they all be sitting at home waiting for me to call i hung up went to the bar the start of one piledriver of a headache working underneath my forehead i didnt want to deal with babe you should solve your problems directly that night was quiet at the bar and i had time to think to construct four different plans and decide on one while i collected beer mugs and ignored a giants baseball game showing on the television through a thin haze of cigarette smoke i returned to the dumpy motel smelling of cigs and beer jim wasnt in my room we have separate rooms i insisted on it trying to keep our new identities separate too but he liked to lie on my bed and wait for me i had a key to his room he lay sprawled on his bed passed out reeking of whiskey and onion and hamburger a globby mess of french fries greasy on a paper bag lay on the table jim i said you awake poked at him with my fingers in his cheek his throat his stomach his crotch let my fingers linger on his sweet spot see if there was any response to my tickle nothing a little dribble of spit tracked down from his mouth drying on unshaven cheek dont you threaten my kids you asshole i said he didnt move gave off a rough sour snore so i went back to my room i opened the little suitcase under the bed and got the gun id bought on my way to dallas from port leo paying cash using an assumed name wiped the gun carefully with an old tshirt then wrapped the material around the grip but not the barrel i walked back down the hall the silence of the motel pressed against my ears the quiet of empty rooms i stuck the gun in his slack open mouth nestled it between his teeth and gave the trigger a little squeeze i jumped at the sound more than he did i carefully put the gun in his hand unwrapped the tshirt from around it pressed his fingertips on the grip i went back to my room it was one in the morning i waited for someone to respond to the shot but the motel was still no distant whine of sirens approached i took a shower washing the bar smells out of my hair and packed wed paid cash for the rooms a week in advance each time and were still good for two days so i took the money jim stole from the bank and the mobsters and i drove the car wed rented to an allnight diner i ate fried eggs and toast heavy with strawberry jam and drank coffee watching the night against the windows go gray then orange pretty but not as pretty as the sun rising out of the gulf once i thought i saw my sons faces in the glass little ghosts again but it was all the nerve juice pouring through me missing the boys really badly but at the same time not wanting to see them knowing that chapter of my life was closing i smiled at the boys and their little blank faces vanished in the dark glass at seven that morning i drove to the bozeman airport left the rental car in the lot on the radio there was nothing about a suicide or a murder at the pine cone motel jim is apparently sleeping in late the maid wont show up to straighten the room until ten or so and id left the do not disturb hanger on jims door she wont knock until two perhaps not until tomorrow our maid was not the poster child for initiative an hour later i was on a plane flying to denver under the name of eve michaels the name id used since leaving texas with five hundred thousand in cash in my checked luggage praying to god they dont lose my suitcase its mostly businessmen on this flight not as crowded as i would like i might be remembered more easily a gaptoothed man next to me asked me what i do flirting way too early in the morning i want to say i abandoned my family and killed my rotten mean lover and stole his money you you sell insurance thats fascinating but i dont of course i said i work in a bar and im flying to denver to see my boyfriend whos on the semipro wrestling circuit gaptooth lost interest and i closed my eyes part of me still wanted to go home part of me didnt and part of me worried that the men from detroit jim stole that money from wont stop because jims dead they could come after me its funny looking back now i wasnt really too worried about the police but this tommy bellini guy jim was afraid of he scared me a half million is a lot of money but not enough to live on for the rest of your days not in style so i wonder if theres a deal i can cut that will open the right door for me into a life a hell of a lot more up my alley than raising six kids i sat that whole flight with my eyes closed playing out the different twists and turns my life could take in the next few days i didnt stay long in the denver airport grabbed my precious checked bag and fixed my makeup and rented a car i headed east through the morning denver traffic for detroit babe and the boys know i hate the cold but the colds where tommy bellinis at and i needed a new best friend thirty years ago i thought montana would be the last time i would ever need to disappear i was wrong stop the search judge harry chyme said thats the best advice i can give you whit mosley wrapped his fingers around his bottle of beer felt his friend claudia salazar inch closer to him in silent support i dont give up easily whit said are you telling me youve hit a dead end no harry said im telling you that finding your mother might not be a good idea it might be well dangerous dangerous youre kidding right whit asked i dont often deal in hunches but i have one about where your mother ended up but i need to know how risktolerant you are before i proceed claudia put her hand on whits arm whits tough harry throw your worst at us harry dragged a hand through his short dark hair he didnt look the part of a private investigator bespectacled wearing a tweed coat and a yellow silk tie with the casual rumple of an english professor harry had a kindness in his face whit trusted and harry had been claudias instructor at the police academy before she joined the port leo police department now he sipped at his iced tea and set the glass down studied whit as though measuring his strength you may not like what you hear judge this information gets out could be you dont get elected next time around his voice lowered and i know the situation with your father is delicate but harry whit said the doctors give my dad four months for years hes wanted to know what he did to drive my mother away to make her leave a good life and six sons who loved her i want you to find her so i can drag her sorry ass home to face my dad before he dies i want her to explain herself i dont care if shes got a perfect life now and i mess it up they sat in a back corner at the whitecap a small seafood restaurant overlooking corpus christi bay and in the midafternoon of a february weekday the restaurant was empty the sky the color of burned charcoal the bay lay empty before them windwhipped the restaurant was a converted bright yellow house the tables close together but they were alone in the back the lunch crowd evaporated back down ocean avenue to the small towers of downtown corpus christi or to the regal mansions that lined the street harry chyme spread files on the restaurant booths table in a loose jumble okay then harry said i know your father hired investigators to look for her for several months when she initially disappeared yes whit said then he started drinking and stopped caring the investigators werent terribly creative in their search harrys got game claudia smiled you found her you genius harry ignored the compliment your mothers disappearance was treated for the most part as that of a woman who was simply tired of being married tired of having six kids to raise harry folded his hands on a folder they looked at her as a woman who had packed a bag hired a lawyer to end the marriage and driven off to have a calculated break from her life but even a divorce meant she might want to see her kids again and when she didnt come back and she never got in touch again then something bad mustve happened to her that theorys crap harry said because she didnt leave alone whit shook his head no one else took off from port leo the same time she did or from any other nearby town she didnt run off with a boyfriend i looked at every person in texas who went missing the same month your mother did there were nineteen people not counting ellen mosley fourteen turned up later safe and sound the other five didnt turn up safe two were kids kidnapped and killed one in fort worth the other in houston a third was a young woman in texarkana raped and killed and found on the banks of the sabine river three months later a fourth was an elderly man with senile dementia who wandered off from a nursing home in el paso and was found dead in the desert from stroke the fifth was james powell i dont know that name whit said james powell was a dallas banker he embezzled over a half million in cash from his bank and ran he committed suicide three weeks later in bozeman montana he actually disappeared the week before your mother did harry chyme opened a folder james powell fished regularly in port leo lots of people do claudia said what proof of a connection do you have the woman who was living with james powell in a bozeman motel and took off after he died matches your mothers description except for hair color whit thumbed the base of his glass really so i started going back through the files in dallas and in bozeman about james powell hed told a friend at the bank hed gotten involved with a married woman said nothing about port leo but he fished in port leo nearly every month a woman with six young children hasnt got the energy for an affair claudia said six kids underfoot could give her every reason for an affair whit said we were left to our own devices a lot claudia or left with our grandmother or friends my mother could have met up with a guy now and then but it would have been difficult to keep it quiet for long but easier with it being a tourist harry said much less chance hed be recognized he could stay at different hotels or stay in rockport or port aransas or laurel point where ellen would not be recognized or known this james powell no question it was a suicide claudia didnt look at whit thats a nice suggestion whit said harry pulled a photocopy of a faded police report from a file there was no sign of struggle and he was drunk according to the tox reports no prints on the gun other than his did that half million turn up claudia asked no that obviously concerned the investigators and this woman who was with him was never a suspect sure she was but the trail died she and powell werent actually living together they were renting rooms in a dive motel her room down the hall from his she arrived at the motel a week after he did and according to the motel maids statement at the time they seemed to not know each other and then hit it off the maid saw them going to each others rooms a couple of times but no proof that they had a connection beyond acquaintance the stickler is this woman her name was eve michaels left the night powell died eve michaels ellen mosley whit said yep according to the investigator files on powells case a woman named eve michaels bought an airline ticket to denver from bozeman rented a car in denver used a fake credit card the car was found abandoned in des moines iowa then the trail went cold and the bozeman police didnt have luck pursuing it further so my mother if shes the same woman is a killer and a thief whit said i think i know enough now but maybe she isnt harry said heres the second part of my theory and it gets ugly james powell cleaned money through his bank for a couple of small businesses in dallas that were fronts for an alleged organized crime family in detroit the bellini family the money he stole was from the accounts hed set up for them these guys might have caught up with him in bozeman but being mob they would have roughed him up before killing him no sign the guy had been beaten or tortured unless there was no need claudia said they found the money took it and killed him a faked suicides not their style harry said and unlikely they would have left the body in the motel whit pulled the old police report across the table and studied the description of the woman fivefootsix around pounds attractive face green eyes red hair no picture attached but a sketch it sort of looked like his mother it says she had a bartending job at a beer joint why would she work if they had a half million in cash to blow harry said she wanted a cover not draw attention to herself and she had red hair my mother was a brunette safe to assume she would change her appearance if she was on the run and with an embezzler harry said do you remember anyone else asking about your mother after she vanished strangers no my father would know harrys face softened hows he doing the chemo is hard whit glanced back out at the bay no longer empty in the winter afternoon one brave sailboat plied the waves racing along the edge of the bay in a sweeping turn its wake a slurry of white foam and gray water so he feels horrible he knows hes dying and i tell him my mother ran off with a dallas embezzler with mob ties who ended up dead whit shook his head maybe the bellinis caught and killed them both but dumped her body elsewhere and a woman who looks like her happens to leave bozeman the same day claudia said gently lets say she took the money she killed powell or guilt or fear ate him up and he killed himself and so she ran with the money yes harry said great minds claudia she had a few choices one come home she didnt do that whit said two run always waiting for the bellinis to catch up with her that seems the logical choice claudia said yeah and yall might never find her again harry said or three she went to the bellinis to return the money to take the heat off of her to cut a deal huge risk claudia said harry slipped another set of stapled papers from a file yes tony largo was a loan shark in dallas whod been close to james powell he turned to the feds about ten years after powell died said word on the street was the bellinis were looking for powell but never found him and the bellinis fell from power a few years back harry opened another file the feds could never get the hard financial evidence against them for racketeering charges big tommy bellini the head of the ring cleans up after himself better than an analretentive maid the meanest baddest most vicious sob in detroit crime circles but the one who maintained the lowest profile until two years ago then he kills another boss without permission books himself on freaking good morning detroit and disclaims any knowledge about the killings grabs way too much attention so he basically gets kicked out of the mob the other families cant whack him but they cant work with him any further because hes damaged goods his wife used to be a texas debutante came from old money so they head back to her home turf in houston he sets himself up as an importer of fine textiles rugs art and so on totally legit and he was being watched very carefully hes probably importing white powder and hash but what do i know houston police roughed him up once and he sued their asses into the ground and he won a milliondollar settlement and so i dont know how hard they looked at him afterwards harry pulled out a newspaper clipping a month ago he had a stroke at the wheel of his jaguar on the gulf freeway and crashed badly two of his buddies were killed tommy bellinis been in a coma ever since whit tore the wet napkin under his beer in strips harry leaned back eve michaels car ends up in des moines its on the way to detroit from denver she wasnt running away she was running toward something or the bellinis caught up with her and killed her whit said his voice was hoarse and shes long dead or they might be grateful to her and possibly she wanted something from them harry said what whit said a new life harry said you want me to see if theres a connection between eve michaels and the bellinis its a thin chance but its about all i got left to check this could be worse than pandoras box whit said the mob jesus im not afraid of these people judge harry said okay well maybe a little because im not foolish i can go to detroit tonight detroit what about houston she might have stayed in detroit once his organization fell apart there but ill try houston as well whit nodded at harry find her please on the way back to port leo they stopped at the nueces county morgue for whit to pick up autopsy results on a drowning victim who had been pulled from st leo bay as justice of the peace for encina county whit also performed coroners duties ruling on cause of death and conducting death inquests but the autopsies were performed by the pros in nearby nueces county whit read the report as claudia navigated through the traffic heading north out of corpus christi the dead man was lance gartner a young grad student from austin who had gotten raving drunk visiting cousins in port leo taken a rowboat out in the bay in the middle of the night freebased heroin fallen overboard and drowned he was twentythree a life wadded up and thrown away shame about that man she said as he put the autopsy file away yes i dont think his family knew about the heroin use sad silence hung between them busy day tomorrow ive got a full docket in smallclaims court and then two days worth of juvenile court coming up this week get to have surly teenagers attempt to explain idiot behavior for hours on end time i could be spending with my dad instead i know why dont you take time off from work be with him more whit said and not waste time trying to find my mother your father only has a while whit who cares about your mother shes hardly more than a concept to you claudia said if harrys theory is true she was bent if she wanted a life with embezzlers and mobsters if she is still with these people then she wont want contact from you and they wont want you bothering her shes not worth five minutes of your time i dont care what she or anyone else wants whit said whit end this now tell harry you changed your mind now he looked at her i have to know claudia youre up for election in another couple of years you want the voters knowing your mother might have been involved in a murder are you going to publicize it fast way to get a fresh face to work death investigations with you she gave him a quick sideways smile i would never breathe a word but you know politics if someone else wants to run inquests and juvenile court and smallclaims court that bad let them splatter me with mud but thats not what youre worried about is it promise me she said youll wait to hear from harry before you do anything youre afraid im going to run up to houston check out the bellinis see if i can find her myself if harry backs out i know you let harry handle this be patient stay out of it whit please promise me my family was never much good in the promises department whit said but i wont do anything you wouldnt approve of okay worrywart claudia knew it was all she would get and she silently wished that harry found no trace of eve michaels when the strippers showed up eve michaels knew the business deal was done and the bellini family was going to get burned the negotiation dinner in one of club topazs private suites started winding down early about ten not nearly soon enough for eve she was bonetired and ready for the deal to close she suspected paul bellini was ready too she saw as the table was being cleared that the two strippers fresh from performing downstairs were waiting outside the suite it was a subtle difference between tommy bellini and his son tommy would have been much more discreet with his whores tonight when it mattered most that paul be focused he was thinking with his little soldier again cut a fast and possibly disadvantageous deal so the partying could begin tonight the guests were a couple of miami drug dealers in houston for a fivemilliondollar score and behind the smiles eve decided they were judging how much tattered flesh remained on the bones of the bellini organization the night had begun with business when the six of them sat down at the table and eve put on her best poker face so youve got five million worth of coke to sell paul said he was making his voice a low growl on purpose eve didnt look at him embarrassed yeah but we can supply you even more if our deal works out the head miami guy kiko grace took a hit off his cigar blew a stream of cuban smoke above the table the cigar fit in with the rest of him tailored dark italian suit black hair trimmed in an expertly stylish cut shoes polished so you could see your reflection in the calfskin he had a small delicate mole near the corner of his mouth more like a womans beauty mark the only softening feature on his hard face were bringing in sixtyplus kilos this week to see how it goes with you all we can double it triple it no problem kikos voice was butterysmooth satisfied like the deal was done but we want to be sure you can distribute fast enough for our volume we cant work with an organization who cant sell it effectively our problem is youre asking a premium price for the coke eve said quietly that hurts our margins paul glanced at her as though hed forgotten she was in the room rethink your margins eve you got suppliers lining up to work with you kiko said he touched the little mole on his cheek no ones eager to have more deals canceled because your organization took a body blow i know and you know im doing you a favor eve glanced at her boyfriend frank sitting next to her but he had eyes only for the merlot in his glass dont misunderstand me were sorry about your dad paul kiko said thanks paul said he was a great man kiko said eve didnt like the was but with him down a couple of his lieutenants dead theres not a lot of confidence that you can keep the streets supplied you dont want to be the momandpop store when the dealers prefer megastore you see what im saying were here to help give you a chance to really thrive by giving you a steady supply for your dealers all out of the goodness of your heart eve said kiko gave her a crooked smile i like you he said youre about as blunt as my mama no not out of the goodness of my heart out of a desire for profits eve started to negotiate a point about margins but paul said houstons our territory just so were clear accepting the pricing structure moving onto the next item on the agenda thats all cool kiko said weve got no interest in invasions miami keeps us plenty busy when would you need the money for the first shipment paul said and eve bit her bottom lip frank gave off a soft wine belch and smiled at jose kikos sideman eve didnt like jose he said little and watched faces like he was studying a map he was short and squat with a plain face and heavy cheeks but his eyes were in constant motion watching eve then frank then the rest of the table he flicked the nail of his stubby thumb with each of his fingers in turn like he was ticking off seconds from an internal clock playing dumb muscle but smart under the skin he made eve nervous five million even in cash by thursday afternoon kiko said weve got the shipment already here hidden in imported pottery thats listed as antique on the manifest he laughed its junk break open the bases and theres a half kilo in each one stashed near the port its safe as a baby deal paul said eve took a tiny sip of red wine done without discussing it with her in private and all she could do now was try to protect them in this new alliance she glanced over at pauls new righthand man the guy who looked like a corporate drone he was wearing a brooks brothers suit pink oxford shirt navy tie like he was here to bring a kid to a prep school interview or negotiate a lowlevel bank deal everyone called him bucks short for buckman his last name but more because he was supposed to be brilliant about new ways to make money eve hadnt seen a single glow of smartness yet bucks gave her a stern look back that said keep your mouth shut frank always the host raised his glass and said heres to good business and they all clinked glasses together kiko smiled at her as her wineglass touched his like he could smell her disapproval and didnt care the deal done they dipped into the food the thick steaks brought up from the clubs kitchen salads crisscrossed with blue cheese twofisted baked potatoes crowned with cheese and chives she nibbled at a chef salad her appetite gone five million she had five million cleaned and sitting in twentytwo different accounts in the caymans that she could transfer back to a bank in houston the only clean money they had and paul had spent it all in a minute the revenue streams were drying up the muscle not yet loyal to paul while his dad lay dying and now their cash reserve was in play with people theyd never worked with before hey frank kiko said sing a little give us a few bars of baby youre my groove please dont paul said weve all heard it about nine million fucking times thats because its a timeless classic frank said he was on his fifth glass of wine yeah it gets timeless about every ten years when disco gets rediscovered bucks said then it gets untimeless real fast what he wont tell us is how much money hes made off it i was an artist frank said money was for agents to worry about not my groove the only groove frank has eve said is the one his rocking chairs wearing in the floor yet you love me still frank said and she smiled because it was true the folks that make viagra need to use this for their theme song paul said pay you a bigass licensing fee silence please respect for the artist frank said and he stood and sang a capella the wellknown refrain im just saying whats in my heart been there from the very start and it sure noughs not some move cause baby youre my groove baby youre my grooooove eve smiled at frank as he sat back down and everyone applauded jose whistling through his teeth bucks clapped but not like he meant it the voice was still there worn but clear as a bell a tenor smooth as melting chocolate voice of an angel still eve said an oldfart angel frank said but she could see he was pleased a tiny stage better than none man you ought to do one of those disco reunion tours kiko said nah frank said club keeps me too busy plus theyd probably make me share a dressing room with the village people and aint no way but rejuvenating your singing career bucks said thats a worthy goal yeah why dont you draw me up one of your action plans son frank said he turned to kiko bucks here is a human day planner got more goals than a soccer tournament does he now kiko said goals are vital bucks said goals help us actualize paul interrupted like hed heard the words one time too many before kiko got a couple of fine girls who can come in and dance for you theres a worthy goal bucks shut his mouth like a switch had been flipped kiko smiled no thanks man but id like a quick tour of the club if frank here would show us around see whos famous downstairs tonight you sure you dont want a little private performance paul asked drawing out performance into way more than a hint i got a wife pregnant back in miami kiko said but appreciate the hospitality how about you jose jose shook his head no thank you declining because his boss did eve thought sure thats fine paul said a little disappointed such a generous offer had been refused eve could tell so the money he said well get it for you deliver it tomorrow night today was wednesday tomorrow afternoon would be better kiko said why wait we have to move it from overseas tomorrow night paul said asserting himself too little too late and kiko having won every other point that mattered gave a slight nod they stood eve rose to go but paul said eve stay a moment please and she sat down watching frank kiko and jose leave bucks stayed at the table paul said bucks go downstairs and count boobs okay tell the strippers to wait a minute outside youre in trouble queen bee bucks said as he went out the door and eve felt the blood leave her face whats the matter paul she said i want to hear your opinion he said ignoring her question theyre asking too much for the coke our profits too thin and they sure as hell want to get their foot in here kikos ambitious houstons a workable market for him the dominicans here theyve already got ties back to florida gangs he could negotiate a separate peace with them and cut us out easy you thinking everyones trying to tear us down they are paul she leaned forward covered his hand with her own they are honey were vulnerable any time theres a power shift here come the wolves we need to do several smaller deals boost our revenues and our profit margins not cut one big deal with a guy weve never worked with before you think i cant handle this you may not realize how weak we are right now no one gets a second chance with deals like these this puts us back on top get the five million he said and bucks will handle the exchange with kiko the air in the room felt weighted with smoke with the world starting to take a left turn tommy would have had her handle the exchange but she said okay change is coming eve he said nothing for you or frank to worry about im gonna take good care of you both but were gonna rethink business priorities my dad bless him he wasnt growthminded bogged us down in too many small deals youre worried about miami horning in here they should be worried about me horning in on them paul baby reality check how about a reality check on your part eve who works for who here im trying to give you perspective so you make an informed decision honey the decisions made paul bellini cleared his throat put on a smile you think im such a horses ass then you can help frank with running the club daytoday to her it wasnt far removed from a job flipping burgers you dont need me and frank for real work well go back to detroit i dont care much for texas to be honest eve of course i need you he eased back in his chair a little bit wriggling his butt into the throne he was twentyfour and he didnt know his ass from a hole in the ground worse he didnt know what he didnt know as long as you support our new directions she saw she couldnt win being put out to pasture her and frank both she had known paul his entire life and he looked at her with all the interest hed give yesterdays paper how does kiko want the cash nothing bigger than a fifty he said who you gonna work with richard doyle at coastal united she said hes safe yeah if the doggies aint running paul said with a laugh go find frank rescue him from miami vice tell bucks to take em back to their place and send the girls in would you kikos shy but im sure not what a nice guy hed turned into since his dads accident she stood and eve i noticed your body language while i was cutting the deal bucks saw it too i want your opinion ill ask for it otherwise smile and sit still like youre happy if big tommy was here and heard him talking to her that way hed backhand paul across the room but she said sure paul sure and kept her gaze to the floor she closed the suite door after her the two dancers the tall one they called red robin and a stunning black girl named tasha chatted in the hall wearing their stupid theme costumes frank wouldnt let the girls simply strip no they had to be characters red robin had a leather bikini with cowboy fringe a holster with little fake pearlhandled revolvers and a white stetson tasha wore a bra covered with cds and a miniature flat fake computer screen mounted in front of her crotch a computer mouses cord wound around her throat like a necklace the mouse resting atop mountainous breasts eve wondered how much the gear weighed shed heard paul was hot for this one yall can go in now eve said red robin did already swaying her hips to the downstairs music but tasha stopped hi eve how are you doing tasha spoke with the clean enunciation of an actress no street about her fine honey eve said with a thin smile i wanted to talk to you you know a lot about money right depends well paul said you knew how to hide cash so you dont have to pay taxes on it pauls mistaken eve jerked her head toward the door and hes waiting for you sure eve no offense meant tasha went inside shutting the door behind her eve stood alone in the thin light of the hall paul deciding deals involving millions millions and shutting her out now an uppity bigtitted dancer wanting tips on taxes because paul mouthed off about cleaning money a topic his father never would have discussed with a girlfriend a little pulse of nausea seeped into her guts she hadnt wanted to come to houston god no swearing never to set foot in texas again but tommy had insisted she and frank come to houston with him when the other mob bosses forced him out of detroit connecting a minor celebrity like frank to the topaz had been sheer genius for generating interest and crowds and giving it a more respectable sheen then the stroke took out tommy and now paul was risking everything theyd built eve walked down the flight of redcarpeted stairs club topaz was in full swing a cramped city of men in the dim light a trio of women danced on three different runways all three of them stunningly beautiful throngs of men and even a few women were in the crowd it was big business for a wednesday night in one corner a group of young astros whooped and hollered in another corner a houston rocket and a couple of visiting dallas mavericks enjoyed synchronized lap dances by a pair of swedish twins near the main stage ogling a poledancing doubled brunette was a local actor whod hit it big in a movie last year and scored an oscar nomination and of course around them a locust swarm of everyday guys drawn by knowing that athletes and actors and the famous would be on display as much as the supple thighs and perfected breasts did you all not get enough tit as kids eve wondered as she moved through the crowd looking for frank apparently the tour had slowed to enjoy the attractions she found frank kiko and jose at a front table a chesty latina dancing for kiko with a plumage of folded twenties on her thonged ass eve leaned down and said into franks ear paul says give them to bucks and im ready to go home excuse yourself from the table in ten minutes and ill be in your office frank nodded she worked her way back through the crowd and went upstairs to franks spacious office it was more for meeting and greeting than for reviewing liquor inventory or interviewing staff or talent plush chairs a mahogany table the inevitable photos of frank polo gladhanding every notable who passed through the club doors she sat behind his desk put her face in her hands and wished that tommy bellini wasnt laid up in a bed for the rest of his life it had been him thirty years ago that shed met to return the money that james powell had stolen for a chance at even greater money and tommy had not disappointed tommy had liked her brought her into the organization given her responsibility power and protection and a life free of cloying attachments but paul was why monarchy fell out of favor you could have a king with an idiot son and piss away the empire in no time flat and leave the loyal subjects with no jobs and one did not walk away from the bellini family with all the information eve had you didnt list on your resume the millions of dollars you laundered or how many hits you knew the bellinis had ordered frank was already relegated to being the clubs frontman god knew what job paul would give her probably stuck in a back office counting bar receipts if he doesnt kill you she had been afraid of tommy of course the fear kept you alive the caution of every step you took he could be kind generous even but if you crossed him you lost money you lost a finger you lost your life he held himself to high standards of performance paul wanted respect he couldnt yet command and seemed to have little regard for her or her abilities piss him off and she would sink like a stone in the waters of the ship channel sporting concrete sandals and three bullets in her head one for each decade of service the door opened and bucks stepped inside he shut the door behind him gave her a bright snappy smile dont you know to knock she said this isnt your office no its my boyfriends office what do you want peace and quiet he said this place is too loud not conducive to clear contemplation bucks sat down on the leather sofa like he was used to lounging in the office shouldnt you be guarding paul from what attack of the killer tits bucks said that tall redhead up there robin i thought you were sweet on her shes sweet on me theres a difference plus how involved am i really gonna get with a stripper i cant take her home to mama i was unaware you had such lofty morals all this lust it shows a lack of discipline and selfcontrol bucks leaned back against the leather you handle pauls money makes you important right now seems to me i ought to be protecting you more than him im feeling safe thanks chad channing says you can never feel safe because complacency blocks you from your goals she didnt know who chad channing was and didnt care so you giving our friends any money he asked she let a beat pass no you are paul wants you to handle the exchange honey naturally this guy had pauls ear so she decided to try this deal bucks i have serious reservations about it these guys are looking for a back door into houston theyll crush paul soon as they get their foot in the door paul and i can handle them bucks said look at kiko and jose they dont have four neurons between them bet neither one of them even got beyond high school baby getting a degree means you spent less time learning the actual business were in eve said this seems like every other business i studied at wharton you wont find an mba case study on the bellinis so what do you recommend find out a little more why theyve approached us why arent they dealing this coke in florida or take a shortcut bucks said kill them and steal their coke thatd be one way to sweeten the deal he gave her a crooked halfmad smile eve stared at him you ever seen a frijole popped they lose all command of their english blabbering all this spanish bullshit begging for their lives doesnt occur to them i dont speak spanish so its not helping their cause any bucks leaned forward put his elbows on his legs killing people on a whim is what got the bellinis in trouble before i might fire your ass on a whim like the power was his honey she said id watch how you talk to me im higher up than you in this family and im telling paul what you said about killing them she picked up the phone dialed the extension for the private suite bucks yanked the phone away from her shoved her back onto the floor then he was on top of her his fingers working into her neck not closing around her throat but digging into the flesh i was joking about popping them im not joking now bucks said pain exploded from her neck coursed along her arms her chest see what i got here this is all the flesh around the carotid now i start to squeeze the lights go dim i shut it off and thats all you wrote or i nick it just so and we have a mess on franks nice rug he brought his lips close to her ear the weight of him crushing the breath out of her you dont fuck with me you understand i understand she said large black circles dotting her vision he got up helped her to her feet eased her into a chair she watched as he went to the bar and poured a glass of water brought it to her youll have a distinctive bruise tomorrow like he was proud wear a nice scarf you got one she nodded stunned she took the water bucks knelt down before her put both his hands on her knees the intimacy of it was worse than hitting her now lets be friends he said she nodded but seething suddenly more mad than afraid i understand you and paul she said i understand the juice you got in your blood right now this is exciting way more exciting than energy trading right bucks gave a slow nod but these guys they will kill you and paul without missing a heartbeat they wont grab your neck and play around theyll shoot you dead and not think about it again for the rest of their lives thats why i should kill those guys and get their goods now that would start a war we couldnt win youve got to start thinking big eve she couldnt help it youve got to start thinking period bucks frowned at her his hand moved to his back where she knew he wore his pistol under his jacket youre not being a team player eve and i cant support this negativity it ends now the office door opened frank stumbling inside the miami wiseguys in tow hey frank said they want to see that photo of me singing with donna summer bucks stood and smiled easing his hand away from his holster folding his arms across his chest great then you boys ready for a ride back to your condo me and eve are done talking for the night he grinned at her this is gonna be our best deal ever isnt it eve she nodded slowly putting her hand on her throat and hating him a hundred and seventy miles south of houston whit mosley couldnt sleep and he walked from the guest house he lived in at the back of his fathers property past the blue quiet of the pool up to the main house his father babe sat at the kitchen table finishing a chocolate milkshake eating the sweet slurry with a spoon hey babe said you want one no whit said you wont sleep if you eat that sleep is a thief of time whit sat down across from his father irina asleep zonked irina was his fathers much younger wife a year or two younger than whit wife number five a russian girl babe had met through a marriageoriented service and brought to port leo from moscow shes tired all the time tired of me being sick he shrugged she wont have that much longer to worry about it daddy whit its okay no selfpity colored babes voice shes too young for death to be a widow he licked chocolate from his spoon ran a hand over the blondish gray stubble on his head shell go on and shell always love me but she aint gonna go back to russia and she dont have her citizenship yet so if she remarries kind of quick dont hold it against her he clinked his spoon back into the glass can we talk about my mother for a minute not with food in my mouth what brought her up i want to know if theres anything you never told us about her whit said for example did she cheat on you what possible difference would any of this make now dont shield me theres no point in it i believe she did she got bored with me frustrated with having so many kids so quick i never had proof you ever hear the name james powell babe shook his head what you up to whitman nothing whit picked up his fathers ice cream glass rinsed it out in the sink who the hell is james powell nobody you ever think about my mother wonder if shes alive rarely regret in his voice as though this admission meant weakness whit didnt look at babe as he loaded the dishwasher you ever want to see her again a long silence took hold the kind that carries a weight with it finally babe said this will sound nuts but ellen probably thinks about us more than i think about her shug but she left us she didnt care about us whit you wont remember this but most of the time she was a real good mother she held onto you boys tight like a life preserver you all were her chance for normalcy a life like people are supposed to have but she liked excitement once right after we were married i had to go up to the bank in rockport we pull up and she said out of the blue babe what if we robbed it she had this glittery look in her eye like she was hoping to be bonnie and i was gonna be clyde she gave me this sideways glance ill never forget we went to vegas on our honeymoon and shes pregnant i come back from the bathroom and shes betting a grand all our gambling money on a single blackjack hand she won and i got her the hell away from the table it scared me and the years after that im filling her up with babies and i guess that wasnt excitement enough he shrugged finally she left but you cant leave a large family and pretend they never happened i figure she died a long while back otherwise she would have called you and your brothers you said i dont remember her whit said but i remember her scent i never knew it was gardenia until i was older i didnt imagine it did i babe nodded smiled yeah she used a soap that smelled like gardenia why did you marry her whit realized he had never asked before because we got pregnant with teddy but the reason i loved her was babe stopped shed walk into a room crowded with people and read it in an instant like a map know who was mad at who who was wanting who hardly without two words being spoken it was funny to me that she could do that a little hypnotic too and she was smart pretty but not bitchy about her looks after she was pregnant and wed only known each other about six months marrying seemed like a fine idea i loved her and she would have been a great partner in business i figured i wasnt gonna do no better you didnt feel trapped no babe shook his head sure i had money and she didnt but ellen trapped herself wanted to be tied down forced herself into a structured life her mom and her werent much more than vagabonds working jobs up and down the coast she never knew her dad and her mama died right after teddy was born you know i really didnt have anyone else to ask about her after she left we all sort of felt wed been fooled into knowing her she got tired of normal she never appreciated normal babe stood shug im gonna go and sleep next to my beautiful sweet wife and not talk about ellen any more would you want to see her daddy whit asked you mean see her facetoface yeah yes he said after a moment i would i dont wish her ill but i would like to know what was so goddamned more important than you boys if she wanted to leave me fine but you boys only got one mama she stole the most precious thing in the world from you and your brothers whit and you deserve an explanation an apology i dont need her apologies whit said perhaps you do its water on the moon to me babe stretched his thin arms above his head whits throat thickened his father looked the worst he had since his drowningindrink days the healthy glow of longterm sobriety had been replaced by the dimming paleness of the enemy within chewing through his fathers liver youre like your mother babe said i dont mean it bad but she had to kick over the anthill to see what would happen youre the same we could look for her so you could know what happened to her asking if i want to see her and actually trying to track her down are two different things whit i wouldnt waste my limited time on ellen im invoking the imdyingsoigettobeanasshole clause i forbid you to look for her in case youre considering it i never read that clause respect my wishes please all right whit said he could change his fathers mind later if harry chyme found his mother he knew he could he hadnt heard from harry in a week its all hypothetical anyway ill see you in the morning love you shug said more often now in the sunset of life i love you too whit watched his father leave the kitchen in his slow tired shuffle i dont have much time left to find her whit thought not much at all paul bellini liked to watch the girls dancing in the smoky thin light the tall redhead robin was the best technical dancer of all the performers bucks liked her but wasnt serious about her and pauld called her up to the private suite to be sure she knew he was top dog the other was the regal black girl who danced wearing that customfitted computer gear on her body under the name geekgirl the audience loved her she kept her eyes locked on his eyes as she danced perhaps as excited by the sight of him as he was by her he took another long swig of scotch as red robin doffed her leather bikini top and dropped it on the floor he unzipped his pants pulled out his penis hardening in his hand wait a damn second geekgirl said she stopped dancing keep dancing baby paul said in a minute you can get down on your knees and do your best oh can i she said i dont think so dont be snooty red robin said with a goodnatured laugh and shimmy pauls fun not me geekgirl said she crossed her arms over her bikini top im not your whore so fire me im not worried about keeping my job in a place thats getting robbed blind paul didnt get mad he grinned put himself back into his khakis set his scotch down on the table hey robin go outside for a minute let me talk to your friend robin picked up the leather top tucked her ample breasts back into it turned and walked out of the room without another word the black girl stood there moved her hands onto her wide hips frowning you know who i am paul said yeah youre paul bellini he laughed but without humor i own the club and if i want you to dance for me then suck me off sweetheart thats what you do she sat down crossed her legs actually no i dont and if you dont pull your head out of your ass sweetpea you wont have a club to play around in quit worrying about your dick i told you youre getting robbed blind and youre worrying about whether or not you get a blow job tonight paul shook his head and grinned hed have her arms broken in about five minutes whats your name geekgirl your real name tasha strong you got a smart mouth tasha i only use it for talking she said so whos robbing me amusement in his voice frank polo ah for how much up to ten thousand a week paul tongued his lip and how do you know this miss cpa most of the girls dancing in here theyre sweet but not really planning their careers or futures like robin theyre now people im a tomorrow kind of person i keep my eyes open i notice details like when im doing private dances in the suites for a bunch of drunk lawyers franks charging five grand on the credit card but hes reporting four grand on the books that other thousand its getting funneled into his pocket that kind of money adds up real quick youre serious pauls face grew hot i looked on his computer she said compared it to the credit slips i saw after my dances over the past month i kept a little record in my head those files are supposed to be passworded he said they are it didnt stop me she shrugged his password is groove that was a real toughie to figure out she pointed to the cds on her breasts i do the geekgirl gig cause i used to work with computers and now youre a stripper job markets better and you got to follow your dreams he couldnt tell if she was being sarcastic can i have a sip of your scotch she asked paul handed her the glass watched her take a dainty sip cradle the crystal in her hands god she was stunning you had a stray impulse to look at the books he asked paul can i call you paul yeah sure he had decided to wait on breaking her arms i figured i could tasha smiled with your daddy in such bad shape your minds occupied you dont realize people around here are jockeying for positions seeing where they can take advantage of you seeing where they think youre weak im not weak i didnt say you were i said where they think youre weak she rose set the scotch down next to him eased herself down into his lap and the club is a weak point she started to rub his temples slightly his erection returned full force despite the talk of lost money with this weirdirritatingbeautiful woman sitting on his lap the club makes a fortune he said she squirmed ever so slightly against him oh it does so its going to attract attention you got every male celebrity comes through houston stopping off here you got thousands being spent every night you got the bestlooking women in texas dancing on your stage and doing private entertainments in the rooms she kissed him once feathery light and when she pulled away he leaned a little toward her wanting more but you got too much money being spent too much being skimmed too much sex being sold its gonna explode she leaned down kissed him again let her tongue tease against his i shut the club down youll be out of a job give me a new job tasha strong said im gonna finish dancing for you then im gonna screw you good tonight but because i want to you try to give me money i slap you into tomorrow i like you i like your smile she ran a finger along his lips he stopped her with his hand youve talked a lot he said and he put an edge in his voice the way his father used to he liked no loved the way she was talking to him but he couldnt let her see that wheres the proof against frank in your computers i copied the files in case frank or eve get wise eves in on this shes got twice the brains frank does no way she doesnt know hes skimming tasha strong unhooked one of the cds off her top im wearing the proof baby her other hand strayed down to his crotch you want to go home with me and start it up bucks suddenly realized he was outnumbered chauffeuring the miami dumbasses wasnt a big deal but he realized as he pulled out into the thick traffic of westheimer he should have brought a buddy to watch his back it was two against one but kiko and jose were laughing a little drunk rating the dancers as if jiggling were an olympic event he decided to take the long way home wanting to hear what they might say about the deal he pulled onto loop taking it toward i east which would lead toward the glittering towers of downtown houston he loved the city loved its happy chaos loved the way people drove like maniacs loved the way the humid air held endless opportunity even in the bad suckass years houston made you tough tough to grab the chances that came your way tough enough to persevere when the world soured kiko leaned over the dashboard fiddled with the tape player and suddenly chad channings confident voice filled the air make your goals your friends not your enemies they are not to be challenged or overcome they are to be embraced love your goals as you love yourself whats this peace love and understanding jose called from the back seat its chad channing kiko said dont you ever watch infomercials man he sells thousands of these tapes to he paused as though searching for the word that would not insult people who need a little boost discover the goals within yourself as you discover your love for yourself chad purred on the tape theyre right under the skin in fact were all motivated by goals we havent even discovered or articulated yet its better than coffee for getting me going bucks said but suddenly he felt a little uncool he felt kikos gaze on him amused and he swallowed a thick lump in his throat he clicked off the tape oh man i wanted to hear more jose said i havent had a good articulation in a long while hey jose this tape is bucks secret weapon kiko said how he stays so cool so tough all the time like it was funny thats right bucks kept his voice steady greasy little bastards he hated them both with a blackness that filled his chest thought they were clever when they were not worth the grit under his shoe as he merged onto bucks felt a tickle at the back of his neck he glanced into the rearview mirror and saw jose smiling at him kiko sitting in the passengers seat said because youre so tough and cool mr tightass executive i know you arent going to freak the barrel of a pistol that was the tickle along his nape jose held the sig up so bucks could see it then put it back at bucks throat we aint gonna hurt you okay man were all friends bucks was more surprised than scared shooting him while he was doing seventy on a houston highway wasnt real bright youre right were friends but i wouldnt hit a bump in the road right how kiko said he carefully eased the beretta out of bucks back holster bucks even leaning forward a little to make it easier deciding to cooperate houston is pothole city man you cant avoid bumps jesus put the gun up bucks said suddenly he was watching the highway for ruts that could jar the car blast his brains across the windshield you dont want to sour your deal with paul no we dont kiko said but we want to have a private chat with you because we like you i like your name jose said his voice was low hard like it was won in a fight in the mirror bucks saw joses peasant face break into a grin bucks youre what makes the world go round take the next exit kiko ordered this is a bad idea guys bucks started delays have dangerous ends jose said willie shakespeare was right man do what youre told take the next exit kiko repeated bucks took the shepherd exit he had a little caliber gun strapped above his ankle not a cannon but put it up to kikos eye itd get the job done of course jose would blow his head open while pretending to quote shakespeare to act like he was smart bucks turned onto shepherd as kiko directed go to that waffle house kiko said i like em better than ihop they dont have that fresh n fruity crap my grandma likes that plate jose said its also rootytooty shes their target market kiko agreed bucks turned the jag into the waffle house lot they wouldnt kill him at a busy restaurant he decided jose moved the pistol away from the back of his head but kiko pressed bucks gun against the flat of bucks belly where it would deliver a nice crippling gut shot he parked at the back of the lot still calm weighing how he could get to his ankle gun wondering what they wanted if he would be alive in five minutes pauls going to be calling for me soon bucks clicked off the engine not with his eyes full of big boobs jose said youre new to this line of work arent you kiko asked yes but i went to business school with paul bucks said i heard he flunked out kiko said yeah bucks tried not to look at the gun pressed against his abs but we stayed in touch i called him when he moved down to houston with his family because a friend whose family is mob might be handy jose said i like paul hes cool bucks said kiko cocked his head you were at energis bucks tongue turned to sandpaper yeah i worked there for a while as an energy trading exec right kiko said man and people say were crooks jose said that company robbed the whole country you left energis kiko said right before the financial meltdown you sound like a lawyer bucks said asking questions you already know the answers to whyd you leave the company kiko said now bucks said nothing see being a businessman kiko said i follow the news three energis energy traders went missing after a night out drinking murdered bodies and car dumped into galveston bay looked like a robbery went wrong thats what it was bucks said i knew those guys sure you did they all worked in your group then six weeks later your divisions at the heart of the energis multibilliondollar collapse tragedy surrounded me bucks said at that time in my life outrageous fortune jose said life sucks there were allegations about you mr buckman and your friends deaths like they knew about those onlyonpaper deals that had boosted energis stock and your own wealth kiko said allegations dont mean much bucks said proof matters and now with your business career gone jose said my careers fine a disgraced energy trader mailing out resumes mustve been an exercise in humiliation kiko laughed did you get a single interview ive never had a stranger so interested in me bucks said youre on the verge of stalkerhood here understand kiko said that we own your ass from this day forward you want me to come work for you forget it im not betraying paul because you got such loyalty to your friends and coworkers right jose asked coolness in his voice he looked thickheaded but he sure wasnt bucks thought you killed those three guys kiko said his voice low because they were gonna talk were gonna ruin your sweet little setup you were already getting into pauls pocket so he loaned you a private spot for the kill we were already watching houston close man watching the bellinis every move see where we could take advantage of them kiko leaned in close alan gillespie hunter gibbs ricardo montoya you brought them to that house the bellinis own down in galveston bucks didnt move but his blood pounded in his chest his palms went damp and he hated that youre full of shit it juices you up good doesnt it kiko whispered knowing you have power over another persons life its okay youre among likeminded folks part of our surveillance of the bellini properties included videotape jose said with gillespie gibbs and montoya arriving at the house with you timestamped and everything you were wearing a nice cashmere jacket a little warm for the season slatecolored shirt khaki slacks you were the sober one its pretty highquality stuff very nice kiko agreed im gonna thank the academy after the world gets to see it i dont believe you jose pulled a portable dvd player from his briefcase slid in a disc let it run leaning forward to hold the screen in front of bucks face the house in galveston the film image clearly shot with a telescopic night lens probably from a vantage point down the street a car bucks old bmw followed by a lexus pulling up in front four men got out of the cars ambled into the house decent shots of their faces easily identifiable jose fastforwarded then bucks carrying out a wrapped body dumping it in the trunk then another then another then driving off in the lexus turn it off bucks said your voice has lost its confidence jose clicked the player off then sniffed did you just crap yourself heres the deal kiko said we want the five million pauls paying for our coke but well keep the coke at the same time youll start a war bucks said a fiveminute war kiko said the bellinis theyre in a bad jam organizations falling apart paulboy needs this deal we need it to not work and youre gonna help us why me because well give you a nice cut and because paul trusts you and because we got your balls nailed to the wall kiko said and if i say no no one ever sees you again jose said like willie s said he dies and makes no sign excuse jose hes a bit dramatic got it from his mama kikos voice was cool as a snakes skin the authorities would be fascinated by that movie so would americas funniest videos jose said bucks glared at kiko so i get the five mil and just hand it to you sure kiko said just think of stealing the money as a new goal weve articulated for you ive been digging claudia said into the bellini family thursday morning dawned bright and cool on the texas coast and whit and claudia ran hard along the sand of port leo beach the beach was a crescent with a park spooning against it the water shallow the bay shielded from the gulf by the long finger of barrier islands this was the day of the week they ran together whit usually preferring to run in the evening but now it was a routine with them starting at the county courthouse working over the harbor and the beach then back up through parkland and neighborhoods back to the town square and you found they have a frozen drink named after them whit asked they hit mile one and the sweet surge of adrenaline settling into the run primed his muscles more than that harry said that tommy bellini was suspected of killing another family boss right yeah i searched the detroit free press online archives the rival his name was marino was whipped to death with a chain his face was gone the flesh had been torn from his bones his organs were in tatters hed been beaten long after he was dead it doesnt seem ganglandefficient whit said i thought they preferred guns dont act like that doesnt scare you she ran a bit ahead of him made him catch up with her i made a couple of calls to the detroit pd talked with a detective pretended that wed heard that the bellinis were buying a vacation home here you lied for me thats sweet whit said he told me that the police believed that it wasnt tommy himself that it had been done by his son paul they turned off the beach heading into parkland cleanly manicured grass that stretched from the waterfront up to the highway past windbent oaks kneeling almost to the ground like father like son he said so so if your moms alive and tommy bellinis out of the picture his sons a psychopath she reached out to touch his chest slowed him he stopped running started walking not looking at her the detectives in detroit i talked to said paul bellinis one of those kids whos never been told no doesnt believe people feel the same pain he does if his familys still involved in criminal activities hes going to be the new head of the family if they were criminals why didnt they do time people connected to the bellinis did tommy did a brief bit as a kid but since he became a boss no never never enough evidence or witnesses doesnt that tell

investigator might not be the first friend to introduce to dear old mom and claudia was opposed to this whole enterprise but gooch he was fearless and nuts and inventive in tight situations harry might call claudia to check up on him ensure he hadnt come to houston so leave sooner rather than later if gooch didnt have fishing clients today and could go do it before claudia could stick her wellintentioned nose in and talk him out of going houston so close he felt sick and dizzy and happy and afraid all at once edith he called to his clerk cancel my appointments for today and tomorrow

of what she might say to me i shouldnt care if she spits in my face and walks away i shouldnt care but you do gooch said dont tell anyone whit said thursday morning eve woke with a start gasping at the hard dig of bucks fingers in her throat a memory turned to dream she got up from the bed early around six frank polo snored next to her she examined her throat in the mirror bruised but with sickening precision bucks had half strangled her had been going for his gun when frank and the miami dealers walked in and an unforgivable line had been crossed she could not be treated this way there was a hierarchy an order of respect in the organization and bucks had ignored it in tommys day it would not have been tolerated but tommys day wasnt ever going to dawn again one of the monolithsized bouncers had told her that paul bellini had left the club with tasha strong walking funny and in a big hurry the bouncer said with a knowing laugh while she was nearly getting killed by his pet loon paul was screwing a stripper she had half a mind to call pauls mother tell her save for the last moment that tasha was black which would kill mary pat bellini on the spot but she didnt tattling would piss off paul worse she washed her face and when she looked up from the sink frank was standing behind her he kissed the top of her head what if paul sides with bucks did you sleep on that last night he asked hes not gonna side with bucks after i talk to him anyway he needs us now he needs mentors mentors he said in disbelief pauls not a summer intern hes killed people frank hush that is not so frank rolled his eyes anyway killing a guy is a lot easier than running a business she said paulll listen to us when hes not drunk and horny ive got to talk to him before bucks does im heading down to the club leave it alone what a classy boyfriend you are really coming to my rescue here frank because i love you thats why you need to forget it happened youre not going to drive a wedge between paul and bucks hide and watch she said hide and watch this aint never been a bad gig sweetheart follow orders and keep your mouth shut frank staggered off to drink coffee she showered fast grabbed toast and eased her mercedes down the driveway onto timber the house wasnt technically theirs rather it belonged in name to tommys sister eve liked living in river oaks perhaps the most exclusive neighborhood in houston even though they lived right along its edge she took an immediate left onto locke stately homes lay on her left and the thin ribbon of river oaks park on her right she turned onto claremont then onto the major thoroughfare of westheimer it was always busy but it was her favorite street in the city snaking from near downtown out to western houston she drove past palmlined highland village with its highend shops and restaurants catering to the old oil money and the new tech money past the sprawling shopping utopia of the galleria then onto a longer slightly less tidy stretch of road that included nightclubs strip shopping centers and club topaz leave it alone frank had said in other words go ahead and paint a bullseye on her back and hand bucks the gun frank grabbed too hard onto the present rather than the long term save paul from a mistake now earn his undying gratitude that was the way to solve this problem frank couldnt see that that same stifled vision was why franks music career died when disco did he had a voice suitable for the classiest pop ballads for music with muscle instead he jumped on a ship doomed to sink and complained no boat ever came to save his ass from the ocean of obscurity but frank had a point she took a deep breath today if paul didnt take her side shed act like shed let it go pretend the encounter with bucks didnt happen get the cash for the deal with kiko show she could follow orders show her unquestioned loyalty and then quietly get ready to disappear again eve waited around the club thursday morning and into the early afternoon for paul wondering why the lunchtime crowd wanted to ogle strippers while chewing on overpriced sandwiches and then head back to work with an unrelieved erection she went back up to franks office shortly after one and paul was sitting behind franks desk feet propped up on franks papers well hi she said been looking for you honey wheres frank at lunch with a liquor rep ive been trying to reach you so you and bucks paul said had a little spat you got my messages yes i talked with him this morning and he says you misinterpreted his actions i misinterpreted him going for his gun eve said what he wanted to show me a monogrammed clip she pulled the scarf from her throat you see the bruise he tried to cut off the blood to my brain hes nuts you know im under a lot of pressure paul said although he looked as relaxed as a cat fresh from a dinner bowl you and bucks being the people in the world i trust the most dont need to be snarling at each other she didnt like the smile on his face not at all too calm too sure of himself and this trust the most crap she didnt believe it if i misinterpreted him then im sorry but do you think what he did was right he ignored her question have you got the cash ready for the transfer to kiko yes richard doyle from coastal united bank is meeting us at the alvarez office over by the port this afternoon fine you can go with bucks okay she said its amazing how much disapproval you can pack into one word eve kiko grace will gut you from stem to stern if he gets a chance and youre dead if you forget it hes afraid of me you got the transfer set up with kiko or is he too scared of you to meet she asked bucks and a couple of boys will take the money to wherever kikos got the stash and we do the exchange the dust is hidden in decorative pottery theyll truck it out to a safe place east of town have a little potsmashing party later at least paul had the sense not to go to the exchange himself hed learned that much from his father when tonight i want to get that coke on the street he laughed lots of depression in houston these days everybody needs a little pickmeup even you and frank hey sit down for a minute he said she sat frank paul said hows he doing fine he spending a lot of money lately not that i know of because paul said were missing serious funds from club topaz she let five seconds pass franks not a skimmer a little panicky thrum quickened between her ribs surely frank wasnt that stupid because he doesnt have the brains for it franks not dumb be honest with me eve i dont know anything about him skimming money she said a little here and theres okay a perk of the job at least my dad viewed it that way paul leaned back in his chair laced his fingers together on the flat of his silk shirt what i dont like is the idea of frank taking advantage of my dad being stuck at deaths door and helping himself because its easier franks not a thief i spent the evening checking the books against the receipts and franks had his hand no eve his fucking arm deep in the till hed gone from easygoing calm to screaming his face red spit flying from his lips this was why paul didnt give a crap what bucks had done to her her heart filled her throat her mouth you want me to talk to frank for you she prayed hed say yes let her handle it get the money back not send the muscle pounding down on frank you know frank he doesnt know numbers he probably entered a few figures wrong in a spreadsheet hes not the brightest star in the sky paul dragged his sleeve across his lips yeah you talk to frank because i dont want to smash franks face in he brings in the celebs without franks touch were just another highend titty bar the staying power of minor celebrity never fails to amaze he smiled a cold one like his father used if hes having money problems he should let me know ill take care of him pauls voice was now gentle steady it scared eve of course paul theres a reasonable explanation i have to be able to trust him eve if i cant trust him if i cant trust you he let the words fade into the quiet then i have to take corrective measures regardless of my affection for you or frank corrective measures tommys old code words for a hit dizziness spun through her head at the idea of paul ordering her and frank killed she thought of ricky marino his body thrashed into shreds by a chain she didnt know for sure that paul had done it but people had whispered yeah he sure had whooping and screaming and making a tantrum into a gutwrenching kill that ended up discrediting his father and destroying their organization in detroit ill make good on anything franks done she said in a rush and if i pay it back and youre still mad at him then let us go back to detroit wow paul gave a soft laugh i havent even shown you proof of franks skimming you sure seem ready to believe hed do it after a moment she said well you wouldnt accuse him without good reason finally you show faith in me he said of course i have faith in you honey always you want to see the proof yes he handed her a cd destroy it when youre done he said one file shows the charges actually made on client cards the other shows the nightly revenues theres a big shortfall ill check it carefully if its him youll get your money back and an apology and hell work for free no salary for six months hell show you respect paul i promise franks stealing from me from my dying father and you you want to lecture me on how bucks behaves and what deals i enter into im not lecturing you she said god forbid so who found out frank was skimming doesnt matter he got up from behind franks desk and she stayed still as he walked behind her chair after a moment he put his hands thickfingered on her shoulders i know you returned money to my dad years ago a big load of cash he otherwise would have lost so im giving you fair warning you clean franks nose you get the money back he stole and you and frank keep breathing understand yes she said the pressure from his hands tightened on her shoulders her collarbone his thumbs rubbed the sides of her neck tickled them slightly avoiding the bruise bucks had left i forgive once eve not twice thank you paul she said ill fix it how much does he owe you about ninety thousand he said the pressure on her throat increased she said nothing it could be worse she could call detroit talk to a couple of old friends get a loan frank the idiot what had possessed him ill fix it she said again please let me talk to him first ill straighten this out paul bellini eased the pressure of his hands slowly turned the chair so she faced him leaned down close to her frank steals from me or my father again im gonna take him to a doctor i own in arizona ill have his tongue removed no anesthetic then his mouth surgically sewn shut ill let him starve like that for weeks and then ill take a chain to him and put him out of his misery i understand she said she fought down a wave of nausea he leaned back now you and bucks go get that money for me ill see you when you get back all right eve stood fought to keep from trembling all right drive careful paul said that traffics a bitch eve sat at franks desk peering at the computer screen frank still hadnt returned from lunch which he considered a marathon event and hed forgotten his cell phone on his desk she was reviewing the files on the cd paul had given her and gritting her teeth the discrepancies between large credit charges and the books had started small but widened in the past two weeks in one case a private party of ten in a suite had incurred charges of nearly ten thousand dollars only five appeared on the spreadsheet for the same charge the other money diverted and never making it into the bellini pockets a little yes a perk this much was unforgivable the slow crooked twist of a headache sprouted in her temples and she craved a hot bath a cold glass of wine and silence her cell phone beeped and she clicked it on hoping it was frank eve its bucks ill meet you at the exchange bucks said im running a little late on other business for paul sorry the barest hint of conciliation in his tone he wanted us to go there together she said sorry cant ill meet you there he took a breath hey eve about last night i apologize i was out of line too much wine i was kidding around with you okay its forgotten honey she said trying to sound relaxed eve i do respect you the great work youve done for tommy all these years she didnt believe him not for a moment but she needed him on her side now with paul furious and said its okay we need to work together well for pauls sake lets have a drink after the errand today drown the hatchet he said with a little laugh but not at the club ill take you to a classy place with a really stellar wine list im sure youre tired of looking at tits in strobe lights that sounds good ill see you shortly bucks said and hung up odd she would have thought that bucks would have ridden with her been her shadow in getting the money especially if he knew about pauls accusation against frank but fine whatever she closed the accounting files and headed down into the nearly deserted club a few men still sat at tables watching a dancer an air of failure hovered about them guys alone in the afternoon who didnt have desks to return to and she wondered if most of them were salesmen having off days blowing commissions they hadnt earned she walked out into the bright hard houston winter light headed for her mercedes frank that idiot she wondered why hed skimmed he didnt do drugs beyond a rare and purely social toot of coke he had no gambling problem their finances were fine not grand but then they didnt need much tommy provided fairly paul seemed far less inclined to share the wealth ninety thousand it was a long slow bleed that she couldnt afford she was in her late fifties now she couldnt launder and courier money forever she had already taken a few precautions over the years in case she needed to run credit cards under an assumed name cash hidden in secret deposit boxes she could drive right now to houston intercontinental get on a plane to detroit or where no one knew her find the montana of the next stage of her life begin again and what then she could not conceive of landing a normal job what on earth would she put on a resume her history of the past thirty years might as well be a blank tablet a life run on empty and she couldnt leave frank behind if paul wanted you dead she told herself youd be dead already hes mad but hes not killing mad so who told him about the skim not bucks because bucks would have grilled her about it himself so someone else she drove onto the loop that encircled houston gliding the mercedes around slower cars midafternoon traffic moved like a european grand prix cars weaving brakes used often and not wisely she headed past acres of industrial buildings the newly refurbished gulfgate shopping center the dazzle of reliant stadium and the forlorn quiet of the astrodome she headed north over the sidney sherman bridge that arched over the vast port watching the road but taking in the view of houston and the ship channel below the port of houston was huge the major artery for shipping from the deep south down to mexico central america and south america massive storage facilities lay to her left acres full of justunloaded volkswagens and audis to her right freighters and tankers idling at the docks the port made her nervous it seemed a door where a person could be seized taken anywhere in the world and never found again all in a matter of days the next exit past the port was clinton drive and she took it the rest of the traffic on the road were eighteenwheelers she headed away from the highway and on her right was an array of rail lines and gates where heavy trucks rumbled out with cargo on her left were weedy lots a prosperouslooking lumberyard a tire reseller brick bars with signs offering ice cold beer and bebidas compuestas a chinese restaurant a tiny walkup taco stand she turned her mercedes right onto mccarty and a block down turned again into a little parking lot a bar stood at the end rositas with a handpainted sign above the door a woman with a snake entwining both her arms unlit neon signs for cervezas in the window and next to it a small office built of cinder block painted white the world headquarters as she always called it of alvarez insurance interested parties who called the number on the door got a heavily accented voice on the answering machine basically apologizing that mr alvarez could not accept any additional clients the glass door announced by appointment only in both english and spanish and what could be seen of the office looked empty drab uninviting to thieves since it was rarely occupied tommy had used it for meetings and exchanges and cleaned money through it as a business mr alvarez was nominally retired but sold a lot of life insurance policies overseas that were cashed in within a year of purchase moving money back into the country last year he had moved nearly four million of bellini money all propelled by eves finding a new loophole in insurance law no cars were parked nearby richard doyle drove a cadillac and he wasnt here yet she hoped he hadnt succumbed to his ongoing deep addiction and swung by the horse track on the way over five million in cash could be a temptation shed have to count it brick by brick twice before shed sign off eve got out of the car wrinkling her nose at the distant smell of the port she was fumbling for the office keys in her purse when the man turned the brick corner of rositas not twenty feet away and hurried toward her excuse me maam eve glanced up at him her hand still deep in her purse she didnt know the man attractive balding fortyish khaki slacks and a navy blazer yes eve said and the man brought up a small camera one small enough to hide in his hand and snapped three pictures he lowered the camera as eve ducked her head and he said i didnt have a highquality closeup to use youre ellen mosley arent you eve froze then her feet moved and she hurried back to her car if youre not ellen mosley why are you running from me the man asked eve didnt look at him again fumbling for keys her skin felt like ice she forgot entirely about the cars remote entry taking my picture like that what kind of freak are you one of your sons wanted me to find you the man didnt come closer let me help you help me doyle and bucks would be here any minute jesus who the hell are you she wanted to scream at the man do you ever think about your sons ellen thats not my name and i dont know what youre talking about she jammed the car key into the lock turned it yanked the door open would you like to see one of your sons i dont have children eve said she felt like a fist had smashed through her skin her muscle and chest bones to seize her heart and squeeze it into gel she sat in the car slammed the door thumbed the lock switch the man hurried to her car window calling to her through the glass calling her ellen unbelievable if you want to see your son i can arrange it no one has to know please forgiveness isnt impossible eve powered up the car threw it into reverse peeled out from the lot she watched the man standing in her rearview mirror not giving chase of course not he probably already knew eves license plate knew where she lived but she knew nothing about him she gunned the car down mccarty back onto clinton toward the highway harry chyme watched the gray mercedes tear away from the parking lot the woman had glanced at harry when hed yelled through the window that he could help her that no one had to know if she saw her son the unexpected words about forgiveness hed nearly had her harry tucked the camera back into his pocket this wasnt going to be easy for whit to hear certain dogs should be left sleeping even better left to die in their sleep he had wrestled with taking this direct approach but he had waited until she was alone far from bellini colleagues and it had gotten him the answer he needed before whit decided to charge up here not interested whit could stay home and harry could go back to doing divorces harry walked around to the back of the bar where hed parked after following her to the port from the club go back to his hotel call whit tell him the woman wasnt ellen mosley perhaps that would be best see if a voice sounded behind him hey buddy you bothering eve he called you ellen mosley eve got four blocks down clinton before she pulled over in front of an abandoned warehouse and vomited into a ditch she hadnt eaten much today and she spat a long ropy strand that tasted of orange juice into the chopped tops of the roughly mown grass she wiped a tissue across her lips looked back down the road as if the man in the navy blazer would be leading an avenging charge of mosleys babe in the lead six angry sons marching behind but the road was empty she got back into her car she drove along clinton past the highway into bluecollar galena park past a little motel that catered to truckers fast food spots an oldstyle barber shop she pulled into a mcdonalds parking lot several blocks down she put her lipstick back on keeping her hand steady what if the man was still there in a few minutes when bucks or doyle showed would he watch them follow them she should have said sorry you have the wrong person i dont know who youre talking about bluffed her way out and gotten into the office but she was already rattled by paul telling her about frank she wasnt using her brain her best weapon she went inside bought herself a coke drank it further washing the hotyuck taste from her mouth ate a mint tried to call bucks on her cell phone no answer tried to call richard doyle at his office no answer she didnt leave a message with either she called paul and he answered i cant get in touch with bucks tell him the meeting with doyles off why theres a heating problem in the building their code for police are watching the man wasnt police but eve couldnt give the real reason to call off the exchange ill let him know tell him to call me im down clinton at the mcdonalds paul hung up without another word eve sat down at a booth with her coke and three booths over a mother fussed over her trio of small children all with ketchupsmeared lips vrooming the little plastic roadsters that came with their lunches and letting their hamburgers cool on the trays the mother was cajoling them in spanish to eat their burgers not fill up on their fries the boys ate the drooping fries like birds devouring worms three little boys she watched the children your boys probably ate a lot of meals at mcdonalds god knows babe never knew how to cook she waited now that the shock was subsiding for regret to fill her heart sadness her children had not been mentioned to her since that longago day in that small wreck of a motel room in bozeman james powell threatening her kids her broken ties to them raw and fresh her nestling the little gun in his snoring mouth but instead she felt scared and confused her kids couldnt be looking for her they couldnt she watched the clock tick its minutes fifteen passed she drank a second coke tried again to call doyle and bucks eve got back in her car studied the wheel she didnt want to leave the plastic womb of the mcdonalds didnt want to go back to the alvarez office but doyle would be there by now and bucks would still show if paul hadnt reached him she couldnt screw up this job no not after frank had put them on the firing line she started up the car turned out into the lot headed back to the office a car she recognized as richard doyles cadillac sat parked near the alvarez front door no sign of the man in the navy blazer she pulled up next to doyles car he wasnt sitting behind the wheel she got out went up to the door her key ready this time but the door was unlocked and she pushed it open she smelled the crisp stink of gunfire as soon as she stepped through the doorway eve froze there was no sound but the quiet hum of the airconditioning the office had a small reception area with two offices and a tiny kitchen in the back silk flowers that needed dusting stood on the bare receptionists desk she took her gun from her purse held it in a firing stance she moved forward into the main office she used for her exchanges richard doyle lay on his back he was a floridfaced good old boy but the rosy full cheeks paled in death two bullet holes marred his forehead dark and wet blood splattered his shirt and tie another bullet had found his chest the man in the navy blazer lay next to him two bullets in his forehead blood on his eyeglasses eyes wide mouth slack his hand was on his chest three of his fingers ripped by a bullet eve knelt by the man supposedly sent by her son felt his pockets empty no camera with her pictures inside no wallet no id she stood her legs wobbly her foot stepped on richard doyles hand and she jumped back quickly there was no sign of the five million in cash doyle was bringing to her no duffel bag no suitcase nothing she moved through the rest of the office there were few hiding places empty the back door to the office was unlocked as well she pushed it open looked back into an alleyway empty except for a pickup truck she knew belonged to the bar owner in the neighboring building and a car that looked like a rental a nondescript taurus she took two steps toward it and heard sirens begin their cry on the moist breeze she shut the door ran back through the office back out the front got in her mercedes revved it away from the storefront she pulled onto mccarty back toward clinton and when she was a block away she saw in her rearview mirror a houston police car wheel into the lot pulling up near the bar someone must have heard shots and called the cops a car pulled out after her onto the road from across the street a silver jag she recognized as bucks he revved up close behind her in the rearview he gestured to her to stop she slammed her foot down on the gas accelerating toward a red light that would put her back on clinton her cell phone beeped bucks name was on the readout she scooped the phone up whats the hells going on bucks said what she screamed why are you hauling ass out why are there cops theyre dead she screamed they doyle and some guy and the moneys gone what what guy pull over and lets talk right now her heart felt like it suddenly exploded who knew about the meeting she knew paul knew bucks knew doyle knew you killed them she said you shit you took the money no pull over eve he said the jag drew closer she floored her car zoomed through another light shifting from yellow to red went left onto clinton headed for the highway bucks stayed with her leaving a chorus of honking cars in his path wheres the goddamn money i dont have it she said you killed them you took the money his voice was quiet as death pull over right now eve he said she sped on and he rammed the jags bumper into her rear she tore the mercedes around a pickup truck and a semi heavy with goods from the port the jag wheeled around the trucks started to pull even with her a sharp ping sounded of metal hitting metal he was shooting at her she veered across the lines into oncoming traffic accelerating toward a truck that laid heavy on its horn the truck roared off the road plowing into a lumberyards wire fencing and a parked pickup she glanced over saw bucks closing on her rounding a station wagon edging past a braking semi eve tore back into the northbound lane as another truck thundered past missing her by inches and cut off bucks she aimed left onto the entrance ramp for a scream of metal sounded behind her in the rearview she saw the jag swerve around the back end of another service truck piping and a ladder flying free from the truck bucks peeling away the left side of his jag damaged but still coming now on the ramp she jammed the accelerator to the floor hurtling into midafternoon houston traffic pounding on the wheel going up the immediate rise of the bridge he came up fast after her nearly clipping another semi carrying hondas in a zigzag stack ripping across lanes leaving a wake of slamming brakes and screeching horns firing at her two bullets hit the edge of her rear windshield ricocheting off she swerved to the left nearly colliding with a frightened woman in a pickup truck a child in the passenger seat screaming at eve in terror and eve tore back to the right away from them thinking thats it hell hit me but as they rushed down the incline of the bridge bucks went left getting the pickup between him and her and as he sheered back to follow her she darted into the speed lane flooring the pedal moving in and out of the array of trucks cars now trying to get out of their way a cloverleaf exchange came up eve went toward the exit that would put her on e and watched him try to follow and then she wrenched the wheel bolted across every lane and hit the ramp for to galveston he couldnt get over nearly spun out trying and two cars behind him rammed into each other brakes squealed she couldnt see him then merging into traffic now but he didnt come up in her rearview she drove toward the coast finally taking an exit after ten minutes shed lost him she waited for another fifteen minutes then ventured back onto when she reached the interchange traffic was backed up two wrecked cars being cleared no one looked hurt but there was no sign of the jag in the few seconds she had to scan the stalled cars she took to kirby a major thoroughfare that threaded back into the heart of houston the coldness in his voice played over again in her head ordering her to stop shooting at her determined to kill her sure she was the last witness bucks had killed doyle and the other guy taken the five million and now he was going to accuse her of taking it he said she said and who would paul believe she knew the answer she pulled into a bagel shop parking lot she fumbled for the phone called paul tell him no answer except for pauls voice mail she said i dont have the money i didnt take it and if bucks says different hes a goddamned liar he took it hes trying to kill me dont believe him call me please paul please paul had to believe her he had to know she was telling the truth but oh god frank had helped himself to money paul had threatened them both he would believe she was ripe to run the five million fueling her engines she steadied her hands on the wheel she needed a place to go a way to talk to paul that didnt put her at risk not facetoface right now that would be suicide if shed been set up and frank if they thought shed taken the money theyd go after dumb sweet frank ill have his tongue cut out he had said she dialed franks phone no answer run she thought run like hell she tore out of the parking lot what is the difference between a tick and a lawyer charlie fulgham asked whit and his friend gooch waited the tick falls off you when you die what do you call a lawyer who doesnt chase ambulances charlie shifted his balance brightened his smile retired whit said praying this ended the routine man but youre a judge charlie said youve heard them all he shook his head leaned against the doorway stuck his hands in his pockets look whit

sure charlie closed the door behind him and they heard the tread of his step going down the wooden stairs nice guy whit said that audience is in for a laughaminute treat that boyd rather humiliate himself in front of an audience thats gonna boo him off stage than take another case and a big fat retainer i hope he makes it i cant afford for him to get poor and stop his sport fishing whit dialed harry chymes cell phone he left a message harry its whit call me gooch cracked his knuckles lets talk about the bellinis about a plan of action gooch bent over his duffel bag pulled out a gleaming sig sauer handed it to whit know your world and get the right spear for it grasshopper this is for you like i said this is the only thing the bellinis will respect whit held the gun beautiful he thought although he had never been one much for guns he knew how to shoot but it felt awkward and heavy in his hand this wont be necessary shows what you know about mob families harry said my mothers boyfriend runs a highend strip joint for the bellinis gooch took the gun from whits hands charlie says paul bellini owns club topaz lets start there i dont think my mothers working there gooch why dont you go to the strip club see what you can see i got another angle id like to work im calling the shots gooch you understand i know youre treating this like a secret mission but its my family problem i want to handle it my way yes your honor tell me i heard sincerity whit said im deceitfree right this minute whats this other angle gooch watched the tree limbs rocking near the window as the wind stirred them you can try to find your mother at a bellini hangout present yourself as whit mosley nothing to hide a guy trying to find his mom or you can convince harry that now youre here he needs to tell you what he knows and not shield you from the big bad truth or take a more aggressive approach aggressive lets say you find her whit and she has no interest in seeing you or in a sweet little reunion with your dad before he dies id say toss her over your shoulder and haul her to port leo thats kidnapping although i cant imagine a jury would convict you and she wouldnt have a lot of sympathy if she pressed charges gooch let a crooked smile creep across his ugly kind face the problem is the bellinis they probably dont take kindly to a guy coming in and hijacking key members of their family so let me kidnap her you keep your hands clean whit paced to the bed thanks but no gooch shell come with me why theres nothing in her interest to make her do so shell come he said again whit gooch said his voice going quiet man i do not want to screw with your head the bitch dont call her that st ellen has had thirty years to make amends she wouldnt know you if she walked past you on the street what she sees you she suddenly cares a heart grows where there was stone did you read that in a bad poem i wrote that in a bad poem so your backup plan is to kidnap her and keep the bellinis at bay whit said youre a freaking strategic genius im trying to save you time gooch shook his head so whats it gonna be im going to see if my new plan a works first whats plan a find her whit said and get her away from these people if i can talk to her really have a conversation with her thats all i need to do you have an unrelenting and hopelessly naive belief in the goodness of people whit why should she talk to you im not so good gooch theres a man she knew in montana whit said i mention his name ill get her undivided attention night had begun its fall and the mercury lights pooled over the lot of club topaz paul bellini stood at the window of frank polos office watching the valets park cars the blood hammering in his head in his chest he took a calming breath he liked to play a game with himself look at the cars figure out how much money each driver would spend a porsche would be a guy who would drop a couple of hundred because it was himself and a friend your lexuses bmws mercedes often four to five guys together up to a thousand easy best of all would be a little fleet of cabs and limos arriving those meant groups bachelor parties sports teams packs of young wolves ready to lay out serious cash the lot was half full it was still early for a thursday but the empty parking slots pissed him off paul closed the heavy shades of the office with a flick of a button the little whir of the device was the only sound in the room except for the labored breathing and soft crying of frank polo where is she frank paul asked his voice was kind a quiet murmur of buddyhood a whisper between friends oh christ i dont know frank polo sobbed he sat curled up on the chair paul had punched him twice in the ribs backhanded him franks lip was swelling would purple before long you hear from her she left two messages on my cell phone crazy ones they dont make sense nothing makes sense right now frank paul said his voice an ooze of concern i got five million in cash missing i got two people who couldve took it bucks and eve bucks comes running straight to me tells me what happened eve runs bucks sat in the corner pouting bleeding from his own mouth where paul had punched him staring at frank bucks couldve taken it frank started but you know he isnt already stealing from me paul said he sat down next to frank touched his jaw gently frank this is going to get real ugly real fast and i dont want that youre family help me understand this i really truly dont know where she is frank said i havent talked to her you dont help me then i got to put a hit on her thats gonna tear my heart open frank well dont frank said you love eve help her now tell me where she is so we can talk to her i dont love her if she stole five fucking million from you frank said its over between her and me if shes turned traitor he wet his lips with his tongue looked up at paul like a dog looking shyly to nuzzle a strangers hand now eve called you yeah i forgot my cell phone left it here stayed a long time at lunch then ran errands i came back here got to gladhanding with an early group a bunch of japanese businessmen i didnt come back up to my office until an hour ago play me the messages on your phone paul said i erased them i wasnt thinking straight paul frowned what did she say in the messages and dont you lie to me i start snapping fingers if you do and he took franks hand ran a fingertip along the finger and palm and positioned the middle finger between his own bent it back ready to break frank gasped she said doyle and another dink had gotten shot at the exchange point the money was gone bucks had tried to kill her and for me not to go home where did she want you to go she wanted to meet me at the neimans at the galleria at five it was already past seven where you been this afternoon what the hell were these errands i went over to the platinum club they got new dancers girls we ought to have you spent the afternoon ogling tits while your girlfriend stole five million from me paul said giving the finger a little twist wondering if the snapping bone would sound like a twig or louder like a pencil uhhh frank moaned jason the bartender at platinum hell tell you i was there and i talked to two of the girls that we want to recruit for topaz ginger and anita theyll vouch for me paul let go of his hand turned to a muscular man with dyedblond hair standing near the door gary call the platinum see if his story checks out gary stepped out of the office i need that cash frank paul said we got a deal going down late tonight and now i got to call them and postpone how do you think that looks to a man like kiko he glanced over at bucks get a couple of guys over to neimans have them walk the galleria and keep a guy watching eve and franks place ill take care of that bucks said personally paul cocked his head frank here could be right and youre lying to me bucks blinked im not im here eve isnt this isnt complicated you tried to strangle her and nearly pulled a gun on her last night frank said shes given her life to this family and you dare to touch her she tried to call off the exchange frank bucks said told paul there were cops watching well that was a lie there werent any cops there frank swallowed bucks gave him a thin trap of a smile where else would she go frank paul went to the wall of franks office he ran a finger along the three platinum records baby youre my groove boogie city when you walk away he took down baby and shattered the framed record on the corner of franks desk oh god not my disks frank stood in horror paul picked up a jagged shard and turned back to frank tell me where she is frank jesus paul frank screamed this is me please this is you between me and five million paul said where would she go frank swallowed not to our house she wont come to the club or any of our hangouts she got a place she goes when shes stressed what you think she went for a spa treatment bucks said paul shot him a look and he went silent if she took the money frank said slowly she wont be staying in town if hes framed her he nodded toward bucks shes probably gonna go back to detroit where people have sense be very careful old man bucks said paul get real you think eve took that money seriously frank pleaded you been skimming club money from me way more thans acceptable i know you have bucks said hasnt there been a big outbreak of initiative around here so paul said its not a big jump to eve deciding to take a lump payment and retire she would have taken me with her she didnt frank said so you say shes been bitching about the way i fart ever since dad got hurt she doesnt like how im running things she knows shes gonna be retired youve screwed the pooch big time frank so she takes the money and runs paul leaned down close to his face ran the tip of the jagged vinyl along franks eyebrows wheres the money you took i stashed it in an account in a bank in katy frank said katy was a distant suburb west of houston a nice quiet town known for good schools football and big malls all ninety thousand i havent spent it it was a loan i was gonna pay back in a few months with interest paul shook his head loan do i look like an atm frank you see any fucking buttons on my front no why did you want a loan frank worked his mouth i wanted to cut a new record bucks laughed short and sharp im gonna cut you a new record paul said right after i cut off your fingers and your balls and your ears please paul franks voice broke ill do whatever you want to make it right paul let go of franks shirt took a step back that ninety thousand its not so bad not nearly as bad as what eve did to me i tell you what you get her and the five mil for me you can keep the ninety thou paul youre gonna let him get away with that bucks said you shut up paul said you find eve bucks you can have the ninety thou bucks shut up im not trusting either of you too much at the moment paul said thats why you both got to prove your loyalty bring her to me think of it as a modified contract you two boys are the only bidders he glared at frank you give me your katy account info and im moving that money back where it belongs sure paul frank said you steal one more cent from this club and im going to kill you with this broken record an inch at a time i understand paul not an inch im going fucking metric a centimeter at a time i understand paul i dont think you do frank paul said and he reached out grabbed franks hand turned the palm skyward and with one swipe of the shard laid the flesh open blood spurted frank screamed paul shoved him to the floor frank clutched the torn hand to his chest next time im slicing your dick paul said now call doc brewer and get yourself sewed up frank staggered toward the phone you go downstairs and call the doctor get out of my sight you get blood on the carpet im cutting the other hand paul said frank tucked his hand inside his suit jacket and fled from the room hes lying bucks said he knows where she is nah paul said no way hed come back here if he knew paul gave him a smirk hes an old guy and a hasbeen he was stupid youre not stupid are you bucks no good because i got a couple of soldiers searching your crib right now theyre not going to find five mil in cash there are they no i told you i dont have it thanks for the vote of confidence man bucks stood squared his shoulders you brought me into this business paul i owe you everything im not going to betray you we both know that you had the same opportunity as eve you hired me bucks said but you inherited her tell me again what you saw bucks took a breath i was running late getting to the exchange why fender bender on two lanes closed for about fifteen minutes traffic sucked bucks shrugged then what i get to alvarez doors open i go in find doyle and this guy dead bodies still warm no sign of the money he paused i check doyles pockets his wallet his ids gone the man doesnt have id on him the smell of gunfire is still fresh theres even a casing on the floor i pick it up pocket it then i get the hell out being sure im not leaving prints he tented his fingers i pull the jag across the street start to call you and then here i see eve tearing back into the lot she goes inside i wait to see what happens then she comes tearing out before the cops show if she had killed them and taken the money while you were stuck in traffic why the hell would she come back bucks held up the casing she found she was missing one and came back for it eve would be thorough if she planned a heist like this shes hot a hit man paul she could have missed a casing in a panic or she was coming back for another reason bucks put the casing on the desk her coming back was a huge risk doubt in his voice im telling you what i saw even a lady sharp as eve isnt going to think straight all the time i dont like not knowing who the man was with doyle paul sat down i want you to find out the cops are going to be looking closely at a banker getting killed down at the port theyll come after us if they make the connection between my dad and alvarez insurance first they have to make the connection bucks said paul shook his head this is like finding out your favorite aunt is a twodollar whore its depressing people often disappoint you better not paul said im trusting you man find her find the money see if we can push back the deal with kiko until saturday night but he cant know we dont have the green he knows that were dead in the water no one will supply us that moneys the starting point for us starting point bucks said the reason i wanted you working with me paul said is that im going to be bigger than my dad ever was i need your expertise a lot more than i need muscle with guns were gonna run houston bucks and when weve got that base to work from im going after the men that humiliated my father that drove him out of detroit barici vasco antonelli theyre driedup old men now the racketeering laws have broken most of them they worry so much about the feds they wont see me coming but im going to annihilate them and they wont be able to touch me he jabbed a finger at bucks his face reddening but i need this deal to jumpstart us to build a stronger power base with an ally like kiko youre not mob anymore bucks said quietly with all due respect paul leave it alone theyre old men they dont have nearly the power they once did whats to be gained from it eve knows those guys she could run to them with the money if she wanted theyd give her sanctuary shelter shes old school she and them theyd understand each other she knows how i work so you got to find her and the money im not gonna let my family be humiliated again if i cant find her bucks started hey bucks paul said if you dont find her nobodys ever gonna find you whit passed under the eagle eye of the bouncer who looked carved from a redwood paid the twentydollar cover walked into the thump of the music the strobe lights blinking against his skin club topaz was dark as a dimly lit closet a happyhour crowd thinning out and a wellheeled postdinner crowd settling in the only fully lit areas were the stages awash with white glows from both ceiling and floor the crowd was mostly men with the exception of a few women who wore uncomfortable smiles as if here under mild protest the decor was heavy on gold and chrome a strange mix of roman antiquity perhaps to suggest an impending orgy and contemporary sleekness the club had retroguido written all over it probably part of the cheesefactor appeal but it was spotlessly clean the waitresses moving among the tables with precise energy the cogs of the club all warming up to produce a night of longing and money a woman was dancing solo on the stage and her moves were not of the simple shakethetits variety she was tall redheaded and she moved with easy grace and wry suggestion performing to david byrnes cover of cole porters dont fence me in as opposed to a generic danceclub beat she was dressed as a skimpily clad cowgirl a stetson perfectly angled on her head topless but wearing a thin bandolier that divided her high and mighty breasts leather chaps over a sparkly gstring and a holster she drew her guns and sprayed a couple of heavyjowled men with water they hooted and clapped she blew imaginary smoke from the guns barrel and the men howled in appreciation she moved with the confidence and style of a broadway dancer who happened to be showing her breasts a funkier fosse girl removing her gunslinger gloves she dropped them on the balding head of a delighted patron whit moved to the bar looking for gooch theyd decided to come in separately gooch had been in for ten minutes already he saw gooch sitting alone at a corner table nursing a beer watching the stage he selected another corner table and sat down his stomach dropped as he realized his mother was possibly less than a hundred yards away from him he could come facetoface with the shadow that had always loomed over his life while surrounded by strippers and men waving crisp dollar bills it was not the reunion he had envisioned as a child little flowers of sweat blossomed under his arms along his ribs on his back a waitress dressed immaculately in a white shirt red leather vest black bow tie and a black leather miniskirt snug over supple hips appeared almost instantly sir what may i get you a corona please the frosty beer with the requisite lime slice perched in the bottles opening quickly materialized on a napkin before him he paid with cash and watched the tall redhead finish her show to wild applause while the announcers voice said give it up for red robin shes heading back to the plains to a pause hung in the air rope her dogies and shell be back in a while now coming onto our main stage is desire omalley shes got a pot of gold at the end of her rainbow and in a burst of celtic drums and fiddles a bosomy colleen with a jaunty green hat and suit jacket riverdanced onto the stage clogging with a surprising degree of expertise barely restrained breasts jiggling she wore a little fake leprechauns beard that she tossed into the crowd amid laughter and clapping it was horndogridiculous but the women were extraordinarily pretty none of them and whit watched a few working the room offering lap dances or sitting and chatting with customers had a weary worn look to them from eking out a living in an exploitative field playboy could come through with a camera crew and do shots to fill a years worth of magazines in ten minutes he glanced past the stage he saw two doors that looked like they led to restrooms and a darkened alcove lit with a thin red gleam offices he guessed on the left side away from the stage stood a curving staircase with burnished cypress rails a small velvet rope closed the staircase off with a private sign hung discreetly on the rope at the top of the staircase stood another door shut he took a sip of his beer and a voice next to him said would you like a dance sir whit glanced up to see one of the most beautiful women hed ever laid eyes on she was moviestar gorgeous skin the color of lightly milked coffee hair cut short because the hair could never be more than a frame for that stunning face full mouth cheekbones high delicate jaw brown eyes you could drown in a brief bra of cds covered her top a thin fake computer screen shaped to fit covered her loins over tearaway hot pants i got ds in computer science he said she laughed politely like the line wasnt new id die of happiness if you danced with me whit said not with you she said letting him have his joke for you a lap dance sure how about just sitting and talking to me for a minute she hesitated he supposed there was actually more intimacy in talking than in dancing she could gyrate give a little hip sway expose her breasts and it would be less revealing than a conversation where they would have to scope out each other as actual human beings he asked how much is it for a dance a hundred well you put a hundred on my tab but sit here and chat with me for a minute whit said no dance im recovering from heart surgery she signaled the waitress with a twirl of her finger whit realized hed have to give a credit card he didnt have that much cash on him a risk but he had to talk to people and there was no reason to believe if his mother worked here she would see one out of dozens of credit receipts he gave the waitress his card and the black girl sat down next to whit at the little table whats your name he asked geekgirl she said no really tasha hi tasha im whit ive heard a lot of lines in this place but heart surgery is a new one she fixed him with an intelligent amused gaze im a weak man like every other man here you in town on business like every other man here yeah im a location scout for a film company hed considered several ploys to get him into the offices of the club and in an instant decided on this one she raised one perfectly styled eyebrow a film company sorry im not in casting he said i assume this place is thick with aspiring actresses yeah we got girls here hungry to do shakespeare hoping to bring deep new angles to ophelia sarcasm in her tone not me what are you aspiring to world peace she said he swallowed a thick gulp of beer the waitress came and brought tasha a club soda slice of lime bobbing among the ice cubes blessed are the peacemakers dont take anything i say she said seriously you strike me as a woman of refinement and intelligence her smile got tight im a naturally friendly person whats upstairs im not that friendly she said i didnt mean to imply that tasha whit said private suites we get a lot of famous people here like to have their food and drinks and dances out of the glare so are you trying to impress me with your hollywood connections or are you really looking for a place to shoot your movie i suspect i cant impress you very easily you seem too smart for that and too smart for this place he watched as desire omalley finished her number wearing a glittery shamrockshaped gstring over her clover as she bounded off the stage and yes im scouting for a thriller hero is a spy trying to capture a rogue agent whos stolen a deadly virus his romantic interest goes undercover as a stripper in three scenes to get close to an informant so we need a club why arent you shooting in la texas is cheaper so who would i talk to here about filming frank but be warned hell want to be in the movie frank frank polo hes the manager but kind of a figurehead i know that name sweetpea if you know his name you dont have good taste in music tasha leaned forward started to sing in a clear alto that cut through the humping music of the performer on stage baby youre my groove baby youre my groove i know that song frank never recovered from his saturday night fever she shrugged he had gold records then and now hes managing this place how far can you fall this is a very nice club tasha absolute paradise i hope to retire here one day so how could i get a meeting with frank polo she studied him if youre not legit honey i wont waste franks time with you no offense you got a business card he didnt of course but he made a show of searching his wallet and his shirt pocket hed dressed in khakis and a loose shirt and now he thought he didnt look hollywood enough no mousse in his hair no waycool sunglasses i dont have one on me i mustve given out the last one at club yes this was another fancy strip club hed seen a billboard for it on the highway you mustve tasha said polite and unconvinced ill give frank a call whit said or does he have an assistant i should talk with he patted his pockets again as though gathering his thoughts see you dont want to commit to people that you have an interest in filming at their business get their hopes up if its not right thats why they call it scouting sure tasha said whit realized he was overexplaining talking too fast for much credibility my assistant did call club management earlier though she spoke with eve eve michaels he made it a question yeah i know eve tasha said but shes not tasha a voice rumbled behind whit your presence is requested upstairs a wiry guy who looked rather corporatedrone for a stripclub employee walked past whits chair leaned down on the other side of tasha whispered to her she nodded once gave whit her indulgent but professionally distant smile excuse me it was very nice meeting you scout enjoy your evening at club topaz thank you tasha she rose and walked past the wiry guy who turned to leave whit said excuse me the guy turned back to him and gave him a smile cold as ice yes id paid for her to sit with me for a bit whit said i believe im due a partial refund since youve whisked her away whisked cold smile said his badmood scowl deepened sorry no refunds how about a favor instead whit said where could i find eve michaels cold smile sat down across from him i understand shes involved in the management of the club whit said not really why were you looking for her cold smile did not have the look of a club thug nice suit conservative haircut a rep tie over a pale blue shirt but a freshly swelling lip like hed taken a punch in the past hour what are you her receptionist whit asked now cold smile didnt smile whats your name ill tell her youre looking for her never mind my name my business with her is private cold smile looked at whit as though trying to fit him into an odd equation well come with me buddy ill take you to her whit glanced through the strobing lights over at gooch desire omalley the wild irish rose shimmied out a lap dance for gooch you want to go or not cold smile said this was happening too fast being taken before his mother but he thought of his dad and he stood up his stomach felt like it was left behind in the chair this way cold smile said and whit followed him moving past the velvet rope and upstairs toward the suites whit glanced back at gooch couldnt see his friends face obscured by desires smooth back the second floor had the reddest richest carpet that whit had ever seen and they made no noise as they went along a row of doors with gold numbers gleaming on them cold smile knocked on number five opened it peered in here we go whit thought hi mom he followed cold smile inside but the room was empty cold smile grabbed the back of whits neck in a pincer hold working the nerves and carotid like dough with his other hand whit gasped the air in his lungs thickening into jelly one arm went around his throat then he felt the unwelcome jab of a gun into the small of his back i pull the trigger cold smile said and youre riding a wheelchair for the rest of your life whit held his breath not hard he barely had any air left its not been a good day at the office cold smile said in a low growl i want to know why youre looking for eve and i want to know in the next five seconds five four three she owes me money whit said it was the first thing that came to his mind a blast of lightning through his brain the gun didnt waver from nestling against his spine for what whits mouth dried i had money i needed moved offshore cleaned up harry had said his mother worked in mob finance this was a possibility but she didnt return my money that bitch is freelancing now cold smile said turn around whit did and cold smile socked him deadon in the face and whit staggered back he closed his hand into a fist and lurched forward but the guns cool barrel abruptly pressed against his forehead how much money cold smile said what does it matter to you whit said the guy was being too artful too fancy in his handling of the gun in his stance right now like he held a swords tip at whits throat enjoying it now not being brisk and businesslike the door eased open behind him rooms taken cold smile called not glancing back try one down please spicing his voice with a little friendliness but i like this room gooch slammed the door behind him locked it a knock immediately followed a young womans voice barely audible on the other side of the door its the dorkswithguns room get out man cold smile darted a glance back at gooch but pushed the barrels point deeper into whits forehead i will and im gonna go straight back to detroit and have a little talk with joe vasco you know him the guy who ran the bellinis out of detroit who the hell are you your better half gooch said you shoot my friend vascos guys fly down from detroit take your stringy ass out to the bayous and feed you to the gators a pound at a time shouldnt take more than three or four days for you to die vasco cold smile repeated yeah gooch said cold smile lowered the gun whit didnt move the gun wasnt screwed into his skull now he started breathing again whats your name cold smile asked whats yours gooch said they call me bucks the guy said bucks gooch asked a smile on his face for the first time as in money or as in rhymes with fucks and sucks like youre a prison bitch as in money bucks said in a dead cold voice im leonard it was goochs real first name rarely used the guy youre threatening is michael it was whits middle name never used and youre from vasco youre catching on quick is calculus your hobby gooch asked ill go get paul gooch shook his head no need to rush to paul and tell him were here he doesnt know thats the way mr vasco wants it ever since tommys in the hospital vascos wanting to see what paul does wants to make sure hes sticking by the agreement staying out of detroit staying out of the business no drug dealing no money cleaning no illegal activities bucks frowned whatever were doing in houston is frankly none of mr vascos concern pull your head out of your brooks brothers ass son if we tell mr vasco that paul is stepping out of bounds getting into lines of work that arent his to go into then hell send a few illtempered gentlemen to straighten you dinks out and youll be one unhappy mostly dead wannabe gooch said thats assuming you get back to detroit bucks said and whit saw the momentary fear leave the mans face replaced by brittle anger gooch had gone too far man cool it whit said he glanced at gooch you cool it too lets talk all right his face ached and the skin under his eye was already beginning to throb he was going to have a shiner and a sudden rage boiled at him this guy knew his mother saw her knew her business he wanted to pound his fist into bucks mouth whyd you lie about the money why didnt you say you were from vasco this thought moments late made bucks voice rise and he turned back to face whit goochs fist slammed into the back of bucks head drove him down to the floor because youre nothing but an ass wiper gooch made his voice more growl than talk because we dont owe you an explanation you understand me whit knelt took bucks gun from him now pounding rocked the door a key fumbled in the lock whit placed the gun on the table his hand near it two thicknecked guys came into the room staring at gooch at whit with his clearly justpunched face at bucks now sitting on the floor whats going on bucks one asked friends of mine bucks said playing a joke on me everythings fine he gave a nervous little laugh the two muscles looked at gooch and whit again sorry i had to keep miss omalley out of the room after she brought me up gooch said part of the joke the two muscles looked at bucks nicky its fine its cool tell desire well give her a big tip for her trouble bucks said standing yeah i got a big tip for her gooch said and now the men laughed its all cool well be down in a minute bucks said and the two men backed out and shut the door behind them you see how it is bucks said i give the order theyd kill you i see theyd try detroits watching gooch said you remember that so what happens if detroit doesnt like what they see bucks asked i wouldnt be too loyal to paul whit said bucks looked over at him again as if for the first time we want to talk to eve michaels bucks tented his cheek with his tongue made a clicking sound in his mouth shes not around the club often give us a home number then an address gooch said bucks didnt say anything for several seconds as though chewing over his choices shes out of town for a day or so do you have a cell phone number for her gooch asked no sure dont bucks said call me later he took a pen from his pocket whit could see the bulge of a cell phone inside as bucks jotted the number on a napkin whit took a step to one side one question whit said and as bucks turned toward him whit popped him with a right jab below the eye left of the nose then another hard bucks staggered back fell on the floor now we match whit said he grabbed the gun from the table pointed it at bucks and reached into the mans coat pocket for the cell phone hey bucks said shut up or ill dig this in your forehead like you did me whit turned on the phone found the address book clicked through the numbers listed inside eve cell was one he committed the number to memory and dropped the phone on bucks chest you did have her number whit said thats one lie youve told us you dont get two asshole bucks found tasha in the dancers changing room buds nestled in her ears swaying to music in front of the mirror he yanked out an ear bud heard the thin thump of her song where the hell is paul up in a private room alone she glared at him over her shoulder no time for you anymore he said in the mirror he was watching her chest covered by thin white lycra shed taken off all the computer crap it lay in a jumble on her makeup table like a system undergoing repair she took out the other earphone hes watching a basketball game hes in a real sour mood word is youre his new girl word is that blond guy you were talking with yeah whatd you talk about hes a scout for a movie production company looking to film a few scenes here she examined her lipstick in the mirror bucks was silent he run a tab yeah why now she watched his face in the mirror no reason a movie here thatd be cool she said nothing watching him with a wry smile whats your problem he said did you get punched in the eye its starting to swell tasha said paul isnt going to like that why would he care a black eye thats a good advertisement for a badass really shows you command respect i fell on the stairs hit the railing he said and as soon as the words were out he regretted them saw she knew he was lying little miss smart mouth uppity and acting like her brain was as big as her tits he wanted to reach out grab those perfect breasts and twist them in a fierce squeeze until she screamed but she was pauls now if kiko grace or these detroit dinks had their way paul would go for a long swim in galveston bay and miss smart mouth could join paul when bucks was through with her you should be more careful on that thick carpet she said watch your step dont you need to go shake your tits for the slackjawed masses he said i doubt paul wants you talking to me that way she said and left as red robin sweaty from a lap dance came in to towel off hey sugar bucks said he had decided being real sweet was a good idea right now robin gave him a quick kiss hi what happened to your eye baby fell and hit the staircase like a dumbass robin kissed the mark by his eye angel baby ill go to the kitchen get you an ice bag in a minute i want you to do me a favor keep an eye on tasha tell me what shes up to bucks put his arms around her gave her another short little kiss up to shes shaking her ass just like me not up to anything i want to be sure shes not screwing over paul um okay robin said ill keep an eye on her we staying at your place tonight its gonna be a late night sweetie deals and all you go on home ill see you tomorrow night let me get you that ice pack get it to go i got things to do he gave her an affectionate swat on her thonged rear as she went out the door bucks went back into the club found the waitress whod waited on the table in question the charge card was to whitman mosley the ugly jerk who had come up to the room with desire omalley hadnt used a credit card had paid strictly cash whitman mosley the name did not ring a bell maybe the guy was using a pseudonym that would not be recognized as a vasco loyalist from detroit but the guys story well he didnt quite believe it because they were too interested in eve didnt ask about the other players in the houston organization and the blond guy had a tooweird nervoussad look on his face when bucks talked about eve none of it sounded right to him he dialed his cell phone calling nicky one of the guys whod interrupted his discussion with the two men yeah nicky said you following them yeah about six cars back now were on buffalo speedway theyre driving aimlessly like theyre deciding where to go dont lose them he said i will kill you if you lose them he clicked off the phone stepped back out into the thrum of the club he should call kiko he didnt want to he took a calming breath go deep he thought be centered keep your focus on the goal many will seek to pull the goal away from you destroy them but never lose sight of the goal bucks walked upstairs to frank polos office frank was there sitting on the couch his hand now neatly stitched a glass of pinot grigio sat on the side table beaded with cold the bellinis had a doctor on call who liked discounted cocaine didnt mind house calls and thought discreetness a saintly virtue the doctor was leaving now and he nodded politely at bucks then looked again at him you want a compress for your eye its gonna go shiner doc brewer said no thank you the doctor left bucks sat down next to frank handed him the cold glass of wine put a hand on franks shoulder lets be realistic i cant compete with you on landing the ninety thousand bucks shrugged eves gonna contact you you know it i know it frank swallowed a gulp of the wine then another watching bucks waiting were on pauls shit list but he still has faith in both of us or wed be heading for the bay right now hes pretty goddamned mad hes mad yes but frank you and i are all he has left to make a go of this deal with kiko he needs you and me to be his team to help make it happen bucks slid into his businessmeeting voice smooth ready to rally the troops you help us find eve and i guarantee i can get him to forgive your stealing you can even keep the ninety thou a team frank considered the idea tenting his cheek with his tongue fine bucks were a team so dont lord over me that i made a mistake okay it was a loan i understand bucks said i do man i know what tough times are like i wish youd asked us for the money up front paul might have said no to you never youre the closest thing to a dad hes got frank held up his bandaged hand okay an uncle then sucking up isnt you frank said you dont have to bother trying with me bucks bucks gave him a crooked smile fine are we supposed to believe you manipulated credit cards and book entries on your own to the tune of ninety grand youre a singer youre not an accountant eve set it up didnt she now frank stared into the yellow of his wine didnt she frank bucks said quietly she mightve frank said after a moment ah a breakthrough bucks said but your girlfriend took off left you holding the bag you can pick em frank ive not been lucky with women frank said most singers arent artistic temperament bucks said joe vasco frank made the sign of the evil eye am i supposed to know what that means bucks said i cant stand joe vasco you been in touch with him huh wanting old friends to take over tommys ops now that pauls pissing you off joe vasco isnt my friend frank said hes not a friend to any friend of tommy bellini lets be sure of that frank you and eve youre not on a new payroll if i was then i wouldnt need to borrow ninety grand would i point taken bucks said franks valiumed smile faded im going home bucks grabbed franks bandaged hand dug his nails into the stitches frank yelled wine sloshed onto the carpet youre gonna let me know if you hear from her right frank yes yes and to build our team spirit im going home with you in case eve calls you now go downstairs and wait for me frank set down the wineglass and staggered out his palm cradled to his chest bucks dialed a number listened for an answer he had to buy precious time and now bad news theres a delay about the money he said not what im wanting to hear bucksy jose said they had a problem at the bank nothing serious eve couldnt wire the full amounts back into the country a temporary delay until saturday be kidding im not kikos going to be upset jose said highly upset thats your problem man jose said thats your problem you just dont know it he was quiet a moment you not turning on us are you bucksy because if youre messing with us we send the police that film and some buttered popcorn you got me i know it okay god he hated jose and calling him bucksy like he didnt know what he was doing like he was a child it made his skin crawl youre going to get your money i promise call us tomorrow morning jose paused with good news only good night bucks said he hung up the phone not much time he had to get every gun from paul and kikos sides aimed at eve michaels make sure all the blame stayed firmly on her point it at eve and these two dinks that were looking for her it didnt matter why they really wanted to find her he could paint them as her partners in crime the dinks why would frank or eve who hated vasco he knew that part of the bellini family history was true call vasco for help they wouldnt so who were these two jerks guys from kiko testing him or plants from paul hopefully not hopefully just two dumbasses that eve screwed over but he could screw them over big time now make them the target instead of himself if he played out the game right planned his work and worked his plan like chad channings goal winners tape advised he took a deep breath closed his eyes envisioned a todo list with clean little checkmarks the beauty of completion next angle to work go reassure paul bucks roamed back to the party suites he found paul in one leaning back from a workedover plate of enchiladas and a couple of empty shiner bottles hiding in beer and comfort food while bucks did the heavy lifting in the corner a basketball game was on the rockets overpowering the jazz what happened to your eye paul asked squeeze the wrong ass accident it doesnt hurt he said hed break that jackass michaelwhitmans fingers the next time he saw him youre not bringing me eves head on a platter or my five million paul said im not sure why youre here no paul i dont have her yet bucks said but i got an extension with kiko said it was a bank problem good new problem bucks said i found a couple of guys who seem extremely interested in eve they might be a help to us who guys were here looking for her gave me a line about her cleaning money for them wanting to find her real bad bucks didnt mention their supposed vasco connection or that they didnt seem to know eves cell phone number because it didnt fit into the theory he wanted to feed paul these two theyre her partners they can lead us to her bucks said but bucks paul stood turned off the television shrugged into his jacket if these guys know where she or the moneys at rip it out of em then kill them do your job man now i had no idea you were a mafioso from detroit whit said gooch turned his van into a diner parking lot pie shack off kirby the lot halffull of cars lots you dont know hoss whit traced his finger along the phone number hed written on a napkin downstairs in the club before heading for the doors suddenly afraid hed forget it in the rushing thrill eve michaels phone number the combination of numbers that could open a longconfounding lock what if this woman wasnt his mother what if she was bucks can figure out were not real mobsters with a couple of phone calls gooch said yes hes strange bucks looks more like hes a corporate lackey than gang muscle whit said you pushed him too far i saw it in his face because we hit a very raw nerve hes scared and hes willing to switch sides to someone who could outgun his boss maybe bucks is on precarious footing somethings rotten in belliniland or hes an opportunist whit said this is one great ally you pick for us gooch fate picked him not me surprised you punched him hes between me and my mother and he would have shot me if we hadnt been in a busy club he would have shot you anyway those rooms are soundproofed no one would have heard over the bumpandgrind and theyd carry you out after the club closed gooch kept his eyes on the parking lot on cars coming in and out we werent followed that means he doesnt want the rest of pauls crew knowing about our chat you spoke with authority back there gooch marine corps you learn how to speak properly hoorah i dont think so whit said you know this world dont you these men organized crime i watch a lot of movies which bear no resemblance to the real world whit said you hitting him was a smart move gooch said act afraid of him youre dead this is social darwinism at its nexttomost advanced only prison is more brutal gooch glanced over at him this is a side of you i didnt quite expect your honor this is me whit stopped what this is me finding my mom its like training your whole life for a single event like the olympics or the super bowl or the world series and now you cant make a single misstep if i screw this up he could roll down the window wad up the napkin toss the number into the street go home to his dad take care of him walk away from clearly serious trouble call her gooch said quietly tell her youd like to see her what if shes not my mother then wont i be a fool whit said i can think of one threat to get her here and its not how i want to start a new relationship let me talk to her gooch said im much more charming and refined for now she was emily smith insurance came in many different forms and for eve protection lay in a safedeposit box at a branch bank on kirby west of the rice university campus and the sprawl of the texas medical center inside the box a black purse held an illinois drivers license a mint visa credit card a passport in the name of emily smith and five hundred in tidy bricks of cash she retrieved the purse after listening to news radio in her car to hear if there was breaking news about a double homicide near the port there wasnt but it wouldnt be long and shed know how much of a description if any whoever called the police had given of her at least the police wont kill you why should paul believe you after franks skimming and the answer to that question made her blood race shed seen what happened to thieves in detroit pliers blowtorches broom handles were the toys of choice of the men charged with finding where missing money lay if they believed paul and bucks over her and given franks recent pilfering it was more than likely they would torture her for days before putting a bullet in her head even if she couldnt reveal where the money was hidden if she ran she looked guilty and they would never give up she had saved herself once before taking the stolen cash back to tommy and she figured it was the way to save herself again find the money prove bucks took it get the money back to paul she needed a hiding place to wait out the crisis and hatch a plan paul might not be watching the airports yet he would be soon enough he could pull kiko into the search as well kiko would have a vested interest in getting hold of the cash she could drive anywhere in the country but then that would leave frank alone and she was afraid of his bearing the brunt of her supposed guilt she decided to stay in houston at least for the moment hiding out at a dive motel was out of the question her car wouldnt fit in so late that afternoon she headed west on i out into suburbia took the addicks exit on the edge of houston and got herself a room at a nondescript hilton she used the emily smith card to pay believing that paying in cash would attract undue attention at a nicer hotel holding her breath while the card was processed shed paid a lot of money for the emily cards and documents getting them from an old friend in detroit who specialized in false identities and when the desk clerk handed her back the card along with a slip to sign she nearly collapsed in relief she tried frank on the phone no answer she showered put her clothes back on ordered room service soup and salad and ate she needed basics but she didnt want to go to the nearby sprawling malls shed found her rock her comfort zone and she wasnt eager to get out of it would you like to see one of your sons she poured a soda from the minibar drank half of it down wiped at the tears that chugging the fizz brought to her eyes maybe the man wasnt from one of her kids maybe it was a trick of bucks he might have found out about her background a way to shock her into leaving the exchange but there were much easier ways the guy who took her picture had to be legit her sons she did not think of them every day but she did on their birthdays at christmas when classes started although they were all grown now and long past anxious first days of school she had pictures of them hidden in the house in houston not even frank knew about them the thought of losing those photos never seeing them again made her ribs hurt eve turned on the news at ten it was the lead story two people found shot in an office near the port the glossylipped anchor faked a frown of personal concern the two bodies have not been conclusively identified her cell phone rang she looked at the caller id frank she clicked it on frank theyre going to kill me because of you frank said his voice was low aching paul sliced my hand open you happy i didnt do it i told them that they dont believe me bucks did it she said i knew it that bastard hes got the money cant you prove he did it frank said no hes sticking to me like a horny fan frank said im calling from the mens room on the second floor at the club hiding in the toilet frankshe started then stopped they gave me a valium shot im a little fuzzed i do love you babe even if you did this im having to act though like i hate you or theyll kill me dead i told em youd called me wanted to meet at the galleria so dont go there where are you he asked its better for you if you dont know i need to get that money back frank or prove i didnt take it she suddenly didnt feel tough or smart she simply wanted to be at home in bed with him watching an old movie snuggled under the covers make a deal with the cops theyll protect you im not doing that eve baby then come in talk with me with paul if he doesnt already believe me im dead or bucks will shoot me dead to protect himself before i get two words out you stay away paul believes even more that you stole it frank said her anger at frank boiled suddenly your damn skimming youre half the reason im in this trouble why on earth did you take money from the club everybody pinches frank said he sounded as mournful as a schoolboy called before a growling teacher but this guy in la he said if i could front the money he could get me recorded and we could sell the cds on ebay or get me guest backup gigs i still got a name eve it would have worked then i would have fed the money back into the club no one had to know i figured youd help me do it frank my god im sorry im sorry but she heard resolve in his voice i messed up so im gonna save your ass how i can find where bucks put the money he said frank you cant find your dick most days jesus youre good to me what a sweetheart im scared for once im scared all right her voice shook i dont have a way out of this i cant even come home frank ill meet you anywhere no she said what you dont trust me now she didnt but she wanted to trust him so badly her need was a sour taste in her mouth the fact hed stolen money and paul hadnt beaten him to a pulp paul wanted him healthy to help find her frank might be bait you dont love me she said this ends it doesnt it sweetheart i do but i need you to tell me where youre at frank said frank she began then stopped its not a good idea you protecting me or yourself both ill call you tomorrow evie he said and his voice broke slightly i love you whatever happens i love you like he expected to see her next in a coffin to set a rose in her cold folded hands she felt a distance begin to widen a gap between them that hurt her chest has anyone else been looking for me she asked what do you mean i she couldnt say it frank didnt know about the husband and sons shed walked away from at the least she never told him port leo seemed now like a story that had happened in another womans life never mind ill talk to you tomorrow goodbye he started to protest but she clicked off the phone she believed that with all his faults and vanities frank did love her but love didnt bind every heart as tightly she loved her children in a way more as little playmates than as treasured responsibilities but she had walked away from them love was a condition you could get over and maybe frank had recovered fear could make him leave she couldnt trust him and she couldnt put him in further danger she lay down on the bed her beretta was at her side probably by tomorrow richard doyle would be identified and the police would naturally scrutinize his dealings at the bank she and doyle had been very careful but if houston police department brought in the feds and doyle had left any traces in moving money that she didnt know about it was probably over hpd was a smart force very capable and of course so were the feds she might have to run from the mob and from the fbi she could try and cut a deal for the witness program but shed known of people who went into witsec and still got killed her cell phone rang again no caller id she clicked it on ms michaels a mans voice she didnt know low she said nothing silent treatment and you dont even know me yet who is this eve sat up on the bed my friends call me gooch i met a gentleman tonight named bucks who is very protective of you we had to beat him up to get your phone number i dont know you bucks seemed rather desperate to know why i wanted to find you i got the impression youd caused him to have a bad day what do you care i dont like this bucks guy at all hes got a black eye right now and he doesnt like me either gooch said hes a common enemy to you and me and why do you want to find me i can explain gooch said meet me tonight im not meeting anyone i dont know you know the pie shack restaurant over on kirby she did pie shack was an allnight eatery famous for delectable pies and bigplated breakfasts an eclectic favorite with the latenight bar crowd rice university students nightshift workers it was always crowded presumably safe if this was a trick and bucks was planning an ambush it was hardly a good choice go there to the rear booth we can talk tons of people around no need to be afraid because you sound kind of nervous and upset im not meeting anyone i dont know who calls me out of the blue james powell bozeman montana gooch said she let ten seconds of silence pass her tongue drying into sand i dont know that name and i dont intend to continue this discussion the police in montana would be interested in talking to you even after almost thirty years she finally gave a coarse laugh of disbelief if youre a blackmailer buddy youve picked the worst day possible you have something i want gooch said but its not money skip meeting with me and ill happily give every bit of information i have on you to the feds and to the police back in bozeman ill see you at pie shack in thirty minutes come alone no gun he hung up she was scared but she calmly checked the clip in her beretta and put it in her purse the leather of the bag was thin she could fire right through it she had closed the curtains but now she opened them slightly looking out across the coastal plain covered with strip centers and housing developments and chain restaurants that made this part of houston practically indistinguishable from any other major city she could burrow deeper down in the sprawl hiding in the anonymity of sameness rain starting turned the lights of suburbia into smears she sat back down on the bed james powell she had not thought of him in weeks you could not kill a person and wipe them from your mind but james powell did not haunt her every day james powell her sons the past rising up out of nowhere this phone call and the strange man today it could not be coincidence eve got up and dug her car keys out of her purse she headed out the door i have a surprise for you tasha was a little breathless after the sex the first night with paul him winedrunk had been nothing to savor but tonight nervous and seeking release he had been a smarter lover conscious of her pleasure taking an interest in it first with his fingers and mouth the good leisurely lovemaking done she smoothed out a raised lock of his brown hair it might make your night she whispered getting up from the bed baby my night was already made she went to her computer checked her email keyed a button papers peeled out from the printer she picked them up read them tossed them on his naked stomach whats this he said credit reports he picked up the pages she waited for him to speak he blinked at the data but it was clear his mind was fuzzed so she sat down next to him about your problem with eve she said i know a guy whos a black hat a what a hacker gets through computer systems he worked with me at houston primenet as a security consultant we both lost our jobs at the same time energis was our big client they went under we went under yeah he said so my friend ralph hes what you call socially maladjusted she ran a finger along pauls leg watched the flesh goosebump he started hacking because he couldnt find a job for the longest time he hid himself a trojan inside the visa and mastercard authentication systems a what a trojan paul still gave her a blank look its not a condom baby she said its hidden computer code that does what you want get you account information for example he uses it now and then to steal an account hes been asking me business advice ways we could make the most money off of this little private access he doesnt want to get caught before he can make serious profit tasha patted the papers i can solve your eve problem you could get me five million tasha took a very subtle calming breath and locked her smile in place no sweetpea he cant get you five million in cash but lets say eve planned to run and lets say she took the precaution of getting new credit cards under new names pauls eyes widened when a credit card is used for the first time it creates an initial entry in the account file so i asked him to find all firsttime credit charges in houston and galveston for today for planes trains rental cars hotels if shes hiding out and to key it to womens names or cards with the same initials as the name holy shit paul stood up and scanned the pages her names not here no and this only works if she hasnt used the card before but theres twelve women who bought plane tickets one named margaret scott to detroit that could be eve or if shes hiding in town she mightve rented a room three rented hotel rooms as initial charges as of eight tonight alice masters at the doubletree over on post oak deanna lopez at moody gardens down in galveston emily smith at the hilton out by addicks out on the edge of town my god baby you are amazing paul kissed her hard slow grateful and she felt him rise in her hands she tickled him with her fingertips therell be time for that later she said see how i can help you tasha what a team we could make he tongued her ear sweetpea she cupped his chin with her hands if i give you eve michaels what are you going to give me he smiled put her hands back on his erection thats a given she said im asking for a bonus okay he kissed her but i need to make a call get guys out to those hotels he started to scoot off the bed she gave him a little squeeze and he stopped one leg on the floor lets move beyond bonus to an actual cut she curled her feet up under her rear youre cute when youre smart he said im never not cute then she said how big of a cut a tease touched his voice one she liked he ought to shove her out of the way make those phone calls but he was giving her time to listen he was passing her test she slid her fingernail down his strong roman nose along his cheekbones as though she was mapping out a course call your guys first see if they can find her he hurried to the phone made the calls while she watched two guys each dispatched to each hotel when he was done he came to her gave her another kiss now you he said my cut should be about a half million he laughed looked blank laughed again dont we aim high im serious ten percent finders fee i got to pay ralph for his help and i want to quit stripping and get a new job what job eves she said let me be your money minder from now on she moved her fingertip along his mouth stuck the fingertip between his lips he flicked his tongue across the nail kissed the flesh his voice thickened as her finger roamed down across his stomach tickled at his navel think youre qualified he said okay he had flunked qualified tasha pointed at the papers i handed you eve and your five million you lose her this time she gets away maybe i dont ask ralph for his help again we can let her walk off if you arent interested in playing nice how about i give you and ralph fifty k its a lot for a few minutes work not if it saves your ass she got up from the bed knelt down searched under the bed for her panties im sorry i bothered tasha didnt hear him rise from the bed as she stood his fist closed in her hair and he yanked her head back bared her throat gave her flesh a little nip he eased her onto the mattress his grip still tight it didnt hurt much but a hot boil of anger rose in her chest youre not going were not done paul said let go please you dont threaten not to help me you got that tasha he pushed her face down into the sheets now what are you going to do help you the pressure on her head eased slightly and his voice softened besides that baby paul she said i can do a lot more for you than be good in bed clearly youre the smartest person i know right now tasha but i dont like it when you make me get rough with you he let go of her hair like his ill temper was her fault she crafted a careful smile made it rise on her face looked up at him with a mix of patience desire and calmness she reminded herself that right now she needed him that wouldnt always be the case and she filed this nasty minute of roughness away to remember to use later so i help you youre gonna help me right he kissed the top of her head you usually deliver the goods before collecting the reward but ill give you and ralph a hundred thou final offer okay she said she didnt believe him now he smiled kissed her lips she stayed still cool baby and youve given me an idea with ralph i want to know everything frank polos been charging on his accounts eve too and bucks bucks tasha hes my friend but that doesnt mean i trust him right now do you trust me she asked sure i do he said sure i do and thats why ive got a real special job for you to do he leaned down gave her a slow gentle kiss and this time she kissed back gooch slipped the hostess a tendollar bill and nabbed a large booth in the back of the pie shack whit sat across from him the place had the treasured atmosphere of an old neighborhood cafe mirrored walls neon art of thick slices of pie on plates coffee steaming up from a mug at every booth the huge window by the booth that faced out into the lot was smeared with rain thunder sounded far off a brief rumble now we wait gooch said whit glanced back at the doorway i shouldnt sit here by the window she could see me run i doubt shell know who you are after thirty years whit i dont know he fidgeted in the booth checked his watch shes late shes going to be at least fifteen minutes if shes survived this long working for a crime ring shes going to be cautious shell put us on the defensive shes not going to talk to me in a busy place the pie shack was full the two closest booths there were no tables were both occupied one by three gay guys rehashing their evening at a local club the other by a winehappy quartet of women laughing at themselves and digging through thick slabs of meringued pies attempting to sober up with pots of black coffee both groups seemed wholly captivated by their own conversations a riser of plants separated the booths from each other obscuring views and dulling sounds whit watched a lincoln navigator with tinted windows drive through the lot mist rising from its tires then a pickup truck then a lexus easy boy gooch said shell talk to you she has a nicesounding voice shes probably more nervous than i am she has reason to be sit at the counter and keep your back turned to the front door gooch said you wont scare her off that way when she walks in gooch cocked a finger at him its gonna be okay buddy thanks whit took a seat at the long curving counter turned his back to the front door he ordered a cup of decaf dosed it with milk and hunched his shoulders over the curl of steam on his right a woman in a securityguard uniform plowed through an omelette doused in chili and cheese she gave him a glance that showed she noticed his bruised face but said nothing on his left a young man with three earrings ate buttersoaked waffles and read sports illustrated whit stirred the milky swirl of his coffee no mirror was mounted above the bar to let him watch arrivals and departures but he heard the jingle of the door as it opened and closed and each time the little bell tinkled he tightened his grip on his coffee cup he tried not to care he glanced over at goochs booth he could barely see the top of goochs crewcutted head over the divider of fake ivy he had played out in his mind a thousand times what he would say to his mother why did you do it what did we do wrong how could you i hate you i forgive you the day she had left his four oldest brothers had gone with family friends to see a movie in corpus christi he and mark the littlest boys at two and three had played in the backyard worn themselves out playing chase while his mother sat and watched shed put them down for naps and while they slept she put her bags in her car placed signed divorce papers on the dinette and left port leo forever he imagined that before she walked out the door she kissed him goodbye cuddled him told him she was sorry she probably had done none of those things sweat tickled the undersides of his arms the backs of his legs the door jingled he waited watched the hostess leading a young couple to a front booth he relaxed a moment then he saw an older woman her back to him dressed in a rumpled suit and no raincoat heading right for goochs back booth i dont know you eve michaels slid into the booth she clutched her purse close to her right side my god she thought the guy was a bruiser built big and brokenmirror ugly hands as big as hubcaps im gooch he didnt rise from the booth wisely not making any move to scare her but he did offer one of the plussized hands she didnt shake it she had her hand on the beretta pointed at him inside the purse she flicked her gaze to her left the kitchen door was right there in case she had to shoot and run thats a very nice purse by the way gooch said thank you what are you aiming at me a magnum gooch asked the waitress approached took her order for coffee and lemon pie and left most women put their purse on the side that isnt by the aisle gooch said youve got it right next to you on the aisle and your hand went in it as soon as you sat down like i said mr gooch i dont know you the waitress returned with the coffee poured eve a steamkissed cup refreshed goochs mug walked away the booth of drunken women brayed loud and long at one of their own jokes coffee doesnt make you jittery right gooch said i dont want you jittery with a gun pointing at me he sounded unconcerned id prefer you put both hands on the table she didnt james powell we can talk about him later gooch said why does the mention of your name send bucks into a tantrum she decided he wasnt a cop or a fed this wasnt the place theyd pick not the words theyd use hes a thief and hes framed me what did he steal tell me who you are before i say another word gooch glanced up and past her shoulder im not from your friends paul bellini can lose every dime hes got and i wont care she tightened her grip on the gun youre not here about the money money no love gooch said i dont she began and then a young man with a face much like hers slid into the booth next to gooch hi ellen he said his voice was steady a little husky not cold but not exactly friendly she didnt move didnt speak still pointing the gun at him or me gooch asked really mrs mosley its time to let it go eve stared at the young man then slowly she put both hands on the table ten seconds passed and whit said are you trying to figure out which one i am youre whitman she said her voice was a low gravelly alto roughened she coughed once cleared her throat put a hand up to her mouth as if stifling a hiccup then back down again staring at him her mouth was open slightly a little wet youre whitman im impressed whit said ill sit up at the counter gooch said let yall talk whit rose gooch scooted out whit sat back down and the whole time she never took her eyes from whit whit folded his hands on the table youve got a nasty bruise on your face her voice was flat not motherly got one and gave one back to your buddy bucks good for you she swallowed outside the rain pelted down harder a cloudburst flowering water puddling by the curbs a laughing trio of rice students running and screaming through the rain toward their car i figured whit said that when you saw me you were either going to run in shame tell me you never want to see me or my brothers again or say youre sorry she rubbed at her temples im sorry you didnt even deny who you are i guess that was the other option she sipped at her coffee set the mug down carefully her hand shook she covered it with her other hand denial would be pointless youve found me congratulations the waitress stopped across from their table grabbing a fresh pot from the coffee stand filled a carafe set it on their table dont you want to know how or why whit asked he kept his voice quiet not right now whitman im trying to collect my thoughts catch my breath she tried to smile i go by whit whit sure your father was never that crazy about the name whitman even though it was from his family he grew to like it may i touch your hand she asked unexpectedly he hesitated he had not imagined physical contact but shock and rejection and angry words hitting like missiles why i would just like to touch you heat surged in the back of his eyes in his throat in his stomach okay she put her hand on top of his not holding touching her hands were worn but her nails were freshly manicured painted a mild red and a goodsized diamond glittered on her left hand are you glad i found you he asked i have mixed emotions about it but not because of you he didnt understand her comment so he let it pass his longconsidered game plan of what to say evaporating in the heat of the moments reality i always figured this would happen on oprah unexpected reunions were more jerry springer she said and it made him laugh for a moment her lemon pie arrived the waitress set it down by their joined hands whit said he didnt need anything thank you as she took out her order pad she left them alone how is your father eve asked your brothers wow a sudden bout of caring he knew the words sounded ugly but he couldnt help himself what else am i supposed to ask you whit she said your opinion on the middle east your favorite tv show whether you prefer wine or beer im not much for drinking whit said daddy drank himself sick for years after you left is he still drinking no but hes dying cancer he has four months max thats why i wanted to find you she digested this news in silence you sent a man looking for me yes a private investigator she released a long wobbly breath she put her other hand over her eyes but now she took his hand squeezed his fingers fortyish dark hair a little rumpled looked like a schoolteacher yes you saw him yes now she looked at him i saw him once she reached for her coffee drank it down when he said nothing more she said im truly sorry about your father and to see you im happy to see you more than you could ever know baby but this is a bad time theres no good time is there in your line of work whit her voice shook what do you know about me you work for tommy bellini im in trouble i may need to leave town very quickly youre not going to do that he clutched her hand youre coming back with me to port leo see my father apologize to him before he dies see my brothers theyre all well happy i cant i cant you have grandchildren whit said beautiful grandchildren four of them teddy has three girls joe has a little boy her lips thinned her eyes filled i cant please dont ask this of me you can please suddenly a truth pierced his heart a certainty he hadnt known before theyll forgive you in time if you get to know them let them know you i would put your family in danger whit people want me dead all the more reason to come with me then you have no idea of the trouble

enough theyd find me kill me she withdrew her hand go have a good life whit tell your brothers im glad theyre happy im sorry for babe i truly am she put her purse in her lap glanced out the window the showers had lessened in the last minute the storm taking a breath and a lincoln navigator eased past the restaurant slowing for a car about to pull out from a parking slot you changed soaps whit said you dont smell of gardenia any more she froze what thats really my best memory of you gardenia your neck always smelled of it she wiped tears from her eyes her mouth trembled i need more from you than the smell of soap i really dont want you to leave whit said if i ask gooch hell toss you over his shoulder throw you in his van and drive you all the way to port leo ellen eve no one calls me ellen eve he said as though tasting the word look at me i want to know exactly whats happening exactly otherwise im going to go to the police and the window exploded whit hit the floor in front of the booth airborne chunks of pie and a gush of hot coffee flying around him shards of glass bursting in from the barrage of gunfire his mother screamed she was cut or shot trying to get down into the well of the booth blood streaking her face whit grabbed her shoulders and dragged her below the window line into the mess of gunshot pie and pooling coffee and water the gunfire stopped screams wailed around them ranging from fullout shrieks to hiccuping moans of terror the party girls were facedown on the floor or huddled in the leather womb of their booth the window by them cracked and webbed the waitress lay sprawled by whit a shattered plate still in her hand eyes open and still gray hair dislodged from a bun her throat a wet wound back door eve said run he clutched her head to him searching for the wound youre shot no oh no she said her eyes went wide then people started running a mad stampede out of the restaurant toward the front doors whit pulled eve toward the swinging doors of the kitchen and his mind registered gooch his gun drawn from a back holster under his jacket jumping from booth top to booth top heading for them and a man swarthy rushing the window jabbing the remaining cracked glass out of his way swinging the eye of a semiautomatic toward him and eve the gunman paused to smile a smile that said youre so fucked and the gesture cost him because the next bullet fired came from goochs sig sauer and the gunman fell back back door eve said again crawling past the dead waitress pushing whit along he grabbed her rammed through the swinging doors as the gunman either hit or not blasted off another round whit eve and gooch landed on the cool tile of the kitchen the cooks and bakers mostly gone one girl babbling into a wall phone whit got eve to her feet followed two terrified dishwashers barreling toward a fire exit as he reached the door the dense staccato thrum of gunfire hit pots and pans and countertops a hard gong sounded a bullet striking the exit door north of his head gooch returned fire and whit shoved eve out the door the kitchen staff scrambled through the parking lot running yelling in spanish goochs van was parked near the rear of the lot and whit steered eve toward it he glanced back gooch had taken cover near a dumpster gun leveled at the back door waiting more shooting inside whit pushed eve through a line of cars putting vehicles between them and the door gooch he screamed get out come on the gunman came out the door holding the young woman whod been on the wall phone as a human shield gooch didnt lower his gun the cops will be here in thirty seconds gooch called let her go we want eve eve and whit ducked down by a red pickup truck her hand tightened on his you hit eve man gooch called and shes bleeding bad from his vantage point the gunman couldnt see if eve was with him or not in the distance police sirens began to shriek in their approach then a lincoln navigator wheeled around the restaurant the gunman shoved the young woman to the pavement and dashed toward the car he made it three steps and gooch gave him a bullet for each he skittered a little dance collapsing before the open door of the navigator the suv sped onto kirby door still open rumbled into a shopping center parking lot and hardturned onto a side street the girl ran back into the restaurant and gooch sprinted from the dumpster toward them go he yelled now the guy hes dead whit we got to get out of here we cant leave whit started this is a crime scene that waitress is dead we have to but whit almost said im a judge i cant do this but if his mother heard that shed take off running herself you want the cops to take in your mom because they will when they find out her connection to this gooch said find her lose her all in short order whit pulled eve into the back of the van with him and gooch powered up the engine tore out the back of the parking lot onto a feeder street that ran parallel to kirby vanishing with a right into a residential neighborhood and was two blocks away by the time the police cars and ambulances tore into the lot red and blue lights making the broken windows glitter like diamonds hospital whit ordered gooch now no eve said im not hurt whit im okay no hospital gooch said at least for now they headed back to charlie fulghams house ten minutes away from the restaurant back down lower kirby cutting through the quiet of the big old houses of west university place taking a winding route along treeshaded roads with names like tulane and rutgers and loyola gooch drove at the speed limit and came to a complete stop at every sign west university place police were notorious for ticketing for the smallest traffic infraction eve lay on her back in the van whit pulled off his blue shirt mopped her head free of blood the wound in her scalp wasnt too big probably from flying glass but had bled with the flooding tendency of head wounds they hurried her inside gooch parking the van at the rear of charlie fulghams driveway out of sight of the street charlie sat in his kitchen drinking a beer and flipping through a copy of texas bar journal marking stories with a red pen when they staggered in what the hell happened charlie stared at eve and whits bloodied shirt firstaid kit gooch asked yeah here charlie rummaged in the back of the kitchen pantry pulled out a little plastic case that seemed wholly inadequate to stitch up the carnage of the past fifteen minutes you want me to call no gooch said well tend to her this is my mother whit said weird the words of introduction coming from his mouth never spoken before eve this is charlie fulgham our host hi eve said uh hi charlie said eve gave him a weak smile her shoulders still shaking now in clear light whit saw she had a score of small cuts and abrasions on her hands her arms his hands too and a sharp sting lashed his forehead they didnt follow us gooch said to whit the guys or the cops gooch charlie said lets talk you and me in the living room as in right now sure gooch said calm like he hadnt shot another person to death a few minutes before whit swabbed at eves wound with a wet washcloth took scissors from the kit and clipped away the graying hair close to her cut the wound was not bad but it needed closing he sprayed disinfectant on it and she winced he cleaned and taped the wound shut covering it with a strip of gauze you need a stitch or two he shook two ibuprofen painkillers into her open palm we could make up a story take you to an emergency room you should see a doctor no she said paul will have those watched closely now he cant watch every hospital in houston sure he can eve said gooch returned to the kitchen without charlie still holding his gun he tracked you two to the pie shack or he tracked you gooch said not hardly she said nicky and his driver wouldnt have let me reach you if they were tailing me they would have taken me at first sight im surprised they didnt grab me in the lot i mustve come in on the other side of them circling around the diner bucks mustve ordered us followed whit said no gooch said i would have spotted the tail there was a silence in the room except for the distant sound of a television sparking to life in the living room or not eve said are you infallible practically he said in a cool voice practically isnt going to be good enough paul and bucks can hire as much muscle as they want to get me they simply have to offer a cut of the five million and ive got an instant megabounty on my head she shook her head at gooch i hope you have an army to back you up gooch paul will hunt you down like a dog for killing nicky youre welcome gooch said i hope i get to save your sorry ass again tomorrow stop whit sat down closed his eyes is charlie upset he asked gooch no i gave him three dollars retainer all three of us are his clients as of this moment commit all the crimes you want clients eve asked hes a top defense lawyer eve gooch said she stood no nobody else knows anything about me all right i dont want a lawyer sit down please whit said and after a moment she did gooch what did you tell him that there are bad guys after eve but for him not to worry hes cool gooch said hes going to kick us out i said hes cool come here a second whit whit followed gooch into charlies den in the corner was a gun vault with an array of rifles pistols and knives several weapons were shining with fresh polish others looked antique and unusable charlie glanced at whit and gooch he had been looking out the back window not watching the tv good god whit said the people i used to defend were scum charlie said this was my security blanket if they got mad at me charlie im sorry we dont want to drag you into trouble whit said whatever gooch needs charlie said gooch gets i once did a big favor for charlie private business gooch said whit started to ask and charlie shook his head go to your mother whit well talk when youre done gooch followed whit back to the kitchen whit wadded up his bloodied shirt eve watched him sorry about your shirt she said its okay now she stood came to his chair knelt by him your eye it needs ice and youre cut gooch with a slight smile aimed his gun at eve she didnt move didnt blink very touching florence nightingale gooch whit said stop tell all eve gooch said how will they come after us why are they shooting at you if youre so high and mighty in the organization whats this about five million you owe them gooch put that down whit said honey you dont scare me eve said if you were going to shoot me you could have shot me back at the diner she closed her hands around whits knees listen closely gooch said im not your son im not emotionally shredded about you the way whit is psychoanalysis from you thats like a surgical lecture from jack the ripper whit said you are way out of line leonard sit your ass down over there and take that gun off her whit gooch said softly you dont see what i see i see you putting down that gun and sitting your butt down now gooch lowered the gun eve watched him i like you gooch you dont mess around do you no i dont id like a glass of water whit eve said its a long story story then drink gooch said she bled gooch shes thirsty whit went to the counter filled a glass with ice and water set it down in front of her you forgot the lemon slice gooch said and the lace doily turn it down please whit said thinking you killed a man gooch and you dont seem remotely bothered by it the depth to which he still did not know or understand his best friend gave him a tremble along his ribs i see weve already picked teams gooch said youre not helping whit said helping who saved your ass tonight and who put it in danger do i need to draw flash cards for you thank you whit said thank you gooch eve said not so much for me for whit sell it to hallmark gooch said ill answer your questions eve said since youve asked so nicely and because you can take whit and get out of this mess right now she took a long sip of cold water she told the story in its entirety from pauls determination to cut a big deal to keep his throne and make the bellinis more powerful her assignment to get five million in clean cash to pay off kiko franks skimming and pauls warning to her the strangers unexpected arrival at the exchange site eve fleeing then returning and finding the men dead and the five million in cash gone and bucks subsequent chase of her he was your pi wasnt he honey im so sorry so so sorry at the mention of harrys death whit put his face in his hands the kitchen was quiet from the den came the hushed voices of the tv charlie flipping through the local stations to see if there were any reports about the pie shack shooting lazy rain pittered against the darkened windows i shouldnt have had harry try to contact you whit said holy god what have i done he thought of claudia back in port leo her friend now dead trying to imagine a way to tell her wanting to tell her before anyone else did but not knowing how he would explain it this isnt your fault whit eve said it was the wrong place at the wrong time harry must have followed me there she reached out touched his leg gooch made a snorting sound whit put his hands down you say bucks killed harry and doyle and has the money whit said yes eve said bucks either wants it for himself or wants paul to fail so he can take over so what happens to the deal now whit said it doesnt happen eve said without that money whit refilled his mothers glass with ice cubes and water set it down in front of her before we were attacked you told me you wouldnt go to the police now innocent people are dead we have to call the police or have charlie call them nicky killed the waitress gooch killed nicky isnt that justice eve said of course gooch here might not want to deal with courts her voice almost sounded hopeful not a worry whit said it was selfdefense not how the court of paul bellini will view it she said you kill one of his guys you die theres no plea bargaining so i kill paul bellini if i have to gooch said you dont kill anyone else gooch whit said and eve you and me go to the police and you tell them everything you know they get you into the witness protection program she laughed no no no thats worthless im not getting a new name a bad hairdo and a nice splitlevel in boise to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder i testify im dead they find you what makes you think you have a choice whit said ah so this is the revenge on me for being a bad mother she shrugged you can call the police whit but you do and im not saying another word your testimony about the money is hearsay harry chyme was a man i liked whit said i liked him more than i like you and he died because i wanted to find you its not my fault but its your problem eve dont threaten me with what you will and wont do im telling you what youll do theres my boy gooch said you gonna tell the cops gooch killed a guy and fled the scene stops sounding like selfdefense then she said still a bigger risk for you sweetheart gooch said why save me then put the screws to me eve turned to whit i dont understand im not letting bucks get away with harrys murder you may be more casual in your attitude and he thought again of the man she had possibly left port leo for those long years ago the dead man in montana the socalled suicide he tried to imagine her killing a man sitting hunched in her rumpled wet suit with a bandage awkwardly taped to her head her makeup smeared by the rain and him having wiped up her blood you wanted to meet me right thats the reason you came looking for me or was it to bully me blackmail me i dont understand she glanced at gooch gooch mentioned james powell when he called me said you would put the montana police on me yeah it was my idea whit said she looked at him with disappointment oh whit i didnt kill james powell eve said he killed himself and you got custody of the money gooch said what money she asked i dont give a rats ass about james powell whit said i wanted to find you so i could bring you back to port leo to see my father before he dies im not trying to screw you over she crossed her arms fine ill go you and babe and the rest of the boys can tell me to my face what a sorry mother i was and ill take it without blinking but i only go on my own terms dont negotiate with her whit gooch said lets hear these terms whit said i have to get my name cleared with paul he has to know i didnt take the money that means either proving bucks took it or finding the money and returning it to paul otherwise im dead and im not spending the rest of my life on the run whit because youre a homebody now gooch said leave us alone for a moment gooch please whit said gooch without a word got up and left i need a friend like him eve said hes your personal pit bull youre lucky so you want our help she wiped the traces of lipstick away from her mouth i dont want you in danger whit but i have nowhere to turn frank is not going to stick out his neck to help me bucks has framed me beautifully and no one believes me i cant do this on my own fine then we call the police he had to try it again in which case i say nothing i dont go back to port leo with you and gooch takes his chances with the harris county legal system she shrugged and opened the firstaid kit let me tend your cuts he let her his back stiffening at her touch as she dabbed ointment on his skin you didnt cry much when you got skinned as a kid not like mark she said he screamed like a cut banshee dont go down memory lane with me you dont have a ticket look im not going to be june cleaver she got up filled a baggie with ice wrapped a towel around it she handed him the ice pack sat back down across from him so how do we help you eve whit asked your friend seems more than competent under fire his brain got baked by the sun a long time ago he doesnt know any better he was smart tonight she said what do you do whit he hesitated at first thinking she was asking him what choice he was going to make but realizing she was asking what his job was if she knew he was a judge shed run vanish again he was an officer of the court what he was contemplating what he had done would result in his immediate dismissal from office if it were known he loved his job but sitting across from his mother he thought its a job nothing more i dont want to talk about me if you help me find the money and clear my name she said ill go to port leo with you we should go to port leo now ive given you the deal whit help me or let me go she paused and when he gave no answer she stood fine go ahead let them kill me now you sound like a mother i know i was nothing as a mother i know her voice grew hoarse actually my dad said you were a good one before you took off i wouldnt remember she studied the warm wood of the kitchen table were you bored decided kids were no fun he kept his voice calm what was so wrong with us you thought it was your fault she passed her hand over her eyes she went to the sink ran fresh water in her glass oh god she said her back still to him im sorry there was absolutely nothing wrong with you whit or your brothers or even your father nothing its me im the one thats bent im the one thats broken you broke everyone else by leaving she drank her water watched him over her shoulder you seem welladjusted im tough but you came looking for me you got a hole im supposed to fill so you do have a nerve to hit whit said now youre sounding downright bitchy baby i am downright bitchy that probably served you well in your new life he shook his head the mob you traded your kids in for the mob i hope you never have to make a really terrible decision whit most people dont they amble through life and they whine about moments of inconsequence she finished her water i hope you get to amble dont ask for pity you made your choice i doubt youve had years of sleepless nights worrying over us i dont expect you to understand eve said and im not going to explain to you theyre going to kill me in the worst possible way to make me tell them where the money is she steadied her voice ive never been more scared in my life except on the day when i left you you were scared very much so you think it was easy it wasnt she stopped im not going to try and explain it you couldnt then i wont waste my breath eve went to the back door opened it the brisk wet night lay outside black under the arches of the live oaks rain dripped from the branches you wont see me again thank you and thank gooch for saving my ass tonight i appreciate you delaying the inevitable bye whit he got up slammed the door shut he didnt want her to go found and lost all in the matter of an hour her face was still blank waiting do you have a plan he asked on how to get the money i have a couple of ideas on how to nail bucks prove hes betrayed paul get evidence that paul will believe but i cant do it alone heres the deal mom he let the little odd word settle between them we nail bucks for harrys murder then you come with me to port leo to see my father and my brothers and if you trick me or run out on me again ill give you to the feds myself in two fricking seconds and you can fry in hell for all i care deal she said friday morning in port leo was gorgeous the air clear and the sky the color of pearl when the light filtered in through her window and awoke her it didnt bother claudia salazar that she had gotten barely five hours of sleep last night the port leo police department working with the sheriffs departments in encina and aransas counties had busted a burglary and fencing ring arrests and interviews had kept claudia up until am but the sun even in winter beckoned claudia went for a leisurely run on the smooth flat of beach along st leo bay the sand wet beneath her sneakers the fishing boats already sailed the horizon out past the thin barrier islands that guarded the texas coast the morning air was februarycool but she pulled off the windbreaker shed worn down to the beach tied it around her waist turned around and ran back the length of the beach and the park letting the warmth sift through her body her sweat was light and she felt good she walked back to her small apartment stopping for a bottle of grapefruit juice and an eggandpotato breakfast taco at a small convenience store up from the harbor she sipped at the juice and ate her taco as she headed past port leos shopping and arts district and the courthouse square watching the tourist birders heading out with the cameras and binoculars from the bedandbreakfasts near the square eager to spot the coasts famed precious whooping cranes at home she stood under the showers hot spray then turned the water icy cold for a deliciously long minute then hot again when she got out and toweled off she went into her bedroom to dress the message light on her answering machine was blinking and she frowned hoping it wasnt work calling since shed put in well over sixty hours this week she listened to the message ms salazar this is barbara zachary at chyme investigations please call me as soon as you get this message please the voice was shaky claudia dressed in jeans and a tshirt and dialed the phone she knew barbara zachary slightly a single mother who did occasional support work for harry if there was a break in whits case she couldnt imagine why harry would call her with that news first instead of whit chyme investigations barbara zachary please this is she the womans voice sounded wooden hi this is claudia salazar you had left a message for me yes then silence harry is dead claudias nice warm muscles turned to jelly she sat on the edge of her unmade bed her breath seemed frozen in her chest oh my god he was shot in houston down near the port yesterday afternoon it took them a while to id him he didnt have any id on him but his rental car was parked nearby the license plates were taken off that slowed them down until they traced the vin number barbaras voice broke again i cannot believe harry is gone my god i know he had a case in houston he was working barbara said for whitman mosley and harry told me you were the referral the barest hint of accusation tinged her voice as though claudia bore a terrible share of responsibility theres no answer at judge mosleys house can you contact him for me the houston police will want to talk to him i hunt him down right now whos the investigating officer in houston claudia grabbed for a pad his name is arturo gomez now barbara broke into sobs im sorry this is difficult he was so sweet to me im so sorry id worked for him from the beginning barbara said he never took any dangerous cases i want you to tell me claudia said everything you know they found harry in an insurance office near the port of houston with some man i dont know his name i dont know anything about him five minutes later claudia was at the door of the guest house where whit lived behind the main mosley house no answer at the door but whits ford explorer sat in the driveway she hurried back up to the main house rapped on the door rang the doorbell irina mosley answered the door in a cotton robe hair looking disheveled like shed had a long night she was a beautiful woman but the sudden weight of babes illness had thinned her already waifish face claudia didnt particularly like irina thought of her as the trophy wife whod seen a rich old man as a passport out of russian poverty but the thought that her husband was dying softened claudias heart claudia hello irina said she always spoke so quietly as though an eavesdropper lurked nearby she looked exhausted dark blotches under her eyes im sorry to disturb you so early wheres whit off to houston her voice hardened why some man barbara had said they found harry with some man claudias skin prickled beneath her windbreaker oh jesus whit he didnt tell me irina said he left right after court yesterday did he fly his cars still here no irina said he went with that gooch person she frowned in distaste claudia thanked irina she went back to her car tried whit on her cell phone no answer on his please not whit too she drove home and called barbara zachary apparently whits in houston oh my god what if judge mosleys the man with harry im sure whits okay claudia said she thanked barbara gave her sympathies again and hung up then she called whits cell phone again got his bright drawl on his voice mail asking her to leave a message she did asking him to call her hung up and lay back down on the bed a sick twist in her heart her back her throat she called her police chief said she was going to houston for the weekend he wasnt happy but she was quietly insistent and told him that a friend had been murdered she did not say that possibly two friends had been murdered then she left a message for arturo gomez at hpd headquarters explaining that she had information on the harry chyme case and asking him to call her as soon as possible then she packed her gun her permit two extra clips her badge although of course she had no jurisdiction in houston but she felt she needed it and her clothes called her mother to tell her she was going out of town for a couple of days and headed for her honda whit is okay she told herself he is okay repeat as needed claudia drove fast a steady twenty miles above the speed limit dont bother talking to the hit men bucks said let me best that you dont know whos doing what in case the police ask questions wrong paul said thats been part of the problem he stood at the window watching the sun start its slow peek above the oaks early morning haze lay on the grounds of the bellini estate off lazy lane and paul had awoken bucks with a am phone call demanding he get to the family house bucks had been sleeping on franks sofa in the faint hope eve would return to the house not likely but he couldnt take the risk of not putting forth a clear and visible effort chad channing says its really important to delegate and you do that beautifully bucks said delegate your ass paul said dont lecture me this morning im not in the mood the money being lost is a matter of trust not delegation bucks said you trusted the wrong woman i dont trust anyone bucks except my mom bucks nervous no coffee yet lit a cigarette blew smoke away from the comatose figure of tommy bellini dont smoke in here around my dad for gods sakes he doesnt have a lung problem bucks said but he inched open a window and thumbed the cig out into the garden if the trellis catches fire im kicking your ass paul has it occurred to you im pretty much all youve got right now bucks said if you and i dont stick together were sunk franks useless eves gone kikos gonna go nuclear if we cant deliver the money youve got nicky dead after the moron shoots up a diner im the one whos standing by you man and you treat me like im a leper he narrowed his eyes gratitude lightens the heart did chad channing say that too no sister mary clarence that was whoopi goldberg in those nun movies and my algebra teacher back in school bucks shut the window fine you want to talk with the hit guys thats fine they get caught they sing they finger you instead of me its really no skin off my back all i want is this thieving bitch caught and punished for the hell shes put us through bucks forced himself not to glance over his shoulder at paul to watch for a nervous tic of reaction he knew it was pauls hot button paul would either trust him or not the silence stretched to ten seconds and bucks thought ive played the wrong card but then paul said fine you handle it but im picking who you work with mackay the wart jerry smacks you got it and i expect detailed progress reports from each of them i want to know exactly whats going down at all times he jabbed a finger toward bucks face dont mess up yes paul bucks said now he could capture eve entirely on his own terms he kept his smile inside it was important chad channing stressed to keep certain victories private the tacqueria on mandell not far from the heart of the artsy montrose district was a faded jewel the door flaked oncebright paint like shredded lettuce the young cook who had taken over for the gifted old woman who had run the kitchen for four decades inevitably scorched the beans and served runny eggs therefore the restaurant was empty in the early haze of saturday morning when bucks slid into the back booth the waitress brought him coffee and he drank half of it down in a long steady gulp if the new owner had half a brain shed torch the place for the insurance hed suggest that to her burn the building with the beans take a cut say eighty percent the place looked starved for goals and resolve bucks had summoned three of them and they arrived within five minutes of each other for an odd reason he thought of the magi the wise men in loud garb mackay was a tall dark fellow a jamaican with dreadlocks that had once hung to his waist but had now been trimmed to a more modest shoulder length an ugly scar bisected his upper lip and he wore a plain white shirt untucked loose green pants and sneakers he smelled like sandalwood too much scent in the close air of the tacqueria hey mackay slid into the booth who else you taking bids from wart and jerry aw man wart is a sick one mackay said he lowered his voice to a whisper he killed a family you know that a family man there are limits he gave the last two syllables the emphasis of disgust not if he got paid jerry cant shoot his pee in the bowl mackay said how bout you give me the deal and we close it right now save you from dealing with an ass like the wart im opening it to all three of you competition is good for the soul bucks said mackay lit a cigarette man do you keep plaques in your jacket so you always got advice to offer yes and theyre bulletproof mackay laughed bucks i set you up with bob marley ziggy miles davis instead of that selfimprovement tripe too much prepackaged advice itll soften your head he looked at bucks face man order yourself a raw steak for that eye i fell and hit a stair railing no one was believing that lie bucks fought the urge to put a bullet through mackays skull and instead sipped at his bad coffee the other two men arrived at the same time darrell branson called the wart was fortyish balding with the carefully cultivated look of a cpa he wore a summer suit five years out of fashion no tie the third man was called jerry smacks and bucks hated the habit of marathon gum chewing that had earned jerry his nickname he was thirtyish always sunburned because whatever money he made got spent down in cancun he rearmed his mouth with a fresh stick of spearmint as he sat down folding the foil into a perfect square and tucking it into his shirt pocket the waitress brought them coffee and then bucks said maria why dont you and the cook go for a walk get yourself doughnuts down at the eleven he slid her a twenty the woman vanished into the kitchen and after a moment she and the cook left turning the open sign to read closed shutting the morning cool out behind them all without a word or a change in their poker faces gentlemen bucks said the deal is simple were looking for a woman named eve michaels shes stolen cash a large amount she stole it practically right under my nose so the pressures on me to get it back fast he cleared his throat fixed each man in turn with the kind of forceful gaze corporate vps blasted at hopeless underlings they waited blankfaced unimpressed ive got to have the cash back i believe shell keep it on her or close at hand she has two men who are working with her one of them is a killer hes ugly as a baboon about sixsix big broadshouldered goes by the name leonard he killed one of our men the other is smaller around sixfoot normal build hair blondish and a little long looks like a surfer type his name may be michael or whitman mosley or he may be using a credit card in that name him i want hurt badly man id pick a cooler alias said mackay whitman sounds like a school principal the wart said they local he had a voice as soft as justwashed baby clothes little more than a whisper eve we know bucks pushed a picture of her hed taken from franks house to each of them the men weve never seen them before he pushed pictures of gooch and whit slightly grainy images recorded on a club topaz security camera when they had paid at the door and entered you said the deal was a single hit jerry smacks said now youre talking threeforone this aint coupon day kiddo i sure dont mind a multiple job the wart said and dosed his coffee with milk assuming multiple job multiple paycheck getting eve is priority one i want her dead the other two guys box em if you want ill pay a bonus of ten biggies for each of them mosley hurt as much as you want before youre done the three mulled this mackay finished his cigarette lit another sipped at his coffee gave bucks an odd little smile you got any idea where they at the wart asked we believe eve is using a credit card under the name emily smith she used it last night at a hilton at the addicks exit on i but she abandoned the room she matches the description of the woman who checked in try there she doesnt know were wise to her and if she returns to the hotel you get an easy mark she uses the card again all three of you get the call on where shes at her shelters got to be coming from these two guys we got her cell phone number were gonna offer them a meeting time tomorrow trap them maybe offer eves boyfriend to them alive for a share of the money if you havent boxed them by then youre invited to the meeting to wrap em up and you can split the pot or you can bow out what if they leave houston the wart asked the deals still open bucks said you find them outside the city wherever well cover expenses and increase the bonus to twenty apples they all knew whatever noun he used was meaningless apples biggies shirts cars it all meant dollars in the thousands how many apples eve steal from the garden mackay asked laughing thats not a concern you find the apples well share a good bite with you but it would be a mistake to take any apples for yourself a big mistake gentlemen im a professional the wart said im not a thief and i resent the implication jerry smacks and mackay said nothing apparently being free of resentment what if we find her and there aint no apples jerry smacks asked he shifted his wad to the other side of his mouth dont be stupid bucks said theres no question about her having the money he swallowed past the sudden thickness in his throat mackay raised an eyebrow jerry smacked his gum the wart studied his knuckles you sure eve dead is what your boss wants mackay asked im sure bucks said i got your numbers well call as soon as we get a lead on her if you hear of three people who recently bought new id papers flashing around big cash or putting a crosshit out on paul or me you call us they nodded except for mackay who watched bucks with a new amusement questions they had none good bucks said and ill hope youll work as a team together we can get this project done and done quickly be winwin for everybody the wart took his three pictures of eve gooch and whit scrutinized them then folded the prints into a square and ate them like he was in an old spy movie jerry smacks pushed the picante bowl toward him you want salsa with that the two witnesses who saw us all the wart said around the paper in his mouth who the wart jerked his head toward the front door waitress and cook wart bucks said they think im a bookie harmless the wart looked unconvinced do you kill everyone you pass on the street wart in case they actually looked at you mackay asked its a business precaution the wart said no that would attract more attention bucks thought of the wart not as a psycho for hire but as a single step toward a goal the wart gave bucks a flat look as he got out of the booth with jerry stay a second bucks said to mackay who was getting to his feet im going to jamaica on vacation when all this is done and i want restaurant recommendations mackay sat back down in the booth the wart and jerry smacks gave each other a glance but left i really see you exploring island cuisine bucks mackay said i know youre better and sharper than those guys bucks said and i need your help wow smarter than a dumbass and a sociopath you make me feel extra special but im afraid to ask the question on my mind mackay said what that this lady didnt steal the money but that you want her blamed and killed for it jesus what put that in your head bucks said i want this bitch dead for what shes done to me you seem a shade more interested in her being dead mackay said but with a smile than in getting the money back the weight of an unspoken accusation hung in the quiet air bucks considered his options then put on his best negotiators smile mackay think what you want but i got an extra job for you worth a lot of money as long as it stays private between you and me whit awoke on the floor of the guest bedroom hed crashed on a sleeping bag a blanket over him he had thought at first he wouldnt sleep at all but the exhaustion zapped him hard until he awoke with a start looked up to see eve watching him from the bed her arms wrapped around a pillow she was sleeping in an oversized tshirt of charlies that announced lawyers have better briefs and a pair of plaid pajama bottoms dug from the bottom of a bureau i havent watched you sleep in a very long time she said traces of your face theyre the same as when you were a baby its weird when did you ever watch me sleep with five other kids vying for your attention he rubbed his face his whole body hurt his eye his jaw his arms his back i always watched you whit you were always special to me he wished he could believe it but he didnt he couldnt did you sleep okay enough to function she handed him a shopping list we need the stuff on here for our project and i need clothes now youll make me feel like a son he said running your errands he put his head back down on the pillow a step at a time im not cooking you breakfast gooch is already up and i can smell bacon she rose from the bed and he saw she was small a little bent and there didnt seem to be enough of her for her absence to have left such a hole in his life eve prodded him with her foot leaned down and kissed the top of his head before he could protest or stop her get up honey weve got a real busy day after a moment he did friday midmorning meant the maintenance crews hit the manicured turfs of river oaks and frank polo fuzzy from wine and painkillers pulled a pillow over his head to ward off the invading buzz of lawn equipment he was vaguely aware of his hand throbbing a belch of cheap pinot grigio souring his mouth the absence of eve from the bed then he remembered everything morning light slanted through the windows frank heard a soft voice from the den regular even quiet he padded downstairs scratching his balls under his boxers and his halfopen robe stumbled through the living room and flicked on the kitchen lights the room was spotless eve liked a clean house her devotion to tidiness and detail was part of the calm precision that attracted him to her nothing like him all disarray and clothes jumbled on the floor he noticed before he clicked on the lights that the coffee machine was already on a pot full a setback is an opportunity the soft voice said a setback is a time to reevaluate our goals our aims and our methods in actualizing our achievements the tape player was at bucks elbow and bucks sat at the kitchen table a cup of coffee in his hands sleeping beauty bucks said good morning i had an unpleasant night he turned off the tape more of that selfhelp oatmeal he swallowed day and night i bet youre gonna have a shitty day too frank poured coffee into his mug so howd you sleep the situation has changed frank changed nicky lott and terry verdine followed two smartasses who came by the club last night looking for eve they tailed the guys to the pie shack on kirby eve shows up she met with both of the guys then one nicky being a fucking idiot decided the fastest way to nail eve and make paul happy was to blaze guns he opened fire on eve and the guy through the restaurant window jesus christ frank felt his heart drop to his feet the guys fired back they got away with eve killed nicky shootouts all over the news bucks ran his hand through his hair the cops will id nicky fast he has a tiny possession record but nothing but hearsay to tie him to paul a woman got killed people got hurt this was exactly what we dont need my god i got max watching the pie shack her car is still parked there the police are all over the lot and theyll be running a license check on every car theyll ask questions so your penance starts right now frank i want you to go pick up eves car okay frank sat how do i explain leaving it behind tell em you were at the shooting panicked walked home now youre coming back to get it thats a bit of a walk frank said frank bucks remembered chad charmings thinklt livelt rule patience never wears thin its always in style you got the keys that fit the car theyre not gonna question you tell them you heard shots didnt see anything ran tell them you were meeting a secret girlfriend there and you didnt want your regular woman to know about it i dont care go get the car back and try not to steal it frank ignored the jab fine have you talked to her bucks asked truth please i tried to call her again i couldnt reach her frank set down his coffee inspected the bandage on his hand who are these new friends of hers frank she had partners in stealing this money i have no idea get one if she was planning this and cutting me out shes not gonna use people i can point to in five seconds frank said does mba stand for moron boy association bucks bucks threw the coffee from his cup into franks face a cry caught and died in franks throat the coffee was cool milky sweet not hot he blinked at bucks who smiled and went to the counter and refilled his cup steam rose around his fingers chad channing says you should contemplate before you speak very sound advice frank now contemplate harder eve has partners who could they be frank went to the sink wet a paper towel mopped his face anyone who wants to take us down the other drug rings in town jamaicans east coasters a few people connected to the new orleans cartels or even our buddy kiko bucks mouth twitched does the name whitman mosley mean anything to you frank frowned whitman mosley no sounds like an ad agency or a law firm you ever hear eve mention guys named michael or leonard no frank gave bucks a crooked smile if its another crime ring thats working with eve and theyve stolen pauls investment youre cooked you dont have the men the resources to fight i got every guy here in houston to fight for paul didnt they teach you economics frank said paul has lost five million so no money no cocaine deal how exactly is paul gonna keep the cash flowing the club doesnt make enough for the largescale drug purchases he wants hows he gonna keep the muscle for enforcement the money to grease the necessary palms frank shook his head again you like your balls in a meat grinder bucks clicked his tongue you know my niece she loves your records she has those seventiesthemed parties now and then of course to her its ancient history thats cool frank said shes thirteen that age of complete cluelessness they dress in bellbottoms ugly shirts gold chains all that junk you used to wear trying to look like a badass when you looked like a clown they call the parties trash disco yeah frank said waiting you see to her its funny bucks said how stupid the clothes were how bad the music was your whole life its a joke to people frank and youre what a supernoble bob dylan fan one of those lyrics matter music nazis i dont like any music bucks said thats what makes you a freak frank said im going to offer you important advice bucks said ditch the negativity you got that from a selfhelp tape didnt you bucks eyes narrowed and frank saw the mans eyes shift the ugliness gather every time ive killed bucks said ive used a gun but chad channing says you need to expand your skill range to meet new challenges so if i kill you frank im not using a gun im beating you to death first your kidneys your major organs then your arms your legs your throat ill save your face for last bucks took a calming breath her computer where is it upstairs franks voice was weak bucks cell phone rang yeah he said a pause then naked shock on bucks face all right bucks said follow him if they let him have the car call me right back he made his hand into a revolver snapped fingers at frank you got one minute to get your pants on and be out in my car some dinks picking up eves mercedes frank ran bucks hurried out to his jaguar and in thirty seconds frank ran back out pulling a shirt on the pants not even zipped up all the way before he jumped in the car bucks backed the jag out of the driveway went past river oaks park headed toward kirby whos the guy one of her partners frank asked breathless better be that son of a bitch that punched me bucks said under his breath i thought you fell into a railing frank said from a van idling on the other side of the thin strip of river oaks park whit watched the jag speed away then he drove around to the side of the park that faced onto locke parked a block away got out of the van he jogged down the street eves house key in his hand a backpack over his shoulder he walked up to his mothers house like it was exactly where he belonged whit slid the key home turned the lock waited for the warning brreep of the alarm eve had mentioned but it wasnt armed and there was only the soft chirp the alarm made when he opened the door bucks and frank polo hadnt set the alarm when they rushed out he closed the door behind him and locked it his mothers house he took two steps into the marbled foyer a scent of coffee touched the air the house was french provincial in design on the exterior and the inside was simple but tastefully decorated the bellinis owned the house and it was a disco kings castle so whit expected goldnecklace thug decor but the antiques looked authentic the dirty plates in the sink were actually fine china and when he peered into the acreage of den beyond the kitchen he saw a tv as big as a giants eye and leatherupholstered furniture to seat twelve he took the knapsack off his shoulder scooted on his butt underneath the huge oak kitchen table and pulled the knapsack under the table with him it was heavy he had gone at ten this morning when a radio shack off kirby opened and bought out the supply of small digital voice recorders they needed to know what bucks knew and since bucks jag was parked in front of eves house at am when gooch drove by eve decided that bucks was still sticking close to frank polo whit unrolled a hunk of black duct tape with his teeth checked the settings on the voiceactivated recorder and carefully attached the small device to the bottom of the kitchen table he tore another chunk of tape loose affixed it to the bottom part of the recorder being exact so he didnt cover the microphone he tugged on his eavesdropping device it didnt give illegally taped conversations would never stand up in court but right now court didnt matter and he wasnt trying to get evidence of actual crimes he wanted to know what they were planning against his mother eve wanted to hear what bucks said if he incriminated himself so she would have evidence for paul transmitters would be better since he wouldnt have to come back in a day to see if theyd gotten any results but time had been short and he simply went with what was most expedient whit slid out from under the kitchen table headed into the huge den a wall of old leatherbound books bought by the decorative yard rather than for their literary value lined one side of the mammoth tv a thin layer of dust lay atop the gilded pages he checked another recorder stuck it behind the thick editions of moby dick and war and peace deciding they were safe from franks or bucks interest he hurried upstairs his feet quiet on the soft plush of the carpets down an upstairs hall he found the master bedroom a mess as though it had been searched probably by bucks a suit of clothes stained with blood on the lapels and front lay on the floor in a heap he hoped he wouldnt find a corpse in the tub there wasnt one one of the side tables was draped in silk and he slid under its tenting to attach a digital recorder to its underside there whit stood the final request eve had made was to copy the hard drive on her home computer ive got enough info there to put paul away if the worst happens to me whit you need it for protection shed said over the morning coffee assuming paul or bucks hadnt already moved it or erased it he found the office down the hall from the bedroom clean tidy no files no papers out for the casual observer he sat down in front of the pc and powered on the machine it began its startup whir downstairs the front door opened the alarm system gave a little ping then the door shut he got up went to the top of the stairs moving silently behind him the pc played its quiet but annoying startup fanfare in a bedroom across the hall he peered out past a drape to the front driveway a honda that hadnt been there before sat parked across the street whit moved quietly back into eves office thinking i am so screwed he heard movement downstairs heels on tile then silence then the soft pad of feet on the carpeted stairs whit drew the pistol gooch had given him from the knapsack he stepped back into the rooms small closet and eased the door shut most of the way he could see the pcs startup screen completed icons against a black background frank a voice called out a womans voice a little throaty he listened for more than one tread footsteps went by the office door down toward the master bedroom frank bucks you here then the quiet again he heard movement centering around the bedroom the intruder checking out the room he concentrated on breathing without sound he squatted in the closet a fur coat tickling his right cheek and throat a long tweed coat itchy on the other side of his face clothes you could wear for five whole minutes in a houston winter he pointed the barrel of the gun toward the closet door you going to shoot another person in cold blood he counted frank and bucks could return at any second he didnt have forever to get out of this house now footsteps approached from down the hall on the pc screen the desktop blanked into a colorful array of bubbles bouncing around the monitor he figured whoever the other intruder was she hadnt heard the pcs annoying trill a figure passed before the crack in the closet then took a seat at the system pulled the office chair close to the desk he could see her back a young woman dressed in a dark blouse black leather slacks she turned he saw her profile tasha the beautiful stripper with the computer equipment as her gimmick he watched her fingers dance on the keyboard saw slivers of screens appear on the monitor she took a cd out of her purse popped it in the tray moused around the screen he heard the whir of the hard drive the whine of processing tasha sat back she was working on the computer what copying files deleting them by reformatting the hard drive sweat inched along his ribs she could be destroying the evidence eve needed to dangle over pauls head his teeth bit into his bottom lip but if he showed himself what would he have to do to her he wasnt going to hurt her and she could tell frank and bucks that hed been in the house if they had half a brain theyd search it then find the voice recorders but why was she here when they were gone shed called their names parked in the driveway mustve had a key to open the door he heard the click of keys being pressed baby theyre not here she was talking on a cell phone yeah yeah im getting it done were good to go a pause whit was suddenly conscious of every inch of his body itching of sweat that felt like it was pooling in his shoes you ordered the hit yet whit closed his eyes there was a long pause i dont want details she said dont go there we ought to go down to the caribbean for a few days have a holiday another pause dont get all pissyass on me pause thats right thats right screw the recorders she knows whats going down and i need to know tasha said ill call you back and he saw her in the crack of the door drop the phone back into her purse zip it shut he counted to three and kicked open the closet she spun toward him but he had his pistol at her jaw line before she could turn entirely around dont move dont scream he said please dont we never did get to finish our chat last night whit said did we is there a problem officer gooch said i just want to get my car and go to my meeting tell me again why you waited so long to come back the officer said i ran from the restaurant when the shooting started headed to a friends house off of westheimer drank a bunch slept real late gooch put a shake in his voice i havent touched a drop in five years last night knocked me off the wagon but im okay now had two pots of black coffee he wiped at his lip i got aa over at st annes in twenty minutes i really need to make it the officer examined the license gooch offered it was in the name of jim oconnor a license gooch had acquired a couple of years ago for emergencies gooch stood at the back of eves car and rattled the mercedes keys in his pocket eve had told him that the car owned by paul was actually registered in the name of a company fronted by an investment broker who was in pauls pocket the broker liked gambling over in bossier city and biloxi a great deal on long weekends and he liked the hidden lines of credit paul provided him even more the cop said one minute mr oconnor and headed to the patrol car gooch sucked air through his teeth he hoped that in the dives for cover and the mad run for the exits no one had seen him return fire or shoot the hostagetaker the second gamble was that the inthebellinipocket broker would simply say yes mr oconnor is using my car theres no problem thinking that oconnor worked for paul and was using the car but that broker would for sure be calling paul as soon as he got off with the police the bellinis would know someone had grabbed eves car from the scene he was surprised they hadnt yet but they were allergic to cops and there were several cars remaining in the lot the officer was taking a long time on the radio there would be no criminal record for the policeman to access on jim oconnor gooch smiled finally the patrolman signed off came back asked gooch for a statement of what hed seen last night gooch said hed seen the window shatter and had run like hell with everyone else into the parking lot he had not seen the shooters theyd taken off and you left this really nice car sitting here the cop said i thought more of saving my ass than saving the car gooch bit his lip put on that anxious face that whit seemed to wear so often lately it was nuts i got to my friends house started drinking and lost myself in the bottle your cars got what looks like a couple of bullet nicks in it gooch said well there was a lot of shooting going on yall gonna get the guy who did it hes dead it was on the news i dont watch tv much gooch said the policeman made a production of reinspecting his license frowning again at the port leo address he tapped it youre a ways from home i moved here this week to work for a company called third coastal investments he knew that was the name of the brokers company im sure considering going back to smalltown living if you stay in houston you need to update your license in thirty days yes sir i will fine all right thanks mr oconnor well be in touch if we need more information the policeman nodded and his voice softened good luck at your meeting ive been clean eight years you dont want to slide i know one day at a time he shrugged im gonna go to st annes now thanks gooch drove the mercedes past the police barricades and turned right onto kirby he headed away from river oaks toward the southwest freeway toward west university place he watched the rearview mirror within four blocks as he came to the intersection of richmond and kirby a mustang inadequatepenis red hovered up behind him hello goombah gooch said he got out of the car ignoring the braying honks from the cars stacked behind him went to the mustangs window the driver behind it wideeyed possibly reaching for a gun under the seat hey gooch leaned down and yelled through the window you tell paul and bucks to back off all right and youre gonna get the special served up last night at the pie shack if you follow me through this light fuck you mr mustang mouthed through the window but gooch saw in the crinkle of his eyes that he understood he was thirtyish thickarmed going gray early not brightlooking gooch tapped on the window with one finger you ill deal with first the guy last night once through the throat once through the heart once through the balls i like the symmetry of it the mustangs window started to go down listen carefully dick gooch said you shoot me you got me dead next to a car thats attached to paul police gonna remember it for sure theyre already asking me about paul bellini when im picking up the car so they know they know last nights dead guys connected to him the police had said nothing of the sort but mr mustang couldnt know let them sweat the kirby light turned green the honking behind the mustang doubled a bighaired brunette in a convertible lexus leaning on her horn like the blare alone could make traffic disappear you understand the message gooch said unfazed by the other drivers mr mustang a molten glare in his eyes nodded good gooch said cars began to pass him five inches away in the other lane a symphony of blaring horns he reached down to his calf hefted up his jeans cuff pulled from a leg holster a stainlesssteel knife with a wicked blade and rammed it into the side of the mustangs front left tire the air whooshed from the sidewall gooch got back into the mercedes and drove through the light he reached for his cell phone dialed charlies house hello eve i have your car he said good call whit im not being followed at the moment i took care of the tail but your old friends will spot him stuck in traffic soon enough will collect him and head back to your house whit should be done by now are you coming straight back here yes gooch lied i dont normally do fetching getting this car back was a big risk it got them out of the house gooch clicked off without a goodbye instead of continuing south he cut over on bissonet to shepherd headed back toward westheimer toward eves house he didnt like the idea of whit alone there tasha closed her eyes the gun nuzzling along her jaw and thought it cant end like this not now not when im so close i figure you owe me about sixty dollars worth of talk still whitman mosley stepped back from tasha the gun off her jaw now but still trained on her sixty dollars worth she said she kept her voice steady thats cool when he took the step back she sighed out a held breath although she still sat ramrodstraight in the chair odd spot for a movie location scout why you playing with the computer he glanced over at the screen a status bar burning files to a cd showed it was halfway filled my friend owns this house and everything in it tasha said the thought of paul gave her confidence he gave me a key i come and go as i please she ventured a smile youre the burglar scout or did you have a key too whit said nothing watched her eve tasha said putting a little creak of fear in her voice you found her whit shrugged she hiding in here too whit see what that got her no shes not whitman mosley was the name on the credit card you used to charge my time last night i googled your ass this morning scout whitman mosleys a justice of the peace down on the coast in port leo feature stories written about you in the corpus christi paper a badass judge took down a senator busted up an illegal archaeology dig havent you been busy tasha squinted they didnt include a picture though shed played the one card she had she knew who he was if he was going to hurt her hed do it now whit shrugged a name to use lets say its you why does a smalltown judge care about a woman like eve michaels why does a smart woman like you hang with thugs job markets tough she said might be tougher for you real quick makes me wonder what the texas board of judicial review would have to say about a jp smacking people around and pulling guns on them and harboring felons i wonder whit said what the fbi would make of you discussing a hit i didnt say hit i said it i have that urban accent thing happening what else had he heard her throat tightened whos the hit on tasha eve me or my friend all of us the laptop stopped its whirring ill take that cd please whit said wordlessly she ejected the cd and handed it to him she thought this is not good copying files instead of taking the laptop whit said makes sense if you didnt want frank or bucks to know you had all these files whats the data about she raised an eyebrow were playing twenty questions until bucks and frank come back answer me what are these files stuff paul wanted she said everybody in this is cheating and stealing from him now he wanted to know if there was any record of it she shook her head eves a dead woman walking you know that i want you to deliver a message for me please i love your manners she said you tell paul that eve doesnt have the money she didnt take it she accused bucks hes a solid bet and now youre all at each others throats and bucks could benefit or kiko or someone else tasha crossed her arms yeah eve youre wrong i dont give a rats ass about the money whit said i want whoever killed the men at the office all right and i want paul and his people to leave eve alone forever guarantee her safety tasha shook her head better ask for nuclear disarmament more likely to get it scout he held up the cd this buys me a treaty tasha fbi would love records relating to the bellini family she didnt want him to leave with that cd a cell phone lay on the desk by her purse a bigger old model and she slowly took it turned it toward him fine you win call paul yourself she turned the antenna toward him her finger sidling to the side button and thought you dont want to kill him but girl you better he started to reach for the phone but then he shoved her hand and the phone went off a shot popping from the little snub antenna and the window that faced out onto the backyard shattered he yanked her up from the chair smashed her wrist against his knee the phone gun dropped and she screamed he kicked it under the desk bad girl he said i read about those in the papers big with gangs in dc and miami and i saw the antenna was openended handy if you dont want anyone to know youre armed youre hurting me you just tried to shoot me so you lost all room to complain whit said but he let her go pushed her back into the chair he steadied the barrel of his gun at her face give me a reason why i shouldnt shoot you right now i aimed at your shoulder she said i wasnt gonna kill you lets be friendly and clear ill shoot you in the knee if you do one more single thing to piss me off she was silent now whos the hit on whos carrying it out tasha bit her lip the hits on eve she said paul could get any of a dozen people locally to carry it out give me names well bucks how about fresh new names theres a guy real vicious bastard named the wart he used to have a bad one on his face but he got it taken care of the name stuck who else i dont know truly i dont probably more five million is a lot of money to lose she squinted at him simplify scout tell eve to give back the money leave it in an airport locker call us leave the key where we can get it tell her to walk away and i can chill paul down she doesnt have it bucks framed her or shes got it and shes sharing it with you and youre blowing smoke tasha said if we had it and we intended to keep it we wouldnt be sticking around houston she wants to prove to paul she didnt take it tell him for us since you have the gun tasha said you didnt do it not at all scout lets all go have a latte if we get into a fight with paul whit said this will end badly for everyone i assume you dont want paul or his business hurt useless to negotiate with me im merely the girlfriend behind every great man whit said youre smart and you can help me and help yourself and paul ill tell him youre trying to find the real thief she said the cold look that had come into whits eyes scared her a little now he meant business as much as paul did she suddenly envisioned him taking her with him forcing a deal with paul and that would ruin everything like paul would pay to get her back he wouldnt i already gave you the message he needs to hear whit said but i want information has the deal with kiko grace been called off if eve didnt have a death sentence on her for stealing the money shed have one for telling you about the deal answer me please you dont have to say please when you have the gun she said as far as i know the deals still on so whats paul going to tell kiko if he cant get the money back call off the deal i suppose and what ask kiko not to sell to pauls rivals call paul and ask him what do i look like robert duvall in the godfather im not his consigliere im just a dancer he held up the cd tell paul to cancel the hit on eve look hard at everyone else who has a motive to bring him down because she didnt do it if he doesnt want the feds to get a detailed phone call from eve about the bellinis over the past thirty years with these files he needs to back off am i making myself crystal clear like waterford scout downstairs the front door opened the alarm giving off its little soft bleep of announcing entry paul bellini watched the slow slow rise and fall of his fathers chest his mother had converted a spare bedroom into a miniature hospital ward and paul wondered exactly how much money it was costing a day to keep the old guy going his mother wouldnt tell him and once hed shoved her about it pissing mad and mary pat bellini said every cent is for your father not another word and a deep welling shame overcame him but last week hed sat by his father calculating each breath in terms of dollars spent and before hed had two thoughts hed wrapped the ventilators electric cord around his ankle wondering how many shakes of the foot would pull the plug literally how long his dad would breathe on his own pr if hed go with a merciful snap of the fingers it would after all save money a lot of money and yeah give his dad his dignity too that was a bonus he took his fathers hand felt the faint warmth in his fingers kissed the fingers tucked them back under the sheet i need you to wake up dad now no answer im in trouble daddy wake up keeping his voice lower than the hum of the machines of course nothing again two guys got killed at the alvarez place and the cops are gonna be on the alvarezes like white on rice dad when he used a southern expression his father had always affectionately tapped him on the jaw telling him dont talk like your mom but not meaning it bad he brought up his fathers hand brushed it against his jaw in a little limp slap do i pay the alvarezes to keep quiet do i kill them i dont want to fuck up again dad he could hear his fathers voice inside his head nothing to connect you to alvarez and one thing to connect you to eve doyle and he was a screwup who probably owed money to any number of lowlifes pray the cops focus on him pray the old lawsuit that we won against the cops slows them down enough if they start looking at you paulie paul got up went to the window the window was taller than he was facing onto the lush green yards and live oaks that led to the stone walls and gate at the front of the house no reporters yet what if eve goes to the press the thought was impossible to swallow shed incriminate herself but if she got immunity hell she might end up giving interviews to people get a book deal appear on oprah nausea wrenched his guts and he put his forehead against the windowpane the paper said the guy with doyle was a corpus christi pi named harry chyme but why was he there what did he know about doyle or the bellini operations the loose end of harry chyme entirely unexpected worried paul sick hed asked tasha to check up on the name harry chyme using her and her friends computer knowledge see what they could dig up he went back to his fathers bed kissed his cheek squeezed his hand waiting for an answering tightening of fingers nothing it was time to go kiko had phoned ten minutes ago asked for an early lunch meeting just the two of them paul went to the garage popped open the back of his porsche a long length of heavygauge chain lay there in a burlap bag the same chain hed used to kill ricky marino back in detroit hed boiled it repeatedly sure that would eliminate any usable trace dna evidence the chain was not an item he could throw away it felt a part of him seared into his hand and head with every lash hed laid on marinos flesh he thought of using it on eve shed scream beg for mercy within five seconds on frank the thieving stupid little bastard hit him in the throat with it stop the singing forever on kiko his perfect clothes shredded by the links his perfect confidence torn away like flesh from bone the porsche purred as paul pulled out of the driveway past the ornate iron gates his dad had bought in italy he headed west on westheimer threading through the molasses traffic of uptown and the galleria past the glass citadel of the transco tower one of the tallest buildings in the world outside of a downtown area he passed highrise hotels neiman marcus ultratrendy eateries he headed west and the trendiness began to fade as surely as if he had crossed a border now there were persian rug shops cellular stores in strip malls neon written in languages other than english he drove past club topaz the lot was almost empty although a noontime crowd would start to materialize soon seven blocks down on one corner was a small greek deli paul parked the porsche went inside kiko grace sat in a back corner no jose this time which seemed odd paul glanced around the room trying to make kikos backup two older men sat at the counter a couple of younger guys in another booth not watching paul walk by he decided it was them and wondered exactly how many soldiers kiko had brought to houston or had already recruited here cash worked wonders when you had it kiko offered a hand as paul slid into the quiet hush of the booth hey hey i asked the waitress to give us a few minutes kiko said because im not sure i want to eat with you whats the problem paul asked knowing the answer do you or do you not have the green cleaned yet and ready at hand kiko said not sounding mad yet im greener than a golf course man paul laughed then why am i hearing you dont have it who said so i got a phone call saying so kiko said from who an anonymous but concerned citizen dont yank me paul said was it a woman that bitch eve she was trying to sour the deal for him or cut her own deal buy the coke herself with his and his fathers money it would be brilliant a quick way to cut his throat and cut him out in one swift move the caller was a man told me to read in the chronicle about a banker getting whacked down at the port im gonna ask again and you better not be fucking lying to me because if you dont have the green kiko said we got to negotiate a new deal weve had a small delay youll have your money this weekend kiko sipped at his ice water i hate surprises they make me uneasy i get uneasy you get unhappy he gestured at the waitress kiko ordered sandwiches for them both and beers not even asking paul what he wanted it was an insult paul decided but he had no leverage at the moment so he gave no reaction but he thought of that chain coiled in his car and wondered how many of kikos teeth he could shatter with the first blow so who killed your banker kiko said not letting it go yet not reassured i dont know any dead bankers paul said it has nothing to do with our deal our deal is dead at the moment kiko said that fries my ass a fucking dink i dont know calling me knowing my business right now my anonymous caller has more credibility with me than you do because he knows paul tried not to swallow show he had a tense lump in his throat kiko fell silent as the waitress brought them cold beers everything is fine on my side paul said if you dont want to do business with me dont do business with me i can focus on lots of other projects and you can try to find another single buyer for your goods man he didnt want to bluff now but he couldnt sit still and endure a lecture from this miami greaseball i hope its fine man i sincerely hope because lets share a moment of clarity if youre trying to score without paying me if youre trying to screw me over im going to have your whole family killed now kiko gave a smile that offered real warmth to it we clear paul wanted to say dont threaten me you greaser son of a bitch do you know who i am but he kept quiet there was no point nothing to be gained and he would be patient until he had his money and the coke he needed the deal so for now he would take the disrespect but never forget it kiko grace had made a serious error he made himself say we clear absolutely the deal is on you will have your money wondering who had called kiko a mans voice frank trying to find maneuvering room one of nickys friends upset about his death at the pie shack looking to switch sides or bucks thinking that paul was fading and kiko was the new power in town the sandwiches came in thick pita bread rich dressing leaking out the side homemade potato chips mounded around the sandwich paul picked up his sandwich bit chewed couldnt taste the food kiko watched him good isnt it paul made himself smile scream tasha thought he wont shoot you scream your head off not a word whit whispered to tasha he kept the gun steady on her but his scalp sweated the skin along the back of his legs prickled he heard the downstairs voices rising in anger bucks saying how hard is it to follow a goddamned car isnt he a highschool graduate then a pause call paul frank polo said right now or i will youre the one who messed up bucks whit moved to the broken window saw that the roof sloped down to the covered walk between the house and the garage thumbed the latches pushed it open heard footsteps treading up the stairs franks voice rich like chocolate still arguing with bucks to get paul on the phone whit lowered the gun and went out the window stepping onto the shingled roof tasha ran out of the room and screamed bucks he skidded down the shingles glancing up to see a mans startled face at the busted window whit jumped onto the walkways roof then dropped down on the wet patch of cool green lawn in the backyard a brick path snaked through the grass the back windows were curtained no bucks yanking open the drapes to fire on him the yard was fenced with another house on each side close up against each property line he ran to the fence on his right and a big dog barked angrily he cussed and ran to the other fence a back door opened behind him he didnt look back whit jumped onto a trellis dense with ivy a thweet popped on his left and the ivy shredded as a silenced bullet pocked the fence whit hauled himself over the fence with a huge pull another thweet and the passing bullet yanked his windbreakers back he smelled a puff of burnt nylon as he dropped down into the neighbors driveway not shot he sprinted past a parked bmw pulled himself over the black iron fleursdelis that topped the driveway gate franks house was on his left now and he ran at full steam toward the l intersection where timber lane met locke lane and the narrow green of river oaks park lay he heard the thock of tennis balls against damp courts at the near end of the park but he couldnt see the players and screaming for help was no good goochs van was another thirty feet away and whit measured out his life in those steps his sneakered feet slamming against the street thinking hell have to chase me down the street but how far can his gun reach he ran and as he turned onto timber road a gray mercedes barreled down the street at him he risked a glance behind him and saw a young man with whiteblond hair not bucks chasing him onto locke gun in hand whit angled to get the van between him and the man and he heard the crack of the gun the silencer off sure to let the bullet fly farther he was ten feet from the van five the gun fired again and heat passed his throat like an angels wing he thought he was hit he rounded the corner of the van as the mercedes accelerated revving in sweet german force and thundered past whit whit glanced back saw the mercedes aiming at blondie saw blondie turn and run and the mercedes clip him blondie went over the windshield the mercedes spun out its front crashing into a modest little honda parked at the intersection of locke and timber and blondie fell went down on the other side of the car gooch in eves car whit scrambled to his feet felt his back his arm no wound although a sting lay across his neck there was no gush of blood gooch yelled through an open window go whit ran got the key into the van started the engine he watched in the rearview the mercedes was gone blondie stood staggering past the street corner gun still in hand whit floored the van shots fired in river oaks the police would be here in ninety freaking seconds he headed fast down locke lane squealed onto claremont then ran a red light and drove past westheimer he stayed straight heading all the way back to the quiet of west university place they could stop paul bellini dead in his tracks now get eve to review the cd identify the most incriminating files they could be sent anonymously to the das office or the fbi or whoever would descend on paul like a pack of wolves fastest hed have to check evidentiary law decide who would be best to approach but the win was in their grasp a negotiated safety for his mother and they could be in port leo by tonight or tomorrow at the light at bissonnet he turned left checking his neck in the rearview mirror while he waited for the arrow to go green a graze nothing worse a millimeter the other way and his carotid artery would be sprayed all over the manicured green of river oaks park he breathed hard but steadied his hands he took a circuitous route through the quiet narrow streets of west u driving past the fancy blue street signs but there was no sign he was being followed after ten minutes of driving and watching his rearview he pulled the van into charlies garage charlie was gone he had left this morning for his standup gig in san antonio with them promising him to lie low and do nothing untoward or illegal as soon as whit parked eve was at the back door opening it worried he ran in she slammed the door behind him they shot at me nearly hit me gooch saved my ass whit oh no baby here sit down it did not even bother him that she called him baby he collapsed on the couch she examined his neck got a damp cloth he told her about tasha their discussion her attempt to shoot him the blond guys chase of him i hope gooch broke the son of a bitchs legs eve said thats gary one of pauls thugs not bright but a good shot gary wasnt with frank and bucks when they left whit said he mustve followed them back eve ran the washcloth along his face this stops now she said in a hoarse voice i dont want you hurt it does stop now i got the cd tasha was burning of your laptops files files paul wanted if its got the goods on paul we can tell him well show it to the police unless he leaves you alone and then well show it anyway eve stopped wiping let me see this cd for an instant whit didnt want to give her the disc in case she didnt want to show it to the cops didnt want to implicate herself well wait for gooch i want him to see the data too dont you trust me whit yeah he said not knowing if it was true but well wait a minute for gooch okay she sat next to him doctoring his graze they waited but gooch didnt come back bucks watched the tall ugly punk on the bed the mans eyes were closed and he was tied down with sailboat rope frank stored in the garage tasha had draped a cold washcloth across his bruised face but the man hadnt stirred from the upstairs window bucks watched frank polo and tasha strong in the driveway the damaged mercedes was tucked into the garage still driveable at least enough to limp into the driveway and then behind the closed doors the bullet gary had put through the mercedes back windshield couldnt be seen a police car had arrived minutes after tasha and bucks got the punk and gary into the house and the mercedes into the garage frank stood out in the driveway and he had chatted with the cops explaining another car crunched into his friends honda then veered into their yard before taking off he had no idea why a neighbor would have reported shots fired the sound of the accident perhaps or kids running around in the winter sunshine with bb guns youngsters in the park last week shot grackles out of the oaks frank with a smile asked the officers if they heard his songs on the oldies stations and would they like an autograph for their wives the police had asked their questions of him and tasha she said she owned the honda didnt see the other car hit it the police left tasha swept up the broken glass in the street frank could be awesomely cool when he had to be hows the guy i hit a gravelly voice behind bucks said the punk he had said last night at the club his name was leonard had one eye open did i kill him youre shot buddy and youre wondering if you killed someone bucks said im shot leonard seemed surprised but his eyes were unfocused bullets are funny things he shot at you but it went through the rear windshield and an edge of the headrest and hit you in the back of the head broke the skin but it bounced off your skull i think you pulled up hard into our yard i leaned in and belted you twice with the butt of my gun your head must be made of granite partner im shot the man said he rubbed at the back of his head as though he expected a bullet fragment to be protruding like a bump gonna be a long wait for the second bullet bucks sat down by him why should i want to kill you partner ive messed up your plans leonard said but im highly adaptable bucks said you need to be adaptable too so answer a few questions for me and i dont stick my gun in your pants and shoot your dick off he tossed goochs wallet on the bed who are you mr oconnor and why do you have such a grudge against me youre nothing to me gooch said whats the real name im thinking its not oconnor guchinski my friends call me gooch you can call me sir mr vascos not gonna be happy about drop it youre not from detroit or from joe vasco i made a couple of calls this morning no one there ever heard of you gooch closed his eyes for a moment shrugged thats correct so who are you and what do you want with eve silence see gooch i dont think you were her partners and she doublecrossed you i heard you were all cozy last night at the pie shack so why were you looking for her last night shes the longlost mother of my friend dont give me lines bucks stood where is eve and your buddy mosley is that his name i dont know where theyre at now theyre moving dont want to get caught gooch bucks said consider your situation you should have a goal to continue breathing in the next five minutes do what you need to accomplish that goal they wanted eves car i said id get it for them gooch said wheres the five million in my wallet seriously bucks sat back down again its just you and me here gooch said so bag the act youve got the money and youre blaming eve its a smart move youve played well off the situation id applaud if i could i dont have the money asswipe bucks grabbed gooch by his shirt shook him hard i dont have the goddamned money he forced his voice to calm forced his breathing to go steady i think you do bucks hoisted goochs head up by the hair whispered hard in his ear i dont have it and i never did you idiot asshole eve has it if she says ive got it shes lying shes playing you for a fool he let go of goochs hair stalked around the room jesus ive hired three hit men to find her im spending a fortune i dont have to find this woman if i had all that money i would have left town dumped it in a swiss banking account gotten the hell out of houston immediately i wouldnt bother with a frame i dont want a job with paul that bad you think hes ever going to give me five million you think this is my dream job i used to be somebody bucks steadied his voice the panic hed been fighting down felt like it might surge blacken his heart shortcircuit his brain i am somebody i dont have it gooch i gooch said dont care you better care who shot nicky you your friend does it matter it will to paul i can tell him it wasnt you if you help me gooch said nothing yall have the money i need the money he got his voice low put his mouth close to goochs ear paul will kill you if he thinks you cant help him okay but ill cut a separate deal with you and your friends and you get to live gooch considered whats the deal we could split the money and i can make sure paul never bothers any of us again but i have to have that cash listen paul can cut a new deal with his buyers just buy half the coke tonight not the whole shipment its not ideal but it would preserve the deal at least for a few more days and you would still get half the money and you get to live lets say you and i cut a deal whats to keep paul from coming in and shooting me at any second while im your captive i dont have a single guarantee gooch said and even if you get half the money you just let me go youre right bucks said you dont have a guarantee except my word that ill keep paul from killing you because i cant afford to have your death sour a deal with eve and mosley but i need you to tell mosley and eve to give me half the money or paul will come at you like that guy in detroit he chainwhipped to death man i saw pictures you dont want to end like that gooch said nothing watched the ceiling they dont have the money they cant cut the deal you want gooch closed his eyes its really painful to watch a mind work at such a slow pace painful bucks said friend youre gonna learn nine new meanings of the word he patted goochs cheek if you wont deal youll just have to take what comes i have an idea on how to keep you on the table as a bargaining chip he went to the top of the stairs dr brewer come up here please chad channing stressed the importance of keeping all your bases covered twenty minutes later bucks went back downstairs tasha strong was on the phone she nodded hung up and bucks sat down across from her frank polo sat at the kitchen table sipping a glass of red wine rubbing his face the blond kid gary was on the sofa frowning while doc brewer who had tended to franks injury last night returned to his interrupted work of stitching up a cut on garys head the muscle assigned to watch the pie shack lot max with the spare tire now on his mustang was out in the garage surveying the damage to eves car that was paul tasha said wants the guy brought to his house easier to keep him hid the guy still hasnt regained consciousness bucks said forced himself not to look over at doc brewer i mean a head injury like that he may be out for a while long while doc brewer chimed in so he cant give us information yet on eve bucks crossed his arms looked hard at tasha strong tell me again what happened paul wanted to see if there were any incriminating files on eves computer i didnt think there would be because she would have taken the whole laptop but she didnt why you i used to be a web designer im comfortable with computers tasha said he said go check it out so i did why didnt he ask me bucks said ask him tasha said sounds like a matter of trust to me frank sipped at his wine shut the hell up bucks said so i come inside with the key paul gave me and i hear a noise i go up to check the computer but before i can do anything mosley surprises me with the gun and then he starts asking questions about you bucks what about me where you live where you eat how often you got muscle with you are you even a decent shot stuff like that tasha gave him a thin smile they must be planning to come after you tit for tat since you put a hit on them bucks commanded himself not to flinch and what did you say i told him i didnt know you well didnt know where you lived anyplace you hung out other than the topaz he fired a shot through the window to scare me i told him i didnt know then he told me to stay quiet when yall came in and he went out the window she folded her arms you find anything interesting on eves computer bucks asked i didnt have time to look ill do that now she stood well take the computer with us when we move guchinski over to pauls house bucks said all have a look together whatever tasha said frank set down his wineglass if there was anything valuable on the computer mosley would have taken it shut up bucks said again and frank laughed against the rim of his wineglass mosley might have copied the information instead tasha said if i hadnt caught him no one would know he was here and theyd have information we didnt know they had major strategic advantage bucks said baby youre my moron frank sang doc brewer stood in the kitchen alcove he was a short gray little man with a face the color of faded concrete and his voice was always soft as though he preferred to sidle through life unnoticed usually i dont volunteer my opinions he said but look at the other side of the coin if he wasnt here taking something he was leaving something behind tapped his ear everyone shut up bucks stood on a chair inspecting the ornate light fixtures he looked along the windowpanes he pulled the phone off the wall checked its back he ducked his head under the kitchen table well hello there bucks reached for the digital voice recorder friday evening darkness settled over houston the sun painting the clouding sky the orange of joy the gray of sadness whit wanted to drive back to the house on timber eve forbade him and he decided it was a bad idea an ambush waiting to happen or maybe theyd chased gooch and hed had to lose them and was taking his time getting home ensuring he wasnt followed back to charlies house the news came on there was no report of a shooting along the quiet of a river oaks street no report of a man matching goochs description turning up dead whit sat with eve at charlies pc studying the data on tashas disc this isnt exactly a backup of the hard drive whit she said he leaned down looked at the spreadsheets before him columns of numbers with annotations and footnotes inserted beneath that made no sense to him so what is it these spreadsheets show operations from the legit bellini businesses and then these are the semilegit businesses like alvarez insurance we use them to clean the money from the drug deals by making it look like the funds are coming from legit accounts from various holding companies but these files she pointed to an array of spreadsheet icons ive never seen before but she was copying from your drive you sure she wasnt copying from this cd onto my hard drive you were tense maybe it was the other way around i should have taken the whole laptop he said then theyd know someone had been in the house theyd know anyway once tasha talked she shook her head honey you think i kept records so a fed with a search warrant could walk in seize a system and indict us no i switched out hard drives every few weeks and destroyed the old ones but i kept the files that made the drug money look legitimate so how would tommy bellini know if his books balanced he and i would review them together before i destroyed the drug files of course that stopped after his stroke she glanced at him the idea was to park a certain amount of real money in his legit interests so you go ahead and pay the taxes on those the rest went into his pocket backed by the moneycleaning books out of that he paid salaries expenses and so on and supplies like the coke she nodded why would tasha have these other files and want to put them on your laptop he said unless shes part of the frame shes in with bucks eve scrolled down through the spreadsheets this looks more like an extra set of cooked books she began to click open files studying them hey these are files for businesses paul doesnt own with lots of money parked in them look at these revenue figures so why does a stripper at his club have an additional set of cooked books on a cd why eve frowned lets say paul gives her the cd asks her to back up the data on the laptop then these are extra files already on the cd data he was keeping secret from me i didnt think he had operations i didnt know about but now anythings possible with paul again why not simply take the laptop its his because he doesnt want bucks or frank to know its gone because he suspects bucks but doesnt want to tip his hand whit said or franks you said he embezzled from paul whit leaned over her watched the screen lets consider another possibility she has these files on the disc but did she also copy these files to the hard drive in return why part of the frameup on you he said bucks could say you were incorrectly cooking the books with this data those files would have a date stamp for when they were placed on the hard drive she clicked the mouse expanded a view see theyre showing as transferred today but they could be edited once they were on the machine assuming tasha has the computer knowhow and ill bet she does bucks didnt want frank around when the files were added so he asks tasha to do it when theyre gone i prefer simplicity eve said shes in bed with paul he wanted to know what was on that system without alerting bucks and frank hes a sneaky ass shes sneakier he said she had that little gun hidden in a cell phone have you ever seen that used no but ive heard of them paul mightve given it to her she pointed again at the spreadsheet icons this bothers me this data makes the bellinis look like theyve got way more income that is being cleaned than they actually do in lots of places that dont exist i dont believe tommy or paul truly has this money so what would be the point of putting it on my computer or tying it to other bellini financial records what would the feds do if they got this information start auditing each and every company start tracing the money trail start shutting down operations making arrests she pointed at the cookedbook files this would make them pee in excitement then we have a negotiating point right we could put paul in jail and me in jail whit she touched the back of his hand is that what you want i didnt do the crime whit said no you didnt i told you i go to prison theyll still kill me i have no doubt she stood walked to the window there has to be another way to use this to get paul to back off on having me whacked whit said nothing for a few moments he tried goochs cell phone again calling on his own cell not wanting to call on charlies home number no answer this isnt right he said we have to assume they got him eve said you said he was pulling away but they may have shot him in the middle of river oaks hes not here is he i messed up whit said no gooch shouldnt have shown up there he told me he was coming straight back here he didnt stick to the plan whit its not your fault he saved me from getting shot and i left him you did what he wanted she touched his face where would they take him the bellinis own two houses in river oaks the one frank and i were in and another much bigger house on lazy lane she crossed her arms lazy lanes a street where practically every house has a guard station dogs roaming property heavy protection if they take gooch there well never get in were not abandoning him paul owns a house down in galveston too but its for sale i doubt they would head down there i cant risk goochs life im calling the police whit said and tell them what eve asked everything he said will that help your dad whit she asked you want him to see you in jail before he dies your concern for my dad is a little late whit said like thirty years im more concerned for you and your own hide sure she said you have me pegged anyway what i did to you defines every aspect of me as a person right yes whit said would anyone ignore abandoning your family in estimating your character i suppose not she sat down on the couch call them then theyll arrest the both of us me for the felonies ive committed you for the knowledge of them thats at least three years in prison whit you already turned your back on law and order baby he sat down on the couch put his face in his hands whit what are you going to do she asked quietly his cell phone buzzed he answered it praying it was gooch hello whit its claudia hey he said his stomach sinking at the sound of her voice thank god she said youre okay sure he said im in houston did you know about harry chyme yes he said it was on the news im so sorry claudia had harry found your mom whit tell me a crackle marred claudias voice on the line whit did you hear me no he hadnt found her whit said seeing how the lie tasted in his mouth i talked with him briefly he said he thought eve michaels was in houston but i didnt hear anything more from him are you still in houston she asked yes where i want to see you now this is a bad time claudia really i cant talk right now im staying at a hampton inn near the galleria i came to houston to find you find out what happened to harry and you are going to tell me what the hells going on when i heard harry was found dead with a man and you had gone to houston ive been scared to death ive left you messages why havent you called im sorry claudia im sorry go back to port leo okay im okay and ill talk with you later whit for gods sakes this is me youre one of my best friends claudia and i love you and i dont want you involved in this im sorry go home and he clicked off the phone girlfriend eve asked no good friend i didnt even ask if you were married or had been i havent been but i wont be bringing a girl home to meet you you shouldnt i would probably scare a nice girl he said nothing eve sat next to him on the couch they will torture gooch if they have to whit theyll blow the fingers off his hand one by one cut off his balls cut him so he bleeds to death an inch at a time strangle him until hes nearly dead then give him the gift of breath back then strangle him again and again till hes begging to die hell tell them where we are weve got to find a new place to hide theyll never break gooch whit said if hes dead and beyond our help were too late if hes not hell never turn on us whit hes an incredible person i can tell that but these people will break him tell me have you seen them hurt people before yes she said after a moment and did nothing stop judging me whitman her voice was as low as a whisper if i were judging you i would be walking out the door i would never have even tried to find you because i did harry is dead gooch may be dead i dont blame you i blame me whit her voice softened my choices he said so i got to fix it im calling the cops but you take goochs van and go youre good at hiding theyll never find you you leave ill stay to get gooch absolutely not im not leaving you to face this alone you have to because if i call the cops youll be arrested she put her face in her hands shook her head and i lose you all over again whit said but i cant let them hurt gooch she looked up at him what if theres another option he got up walked to the window let the drape drop down i dont know how to beat these people she followed him to the window slowly awkwardly she hugged him his arms tensed under hers she rested her head against his chest and he let his breath loose i dont have a right to hug you son she said but pretend i do okay he stood there in the fading light his mother holding him and his heart fractured along a thousand fissure lines a thousand hurts a thousand wishes the house was quiet and he listened to the hush of her breath slowly he hugged her back ill make it all right son she said her cell phone tucked in her purse rang she broke the hug and went to the purse dug it out clicked it on yes she listened for a moment then handed whit the phone bucks he wants to speak to you hello your friend is made of stern stuff bucks said im impressed is he alive for now prove it to me hes unconscious not in good shape how do i know you have him hmmm bucks said his name is gooch but his id says jim oconnor whit closed his eyes i assume youre not just calling to gloat of course not im calling to discuss goochs future im listening ill guarantee goochs safety you give me half of the five million you keep the other half we dont have the money whit said i think it would hurt poor goochs feelings to know you dont value his life i do but we dont have the money whit said again but then thinking maybe gooch told them we do to keep them from killing him so play along to buy time dumbass but if bucks has the money this is nothing but a trap he had to choose now there are people hunting you right now asshole people who make me look like an eagle scout okay this is really your best option and ive got a millimeter aimed right between goochs eyes at the moment hes asleep and hell never know what hit him i suppose thats a mercy oh wait i feel a hand spasm coming on okay whit said okay ill deal eve stared at him shook her head you have until tomorrow at six pm bucks said ill call you back with details call the police the feds your friend dies in a fashion that wont be pleasant and then well come after you and eve anyway since were negotiating whit said theres a little matter of way cool data we have computer records about paul bellinis accounts the paper trail that leads to fat federal indictments release gooch tell paul to cancel the hit on eve right away there was silence for a moment then a soft laugh i admire the ballsitude man truly youre a focused individual but i know what was on that computer and it was crap that doesnt matter that laptops got nothing you think i wouldnt check her files as soon as eve went running whatever you got its nothing to me six oclock tomorrow man ill call you back with details he hung up jesus whit said is he a moron he told eve what had been said bucks has the money she said its a trap i dont think he does but then whit stopped thought it through unless paul was listening in on that call and its all for show and bucks knows well say we have the money just to save gooch thats a distinct possibility she said but then why not spring the trap immediately why give us until tomorrow to deliver the money eve shook her head the moneys got to be due to kiko in the next day or so if they have it earlier they can close the deal earlier bucks doesnt want that deal closed now whit rubbed his face paced i dont think paul was on that call more likely bucks wants paul and kiko both badly offbalance he could have taped that call play it for insurance if he needs it it makes him look better than us even when he said hed deal for half the money the question is who has the money and ive just admitted to it shit he punched hard at the sofa cushions she hugged him its okay you did it for gooch but lets keep our thinking simple and clear whit eve said i still think bucks has the money right now he needs as many fingers pointing away from him as possible so he keeps gooch as a tool to keep us in line but also as a means to delay the deal he can say hes in negotiations with us that only stay open as long as gooch is alive hes got our hands tied and pauls hands tied either until he can vanish with the money or cut a separate deal with kiko that shuts out paul and leaves him on top and hes not afraid of the cookedbook computer records that doesnt make sense he should be scared to death but hes not eve said because hes not staying with the bellinis so hes not worried about getting caught with them hes playing every side against the other because hes flying i played right into his hands whit said he eve put a finger to his lips someone just came in the back door she whispered i blew off a third date for you vernetta westbrook said i appreciate your sacrifice claudia said i suspect he has backhair issues vernetta said in her rasp but a sweet guy im on the fence in that petty shouldidatehimagain way the two women sat under the notmoving ceiling fans of the goode company barbecue restaurant on kirby the air heavy with winter damp and the woodscent of ribs and brisket their plates held shreds of stray meat and onion and pickle chunks mired in barbecue sauce the benches under the fans were mostly empty it was too cool for outside dining but vernetta smoked they had eaten their way past the awkwardness of old school friends who have not spoken in too long they covered claudias failed marriage the embarrassing level of coverage shed gotten in capturing a serial killer on the coast vernettas move from defense lawyer to working at the harris county das special crimes bureau her endless parade of wrong guys mutual college friends misfortunes and triumphs the meal done vernetta opened a fresh shiner bock lit a cigarette and took a relaxed puff claudia edged toward the subject shed wanted to touch so for real how are you liking working for the das office now were getting to the favor vernetta said workrelated color me surprised i have a friend who was murdered here a couple of days ago harry chyme god im sorry vernetta bit at her lip tapped ashes into her plate does his name ring a bell vernetta you mean has the special crimes division gotten involved in the case vernetta poked at a dollop of coleslaw on her plate im not sure claudia could smell a blowoff coming arturo gomez is the investigating officer you know him he hasnt returned my calls yet gomez is very capable very ambitious i imagine he sees police chief ahead of his name one day vernetta blew out a stream of smoke you have information on the case or are you wanting to dig around before i go barreling in as the rural cop and make myself look stupid id like to know the players obviously harris county has a much more elaborate setup than what im used to in encina county so can you give me the lay of the land vernetta raised an eyebrow well from my side of the map the das special crimes division were involved in crimes where the police department needs the input of lawyers we focus on gangs narcotics major and consumer fraud major offender and theft rings asset forfeiture you reacted like youd heard harrys name i have but then she sipped her beer again and claudia waited she had to be careful she wanted to give the houston authorities whatever help she could in harrys case but she didnt want to get whit in trouble something was terribly wrong when whit would not talk to her when he would warn her off and tell her to go back to port leo maybe he had information and he hadnt contacted the authorities he might be breaking the law in this crazy search for his mother claudia waited sipped tea finally vernetta stubbed out the cigarette tell me why youre meeting with me instead of gomez if youve got info i need to know details of the case before i go in and talk to him claudia said why i just do and i know we havent talked in a while because life gets in the way but i wouldnt ask if it wasnt important please i can tell you know more than youre saying vernetta lit a fresh cigarette harry chyme and a senior vp from coastal united bank named richard doyle were found shot to death in an insurance office on mccarty one exit up from the port of houston the office is owned by an eightythreeyearold insurance agent named joe alvarez were not sure who all his insurance clients are but his family lives rather well since yesterday the alvarezes have their lawyers talking for them which means theyre saying nothing she shrugged i suspect our office will serve a grand jury subpoena on mr alvarez by monday morning if hes not more forthcoming what if he doesnt talk or takes the fifth then we give him a grant of immunity that way he cant take the fifth he refuses to answer then hes in contempt of the grand jury so alvarez is covering for someone mccarty streets not exactly a hotbed of highdollar insurance clients she said i bet alvarez insurance is a front well find a connection between doyle and alvarez as we subpoena alvarez client records and records from the insurance companies she took a sip of beer doyle was known as a highroller heavy gambler weve started going through his finances and he seemed to have very heavy debt but he had clean hands at the bank so far so far divorced a few years ago alienated from his teenage kids the kind of guy whod bet on paint drying she paused most likely doyle owed money and didnt pay what we havent known is harry chymes connection do you know claudia took a deep breath harry was investigating a case with a loose connection to the bellini family i take it youre familiar with them vernetta let nearly ten seconds pass before she answered oh sure they were being watched from the moment they arrived in houston but theyve stayed clean mrs bellini is old houston money a debutante who never outgrew the gown her husbands set himself up as an art importer they havent gotten into trouble are you sure vernetta tapped her nails on the worn wood of the picnic table trouble that could be proved let me say there was a little dustup a few years ago anonymous tip that they were dealing drugs not anything you could get a warrant on but a hotshot investigator decided to chat with tommy bellini went to his house mr bellini and hotshot got into an argument hotshot shoved bellini down in a marble foyer bellini got a fractured hip he sued hpd big mess almost funny a guy who was certainly exmob suing the cops for brutality hpd paid through the nose people lost careers over it theyve left the bellinis alone but in fairness theyve had no serious reason to look at them again dont expect the police to rush at the bellinis without hard evidence they dont want another killer lawsuit claudia considered say doyle had a connection to the bellinis and harry was trying to get information from him the bellinis didnt want doyle talking to harry or harry got caught with doyle at the wrong time or these gamblers claudia they get in deep real fast the level of debt can quickly rise into six figures and they get desperate and scared maybe doyle was trying to sell info on the bellinis to harry vernetta tapped fingernails on the table i like to know about this case harry was working a friend of mine his mother had not been in touch with him for many years harry thought a woman working for the bellinis was my friends mom gomez is attacking this case from every angle doyle brings to it not from anything to do with the bellini family you better talk to him yes claudia said her stomach twisting the smell of the barbecue suddenly making her queasy i think i better the bellinis arturo gomez said you got any proof they stood on the lawn of richard doyles exwifes house where gomez had been questioning her about doyles acquaintances and where he agreed to meet claudia and vernetta no claudia said gomez was immaculately groomed in a gray suit haircut no older than two days and still styled as though hed just left the salon fortyish ready to make the career leapfrog from investigator to executive and a shade impatient maybe the bellinis lent him money vernetta said ive got two detectives and an accountant going through doyles finances so far weve found he owes money to at least three smallscale loan sharks who hang at the racetracks and at the biloxi casinos but no one we can connect to the bellini family he laughed it hasnt exactly occurred to anyone they keep their noses clean perhaps doyle used the small sharks for his gambling loans and the bellinis for bigger amounts claudia said how big is port leo gomez said not unkindly you deal with a lot of loan sharking down there between the shrimpers and the retirees claudia bagged a serial killer vernetta said you got one on your wall art gomez cleared his throat vernetta dont claudia said harry was looking for eve michaels and he ended up with richard doyle there has to be a connection true enough gomez said this friend of yours i want to talk to him now they heard the slow click of the back door shutting whit moved through the den to the window that faced onto the backyard no sign of charlies car in the little curve of driveway whit glanced at his mother she pulled her beretta from her purse leveled it at the dens opening she shook her head and mouthed the words get down jerked her head at the couch telling him to take cover he stayed right where he was no way that anyone had followed him not with the chaos of gooch rescuing him unless gooch broke unless he talked eve a voice called are you here not charlies voice velvety she aimed the gun at the door whit moved quietly next to her its frank im alone paul bucks nobody knows im here eve glanced at whit the gun shook slightly in her hand im coming in my hands are up im unarmed ive got news about your friend and with that a man stepped into the opening of the den arms up fingers spread in high five open palms one hand bandaged he was pale and frowning it was the man who had watched whit from the upstairs window when he jumped from the roof eve baby he glanced over at whit then back at eve hi sweetheart how did you find us eve asked her voice was jagged not happy your friends cell phone i took it without bucks knowing it had a call to this number in the call log section i got a reverse directory on the internet i found the address he stared at whit hi im frank polo im eves boyfriend he wiggled fingers in a wave thats up for discussion eve said im here to help you sweetheart what would bucks and paul do to me if i knew where you were and didnt tell them shut up frank check him for a gun eve said whit patted frank down no gun no knife just the paunch of soft flesh under the silky shirt and black slacks nothing whit said she lowered the gun frank stepped forward she brought the gun back up baby baby he said quietly and she put the gun down frank embraced her and she stiffened then sagged against him she started to cry then shook her head and wiped the tears away frank kissed her forehead held her murmured im sorry im sorry again and again he looked at whit is your name whitman mosley frank asked you dont need to worry about his name eve said she stepped away from frank wiping at her nose her eyes frank glanced at eves face then whits then eves again okay whatever wheres gooch eve said our friend bucks has him theyve moved him to the house on lazy lane its the most secure is he hurt whit asked he got a real bad whack on the head unconscious but they had our doctor look at him bucks wanted to get gooch moved and get pauls mom out of the house pauls sending her to vegas for the weekend with a friend before they start rough on gooch to get him to talk frank paused everyones believing that eve stole the money she hit his shoulder once twice sure they are thanks to your damned skimming how could you frank and how could you be so dumb i messed up so im here to help you out of this frank said he held up his bandaged hand theyve already been at me i can tell you exactly what theyre doing what theyre planning so you can get away he took her hand and whit saw her fingers close around his whats your plan whit said before i start sharing my brilliance frank said id like to know exactly what role you play im helping eve whit said thats all you need to know youre the problem frank said bucks and paul know you got new friends eve that doesnt mesh well with the money being gone you must care about her whit said since youre here at considerable risk considerable aint the half of it frank said eve youre never gonna convince them you didnt take the money so you got to turn go into witness security call the fbi offer them bucks and paul eve shook her head you know what happened to gene obrien and lydia mancini they went into witsec and they still made the hit parade they also were stupid as mules calling friends in old neighborhoods frank said they let a trail be created back to them you wont what else you gonna do if i had that five million i could vanish on my own terms anywhere in the world eve said whit shook his head bucks aint leaving it around to be found or mouthing off about how smart he is frank said was this the idea behind hiding the voice recorders we found one in the kitchen but theyre tearing the house apart max already found three three was all whit had hidden he wanted to sit down badly frank looked again at whit this is bugging me you look like eve what the hells going on here he doesnt look like me dont be an idiot eve said frank sat down on the ottoman in front of a heavy leather chair put his face in his hands okay if you wont cut a deal with the cops my idea is tell kiko that bucks stole the money that paul is breaking the deal its supposed to close tomorrow night kiko then comes after bucks and paul guns blazing or kiko finds another buyer whit said sure thats gonna dry up revenue for paul gonna hurt him bad real bad why should kiko talk to me eve said frank cleared his throat because if they all think youre gonna turn to the feds youre as much a threat to kiko as you are to paul you can finger him as having been in on the deal thats real leverage he tapped at his forehead gave whit a crooked smile no one thinks i have one of these but i do eve wouldnt have given me the time of day if i was dumb as a stump so we tell kiko whit said and what if kiko doesnt believe us and comes after us then were screwed but what if eve said slowly kiko already knows the moneys gone this kind of news it gets out on the street fast hes miami frank said he dont have ears on the street here but if they war they take each other out and youre safe i wish eve said none of this rescues gooch whit said he told frank about bucks offer keeping the story simple and not adding in all of his and eves theories as to bucks true loyalties your friend consider him dead frank said sorry they have three sick bastards hunting you you have your hands full without an impossible rescue kid as for bucks hes following pauls orders to the letter so far as i can see whit went to the phone all i have to do is call the police say a man is being held against his will at that address end of story he wanted to see franks reaction to his suggestion he got a shrug from frank and the cops got their asses taken to the cleaners the last time they set foot on bellini property theyd have to have reasonable cause for a warrant frank said theyre not in a hurry to get rid of gooch not while he could tell them where you or the moneys at and for sure not while pauls mom is around pauls not gonna let his mom hear him kill a man then you help us get gooch whit said he turned to eve his safety is nonnegotiable were getting him out eve nodded i agree who is this gooch guy to you why you running around with these younger guys eve frank sounded hurt who are you whit nearly laughed its so not what you think gooch saved my life frank eve said he and whit saved me okay and theyve helped me out i owe them she gave whit a glance almost embarrassed freighted with guilt yeah babe youve always been so debtconscious frank cleared his throat whit said i sure dont trust a scumass drug dealer any more than i trust bucks or paul but franks right if we can make kiko believe the bellinis are trying to screw him on the deal the heat goes up on them he paused im going to call kiko and set up a cometojesus meeting no i should go eve said no me whit turned to frank id like to know what your plans are frank my plans frank asked with a blank look are you leaving town no im not leaving eve ever he took her hand your concern is touching whit said its the most hes ever shown eve said but not unkindly im here at total risk of my life frank said that counts for more than roses that wilt in a day and poems nobody can remember go to where they have gooch whit said and do everything you can to keep them from harming or killing him in case they change their minds we turn bucks timetable around to our advantage use franks idea kikos going to miss his cartoons tomorrow morning well tell him theres no money but not until he has much less time to plan or react less than twentyfour hours before hes supposed to get his payment make him escalate the pressure on the bellinis in exactly the way we want eve were spending tonight at a motel not here you better go frank its best you dont know where were at frank gave whit a measured look im trusting you to take care of the woman i love someone loved her he watched his mother touch franks shoulder franks defiant frown ill take good care of her whit said you take care of gooch for me tomorrow morning i call kiko and we let the shit hit the fan you dont know me the young man said but i have an important business proposition for you he sat down next to kiko on the cool granite of the bench not looking at him watching the college students amble by drinking their saturdaymorning coffee propose away kiko grace said he had been lying on the bed in his rented condo watching a rerun of a boxing match on espn with the tv set to mute listening to his pregnant wife gripe on the phone about her morning sickness he was about to switch over to a ampe and see who was on biography when call waiting clicked he thumbed the button and a voice said if you want the five million in cash thats due to you and you want to know why paul bellinis screwing you over be at rice university in thirty minutes near the statue of the man sitting in a chair in the main academic quad come alone i see anyone with you i call the police and your ass is in jail in five seconds how did you get this number kiko had asked ill see you in thirty minutes the voice said dress like a student but no backpack no weapons were giving you critical information do what we ask or you wont be seeing your five million any time soon the caller hung up kiko clicked over to his wife and said in spanish baby ill call you back go shopping itll pick you up spending money seemed to cure every other ailment she had but he couldnt deny her a thing kiko walking toward the rendezvous point decided whoever called him had made a brilliant move the quad at rice university was beautiful a manicured expanse of lawn and walkways the statue at the middle of the grounds a few students milling around the front of the library it was saturday so there wasnt a heavy traffic of people going to and from classes not an easy place for him to bring jose and tuck him away he felt himself not fitting in even though he wasnt much older than these kids he wore jeans and a miami hurricanes sweatshirt looking too old to be in college and knowing it he sat at the granite block under the sculpture of william rice sitting open book in hand jose lingered in the archways near the art gallery at the quads corner wearing a tshirt and baggy khaki work pants pretending to be maintenance even without a uniform poking at a shrub as though it were diseased his pistol on a calf holster under his trousers but kiko couldnt see him now he risked a glance at the guy who had sat next to him blondish thirtyish dressed more like a grad student than a professor paul bellini is screwing you over the man said i dont know any paul bellini you had dinner with him wednesday night you ate a salad with way too much blue cheese dressing most of a ribeye caramel cheesecake the wine was an australian merlot you drank one glass you didnt stay to watch the strippers dance in the private room who are you a friend because we have a common enemy the man said paul bellini is setting you up mr grace because hes desperate he has no intention of paying you your money hes going to take the candy you brought into town and then hes going to whack you and why should i believe you you dont have to the man said wait for the bullets then make up your mind ill be gone from houston by late tomorrow night kiko said they fly caskets out late i thought that was more of a morning operation the man said you got any proof or you just moving your lips i cant prove that hes ordered a hit on you thats entirely your gamble if you choose to believe me or not but he doesnt have your money he had it ready for you but it got stolen you know bucks bucks stole it kiko gave a smile did he now has paul confirmed with you the moneys missing or is he feeding you a steady diet of just a minor delay promised you the money tonight and he still doesnt have it because bucks has found his fool and its paul kiko didnt answer the question why you telling me this whats in it for you the man didnt look at him watched two young women walk by their laughter floating on the air waited until they were well past paul thinks eve michaels stole the money if you want your money force paul to cancel a hit hes put on eve kiko waited why shouldnt i let paul deal with his own internal problems i hate interfering with other folks staffing issues we have financial information that could bring paul down we give it to the feds theyre gonna know you were dealing with him no moneys changed hands kiko said but he felt a sick little sinking of fear in his ribs his gut well tell the feds the police theyll watch your ass under a microscope mr grace you dont want that he shrugged bucks turns over the money to either you or paul i dont care as long as they know eve didnt take it were off safe well give up our financial data to you and paul you see we dont want the money we dont want the drugs we want the hits called off we want bucks brought down to do all you ask kiko said i have to kill both bucks and paul your call the man stood handed kiko a slip of paper heres a phone number where you can reach me day or night you do your part and ill do mine and then your name is safe how do i know youre not playing me against paul i guess you dont but paul bellinis lying to you and im not the man smiled im going to walk away now good luck im not done talking to you because he decided when meetings were done not this nobody yes we are done the man said and if you dont take any action you go down with the bellinis we want to be left alone you want your money we have a mutual enemy take care of him please he turned to walk away kiko stood started to follow him watching to see if jose could see him now glancing to the left jose was talking with a man in a university maintenance uniform pretending not to speak english starting to back away from the college worker the man turned held up a hand theres a lot of windows in that building to the left the classrooms are empty today ive got a friend up there with a highpowered rifle hell take your arm off if you take another step or follow me until ive left the campus dont you threaten me not threatening promising the man said kiko watched him vanish around a corner stood there hating that he couldnt move watching jose turn and walk away from the maintenance guy finally taking a step walking no shot coming no sign of the man in the parking lot gone he got in his rented lexus jose already sitting in the drivers seat kiko got in the back and didnt say a word until he was on main street driving on the edge of hermann park his furnished condo was on fannin in the heart of a trendy real estate area for those who favored convenience to downtown well this dink says theres no delay in getting the money he says theres no money period he relayed the conversation with the man you believe him think bucks has got the money and is holding out on us kiko tongued his cheek clicked his teeth i dont believe bucks would risk that film coming to light so no i dont believe our new friend regarding bucks he drummed fingers on the dashboard now paulboy paul might be working a new angle and not clueing bucks in telling bucks theres a delay and bucks dont know better thats a serious worry so now what i dont like complications were gonna have an a i serious talk with bucks right now if hes lied hes dead too im thinking this guy and eve michaels have the money and want me and paul shooting at each other youre deadon right jose said like willie s said be able for thine enemy rather in power than use what the hell does that mean he liked jose but didnt like jose acting too smart means that you have to be competent to deal with those who piss you off no holds barred kiko fine so when we get what we want kiko said turning on the radio fiddling to find a salsa beat not wanting to hear another word of willie s we be able for our enemies on a big scale we kill everybody not another roach motel tonight eve said to whit as they drove away from rice theyd spent friday night in a cheap dive out on north of downtown we can find one thats laid out better for defense the open lot of the motel made her nervous shed been standing by the window when whit fell into restless sleep and when he awoke this morning the greystoke was a quiet elegant hotel owned by an old oil family at the edge of the galleria shopping district eve liked it because anyone following them or trying to find them could not park on westheimer to watch the flow of traffic in and out of the hotels doors all the hotels parking was handled by valets so you couldnt be watched from the hotel lot across from the greystoke a gas station had been razed and construction was under way on yet another needless upscale restaurant and shopping plaza security constantly guarded the construction site so it could not be used for surveillance this feels relatively safe she told whit safe it wasnt necessarily the condition he worried most about as he went about life but life wasnt life any more frank had called this morning said gooch sedated okay roughed up a little and hung up and now whit had hopefully unleashed kiko against the bellinis while whit waited in the quietly tasteful hotel lobby eve wearing dark glasses and a blondish wig got them adjoining rooms with her emily smith visa card within five minutes they were in their rooms im not sure kiko believed me whit said i got the distinct impression he knew more than i did he seemed overconfident could he be behind this the theft of the money eve looked blank i dont see how he couldnt have known where the exchange point was harry followed you why couldnt kiko have in a way it would be brilliant hed have the money and the bellinis are turning on each other selfdestructing without him lifting a finger then he steps into the vacuum with their money and still with his five million in coke to sell hes doubled his profits in a day he saw that the thought had not occurred to eve with her unrelenting focus on bucks and her face went ashen whit lets just run she said and leave gooch absolutely not he matters a great deal to you doesnt he yes sort of odd considering you have five brothers you hardly needed another one honey arent you close to your brothers im close to mark not so much to the others i love them all but we dont all see each other much im the last one still in port leo ive seen them more since daddy got sick eve knotted her fingers together in her lap i would have thought me leaving brought you all close together the wounded crawl off to their own corners whit said we all died a little then in certain ways it toughened us did make us close but it screwed up how we got close to people im sorry no youre not whit said you know i dont hate you clearly i dont considering what im risking to save you but an im sorry wont cut it because i dont believe youd change a thing about what you did youve had the life you wanted mom how do you know that whit because you chose never to come home she sat next to him id change one thing she said quietly id have taken you with me i nearly did but babe would have never let you go youre right he loved his children she winced i loved you too abandonment is a strange form of affection i was a strange mother so really whyd you do it does it matter she got up from the bed went into the bathroom washed her face washed her hands she came back into the room mopping at her face wiping it clean does it matter why me and my friend might die trying to save you in your heart youve either forgiven me or you still love me the human heart is capable of a lot more than it gets credit for she folded the towel im not sure i still loved you a few days ago whit you and your brothers were abstractions to me i didnt know you as men i didnt know the people youve turned into i had no years of memories to tie you to me although god knows ive imagined and i sacrificed more for you years ago than youll ever know like what she pursed her mouth like she had said too much it doesnt really matter if i tell you i sound like im pleading a case for you to understand me or to love me you either do or you dont eve said love doesnt leave it doesnt die people walk away from love i love you because at the least you gave life to me and i loved you when you were with me and i loved you when you were gone because i wanted you back more than anything in the world i wanted a mother maybe this time ill be the one who walks you havent walked away yet she said and he heard the little tremble of fear in her voice and he felt ashamed for what he had said the pointless hurt of it nothing he said to her was going to hurt her the way she had hurt him words could not equal years of indifferent silence and for a moment he hated what she had done to his family with a depth that made his stomach turn im trying to save you not change you he said what happens if we make it through this you run again or you suddenly decide youre my mom for real im never ever going to let you go again whit not after what you did for me she came sat next to him put her arm around him and for a moment her touch was like a memory and he could see her cradling him against her arm and shoulder sitting on their back porch reading him a book his brothers nowhere around he wanted to believe her with a thrum in his chest as hard and real as sudden pain lets order room service she said you used to love pizza i remember pepperoni with mushrooms thin crust its still my favorite he said his voice was hoarse but she didnt seem to notice she called room service he went back into his room shut the door showered fast tried not to imagine gooch with his nails being pulled out or a bullet tearing through brain matter or his penis stuffed into a blender or whatever bit of deranged sickness paul and bucks might inflict on him if all went wrong he dressed and went back to her room eve sat on her bed watching the local news nothing new about the murders or the shooting at the pie shack she said weve clearly made the decision to trust frank up to a point can we whit said she switched off the tv but kept her gaze fixed on the blank screen he loves me thats not always an indicator of loyalty now she looked at him stop swiping at me for a while so we can function as a team he gave her a smile i wasnt jerking your chain besides youve had an almost thirtyyear break from mosleyfamily sarcasm she laughed yes thats true god you boys had mouths her cell phone rang frank calling whit answered franks voice was as hushed as if he were in church pauls getting his mother kicking and screaming off to vegas now if pauls working over gooch it will be soon and clicked off no goodbye whit turned to eve i want frank sticking close to where they have gooch we need someone else to stick on bucks i dont have a traitor in mind she said actually i have an idea whit said but its really risky more to me than you who her name is claudia he said and im going to ask her to go against her grain in helping us but i need bucks address eve wrote it down for him and he went into his room god this could be a mistake if claudia found out hed left the scene of a crime failed to report goochs kidnapping and harbored a fugitive even if it was his own mother she would lose all respect for him their friendship would fracture permanently claudia believed in rules fiercely he was breaking them right and left caring that they were broken knowing the pain of leaving a little of himself behind each time but he was making the choice she was his friend she would help if she could focus on bucks it could save gooch without calling the police and having to turn over his mother he paced for a minute deciding and then called claudias cell phone before he talked himself out of it she answered on the second ring are you speaking to me he said depends i want you to answer my questions all right are you really okay she said yes do you know who killed harry surprising him with the bluntness of her question i have a suspicion but no proof who he swallowed a man named greg buckman also called bucks hes a former energy exec involved in a crime ring here doyle was delivering money for a drug deal bucks killed the banker for the money and harry was at the wrong place at the wrong time why was harry anywhere around these people bucks is connected to the bellinis where is your mom whit i havent found her yet the lie felt fine in his mouth and he closed his eyes so you rushed to houston on what impulse i wanted to be here if harry found my mom i couldnt sit around waiting in port leo the houston police want to talk to you whit fine when as soon as possible why are you booked today losing patience not today tomorrow or monday when this had played out and he had eve safely hidden where she couldnt be taken away from him im sorry that your calendar is so full if you want to help me truly claudia turn the police onto greg buckman but hes very dangerous no you should talk to the police with me or the das office i have a friend who works in special crimes she can help us i dont want to talk to anyone but you right now claudia said nothing for several seconds then said im listening buckman lives at alabama number its a fancy townhouse hes about sixone maybe one sixty thinning blondbrown hair dresses very conservatively like a brooks brothers poster boy he drives a silver jaguar late model vanity license plate of bleev believe hes a big fan of chad channing the selfhelp guy frank had given him this information he sounds very frightening i believe he has killed at least two people whit said theres no mention of him in harrys records his assistant gave those to the houston police she faxed me a copy this afternoon that meant the police now knew the name eve michaels harry mentioned bucks in a phone conversation whit you tell me the truth right this second have you found your mom or this eve michaels are you protecting her claudia please you have found her where are you i cant tell you please dont ask me whit do you want the police actively looking for you or your mother as material witnesses they are insistent on talking to you im asking for your understanding youre asking me to suppress information related to two homicides to harrys murder i cant im a peace officer youre an officer of the court youve sworn an oath whit you im asking you to get information to follow buckman watch him he killed harry for this money hes got to have it hidden close to him but no police claudia please you have freaking lost your mind claudia said meet me he said meet me and ill explain but no police just you and me of course ill meet you where theres a little mexican restaurant off montrose on richmond chapultepecs its in an old house ill meet you there in thirty minutes fine she said claudia yes ive really messed up he said i thought i did the right thing and now i know ive really messed up well fix it she said and he wanted to believe her ill see you in thirty claudia clicked off the phone she wrote down the address and description for greg buckman this morning she had driven to the murder site drawn by a need to be close to where harry died but it was still roped off under police tape she didnt get out of her car drove by twice before heading back to her hotel but now now she could do something she picked up the phone vernetta i heard from my friend that was harry chymes client i need you to come to a meeting with me she sighed he wont be happy about it but i need you to help me talk sense into him thirty minutes later claudia sat in a booth at chapultepecs sipping water nibbling from a mound of nachos vernetta sat four booths over waiting for whit to arrive and sit so she could join them claudia traced the beer rings on the worn wooden table with her fingertips waiting for whit waiting to see if he was still the man she knew afraid of what she had heard in his voice the nachos grew cold whit never showed two louis vuitton bags one for makeup and hair one for clothes were all his mother was taking to vegas but to paul her packing process was slower than moving mountains he was ready to shove his mother out the door when tasha pulled up in the circular driveway ten minutes too early in her little honda not what i need paul thought but he smiled and gave tasha a tooquick justfriends hug knowing his mother was watching from a window tasha leaned back from him i stink now no im tense bad bad day getting my mother out of town introduce me i bet i make her want to stick around he took her into the hallway frank polo and mary pat bellini were already in the foyer frank wheezing with mary pats two packedtothebrim bags mom paul said this is tasha shes a friend of mine how nice to meet you mary pat bellini said and her smile seemed to rise like a fence as she shook tashas hand what a lovely sweater what a lovely home tasha said paul has told me all about you for hours on end youre catching me heading out the door mary pat glanced at paul practically being pushed my son thinks i need a little vacation he doesnt give a lady much choice he can be real pushy tasha said but in the sweetest way mom frankll drive you to the airport have a great time dont go crazy at the baccarat tables okay frank looked surprised at the announcement of his assignment but he picked up mary pats luggage and carried it out to her mercedes trunk paul darling mary pat said you look like youre considering a coronary ill see you on tuesday mom unless we got developments here and you need to stay in vegas im not being gone from your daddy that long paul forget it or away from paul either right tasha said mary pat snapped a quick smile at tasha nice to meet you dear its great to meet the woman who raised paul the source of his brains and good manners mary pats smile brightened but it was aimed at her son i call you when i get to my hotel paul paul kissed his mother shut the door watched frank pull out past the extra guards at the gate thank christ shes gone the color went out of her face because of the color of mine tasha said thats a terrible thing to say paul said she treats all my girlfriends bad she was very accepting of you i have lots of black friends business associates yeah she said but i doubt you have many black friends or friends period whats that mean paul sounded hurt friends are a luxury for a guy like you tasha ran a finger along his jawline made her voice husky but i have you he pulled her close gave her a quick kiss she allowed it kissed him back teased his mouth for a moment with her tongue she broke the kiss ralph did that credit check you asked for on bucks and frank and eve great i need five thou to give ralph sweetie for this and finding eves credit card i got to throw him a bone if he can wait i can pay him and you more when we get the money tasha considered his offer with a frown theyre all clean nothing unusual i dont know if that helps you or not he looked a little deflated okay come inside i need a favor she followed him into the grand living room her eyes checking each piece of furniture noticing the rich silk of the draperies the marble on the floors the fresh flowers in every vase she had imagined a former mob wife would lean toward zebra stripes and magenta bad taste run amok instead the house was simple and elegant all at once and a twinge sounded in her heart a lot of pain and death had bought this beauty and tasha strong fought an urge to smash it all set it afire dad moved his eyes a bunch more today he led her upstairs and into a front bedroom the room was dark lit by the greenish goblin glow of medical equipment tommy bellini lay in the bed eyes at halfmast tasha expected a nurse but instead doc brewer was there checking tommys eyes how is he paul asked i think hes more alert hes the same paul doc brewer said our guest upstairs still unconscious the same doc brewer said he patted tommys hand and excused himself brewers an idiot dad knows whats going on paul said knows im in trouble hes fighting up toward consciousness he lowered his voice i was changing his diaper earlier and he was sporting wood thats a good sign right sure paul it surprised her he would tend to his dad maybe he needs additional stimulants to regain consciousness thats not how comas work sweetpea tasha said well moms been reading to him or leaving books on tape playing next to his bed all his favorite books robert ludlum louis lamour he loves those and i run mel brooks movies on the dvd player for him so read to him what about a direct approach paul said you could do a lap dance for him she blinked a lap dance it couldnt hurt and he had a woody earlier so hes still got some juice in his brain do you ever hear yourself talk paul a lap dance for a guy two seconds from choking on his own drool whats that supposed to mean i admire your concern for your dad really but you have millions missing kiko isnt waiting forever for his money youve got a guy halfdead upstairs youre going to start torturing youve got eve and this whit man gunning for you the police could descend on you any second and you want me to lap dance for your comatose daddy paul slapped her she fell back against the withered legs under the covers his legs felt like sticks under the sheets dont mouth off at me especially in front of my dad like tommy bellini was going to open his eyes shoot them a disapproving look you hit me paul she slowly got up from the bed after all ive done for you i hit you because i want you to realize the seriousness of my request i didnt ask you to do him that would be gross he took a step toward her just rub against him if it works it works im sorry baby please and we could all get written up in a medical journal she moved to the other side of the bed keeping it between her and paul charming he can wake up and slip the tip in my gstring tasha i need my dad i need him bad now because i dont know what to do he started to cry more than cry blubber paul dont she was still spitting mad and the sight of tears on his face made her even madder she hated to see a man cry it turned her stomach kikos gonna put my balls in a grinder i got to have that money if he had cried for his father her heart would have softened toward him but he was crying because he was afraid for himself it wasnt tears for his dad or for anyone else she wanted to slap him hush now she said quietly be strong paul i need my dad weve spent all this money to take care of him he sure ought to get better tasha counted to ten silently paul your fathers not going to recover ever thats clear to everyone but you youve got to take charge take responsibility she touched his shoulder let me help you her pager beeped she glanced at the readout ralph her computer hacker friend she pulled a cell phone a real one not the clever little gun she carried that no one knew about except now whit mosley out of her purse and dialed his number tasha ralph sounded excited emily smith is using her visa again at greystoke hotel the charge is for two rooms which rooms charge doesnt say ralph you are a god she clicked off and turned to paul told him what ralph reported you got em in your sights sugar call bucks call your dogs in for the kill and act like a man she lowered her voice came to him put a hand on his chest i done the work for you i got a lock on eve and her buddy now go make your daddy proud you lied to me kiko said i told you exactly what i was told bucks said that there was a delay in getting the money he rocksteadied his voice paul lied to us both because eve robbed him blind shes gutted him he has very little left he can quickly convert to cash with that money gone why should i believe you now kiko said eve stole the loot i swear kiko you know i wouldnt screw you over ive got too much to lose im about five minutes from capturing her ass i got a team working to grab her for paul theres been a change in plan kiko said bucks listened to what kiko said closed his eyes i understand he clicked off the phone waited for the horrible thumping in his chest to subside adapt adapt he could still come out on top the phone rang in his hand and he answered it heard paul telling him where they thought eve was now and truly thanked god and chad channing together for the strength they were giving him bucks waited in his jag with mackay they were parked a half block from the greystoke hotel in the shadow of a new real estate development in a parking lot where a restaurant was closed and shuttered they could see most of the porte cochere for the greystoke cars arrived in a steady stream the hotel had an upscale martini bar that attracted locals valets scrambled around the vehicles but what pissed bucks off was a car pulling in next to them a cadillac with jerry smacks driving and the wart in the passenger seat bucks sipped from a water bottle the next hour would determine how he played his next card he felt warm and calm confident for the first time in a day they gonna wonder why youre here with me mackay said now both men were looking over into bucks jag jerry smacks gave a friendly little wave with his hand the wart didnt smile why are they together bucks asked more likely to make the hit working together mackay said better to split the fee rather than none at all cut me out too so why are we here together in case they ask my car broke down you giving me a ride mackay said quit worrying youre the boss he eased down the window jerry did the same gentlemen mackay said he didnt volunteer why he was in bucks car and jerry smacks didnt ask so you boys sitting here jerking or what the wart said we gonna go in need to know mackay said which of the fifteenodd floors theyre on for starters the registration desk isnt gonna give that up im not inclined to walk through a front door jerry smacks said yeah you struck me as a back door kind of guy mackay said jerry folded a rectangle of gum into his mouth muttered to the wart then he looked past mackay to bucks how you want us to handle it mr buckman i pay the bounty gum boy bucks said i dont do the job for you fine the wart said he started to get out of the car then im gonna whoa mackay said target number two a tall blondish man stood at the valet spot he gave the attendant a dollar and hurried to a slightly decrepit volkswagen van that had been brought up to the curb thats our boy bucks said his bruised eye throbbed at the sight of whit eves alone in the hotel mackay you and jerry go in you know what i need ill follow our boy wart you come with me why me the wart yelled hes part of the contract bucks said kill him you still get paid mackay was out of the car already buttoning a leather jacket lifting his dreadlocks free from the collar hurrying across the pellmell rush of westheimer jerry smacks followed the wart huffed into the jag and before his door was shut bucks wheeled into traffic earning a blare of horns he cussed honking might attract mosleys attention but the van four cars ahead stayed in the left lane didnt slow didnt turn a charge of electricity played along bucks skin man this was a rush like cutting a deal with california power buyers seeing how far he could shove the rates down their desperate little throats calculating his enormous commissions in his head he jammed in a chad channing tape upped the volume chads reassuring baritone filled the car its important to remember chad channing said that goals are as real as the air we breathe they surround us they permeate us like oxygen they sustain us the life lived without goals is life without breath i heard this about you the wart said but i didnt want to believe it listen and learn bucks drummed his fingers on the steering wheel as though the tape had a pelvisgrinding backbeat yeah a tapes gonna tell me how to live do you have goals wart bucks asked yeah pop this guy collect my money and spend the evening with good thai pad noodles a bottle of glenfiddich and a couple of hours with a nice little whore i know the wart checked his gun again keeping it low below the line of the windows losers got to get off westheimer first too many people around those are powerful goals you got wart youve got a rich life im content the wart said you didnt say if you prefer head shots lets get him alone first bucks said make him hurt make him talk and if he doesnt tell me what i want to hear you can take as few or as many shots as you want buddy nicelooking guy the wart said reminds me of the jocks who treated me like a nothing in high school guy like him i usually take special care of the face dead or not you ever see whats left of a face after you hook a gun along the gumline and fire through the lip see youve got a goal so embrace your goals say them each morning like a prayer chad channing intoned from the tape make meeting your goals not simply your challenge but your bliss turn that crap off the wart said its working my last nerve bucks could smell the five million feel it in his hands not just money sudden power now so close eve and this bastard had hidden it and if his luck was sweet the guy was driving to get it right now that thought that thought was golden this was his reprieve oh please yes he said as whit turned onto richmond yes buddy take me right to bliss mackay and jerry smacks walked into the handsome lobby of the greystoke jerry muttering about taking the front door the valets nodded but gave them no special notice as a crowd of departing guests came out at the same moment mackay made a beeline for the lobby phones he didnt even glance at jerry as he picked up a phone you want to tell me the plan friend jerry said just play along you arent cutting me out of the action bud emily smiths room please mackay said into the phone very direct approach jerry said ms smith mackay said after a moment hello paul sent me the tall young man who just left hes here with us now we have him you understand me there was a pause you have two minutes to come down to the lobby weve taken him away in a car mackay kept his voice low and friendly you are not to make a scene you are not to scream or do anything other than what i tell you to do or your young man pays the price do you understand me you have a minute and fifty seconds now ill see you momentarily he hung up cool said jerry smacks i like your efficiency follow my lead and dont get in the way mackay said jerry pasted a smile on like mackays quiet and friendly and the two men went to the elevator bank there were five elevators mackay studied the numbers two young asian women pushed the up button an elevator arrived empty they boarded and held the door for mackay and jerry thanks waiting for a friend jerry said the elevator shut a minute left mackay said well see how much this guy matters to her eve replaced the phone in the cradle how how could they have found her how could they have grabbed whit they called her ms smith they knew about the credit card they had her son she dialed whits cell phone her fingers shaking expecting there to be no answer or worse the cool steel of bucks voice yeah whit answered after two rings calm she nearly collapsed in relief a man just called said they snatched you no one has me im driving i have two minutes to get to the lobby or they say theyll kill you get out get out now how theyre in the lobby eve tried to keep her voice calm but the urge to run surged in her bones find another way im heading back to the hotel whit said no its a trap dont risk it get the hell out mom come to the back of the hotel ill pick you up there dont risk it ill call you where to come get me dont come back here stay calm im coming head for the back he said she hung up the phone she left the small bag shed packed grabbed her purse checked her gun inside closed her hand around it the cd with pauls files on it was in there too whit had left nothing valuable in the room she put on the wig hat and glasses shed used checking in she opened the door peered down the hall nothing but empty hallway with an abandoned roomservice tray a couple of doors down the soft buzz of a basketball game played on a television a room away she ran for the elevators pressed a down button mackay said her two minutes are up give her one more jerry smacks said hardly man mackay said go get the car bring it around fast were leaving in a hurry jerry left and mackay watched the lights above the elevator watching for each elevator to make its inevitable drop to the lobby letting out couples an elderly woman a teenage girl then one car stopped at two mackay headed for the middle of the lobby watching the stairs exit waiting to see if shed come out gambling to herself he wouldnt grab her with other witnesses in the lobby another minute passed mackay bolted for the front door on the second floor eve ran past the hotels conference center past a spa and an exercise room past a set of meeting rooms named after famous texas artists dead and living the ney the umlauf the kohler laughter bubbled behind doors people who didnt have a lifeordeath care in the world a stairway led to the pool and she hurried down it she called whit on her cell im heading to the back of the hotel im on my way he said stay on the phone she said the pool was empty but in the saturday afternoon sun a couple of women in their forties sat at a table sipping coffee and chatting quietly a waiter set a twotiered tray of cakes between the women eve walked past them there was no gate opening to the back of the hotel but she spotted a service entrance leading to the kitchen dinner prep work was under way a couple of men in chefs clothes glancing up at her as she rushed past their chopping and dicing excuse me maam one started and she ignored him heading for the red glow of an exit sign hey the chef yelled again petulant as a toddler you cant barge in here she turned back to the chef put the phone down for a second my ex is in the lobby i have a restraining order against him excuse me the chef started to apologize conciliation in his voice but she didnt wait she hit the door a hallway another exit sign at the end she ran through that door into the cloudbroken light of houston winter the narrow lot behind the hotel empty except for valet slots lining the back lot the hum of traffic from like a ghost whispering in her ear next to the lot sat an office building a squat crystal of green glass ten stories high and beyond it a concrete parking garage deserted on a saturday then an italian restaurant with a gargantuan neon sign then a steakhouse both lots a third full and then the cadillac wheeled around the back of the lot thundering for her eve turned and ran skimming the back of the hotel aiming for a loading bay at the far corner of the hotel she jammed her hand deep in her purse closed her fingers around her beretta she turned to fire but the car was now seven feet behind her slamming brakes and she went across the hood the windshield the air in her lungs whooshing out with a gasp she fell off the caddy the asphalt biting into her face and palms a car door creaked open by her head nice braking man a voice above her said jamaican accent she scrabbled to her feet her ribs her legs thrummed as if on fire her gun and phone were gone dropped eve michaels the jamaican said he smashed a pistol across her head she hit the pavement again blood trickling along her cheek the jamaican picked her up handcuffed her shoved her in the car what the hell are you doing a gravelly male voice not jamaican yelled waste her and lets then the distinctive double pop of a silencer eve waited to draw breath wondering if the passing from life to death was truly so instant and painless that you didnt realize it had happened but she still needed to breathe she did a car door popped open and she heard the dull thud of dead weight hitting the pavement then the car started she risked a glance upward the jamaican in the drivers seat leveled her own gun at her eve he said you see how it is that guy wanted to hurt you i killed him makes me your friend she put her head down on the backseat if she raised her head whit might see her he would be heading back to the hotel hed chase them get himself killed stupid kid just let him go stay down and keep him out of it do the right thing for once in your life ellie she thought of him as a baby her easiest because he was the last and she was too tired to worry about every little cough or scrape she sure hadnt wanted another but here he came her best the only person ever in her life to truly come looking for her like she mattered here are the rules the jamaican said as he made two sharp turns to the right ignoring car horns pealing behind him heading onto westheimer then onto the frontage road of loop you stay down you get up i shoot off a finger get up again i shoot off a tit clear clear she said thickly her head hurt like itd been cut open and the brains rearranged i wont make trouble good call hey you want a stick of gum lots of spare spearmint up here the jamaican gave a little laugh eve closed her eyes let me go whit let me go baby whit spun goochs van in a screeching uturn back toward the hotel a ford truck a lexus a blazer and a jag passed him and in his rearview the jag spun following him again and he spotted the license plate bleev bucks so much for a separate peace whit floored the van down westheimer dodging around slowermoving cars cars honked at him and in the rearview mirror the jag closed on him two men in it bucks driving a guy he didnt know who looked like an accountant balding glasses caught between the wolves hunting his mother at the hotel and bucks lose them first tell eve where to meet him or grab eve then try and lose them the wrong choice could mean death in less than a minute on the phone he heard his mother scream he headed for the hotel the steering wheel in a death grip ten seconds twenty thirty veering hard around a truck whit tore into the porte cochere at the greystoke hotel at thirty miles an hour he sent one valet diving for safety whit nearly clipped a porsche roadster smashed an ornate potted fern spraying the fragments across the flagstones screams and angry yells echoed behind him he sped around the hotels corner then around it again into the back lot the jag hadnt pulled in after him waiting for him to pull out or blocking the exit around the other side of the hotel a body lay before him in the parking lot oh god no he thought but it was a man not his mother and he pulled up and leaned out to look a man he didnt know two daubs of blood on his forehead eyes wide and staring mouth open a grayish wad of gum on the lips like a withered tongue his mothers red phone a foot from the guy the screen broken and battered the hat shed worn atop her wig next to it he opened his door scooped up her phone and hat stood by the car for a tense eternity eve he yelled eve then mom nothing him parked by a dead man anyone could come around in a minute and see him with the corpse he got back in the van and waited thirty seconds passed she wasnt here the jag edged around the building now behind him no choice he floored the van swerved onto the narrow alley feeder that led back onto westheimer nearly sideswiping a parked truck driving past the turnin for the valet parking the jag revving hard now near enough to ram him pings sounded against the vans back door and his drivers side mirror broke shooting at him he couldnt outrun them not in the van whit ripped through a red light barely missing an old chevy pickup and rocketed up the entrance ramp onto loop the vast highway that circled the heart of houston in the rearview mirror a man the bookish one leaned out of the jags passenger window and emptied a rifle toward whit the cars around him braking and peeling away drivers suddenly caught in a war zone whit jerked as though he were hit and the jag slowed a pickup truck and a lexus suv arced away from him slamming into each other spinning barely holding onto the road a cavaliers driver standing on his brakes rearending the lexus cars stopped trying to pull over out of harms way other drivers scrambling past them not knowing about the battle in the lanes ahead then whit saw a patch of empty lane spun the wheel with all his strength prayed the van wouldnt roll the van turned degrees the burnt smell of smoking rubber and strained engine thickening the air he was now facing against traffic on a houston highway a suicide drive and he slammed his foot on the accelerator straight at the jag stopped by the other collisions he saw bucks face the mouth working in shock saying you crazy motherfucker the bookish guy opened his mouth in a scream ducked back into the car struggling to pull the rifle through the window whit stopped by the drivers side had his gun out and aimed at bucks head where is she he screamed tell me or ill kill you bucks wriggled trying to get out of the line of fire and whit thought shoot him but he didnt a car missed the van by inches and he would die if he sat here more traffic coming over the rise from out of bellaire a bullet tore into the trim above whits head bucks firing wild at the bad angle through the open window emptying the clip whit floored the van vrooming into sparse oncoming traffic that hadnt slowed horns wailing he yanked the wheel and suddenly he was on the grassy slide down to the frontage road at seventy miles an hour hurtling downward into traffic his head slamming against the roof the van barely holding its wheels to the grass he swerved to move in the direction of traffic roared down the frontage he tapped his brakes at the red light at san felipe barreled over the curb smacked through ornamental oleanders trimming the parking lot at a small shopping center and drove back into the treelined quiet of river oaks no sign of the jag in pursuit he slowed his speed to the limit checked the rearview mirror again and again and again perhaps hed been lucky and an eighteenwheeler loaded with explosives had plowed into them sitting on the highway like a scene out of an overwrought action movie or maybe whit didnt matter now they had eve so they thought they would soon have the cash they had gooch and odds were bucks had the money whit had nothing nothing at all he could go home he felt dead it was over insane insane of him to try and help her he should have simply taken her to the police turned her over talked her into it now he had nearly killed a man put innocent lives at risk he picked up his cell phone forced himself to take a steadying breath blinked dialed hello frank can you talk whit said not at the moment ill call you back in ten minutes and he hung up whit drove back to charlies house sticking to side roads hoping that the shotout mirror and any bullet holes in the van werent attracting attention he pulled into charlies empty driveway sat and waited the phone rang yes whit said its frank sorry i was dropping mary pat off at the airport for paul meet me at charlies house whats wrong get here he clicked off the phone put his head down on the steering wheel frank arrived about twenty minutes later pulling up in the driveway behind whit whit got out thinking what do you know have they called you have i made a terrible mistake in trusting you they got eve he told frank what happened they knew where we were the hotel we hid at oh god no frank put a hand over his mouth they knew where we were frank heard the accusation in his voice i didnt know where you were whit grabbed franks shirt pushed him against the van eve didnt tell you i swear to god no if id betrayed you whit i sure as hell wouldnt show up to help you now that was true the bellinis must have picked up their trail in another way where will they take her probably the house here on lazy lane with gooch his voice shook i cant believe they havent called me to tell me they got her you sure they havent whit said they havent im on your side whit frank was his best hope this glorified lounge singer go back to the bellinis see if they bring her there then call me calling you may be difficult if shes alive theyll want me to talk with her to reason with her i cant leave her to their mercies me being there might keep them from torturing her worse or killing her frank went ashen frank help me please youre her kid arent you frank held whits shoulders youre not a regular wiseguy or hired thug yes im her son i knew it i knew i saw a strong resemblance man i didnt even know she had a kid frank shook his head looked at whit like hed never seen him before gave him a hard hug we hadnt seen each other in thirty years whit said into franks shoulder oh god i never knew whit stepped back from frank what about gooch now that paul has her his value is nothing they dont need him no no whit theyre gonna kill her its practically guaranteed your friend too leave town whit said nothing did you hear me theres nothing you can do go home and pray they dont come looking for you they can be animals whits eyes felt hot no there had to be a way he slowed his breathing tried to imagine a way through the maze he needed a bargaining chip or a weapon go back to the house whit said ill call you as soon as i can and frank turned and hurried back to his bmw as though relieved suddenly to be on his way back to the bellini fold he hadnt asked if whit would call the police he had to be afraid of that but he got a bonus point for not asking whit watched him drive away whit stumbled into the house reached for his cell phone the police call them tell them everything claudia would help him the phone rang in his hand frank probably calling back now really worried whit was calling the cops he said yes you drive better than you bluff kiko graces voice how would kiko know whit closed his eyes what you got bucks to switch sides im a persuasive man kiko said you have eve yes like i told you we dont have the money she cant help you please dont hurt her im not interested in your sob story kiko said im interested in the money now we can deal her for the money and dont tell me again you dont have it i dont believe you you say those words again i jam a gun up her old ass and pump a couple of rounds better than fiber say anything to buy time fine ill bring you the money dont hurt her now were cooking now were smoking it will take me time to get it we didnt hide it all in one place wise of you you tell bucks to call off any more killers he has working for you or for paul pauls plans are none of my business kiko said he got more problems than plans anyway so pauls out of it its just between you and me now far as im concerned ill bring you the money whit said panic rising in his throat tomorrow bargaining for more time anything he could get no tonight he knew he couldnt back up further fine be five million poorer youre not in a situation to make demands kiko said i have what you want and so do i kiko said but im not an unreasonable man tomorrow at sunset whit said at the mecom fountain on main street you come alone you bring eve ill bring the money mecom fountain was about as public a spot as you could get in houston on main street in a traffic circle that was constantly busy between the montrose arts district and hermann park no pick another place then ill count the money myself whit said ill buy eve nice flowers for her funeral but ill have the money not you kiko was silent all right whit could hear the tinge of greed in his voice ill send my associate jose with eve im not doing any more public appearances mr grace yeah watch out for bucks he turned on paul hell turn on you i appreciate the concern kiko said dont get cute and call the police i have friends on the force any word from them that my names been mentioned to anyone and eve dies you got it probably a bluff but he couldnt risk it i got it whit said kiko hung up without another word whit sat down at the kitchen table bluster he had nothing left but bluster this mess was of his making and he had nothing left but the kind of bluster he used to whip kids in juvie court into shape but bluster made the world go round some days whit went to charlies gun cabinet the source of one of charlies jokes when youve got clients like mine but the guns looked deadly serious rifles pistols an antique german gun from the turn of the nineteenth century wicked knives in handstitched leather sheaths whit opened the cabinet staring for a moment letting the life he knew slip away like a mere shadow swallowed in greater darkness he would be dead or different by sunset tomorrow the thought left him cold but suddenly less afraid he reached for the first gun whit wondered if this was what it felt like for his mother years ago abandoning one life for another he doesnt show for a meeting arturo gomez said he had a pleasant voice one that rang in his chest an actors tone he doesnt sound particularly cooperative does he need the serious encouragement an arrest warrant offers youre jumping the gun im concerned for judge mosleys safety claudia said im afraid hes in danger or hes blowing smoke up your butt gomez shuffled through a file claudia and vernetta westbrook sat on the other side of his desk at hpd headquarters frankly sir i dont like the tone youre taking claudia said whits not hiding anything he made an allegation to me one he said he couldnt prove but he wouldnt accuse another person lightly and its entirely unlike him to miss a meeting with me hes a professional gomez locked his gaze on her raised an eyebrow as if asking what more do you know never mind your friend art you got advil i dont even know this friend of claudias and hes given me a badass headache vernetta said trying to defuse the attention he pulled a bottle of aspirin from his desk pushed it to vernetta given what judge mosley told me claudia said will you question greg buckman on what grounds your tipster who cant make a simple meeting i need cause i need a boatload of cause before i approach anyone connected to the bellini family you have enough cause to question him claudia said hed taken a tone of speaking down to her and she suspected it wasnt his usual way of dealing with officers from other jurisdictions he wanted her on the defensive giving in to a rise and whit is a respected judge not a sleazy backalley informant gomez studied her chymes looking for mosleys mom right mosley wont come talk to you and instead points the finger at an energis exec which is synonymous with leper in houston so wheres the mom why hasnt your friend brought you around to meet this mother he said he hasnt found her yet he can find all these people who are supposedly connected to her like this greg buckman gomez said doesnt ring true and if you werent friends with this guy youd see that clearly perhaps the mom vernetta said doesnt want to be found gomez nodded because shes committed a double homicide say she didnt want to be found by her kid real bad weve acted like chyme was in the wrong place at the wrong time but it could have been he was the target and doyle got in the way harry was looking for eve michaels claudia said we dont know that she is whits mother sure i can bring in buckman or eve michaels theyre in with the bellinis they promptly shut up get a lawyer who starts prepping for another harassment lawsuit against hpd and we get nowhere so you do nothing surely not thats not what art is saying vernetta said diplomacy warming her words art checking into any connection between greg buckman and the alvarez family or with buckman or doyle and chyme might bear fruit or the bellini family claudia said or ms michaels i think its time to start looking hard for her since whit isnt having luck fine well start making inquiries gomez said get your friend in here or im going to tell the tv stations that im looking for a judge who may be withholding information on this case what do you think that will do to his career youd ruin him but tiptoe around the bellinis are you so afraid of another lawsuit claudia asked gomez shrugged afraid no aware yes if buckman killed doyle and chyme or if he knows who did we will absolutely bring him to justice but im a realist ms salazar i have to be that means anything connected to the bellinis is handled carefully and with thought so our asses are armored he glanced at vernetta we have found it very difficult to break into any information about the bellinis tommy bellini learned from his past we dont catch them committing crimes we dont find people willing to roll over on them if theyre still breaking the law they have been extremely careful its frustrating when we cant find a crack in the door to get a search warrant i dont envy you your job under these circumstances claudia said thank you if judge mosley doesnt feel safe gomez said we could provide him with protection if hell come in i dont know that hes in any danger but this behavior isnt like him is there another aspect to this case youre not telling me gomez said he found his mother and is protecting her it would be easy to admit what she believed to be true but she forced herself to be silent gomez and vernetta might believe a man would do anything to protect his mother lie kill they didnt know whit she did no she said detective salazar dont get a cute idea or two you have no jurisdiction here im absolutely aware of that she said absolutely is good gomez said remember it and live it they left and she drove vernetta home claudia vernetta said go home and i dont mean back to the luxury of the hampton inn whits in trouble im not leaving your friends not worth you getting involved in his extreme mess you could be a police chief one day not a hint of improper procedural behavior even as a private citizen can hang over your head vernetta said dont screw with your career you can always get a new friend she paused are you sleeping with this guy no claudia said weve been through a lot together hes a good guy the good ones are worth a certain amount of grief vernetta said but not beyond a certain amount she started to get out then shut the door again i can promise nothing to you understand that but the da would love to get the bellinis if he could if your friend has information but isnt coming forward because hes broken the law himself whit never would claudia said im just saying vernetta said we could talk immunity its not granted often and its solely the das decision no guarantees but it could be a starting point think about it vernetta got out shut the door and went to her house and claudia watched her go inside envying her certainty in always knowing what was exact and right greg buckman if gomez was reluctant to act she wasnt life was a series of choices and the best choices you made were to help the people you cared about claudia made her choice she pulled out into traffic the beginnings of a plan forming in her mind what do you mean you dont have them paul screamed into his phone i mean we dont have them they got away bucks paused and eve shot jerry smacks left him dead in the hotels back lot bucks let the lie settle in let paul sweat under the weight of everything crashing and burning for a change gonna bring big heat if the cops connect jerry to us not to mention we barely got off the highway alive how could you not have them paul demanded bucks wondered for a second why did i pick you for a friend then he decided he hadnt picked paul paul had picked him because the weak were drawn to the strong thats what made leaders great chad channing had a whole tape about strength this isnt acceptable bucks paul said paul im real open to suggestions theyre gone its over theyve got you over a barrel you not we he wondered if paul would notice chad channing says you got to recognize destructive behaviors and cut your losses you know bucks fuck chad channing paul said fuck him and every tape he ever made call kiko i want a summit meeting were gonna strike a new deal you dont have a negotiating chip bucks said i have guns that can be placed at heads pauls voice rose at the edge of a scream call kiko get him here he can bring jose but thats all tell them ive got the money now you arent going to whack him i am i am its what dad wouldve done this is an extremely bad idea bucks said we kill jose to show we mean business we torture kiko he tells us where the cokes at then we kill his greaser ass and you bring his associates down on you like a nuclear bomb bucks said theyre in florida thats tomorrows problem all right bucks said ill set up a meeting with kiko at the club he wont be suspicious coming there well bring him back to the house and do it right bucks because right now youre the biggest single dumbass on the planet he hung up gooch was laid out on the bed in front of paul unconscious he roused slightly and paul turned up the frank polo tape somebody had left in the bedroom stereo letting baby youre my groove thunder down the hallway as he worked gooch over as though he were a punching bag face ribs stomach arms his knuckles hurt but that pop of flesh against flesh made him happy let out his tensions gooch seemed unconscious again doc brewer came in and very gently shook his head at paul he needs to wake up i got to talk to him paul said hes taken a bullet in the back of the head there aint no hole how bad hurt could he be brewer gave gooch another injection checked the mans eyes breathing you want him to give you information then let him recover enough to talk beating him is making things worse whatd you give him my own home brew of coolyoudowns do you need a little shot paul smack give him some smack or something to hype him up hard a big dose i want him talking i want his fucking mouth running away from him leave him alone paul please for a minute let him recover pauls fists hurt but he still popped doc brewer a hard one the doctor fell to the floor stimulants get him conscious and talking now or i just start mixing shit in your bag and jabbing a needle in your old ass paul tasha said behind him she turned down the frank tape that was playing helped doc brewer to his feet let the doctor do his work gooch cant tell you anything valuable right now come downstairs with me let me calm you with a little massage sweetpea bucks clicked off the phone he stayed still on the couch watching kiko and joses amused expressions hating them as much as he hated paul hes having a bad day bucks said he wants to kill you at a meeting his days gonna get way worse jose said tell him the deals off kiko jerked his head at jose go get that bitch talking jose got up without a word headed back to the bedroom bucks didnt like to hear screams or begging it made him remember his friends briefly pleading for their lives in the little house in galveston unpleasant i got to settle with mackay bucks said give a bonus to the wart too so hell keep his mouth shut and wont go work for paul smart move you made kiko said can this mackay be trusted he could have run to paul when i told him i wanted his help to grab eve not kill her or turn her over to paul he didnt i didnt cut a deal with the wart but he seems cool as long as he gets paid for his efforts kiko slid him a thin brick of cash well give em a bonus when she spills about the money they did good work another thousand for each bucks reached for the money kiko covered it with his hand bucks you picked sides ours dont forget that i wont if she talks you want to know where the money is dont you kiko said yes that money kiko said really isnt your concern any more dont worry youre gonna get a nice little cut great kiko thank you bucks cleared his throat the film of me and my friends um ive done what you asked give me the film you promised please he hated himself for adding on that desperate word but he did after we have the money that was the deal kiko gave a little smile waved bucks away with his fingers you dont want to change the deal do you that wouldnt be fair bucks nodded fighting the red rising in his cheeks he wasnt quite out the door when eve let out her first scream and he closed it fast behind him you sure you want to hit kiko tasha asked yeah paul rose from the bed paced around the room worked his shoulders loose yeah forget this peacefulcoexistence crap she curled her legs under her rear paul yeah im proud of you tasha said now youre big and bad come here she shrugged out of her top unfastened her bra his breath caught his lips parted at the sight of her breasts come be big and bad with me he joined her on the bed eased her out of the rest of her clothes she let him take her savored the vigorous calculated pistoning of him inside her made a memory all else aside he was an awesome lay and those were rare in this crowd and she knew it would probably be the last time between them she came with surprising intensity crying out against his throat he didnt relent full of testosterone and blustering confidence this mornings tears forgotten she came again a few minutes later and then he did with an eager gasp and lay down next to her his head nuzzling her breasts his hand cupped over the firmness of her belly groaning the usual about how hot she was how good she felt paul paul she murmured he kissed her with real tenderness on her throat her eyelids love you paul said oh dont she said teasing him plus she knew he didnt really he was saying what he thought she wanted to hear because he didnt know her and because he was scared and frightened more than he would admit and he needed to feel loved the word was a bribe shyly offered she ran a finger alongside his jaw ticklegentle like she really cared about him you love too quick babe i know he said she sighed curled into his chest loving fast can be a curse they lay together breathing each others breath and then he got up and started the shower she knew he liked them long and hot with a blast of skinprickling cold at the end she pretended to drowse and counted to twenty then pulled on her panties and tshirt and snuck downstairs terry verdine one of pauls men stood guard out in the yard max and gary sat in the kitchen watching cable and sipping coffee she ducked into the room where tommy bellini lay in his stupor a camouflaging hum of the monitoring equipment thrummed and tasha hunkered down behind the bed she pulled her cell phone out of her pocket and dialed it needs to be tonight she said when the phone was answered she listened for a moment laughed softly then stood up clicked off the phone tasha strong patted tommy bellinis wasted legs no dances for you sugar pot sorry she hurried back upstairs paul was still wasting hot water in the shower she stretched out on the bed waiting for him to be done paul was out of the shower and toweling when his cell phone rang tasha handed it to him he didnt say thank you yeah he said hello paul this is whit eves friend i want gooch ready to travel at ten this evening you will drive him to lanceys grille on buffalo youll let him off in the lot and then drive away really paul toweled off his arms his waist tossed the towel on the floor glanced at tasha like he expected her to pick it up whereas my money asshole kiko has it whit said he took it from us youre lying he grabbed the money from our room at the greystoke hotel eve and i got away no he would have killed you clearly he didnt so hes got the drugs and the cash and he doesnt need you youre lying why the hell would you warn me because i want my friend back ill give you eve in exchange for gooch paul stopped dead say what youre such a dumbass whit said kiko has the drugs he has the money he doesnt need you at all but eve she originally stole the money for kiko she was working for him she turned on him went on the run i didnt know it she doublecrossed me but she doesnt know i know so ill trade you her for gooch i want out of this war man okay i dont want you coming after me i give her to you then were settled you understand ill settle it now do you want to hear your friend die paul yelled because im getting my gun right now eve can help you get your money back and more she knows plenty on kiko she could put his ass in jail if you treat her right trust a traitor how do i know any of this is true decide for yourself this is a limitedtime offer a beat passed ill be there one more thing whit said we have your financial data on a cd i got when i ran into your girlfriend tasha at eves house data that could slice and dice you that can show just how your legit operations tidy up the money from your drug deals kiko didnt get the cd when he got the cash a pause but if you dont show up or youve killed gooch then kiko gets a copy the das office gets a copy kiko and the da knowing all your secrets either way youre deeply soundly thoroughly laid open for everyone to see do we understand each other paul stared at tasha i understand you come alone you come unarmed we make the exchange and we both leave any deviation from that and the data goes to the da lanceys grille you and gooch no one else ill have hardass backup man so dont screw with me whit hung up paul clicked off the phone he grabbed tashas arm hard explain yourself right now what sweetpea eves partner whit he says he got computer files from you stuff you took off eves laptop he wants to trade them for gooch alive or he sends the files to the police she shook her head no sweetie he was there to bug the place with voice recorders we told you that bucks and max found where hed bugged the rooms i didnt see him take anything off her computer bucks and i looked at her computer together wasnt anything off or on that shouldnt be there and bucks cleaned the system whits bluffing hes got to be youre lying to me tasha he gave a broken little laugh no im not paul these people are trying to hurt you im on your side hes trying to get you riled force you into a mistake paul pushed her toward the door get max and gary tell them to bring gooch and a highpowered rifle youre coming too we all gonna have a long chat with eve and her buddy im gonna get the chain out kill this guy and gooch once i get eve then im gonna have a real real long chat with bucks tasha nodded whatever you say sweetpea whatever you say the parking lot was dark the shopping center a fancy one that had skidded on hard times was lshaped lanceys grille closed now was a cafe that served breakfast and lunch nestled at the lonely end of the l with a long service road to its left traffic from buffalo speedway a busier road didnt have a clear view of the front of the cafe the rest of the stores were closed and quiet the glow from the light poles giving off soft pools against the oily asphalt at the opposite corner stood a small stone church with a wide dark parking lot and across from it a new townhouse development was under construction earth turned open like a grave around newly poured foundations in the shadows of the serviceway behind the restaurant whit waited four minutes and then paul was due and whit expected he would arrive on time he had told the lie he thought most likely to convince paul trying to knit together the facts that he knew with an informed guess that bucks must have made some explanation to paul as to why the capture of eve failed his gun one of charlies weighed like a tireiron in his hand he had never shot a person before had not particularly enjoyed deer or quail hunting with his brothers didnt thrill at the pull of the trigger and the bark of the bullet but he was going to shoot paul bellini whit would shoot paul in the knees when he had to as soon as paul knew there was no eve to trade knees were small targets chests were so much bigger the thought made him sick and he shook it off talking tough on the phone had felt like playacting but this was real he had to do it for gooch headlights turned into the parking lot a porsche slowly moving toward the restaurants front parking at the edge of the glow thrown off by the mercury lights two cars went by on buffalo and then the streets were empty for a moment whit tucked the gun into the back of his pants the door opened paul bellini stepped out from the drivers side left the door open kept his hands down by his side he wore a heavy leather jacket thickarmed put your hands on your head whit called paul didnt raise his hands this is an exchange not a surrender whit stepped out from the dark wheres gooch hes in the trunk open the trunk and bring him out slow down wheres eve in my van get her out here paul took a step forward they stood ten feet away from each other the dim light flat against the asphalt paul more in the light whit on the edge of the dark this is how it works whit said i give you the keys to the van eve is inside you give me the keys to the porsche i drive off you drive off im not trading a porsche for your shitass van paul said youre a real longtermvision guy arent you ill get gooch out dump the car and call you to tell you where your cars at okay the weight of the gun pressed against the back of his pants sure that paul had a gun under that leather coat wondering am i fast enough to fire before be can figuring the math of death dizzy but not exactly afraid paul surprised him with a little laugh too calm for this sure you will i dont want your car you dumbass fine bring me the keys then buddy paul gestured at whit with his fingertips whit took one step forward walking into the light by the way whit said the same files i got from tasha after she copied eves hard drive theyre attached to an email message outlining your activities addressed to the das office and to the police its scheduled to go out in an hour with all those files attached if im not there to delete that message it mails so you kill me youre still screwed do you understand me perfectly paul said youre a clever bastard you want a job weve got different work styles how do i know you wont send the files anyway trust me trust you im trusting that gooch isnt dead in that trunk whit said im trusting the same about eve across the street in the darkened church lot a gentle little pop sounded like a door clicking shut then another paul started to glance over his shoulder then didnt what was that whit said the sound of me trusting you here are the keys paul said he tossed them carefully to whit who caught them onehanded go whit tossed the van keys to paul now we each turn around and walk away deciding he could open the trunk with the remote be sure gooch was okay then drive off fast he wouldnt have to shoot paul he could outrun him in the porsche whit stepped into the cool pool of the light he heard clinking saw a glint in pauls hand an end of a chain was there thicklinked paul pulling it free from his jackets sleeve and running forward whit reaching for his gun the heavy end of the chain was already swinging toward his face and whit fell back onto pavement his gun under him the chain whirled arcing above whit the light showing pauls face twisted in triumph whit raised his arms to shield himself paul bellinis head blossomed in red the crack of the rifle shot echoed against the brick walls and paul fell the strings of life cut then silence except for the chain falling across whit clanking against the concrete whit scrabbled to his feet he couldnt risk leaving gooch in that porsche trunk he had to know he ran to the sports car he still had pauls keys in his hand a shot roared again the bullet whistling behind his head he hunkered low on the concrete crabcrawled into the porsche a bullet slammed against the cars side he was aware he was driving off in a murdered mans car leaving a van behind that was registered in goochs name the night had taken a horrible left turn he started the car blasted out of the lot the porsches wheel cool and clean and responsive under his hand god please let gooch be inside he didnt hear the sound of another shot whit tore down the service road back around the building barreling out onto buffalo he turned at the service road that ran parallel to highway shot down to shepherd finally pulling into a closed catholic school clicking open the trunk door gooch lay inside his face a collage of purple sluggish tied up but breathing he had gooch but the situation had gotten a thousand times worse tasha watched the porsche rocket away gary lay dead at her feet the scorch hole in his temple from the cellphone gun black like a burn max was next to him a similar little gap in the back of his neck still smoking she left the rifle on the asphalt straightened the latex gloves shed hidden in her purse earlier got in the mustang max had driven them over in and started up the engine she could see pauls body on the pavement face down as she drove past too bad really born in the wrong family born in a decent family he mightve made his looks his ambition work for him shed miss the sex hed been good at that but that punching and crying crap worked her nerves thank god that was over no need to go check whits van she knew eve michaels wasnt in there anyway whit mosley was a liar tasha strong drove off into the night humming a little smiling at her dream unfolding youre screwing up claudia told herself she waited in her car outside the gated compound at greg buckmans address at alabama it was shortly after eleven on saturday night and she heard the soft strains of a party laughter a thumping bass beat the clink of bottles because you go down this route youre putting your career at stake the file in her lap told her all she could learn in short order about greg buckman his credit history excellent his income over two hundred thousand a year or so ago but less than thirty thousand reported to the irs last year his family two parents who lived in little rock one sister all delivered courtesy of barbara zachary harry chymes assistant who didnt need to be asked twice when claudia said i got a lead on a guy who may have info about harrys death but needs pressuring to make him talk can you dig on him and barbara dialing and typing like an avenging angel working the keyboards internet databases and phones with a singular purpose faxed pages to claudias motel with rapidfire response she scanned through the credit pages again no charges to his visa or his amex for anything other than restaurants bars and a surprising wave of charges to bookstores both brick and online he must be a voracious reader most criminals werent but then maybe he wasnt what whit thought he was the grabber of course was his drop in income hed made a fortune at energis but that money and the chance to earn a high salary in the corporate world had evaporated in the wave of shareholder lawsuits he claimed on his last tax return to run a consulting company but she wondered how eager companies were to hire an exec tarred with the filth of the energis brush the company nationally had been reduced to a joke a catchphrase for greed and malfeasance no matter that thousands of honest workers had toiled there with good intentions newspaper clipping next and her mouth went dry three energis employees vanished a few weeks before the story broke about the companys shady accounting and deals greg buckman named as their supervisor and friend was quoted in the story were deeply concerned these are terrific goaloriented individuals and they and their families are in our prayers our candlelight vigil for their safe return will be held in our headquarters lobby at seven this evening goaloriented odd praise a followup clipping on the case didnt quote buckman but relayed that the three bodies and their car had been found driven into a remote part of galveston bay more clippings on energis buckman was senior management in an energytrading division that was part of the massive accounting scandal no criminal charges filed against him but his name was mentioned frequently enough that a long shade of suspicion settled on him and hed lost a fortune in the civil lawsuits this past crime his reputation smeared at energis was a doorway to him she had known whit mosley most of her life had gotten much closer to him when he became justice of the peace and they started working together but she had never heard him speak in the strained voice with which he had spoken to her he was clearly involved beyond the scope of the law in over his head she guessed and he had wanted her help earlier but not now either because he had crossed a line he shouldnt have or he wanted to keep her out of danger she hoped it was the latter claudia closed her eyes say whit found his mother she works with a crime ring she wanted nothing to do with whit and the crime ring came after whit to scare him off but why wouldnt he call the police then because he didnt want his mother implicated whit wouldnt stand there and take abuse so a different angle say his mother wanted to be with whit aimed to leave her life of crime her colleagues in the ring didnt want her walking away she knew too much or they found out whit was a judge and it made them nervous this new family connection to law and order so they came after whit and his mom but again why wouldnt whit simply call the police because he did want to protect his mother but from prosecution bust the crime ring bust his mother it could be one and the same she dug in her purse for an aspirin dryswallowed it ignoring the bitter taste or worse whit and his mom knew who the killers were and were hiding but still in houston why what was to be gained by staying here the anchor had to be timely large and powerful information on the bellinis evidence to be retrieved money so what do i do now operating out of her jurisdiction was an entirely foreign concept to her a violation of common sense and professionalism shed never considered but whit changed everything hed always had that effect in her life the one friend who always made life seem a little edgy and funky and evernew the kind of friend youd keep a secret for to protect him if you had to claudia got out of her ancient honda accord walked along the gated entryway a car pulled up to her left and she stepped to where she could see the drivers fingers enter a code on the keypad it looked like she stood arms crossed like she was waiting for a friend to pick her up studying the far end of the street she waited until the car had driven in noticed that the crossbar fell almost immediately she got in her honda and drove up tried the code of didnt work she tried this time the cross bar creaked up and she quickly drove inside she nosed into a visitor parking space near the community pool she tucked her service revolver into her purse number twelve was buckmans a single dim light glowed a light left on in the kitchen she pressed an ear to the door the soft fuzzy murmur of television she rang the doorbell after a moment the door swung open a tall redheaded woman pretty wearing a tshirt that said topaz in glittery cursive the tshirt one size too tight loose jeans and a loose look in her eyes wine or beer or pot working its easy magic hi claudia said my name is claudia salazar im sorry to bother you so late in the evening but im a freelance writer doing a book on energis and im trying to get an appointment with greg buckman his numbers unlisted but a friend of his told me he lived here hes not here and he doesnt talk about energis the tall redhead said sorry she started to close the door hes been treated like garbage in the press i want to fix that claudia said the door stopped the redhead watching her people at certain levels at energis their reputations have been savaged they cant get real work again but they couldnt have all known about the accounting abuses because folks would have blown the whistle earlier right people like mr buckman were following orders he didnt really do anything wrong the redhead gave a slight nod surprised at this heartfelt monologue claudia let a beat pass i want to tell that story defend the people who got their reputations assassinated even though they never faced a criminal charge thats not the american way they need a forum to clear their names out of the goodness of your heart now the gaze wasnt so vacant a little smarter out of an interest in fair reporting the redhead studied her ill see if hes willing to call you are you his wife girlfriend she said with a smile im robin melvin dont misspell it in your book can you mention me in it my mama would absolutely die im sure you want greg to have options in his life again robin go to work for another energy company right command the respect and salary he had before yeah robin bit her lip thatd be nice a stab of guilt touched claudias heart for misleading robin but this seemed the shortest distance to the end could you and i talk now id like your insight on this how its affected you i can meet greg facetoface when he gets back make my case in person to him i know talking about energis is painful but my book might be a big help to him let me fire a shot in his defense robin considered well okay you and i can wait for him he should be home soon you want a glass of wine claudia nodded and stepped inside the townhome was highend one of the nicest claudia had ever seen but buckmans furnishings were sparse clean minimal but expensive a leather couch an entertainment system with more controls than a flight simulator a stack of dvds she glanced at the titles while robin melvin fetched the wine its a wonderful life mr smith goes to washington the sound of music greetingcard movies not what she had expected from a suspected killer a long line of books on a shelf all by chad channing the art of be sail through the goal posts of life i make me happen selfhelp tripe the books spines were all cracked and worn with handling robin brought massive goblets of chardonnay filled nearly to the brim already sipping from one oh those she said seeing claudia inspecting the books you can see how depressed hes been reading that junk it lifts him up she handed the wine to claudia a trickle sloshed onto claudias hand does it claudia asked its a comfort blanket robin said that guru whispering in his ear its like a conscienceforhire this is a very nice place whats he doing now to keep the mortgage paid robin shrugged sat down on the couch consulting bucks got friends who keep him busy a note of bitterness crept into her voice bucks thats what his friends call him not too many people call him greg claudia sat took a sip of wine unsure of what to do now robin in doing my research i understand there were three of bucks friends at the company who were murdered a few weeks before the energis story broke robin nodded horrible but a new wariness was in her eyes well im sure that must have been very upsetting for bucks did he ever say that anyone at energis was involved like had them whacked whacked not killed yeah claudia said whacked robin took a solid gulp of her wine those guys were his best friends at work bucks was crazy with worry i didnt really know him well then he and his friends frequented the place i work i knew them as really good customers after his friends died well i guess i felt tender toward bucks we started spending time together she stopped as though embarrassed about displaying this corner of her heart where do you work club topaz im a stripper claudia liked that robin said stripper not entertainer not exotic dancer but id like to finish college and sell real estate i like big houses she gave a little offkey laugh claudia played her first card see in my research ive found who would have wanted those guys dead and i dont want to scare you but bucks might be in danger robins eyes widened theres a crime ring in houston the bellinis they used to be mafia up north have you heard of them robin grew very still and claudia knew suddenly she had made a mistake but better to press on see it through the bellinis benefited from the energis doubleaccounting they unloaded a lot of stock in the weeks before the stock fell she made this up on the fly theyre not crooks robin insisted but the bellini family owned a lot of energis stock and so did lots of other people if you lived in houston you owned energis stock it sounded like a platitude that bucks had taught her bucks went to school with paul bellini i know paul hes a super nice guy hes not a crook his dad is or was my mother is a beautician robin said you see me styling hair bucks worked with the three guys who got killed and im wondering if he knew details that they knew but he doesnt know the informations dangerous you see he wouldnt necessarily know that the bellinis were involved in the deaths it was a neat little theory constructed out of nothing but she wondered if it would resonate with the young woman a complete lie that had a terrible recognizable possibility to it robin frowned the silence drawing out and then a key slid into the front door hes home robin said why dont you ask him they shot me up gooch said to keep me quiet then to get me talking my arms feel like stone right now and a while back i had a conversation with mahatma gandhi im pretty useless he opened his eyes for a moment closed them he lay on the couch in charlies house theres a spiderweb up there charlie needs to clean or am i hallucinating its a web whit said im not leaving you again you didnt leave me i got caught i was deeply moronic if it aint too much to ask could you check and see if i still have both my balls youre not missing anything but gooch had been beaten roughed up badly blood dried on his lips and ears and indigo bruises on his torso along the tender skin that shielded kidneys a horrible contusion marked the back of his head under the hair a hard knot his skin was clammy a connectthedots spiral of injection points along his arm and whits fear for him turned into a stonecold rage im taking you to a doctor whit said no what am i gonna say i got attacked by pharmacists gooch blinked im strong i can process it out man i got shot in the head sort of and im okay no whit said doctor now no gooch said info now then doctor he closed his eyes kiko has eve whit said bucks works for him now and someone else is on their side whoever killed paul gooch opened his eyes blinked once twice watched whit that could have been bucks he finds out about the meeting between us and bucks takes paul out and then bucks steps into command gooch said command of increasingly little so how do i get my mom back gooch we cant assume shes still alive whitman say she is gooch looked at him youre the brother i never had whit i love you man if that doesnt sound stupid youre a dopedup idiot ask yourself if its time to walk away gooch said in a quiet voice no kiko will find out eve doesnt know where the money is then hell kill her gooch said maybe whats left of the bellini ring and kikos people shoot it out kiko can find other buyers in houston given time or sell it himself this doesnt have a good ending i cant just let her die then we call the police we dont know where shes being held whit said even so do i save her so she can spend her life in prison for money laundering and god knows what else man straighten it out in your head gooch said you cant save her im taking you to a hospital you need to be checked forget it im serious gooch youre out of the game whit said im okay they could have pumped you full of clorox man in which case the blood froth would be a bad sign gooch sat up blinked ill be okay what do you want to do i want you to go back to port leo no way this isnt your fight whit said they kidnap me beat me drug me played frank polo music while they did it to drown out any screaming made it my fight more than yours gooch attempted a smile brace yourself whit said if you come with me youre gonna hear franks voice at least one more time kiko grace cut into the fat stack of pancakes shoveled them into his mouth and pointed the fork at eves untouched plate you dont have much appetite i guess he said shame this is genuine vermont maple syrup im dieting she said in a very quiet voice through her bruised and cut lips he chewed youre skinny already pancakes are good for the soul he glanced over at jose rinsing a skillet in the sink isnt that right jose comfort me with apples jose said for i am sick of love your boy willie s didnt say that kiko said thats in the bible you getting smarter every day boss jose said kiko pushed her plate of pancakes a little closer to eve come on its soft food jose made it special for you i dont want to eat with you eve said she was handcuffed by her left arm to the chair sitting up for the first time since they had brought her to the condo your loss these are awesome kiko dug back into the stack of blueberry pancakes apparently taking no offense that afternoon jose had come into the room they stashed her in gently climbed on top of her asked her where the money was she said she didnt know he produced a pair of pliers from a back pocket and asked her again she said she didnt know so he pried open her jaw worked the pliers onto a back tooth and tried to pull it out it broke and the pain lanced her jaw blinded her thoughts like hed poured in hot coals she screamed he put the shattered tooth in his pocket and asked again she begged told him she really didnt know her tongue probed at where the tooth had been he climbed back on her worked the pliers back in and she fought to keep from vomiting crack he broke another back tooth lacerating her gums she sobbed spraying saliva and blood and he thought she spat on him jose slammed the pliers into her jaw and mouth tearing her lips knocking out two side teeth she screamed that she still didnt know where it was then he hit her with his fist four deep blows and she blacked out she woke up to the awful sour taste of blood wretched pain in her jaw and the jagged stumps of teeth along her gums then jose had come in removed the handcuffs let her use the bathroom in privacy her jaw and face looked like shed gone nine rounds in a boxing ring he let her wash her face with a bar of lavender soap he had unwrapped from delicate paper the bar smelled wonderful and she nearly wept thinking of whit and him asking about the gardenia soap she used when he was little jose took her to kikos table blindfold off which she could not consider a good sign and pushed her down to eat the clock said it was close to eleven night held itself against the windows you know what i want kiko asked what she said watching him chew blueberry pancakes happy wife a cure for cancer marlins back in the world series kiko said no think big chicago jose said from the kitchen he wasnt eating but he stood at the counter drinking a glass of milk your mouth hurting kiko asked yes jose get the lady a pain pill kiko said jose brought her a pill a glass of water she palmed it and kiko said really its okay we arent going to poison you she swallowed the tablet the water hating herself for taking anything from him but god her mouth hurt bad i know a guy he really digs older ladies really kiko mopped a bit of pancake through the maple syrup hes got unresolved mother issues norman bateslevel nutzoid and thats a bitchin hardon that dont fade therapy cant make a dint in this badass you dont help me i give you to him actually i sell you to him he chewed sipped at coffee hell fuck you no less than a dozen times the first day everywhere then hell turn mean get out the knife we got these albanian bosses trying to move south from new york horn in one of em had a wife we grabbed her sold her to my friend let him have her for three days she lost the ability to speak i put a bullet in her head seemed the kind thing to do she said nothing she didnt want to shiver in front of him so eve when you took the money the bellinis came after you where did you put it kiko said i didnt take it she said over the years ive had plenty of opportunity to steal from the bellinis i didnt do it they seemed very sure you did eve took a careful breath play the hand right she thought and theyll see going after whit as a nogain theyll leave him alone she had not even had a chance to say goodbye the most logical choice is that bucks took the money and framed me why would bucks betray paul kiko asked almost idly for five million reasons she said but you see eve i had an arrangement with bucks he said he was supposed to steal the money for me the moneys gone but it sure aint in my pocket she watched jose inspecting a hand juicer he made her nervous futzing in the kitchen like an old woman so bucks betrayed both you and paul kiko shook his head he was highly motivated not to screw me over eve he said in fact he would be an idiot if he screwed me over i know you dont like him but do you think hes stupid i suspect hes a hell of a lot smarter than you mr grace kiko laughed whos your partner bucks says his name is whitman mosley that his real name no she said after a moment its a fake name two of his english professors in college the answer sounded inspired a slowness crept into her limbs the pain pill starting to kick in fast and sweet whats his real name where is he since i didnt take the money neither did he he was trying to help me prove bucks took it leave him alone kiko leaned over and stabbed her with the syrupsticky fork deep in the meaty part of her arm she screamed as the dull tines drove into her flesh quit lying he offered to trade the money for you made the appointment so wheres the money now his voice was soft she turned to jose he was drying the juicer with a dishtowel looking bored whit doesnt have it blood dribbled down her arm the fork hung from her flesh he leaned over and shook the fork and agony bolted up her arm searing every nerve worming into her bones she screamed again nearly fell from the chair jose moved in behind her pushed her into kikos reach wheres the money kiko asked again she said nothing i used the fork he said i still have a knife he held it up smeared with butter and a loose rope of syrup you want to meet my personal norman bates hell be on the first flight from miami if i fedex your picture and your panties to him she closed her eyes oddly she thought of the small close air of that montana motel room thirty years ago the whiskeyandhamburger smell of james powell his idle threat against her children the way the gun snuggled into his mouth like it was meant to fit there dark against the white of his teeth the heady little rush of righteousness that soared into her heart when she pulled the trigger and she thought i deserve whatever i get she spat in his face he slapped her and the blast of pain against her savaged mouth nearly made her pass out let bucks rob you blind she gasped with that money he can hire enough muscle to send you back to miami with your tail between your legs kiko thumped the end of the fork she tried not to wet herself i got serious dirt on him eve proof hes a murderer and hes scared to death of me sending it to the police so youre lying mosleys got the cash and youre shielding him she gritted her teeth with that money bucks can put a bigass contract on you one you cant escape from kiko tilted his head studied her with a halfsmile i heard you were smart once shame to lose the edge aint it he stood pulled the fork from her arm skin and flesh gave way blood bubbled from her skin same question this time i want an actual answer he grabbed the back of her head brought the fork close to her eye one of the tines dug into her eyes corner she had gone down the wrong road in blaming bucks kiko wasnt rattled dumb thinking done fast she wished she could suck the words back in turn back time five minutes he would never leave whit alone but then kiko looking up past her shoulder saying no need man going slow yields more and then three pops in rapid succession three red eyes opening on kikos forehead the hair and flesh shearing away from the skull kiko toppling backward against and then off his chair jose stepped around her a pistol in his hand a silencer screwed on the barrel he prodded kiko with a foot is the chair empty is the sword unswayd is the king dead he said i would say eve the king is pretty fucking dead eve swallowed against a tide of bile in her mouth waited for him to raise the gun to her dont i get a thankyou jose said oh my god she said you killed him it was a choice jose said you ever do that eve weigh your choices he waited for an answer yes she managed to say even for decisive people its difficult jose went to the kitchen got a firstaid kit grabbed a dispenser of antiseptic soap he came back set the gun back in his shoulder holster and started to clean the fork wound on her arm she sat perfectly still now jose said im doing big serious weighing right now i can either believe you or bucks you know the whole infrastructure of the bellini operations thats valuable information i think ill believe you she continued to stare glanced at kiko syrup still on his lips the beauty mark by his mouth all bloodied distorted wideeyed surprise on what was left of his face is everyone turning on their bosses these days she managed to say i did it because he was a drugdealing animal and im a good citizen consider it a public service he laughed softly bandaged her arm taped it lowered her sleeve back over the dressing thatll do for now but i dont know where the money is i know you dont jose said i believe you sorry about the teeth but i did the least i could for him to know you got worked over proper we have a dentist we can probably get you if you behave she stared at him im interested in a lot more than five million jose said you know how much drug money is laundered in this country each year she shook her head jose smiled gave a little canary chirp of a laugh he tapped her forehead once twice gently almost with respect so you dont know the numbers but i bet you can help us find a big percentage of it cant you what you know all the tricks of the trade dont you eve how to clean it hide it youre a numberrattling little genius jose gave her a smile youre key to what i need she was going to live then at least a little bit longer ill do whatever you want me to just leave whit mosley alone please she hated herself for asking but she had to she had to first things first jose pulled her to her feet lets finish the nights work okay greg buckman wasnt what claudia expected he looked like a stockbroker trim but muscular averagehandsome with ruddy cheeks hair thinning early he wore a white buttondown that had gotten dirty in the course of the day wrinkled suit pants an oldschool rep tie loosened a tie on saturday she thought he looked like a young exec fresh from a onemartinitoomany happy hour a little bleary tired and sour and he had a nasty black eye this was the man whit thought killed harry the man with bucks had a caribbean accent spicing his hello to robin dreadlocks neatened back with a red embroidered band dressed in faded jeans white tshirt and a leather jacket but he wore a back holster that claudia spotted the moment he came through the door the man stayed by the door not quite like a guard but like a friend bored and ready to go find excitement waiting on his buddy whos this bucks said to robin staring at claudia no hello honey how are you or hi im greg shes a writer shes working on a book about energis robin said but defending the guys like you claudia stood offered a hand bucks didnt take it im claudia salazar lady i dont talk about my former employer at all please go she lowered her hand i can help salvage your reputation mr buckman he gave a sharp little laugh i didnt know it needed fixing im asking you to leave nicely youre trespassing robin invited me in please go my research assistant died earlier this week claudia said second card to play the one she was afraid of to throw him off entirely if he knew anything about harrys death his name was harry chyme he was helping me with research on energis execs he got shot in an insurance office near the port bucks touched his temple as though a migraine were blossoming what part of go did you not get youre in danger she decided to try the approach shed tried with robin harry was tracking information on three energis employees killed last year i understand they worked for you see how he handled a curveball see how he reacted under sudden terrible pressure to the unexpected bucks came close to her smelling of gunfire she took a step back im sorry about your friends death but it has nothing to do with me you know what its like to lose a friend claudia said you lost three at once not a muscle on his mouth or face moved ive not had a good day youre pissing me off and anger blinds it leads to obstacles greg listen to her you might need to robin started he hit robin a solid slap that sent her reeling she fell skidding across the coffee table knocking over a candlestick and a small stack of chad channing videos claudia had her police pistol out close to his face dont move she said slowly hands where i can see them sir she said to the dreadlocked friend who stayed still and who now wore to her surprise an amused smile he kept his hands away from his jacket but not exactly up bucks said nothing his eyes big anger is the road to obstacle greg you are so right about that claudia said sorry a momentary loss of control if you draw claudia told the friend i will shoot him then you you got me i believe i do he said call the cops mackay bucks said is this a or a mackay said but he didnt move toward the phone robin go outside claudia said robin climbed to her feet a bright little stream of blood dripping from her mouth her fingertips probing at her jaw oh greg she said more stunned than tearful too surprised yet to be angry she flailed an arm at claudia hey put that gun down i will when you and i are out of here a feminist with a gun bucks said isnt that a contradiction waving your phallic symbol around hed gotten the cool back in his voice he circled away from claudia putting her between him and mackay as he moved toward the living rooms bank of windows ill shoot your phallic symbol off with it if you dont shut up claudia said cmon robin he never hit me before robin said digging in her heels not thinking you never pissed him off before claudia said she pisses me off plenty bucks said im picking up the phone okay calling the cops robin wants to press charges she can but youre trespassing and threatening us and he leaned down to scoop up the cordless phone from its cradle and the windows behind him shattered in gunfire glass blinds and curtain sharding into the room claudia dove to the floor knocking robin down with her the redhead screaming bucks screaming the other man screaming the duststale taste of the sisal rug was in claudias mouth and suddenly the thunder of gunfire stopped she turned her head away from the window robin squirming in panic beneath her and saw mackay slumped against the far wall a red smear on the wallpaper behind him his hand tucked uselessly into his jacket silence now from the guns from the destroyed windows that faced onto the parking lot then a man stepping through them bluntfaced stocky hispanic dressed in black tshirt and jeans carrying an automatic rifle looking at bucks feet sticking out from under a table claudia fired at the mans chest and robin moved under her trying to bolt her shot went wide splintering the window frame next to the gunman he fell back firing again but wild claudia hustled robin to her feet looking back in the bulletpeppered den for bucks she shoved robin toward the back door where mackay lay splayed robin was sobbing bucks was gone a door slammed shut to her left bucks hiding elsewhere in the townhouse get out the back claudia ordered robin stumbled opened the door went out not a backyard but a small garage trapped then more gunfire erupted behind them claudia turned bucks running from a bedroom laid fire across the shattered windows with an automatic of his own claudia slammed the door to the condo shut jabbed the garage door opener the door rose with slow suburban solemnity and she pushed robin down behind a battered jaguar but no greeting of gunfire as the door tracked upward just the heavy swampiness of the night silence the gunfire ended run claudia said get to a neighbors call robin melvin ran toward the gleam of the pool and the clubhouse beyond claudia turned back toward the door she eased open the door yelled police lay down your weapons she listened no sound staying low she went through the door keeping her gun trained on the opposite corner the room was empty she checked mackay no pulse a lock of his hair lay across his throat like a rope smelling of sandalwood she moved through the rest of the condo no sign of greg buckman she headed out of the condo through the garage working her way toward the front then around again no shooter no bucks a car raced off across the lot a latemodel black suburban ripping across the landscaping and then through the main exit splintering the wooden rail that didnt rise fast enough gone the license plate began with tj the rest of it unreadable as the car vanished into the night then the thrum of a second engine sounded and the jag tore out of bucks garage into the lot she chased it yelling at bucks to stop he mustve gone out a window and circled the condo in the opposite direction from her the jag zoomed through the exit chasing the suburban claudia salazar put her gun down at her feet dug her police id out of her jacket and sat down on the driveway to wait for the police the distant wail of sirens approached her nerves caught up with her now and her hands shook a coldness crept over her and she wondered if whit still breathed sunday morning at frank polos house there were no hymns there was disco frank wrapped himself in the cocoon of his own voice the beat and croon drifting up from the speakers the one slow ballad he had made into a hit when you walk away he lay on the couch a wet cloth on his eyes a cup of coffee balanced on his stomach his left foot bopped in rhythm to the song do you really listen to yourself gooch asked he stood by the small music collection which offered mostly frank polo cds those are promotional copies frank said from underneath the wet cloth we give em out at the club very popular right no one goes to that club for the women its all about the giveaways frank whit sat by the singers feet and took the coffee cup off his stomach i need you to think jesus thinking is the last thing on my mind then what he said struck him as funny and he gave a nervous little laugh whit and gooch didnt laugh when he was a kid paul used to lipsync to my songs frank said he had the attitude of a performer he couldve been so much more sounding genuinely sad hes spilt milk now gooch said frank lifted one corner of the wet cloth yeah but he was a sweet kid once okay paul cut your hand open and tried to have eve and me killed whit said youre sorry hes dead no im sorry he turned into such a bastard frank sat up theres a difference i got to call his mom im dreading that he tossed the damp cloth on the coffee table smoothed his hair with eve and paul gone theres no senior leadership left but bucks and hes mia the traitor how would he know about paul meeting me hes on kikos side now whit said how would kiko know for that matter paul told bucks simple as that gooch said he still didnt look good to whit his skin waxen hed slept fitfully vomiting this morning sweating with chills but still refusing to go to a doctor the shootout at bucks condo and the triple homicide that included paul bellini last night had been all over the morning news and bucks remained missing kikos people killed paul and then went after bucks whit said double cross frank stood i should be at pauls house rallying whats left of the troops for a war with kiko this is not my style i dont want to do this frank if my theorys right you dont want to become the head of the bellinis kikos eliminating them frank said leadership aint my groove weve got to find where kiko hid mom whit said think frank please i want to believe shes still alive too whit frank said but if kiko killed paul and gary and max and tried to kill bucks whys he gonna keep eve alive because she can hand him the bellini assets transfer funds theres no one to stop him now from a complete takeover with what eve knows kiko can force mary pat to hand over control of every business every asset hes erased the bellinis power in a night frank got up bucks and paul knew where kiko was living but i didnt so i put out word on the street said id pay cash to know where kikos staying theres nothing more i can do iil go nuts sitting here and waiting whit said learn how unless you want to call the police frank crossed his arms you find eve youre leaving town yes shes coming home with me for a short while at least i think thats an excellent idea frank said thanks frank whit said lot of ifs there gooch said you boys are optimists dont talk like shes dead dont whit said the phone rang frank went to it said hello listened said no a few times hung up no ones seen bucks the rest of the ring isnt meeting at the bellinis theres a cop car on lazy lane probably there to take pictures of the license plates of the cars coming and going oh man im moving to vegas they sat waiting and two hours later the phone rang again and frank answered it spoke quietly yeah fine stop by and ill give you your money he hung up didnt look at whit at gooch leaned against the little bar counter for support that was a dealer i know he said kiko grace and his bodyguard jose are living in a townhouse on fannin near downtown the dealers got three other dealers working under him one knew kiko from miami saw him at those condos last week when he did a ysd what yuppie scum delivery frank said so this condo maybe thats where hes got eve give me the address whit said sure but then i got to go to the topaz frank said i should put in an appearance today calm the girls that were staying open no gooch said you come with us frank in case youre setting us up in a trap gooch i love eve im not gonna let her kid get killed frank touched whits shoulder cmon maybe whit trusts you i dont gooch said sorry you can be a little late for the topaz whit said and its safer for you staying with us right what you gonna do frank said ask kiko grace prettyplease to give you eve back no im going to tell him if he doesnt release her im going straight to the police with everything i know simple youll do that even if he kills her frank shrugged his way he gets rid of a witness hes probably gonna get rid of you too if he lets her go i stay silent about him killing paul forever frank shook his head i dont see this conversation going smoothly i killed a man once frank whit said he tried to kill me he had already killed a woman i loved i killed him and i thought guilt would gnaw at me forever but you know it didnt he was a murdering bastard not too different from kiko i was sorry i had to do it but i did it frank opened his mouth then shut it im not going to let him kill my mother whit said its not going to happen usually i admire optimism frank said right now this seems stupidity but youre going too whit said well im stupid frank said they left in franks bmw fifteen minutes later a battered jaguar pulled to a stop next to river oaks park then circled around the neighborhood three times and parked two streets over he doesnt have eve frank polo said he doesnt even have a face they stood over the body of kiko grace still sprawled on the floor of the condos breakfast nook the whole drive over to the condo whit had felt like his skin was on fire rushing to save his mother rushing possibly to die let her see he hadnt given up on her hadnt abandoned her he was afraid she thought he had left her to be caught but the condo had been empty the door unlocked as if the killer didnt mind if kiko was found gooch moved from room to room making sure no one else was in the condo kiko dead paul dead gooch said guessing not a coincidence his face was blanched he leaned against a wall no whit said dangerous world you think frank asked he prodded at kikos shoulder with his foot you bastard where is eve your braverys a little late frank gooch said but his voice was weak whit said you okay fine gooch turned away we need to see if theres anything here that could tell us where eve is whit said he pulled on gloves hed gotten after last nights shooting to finish cleaning pauls porsche of his and goochs prints when they dumped the car on a residential street he handed a set to frank and another to gooch dont leave a trace you were here maybe she killed him gooch said and shes waiting for us back at charlies house whit handed him his cell phone call or bucks took her getting rid of the leadership on both sides i dont think kiko shot paul he moved kikos body to one side peered down the back of the pants for lividity marks hes been dead for hours probably about the same time that paul died you can tell by looking at a dead mans ass frank asked um yeah whit said it wasnt a good time to announce he was a judge and coroner that hed seen several gunshot bodies and recognized the timing of postmortem conditions i knew we shouldnt have recruited from the corporate world said frank those people give me the creeps whit if bucks killed kiko he would have killed eve too gooch said his voice wasnt so slurred now but whit didnt like the pallor of his skin or the shakiness in his hands he watched gooch dial but he felt by a sinking in his gut that eve wasnt curled up in front of the tv at charlies what the hell frank pointed at kikos mouth a bit of green protruded from between the lips even though most of kikos face was raw meat his mouth was relatively untouched and whit knelt down conscious he was disturbing a crime scene but not caring he peeled back the little tube of paper it was a twentydollar bill he unrolled it and written in heavy black ink across the money was a public service frank peered over his shoulder what does that mean i dont know whit said he carefully rerolled the bill stuck it back between the dead mans teeth but i dont see bucks leaving little notes on the body there was no sign of a fight other than half of kikos face being splattered on the breakfast nook wall an answering machine held two messages from a youngsounding woman in spanish asking kiko to call her she was better this morning the condo itself was sparse a few pieces of leather furniture tv with dvd player a breakfast table a toaster and a coffee maker more like a temporary camp than a home whit found a small amount of cocaine in the pantry doublebagged tucked behind the cornstarch box not a good hiding place he expected better from kiko the outer bag had loosened masking tape on it as though it had been stuck to the wall and hidden elsewhere and moved why move it out of the hiding place to snort to sell but then you would hide it again being careful was part of the job it bothered him whit tried the redial on the condos phone got a chinese delivery restaurant down the street hung up joses not here frank said kikos righthand guy probably out mailing resumes gooch said so what do we do frank said leave and call the cops are there more drugs here whit asked thanks im cutting back gooch said or cash or records anything relating back to them being dealers no cash that i found but i havent looked hard gooch said aint thinking they got receipts lets look quickly what youre gonna take the dead guys money frank said yes frank go through his pockets for me whit said frank stood uncertainly over the body as if deciding whether or not whit was serious whit searched carefully through the closet in the first bedroom silk shirts polos pressed linen slacks stylish jackets of course the better to hide a holster under and expensive shoes all perfectly polished kiko probably threw out a pair at the first scuff he either packed heavy or planned a long stay in houston he checked the rest of the bedroom the bed was unmade and rumpled underneath the bed was nothing but a dust bunny or two whit expected firepower to be hidden under there but nothing no notes no papers of any sort no pda no cell phone the other bedrooms empty gooch said all the clothes are gone then jose took off frank said then odds are jose killed him gooch said why turn on his boss whit asked why not gooch said jose thinks eve has the money decides to take it himself kikos in the way whit hated the clarity and simplicity of it because it put them back at zero but she doesnt have it are you absolutely sure whit gooch said quietly she doesnt lets say bucks delivered the money to kiko frank said eve got the upper hand killed him took off with the money no whit said shed call me she wouldnt run away from me again frank said nothing turned went back into the den whit went into the bathroom he glanced through the materials in the cabinet nothing unusual mouthwash allergy medicine to deal with the inescapable houston pollen shaving kit he opened the toilet thinking more coke could be hidden there that it was the common place in movies but kiko wouldnt be that dumb or yes he was a package lay taped inside heavily wrapped in plastic carefully whit pulled it free laid the package on the floor too thin for a cocaine brick a dvd in a case unlabeled lets get out of here boys frank said as whit headed back into the den wait a minute whit slid the disc into the player set it running gooch and frank watched behind him a darkened shot the camera clearly hidden at a slightly tilted angle four men entering a house at night bucks one of them all nicely dressed young executive types two minutes passed then bucks coming out carrying a body dumping it in the trunk of a bmw then another and another bucks then getting in the car and roaring away our smoking gun frank said thank you lord if bucks or jose killed kiko why leave this behind whit popped the disc from the machine bucks didnt know the disc was here gooch said he sat down suddenly touched his chest frowned and whats it to jose if bucks gets caught for murder bucks did know about the film whit said kiko told me he had bucks in his pocket this is how he got him there whit gooch clutched at his chest whit oh man and he collapsed onto the floor groaning eyes rolling into whites a thin sliver of spit oozing from his mouth claudia stood over whit holding a cup of steaming coffee in her hand and he wondered for a second if she would pour it on his head you look terrible she said quietly a family was camped in the corner of the intensive care room and she spoke in a hush hello to you too he said she handed him the coffee it was close to six sunday night gooch lying in critical condition for the whole afternoon thank you he said claudia sat next to him he didnt look at her whit yes whats going on she said sitting here with a coffee that my friend brought me he said dont she said in a low harsh whisper do you know what ive been through does it matter if i know youre mad at me before ive even opened my mouth walk with me she said theres a little garden outside im going to yell at you and i dont want to disturb these people visiting time is in another fifteen minutes i cant miss it level with me and you wont she said i love it when you get all authority figure he walked out past her she followed him the evening was damp rain having ceased its fall an hour ago and the wet held the air in a swampy embrace whit sat down on the damp stone bench claudia stood i almost got killed last night she said did you know that no he said watching her are you serious greg buckman a shooter came after him nearly got me a man got killed but youre okay yes im okay she sat next to him he reached for her arm and she stood and you are so not okay whit not okay at all to me you sit here like a stone statue not answering a single reasonable question over the past three days so ask me start easy she decided for gods sakes what happened to gooch he had a heart attack i dont mean that whit claudia thought infinite patience right now he was full of a cocktail of narcotics morphine a whole mess of junk hes been beaten so much for medical privacy whit said gooch does love to party you protecting your mom whit claudia please go home i dont have anything to say i nearly got killed trying to help you i warned you that bucks was dangerous im sorry im really sorry he wasnt half as dangerous as jose peron claudia said thats the shooters name his name is peron like evita yes look at me whit instead he studied his shoes whit i love you youre my dear friend whatever youve done ill help you okay okay he said i want you to take gooch back to port leo soon as he can travel thats how you can help me fine she said but on the condition you tell me whats happening first tell me everything that happened to you last night please he said taking her hand she let him and she told him about finding robin and bucks when she was done he said thank god youre okay claudia turned his face toward her looked hard into his eyes the police found greg buckman prowling around a house in river oaks today they were already headed there to talk to frank polo whos the manager of a strip club called the topaz oh the owner of the club paul bellini she put an emphasis on the last name got gunned down in a parking lot last night his porsche was abandoned near shepherd and alabama it was wiped clean of prints oddly enough there was a van parked not far from where bellinis body was found goochs van whit let go of her hand so im freaking im calling hospitals whit not knowing if you and gooch are dead or alive eventually i find gooch here you havent talked to the police about all this have you whit i told the doctors my friend had gone missing for a few hours turned up beaten and sick they gave the information to the police they ran a check found his van was near the bellini death scene they came back and talked to me i told them i didnt know why his van was there and gooch isnt up for much questioning yet so you lied to the police claudia couldnt keep the outrage out of her voice tell them what you suspect i dont care you came to houston to find the bellinis you sure as hell found them whit so wheres bucks now they questioned him and let him go his story is that this jose peron is a hit man hired by disgruntled energis investors to get rid of him whit raised an eyebrow they bought that no the man killed at bucks place a guy named mackay is a suspected drug dealer and hit man himself but never arrested with cause they dont have a charge against bucks other than fleeing the scene of a crime his apartment was clean theres nothing hard yet to connect bucks to any illegal activity he drove around houston all night slept in his car then drove to polos house this morning the police are talking with his girlfriend to see if shell give him up bucks is out there whit said thanks for telling me i get the feeling its not telling its warning she paused wheres your mother i have no idea dead probably whit she touched his knee he didnt move im sorry he said nothing wait her eyes widened does that mean you found her or didnt it doesnt matter claudia you found her found and lost he said isnt it supposed to be the other way around what does that mean she ran away from you again then she said softly did you kill paul bellini no you can tell me if you did whit its okay he crossed his arms gave her a crooked smile and why is it okay if i killed bellini because he was scum i didnt say it was okay if you killed him i said it was okay if you told me i absolutely didnt kill him neither did gooch what really happened to gooch gooch can tell you all about it whit said on that long drive home and youre doing what staying in houston to play high noon with bucks thanks for the coffee but its visiting time he stood up and walked away if gooch was conscious now was the time to get their stories straight whispering to each other under the hum of the medical equipment jose perons mother was killed two years ago vernetta westbrook said claudia sat across from her in the hospital cafeteria sipping coffee he was once on the fringes of the miami drug trade a guy who didnt deal anything harder than pot but after her murder he started taking on the dirty jobs no one else wanted and he accelerated up through the ranks she lowered her voice does judge mosley know peron his honor like to snort a little coke no tell me about the mothers death was she dealing its the kind of story the drug czar tells to boost budgets vernetta said mrs peron was a highschool drama teacher staged shakespeare in the projects with underprivileged kids did volunteer work wellloved in the community she walked into a drug deal going down in the school lot she told the boys to get the hell off school property they shot her four times they catch the guys the suspects two of them both eighteen were found floating two days later near the very busy bahia mar marina in fort lauderdale shot in the head dumped rather publicly the police thought to make a statement claudias eyes widened jose peron killed them he had an airtight alibi but i talked with the broward county das office and they believe the guys were offed as a favor to jose then jose began his heavier involvement in the organization its headed by a guy named kiko grace we got an anonymous tip today that his body was ready and waiting for us in a leased condo near downtown so perons boss is here and dies around the same time as paul bellini claudia felt cold god whit did you no she could not believe it of him your judge isnt saying much more than what you told us that he hired chyme to find his mother that he hasnt found his mother and that his friend guchinski had nothing to do with paul bellinis death he either is lying or he really doesnt know which is it claudia im not a mind reader if he says he doesnt know i have to believe him i dont vernetta said i dont have to believe him at all well invite him for a long leisurely chat for hours on end you wont convince one judge to sign a warrant to arrest a fellow judge without hard cause vernetta shook her head mosleys a rural jp not even a lawyer hes nothing to the judges here why dont you drag in greg buckman again he was friends with bellini and peron and grace mustve wanted buckman dead if peron came after him with guns blazing leave whit alone buckmans clearly in the middle of this weve got tit for tat kiko grace comes here wants to move into houston drug territory he whacks bellini bellinis group whacks grace or vice versa it doesnt matter who died first they have a short little war and then its done peron shooting for bucks is the next stage of the war let them kill each other theyre a cancer you have no problem with murder vernetta assuming innocent people dont get hurt thats not so and your pet judge isnt innocent claudia he knows more than hes saying if grace is miamibased jose peron might head back to florida and pull forces in here i hope he goes home stays there and runs graces ring you wonder why a guy would get involved in the trade that killed his mother shortest line to revenge i guess yes claudia said but vernetta had a point it made her wonder none of your informants have skinny on peron hes too new in town nothing yet when leonard guchinskis well enough to travel and assuming hes not charged with anything im taking him back to port leo its a long drive hes a friend of sorts i can hope hell talk she stood talk more than your precious judge at least vernetta said but let me ask you a hard question guchinski talks or mosley talks to you in confidence tells you the truth of whats happened between all these people what do you do claudia rat on your friends if theyve broken the law ill worry about that when i cross that bridge girlfriend vernetta said youre running out of road eve no longer knew if it was day or night after killing kiko jose had given her another painkiller bound her dumped her in the back of a black suburban tossed a cover over her driven into the dark of houston she slipped into the emptiness dreamed of gunfire heard jose jumping back in the car then driving fast short lots of sharp turns that made her nauseated then a long haul on the highway she fell asleep she woke to a radio tuned to jazz played soft as a gentle whisper in the dark jose bound her to a narrow cot then sat by her with a syringe in his hand sliding the needle under her skin while she protested pumped her full of chemical bliss that made her head hazy and cloudy and sweet she was conscious of jose coming in once feeding her a chocolate shake and a package of lukewarm french fries then another shot in the darkness once cool water sponged on her face her hands a kindness then medicine daubed the back of her mouth where her teeth had been across her busted lips the taste of the medicine lingered a long while when her thoughts became clearer she remembered kiko his face blown away but mostly she thought of whit whit here and gone like the life she should have had she wanted to cry but her face felt too numb to know whether or not she was weeping an ache that defied the drugs settled in along her arms her chest her jaw like years of unshed tears letting her know they waited for release she slept awoke in the dark listened heard voices a man and a woman her purse lay on the floor all its contents spilled across the carpet makeup brush a package of mints her gun was gone and something else she tried to remember what was in her purse that would matter so much the room was small carpet the color of clay the ceiling old and worn it had the impersonal dimensions of an office boards covered the one window she tried to reason it out they knew she didnt have the money they found the money or had they had it all along they didnt need her but they did theyd kept her alive through the fog she remembered he had called her the key key to what she made a noise in her throat tongued her numb parched lips they were keeping her for bait the idea rose up tumbled back into the mess of her drugged brain if they wanted her alive it was because they wanted whit the door opened jose stood in the doorway smoking a cigarette he shut the door behind him crossed to the bureau extinguished the cigarette in a small plastic ashtray secondhand smokes bad for you he said his voice was quiet but not warm she said what are you going to do with me her voice didnt sound like her own anymore feed you eggs toast sound okay mouth up to eating or you want another shake depends is it my last meal i told you that you were valuable to me now he smiled a bullys knowing taunting grin i dont understand youre open sesame he said youre gonna tell us how they do it how they hide and move the money they he smiled well start with kiko graces organization and his rivals back in south florida a cold nausea prickled her guts then the dominicans in dallas and new orleans the cartels in new york and los angeles youre gonna help us break their backs joses voice went low we call ourselves public service we do what the cops cant take the war on drugs to the streets we get in with the dealers learn their setup then we kill the leaders gut the organization take their money and go after the next group he leveled a hard look at her dealers killed my mom im sorry no youre not youre not one bit sorry bitch what was my mother to you or your kind the door opened tasha strong stepped inside beautiful face stern a gun in her hand barrel lowered tasha eve blinked tasha o tigers heart wrappd in a womans hide jose quoted making guns with his fingers grinning at tasha dont give her more of a headache with that crap tasha said mouth better eve eve managed to nod shes been tending to you she worked pauls side i worked kikos jose smiled tasha lost her brother to a drug gang it tends to gnaw at you knowing that the police alone can never beat these people so we work together dozens of us eve glanced over at the spill of her purse the cd whit took from tasha it was gone the cooked books she said those files that listed other revenue sources for paul on the cd faked by tasha and me paul gave her access to your house so she could check your finances see if frank had been doing any more stealing but that was a chance to copy those fake files to your hard drive after she copied your real financial files without anyone knowing false trail for the authorities to follow if you got caught or killed right away she already planted those files on the computers at the topaz after you vanished we didnt want the feds grabbing the bellini money before we could but thats not a worry now that we have you see we plan as thoroughly as you do she closed her eyes you want me to help you but i cant i dont know how other rings clean their money you know the tricks the processes like im intrigued the exchange place for kikos money being done at what appears to be a simple insurance company you cleaning money through insurance policies yeah suddenly there was no point in not telling him you buy a life insurance policy overseas then cash it out a few months later and transfer the money back into the country you dont get watched as closely its a loophole i found you can move millions in short order and theres no question of legitimacy jose patted her cheek sweet lady youre exactly what we need to destroy the worst people in this country i said i cant you got a choice he said help us give us what we want crack open the vaults for the major dealers in this country or watch whit mosley die slowly painfully tears of anger frustration welled up in her eyes but whits not a drug dealer hes not kiko or paul definitely hes a judge a justice of the peace down on the coast tasha said eve gave a sharp little laugh a judge i had a chance to kill him when i killed paul and i didnt tasha said you owe me one dont forget it i dont consider your partner a good guy jose said hes a guy who could cause us a lot of trouble and if you want him to keep breathing you do what youre told eve tasha said i kissed paul slept with him listened to him cry about his dad then i killed him we wont show whit one moment of mercy if you dont help us dont hurt him eve pleaded ill do whatever you want they left her alone in the room an old office at one end of the warehouse walked to the other end of the warehouse you think shell cooperate jose said with what she knows she could accelerate our schedules no tasha said we need her son whit son look at him look at her jose its obvious if he was just her business partner she wouldnt plead for him like that tasha shook her head shes been in the business for thirty years and was never caught shes forgotten more than most people know she could lead us down blind alley after blind alley slow us down without us even knowing we need whit where she can see him hurt hear him scream tasha touched joses shoulder weigh his life against all the lives we save doing this the innocents the kids hes nothing compared to them hes the guarantee shell work her best but the police are looking for me i dont know if i can hunt him around houston we dont even know if hes in town frustration in his voice you want him as bait to get her to deliver what we need tasha said god men could be dense at times she already had a plan it works both ways use her as bait to get him only works if we can find him to have a conversation jose said eve wont want to get him anywhere close to us she wont talk tasha frowned at this hard unappealing truth try frank polo she said hes dumb as a stump but maybe he knows how to find eves son his numbers on my cell phone just call him up and ask him where whit is make it worth his while hes gonna be signing autographs on the unemployment line with paul dead or maybe tell him he gets eve back if he helps us tasha went back in to feed eve make sure she ate when she came out of the office jose was clicking off her cell phone and smiling as though hed won the lottery i just had me jose said one brilliant idea to kill two birds with one stone monday afternoon thin rain fell from the sky clouds wandering in from the gulf and the wet lot of club topaz closed was empty but it was where robin agreed to meet claudia robin sat in claudias passenger seat claudia handed her a coffee one of those cinnamontoffeemocha latte creations that was sweeter than a box of candy her name is tasha strong robin melvin said tasha dances here nice girl but a little uppity paul was all crazy about her have you seen her since paul died claudia asked no shes probably scared to death i sure am robin said these arent good people robin i know you have feelings for greg buckman no i had hopes she said the word like it left a bitter taste in her mouth i knew he wasnt the nicest guy on the planet but i thought if he and i could get away from these people he would be better all that goal stuff he says he wants to be better but im not sticking around for the home improvement anymore cant change em robin claudia said tried not to think of whit clearly not robin poked at her puffy lip i never ever had a guy hit me not once i swore i would never put up with that lifetimemovie shit and he did it and i was so surprised i acted a fool im sorry its okay dont apologize but i want to help i dont know anything about any illegal stuff okay i told the police that about a dozen times they dont believe me they think bucks must have talked plenty on the pillow she lowered her voice he never did but bucks wanted me to watch tasha so im guessing she knew bad shit about him and paul i searched her changing room where she keeps her stuff nothing odd a few pictures pictures in a drawer of a boy from being a baby to teenage years kind of looked like her maybe was a brother but the pictures were old creased with handling not new robin cleared her throat funny thing for a girl to keep family pictures in the place where she takes her clothes off most girls dont she sipped at the hypersweetened coffee i love my mom were close but she thinks im a cocktail waitress i wouldnt have her picture around in the changing room like she was looking at me in my getups was there a name or date on the back of any of the photos robin closed her eyes yeah darius on one of the baby pictures she opened her eyes looked at claudia if tasha doesnt know anything i dont want the cops crowding her cops keep wanting me to make a deal like im holding back info to annoy them bucks wanted me to watch her because she was close to paul and he didnt like that but since she was closer to paul she might be able to help the cops and then theyd leave me alone describe her to me tell me where she lives claudia said and ill have a talk with her would you robin said we werent real close so i dont have her contact info but frank would frank polo right his name had cropped up before the singer turned nightclub manager eve michaels boyfriend im not ashamed to say i love disco robin said bucks hated it but its happy music and franks really a good singer tell me about eve michaels robin shrugged eve shes a bookkeeper for paul i think nice but distant tasha liked her seemed interested in eves work tasha wanted to get off stage move into the business side of the club but paul never would have let her you have to see her shes gorgeous did you like eve is she nice it suddenly and oddly mattered to her if this was whits mother that she have at least one redeeming feature nice as long as you didnt get in her way cross her youd be missing a liver and shed be licking her lips i was a little afraid of her you have her and franks address my sister was always a big fan of frank polos claudia said id like to get an autograph before i leave town whit said its time we reported eve as officially missing he hadnt slept much in the past two nights and he rubbed at his unshaven face he and frank polo sat in a little diner off shepherd not far from rice university themed for fifties nostalgia the jukebox played a mournful tune appropriate for a nearly empty restaurant after the lunch rush frank didnt respond to his suggestion as the waitress approached them they both ordered omelettes when i was famous we lived on breakfast food youre tired you want comfort but you cant get full up you never want to be stuffed when youre onstage for a living did you know i was famous once frank said to the waitress who was a cute college girl with a little silver ring piercing her pert nose i didnt she said i used to be a singer frank said the waitress gave an indulgent politebutidontcare smile and took their menus frank waited till she was out of earshot and tell the police what whit that jose has her we dont know he does we dont know where he is some cop named gomez already stopped by to see me about her i told them she took off i dont know where gave him her cell phone number the cops are going to think shes running but the police could look for her and jose and when they find her theyll stick her in prison and youll never see her again i dont believe and whits cell phone rang he clicked it on whitman mosley it wasnt a voice he knew a baritone strong and steady your mothers alive thought youd want to know who is this jose peron were going to keep her for a little while then well give her back to you alive and well unless you call the cops then we have to be mean and we dont want to be mean is not what were about we jose was not acting alone i want her back right now sit tight be patient well take good care of her then well give her back well arrange a meeting between us i dont believe you believe or not the voice said we could have killed her with kiko we didnt take that as serious reassurance let me talk to her what will you discuss her moneylaundering skills her killing the guy in montana all those years ago whits mouth went dry how did behave she lives dont she dies well be in touch very soon and the caller hung up whit told frank the gist of the conversation what the hell does that mean frank said he wiped at his puffy eyes with the back of his hand why would they want to keep her jose if its him he must want info on the bellini operations but he wont let her go hell kill her montana jose knows about mom shooting james powell in montana and that im her son because he took harrys notes off harrys body he killed harry the weight of the knowledge made him very still he didnt look at frank didnt look at his plate so youre going to the cops frank asked he says hell kill her if i do that then we have to listen to him not endanger her frank i cant yes you can and you will frank said we play by their rules we get her back i need to know where jose is frank where he has her i cant work wonders finding the condo they hid out in was tough enough but ill put out word again money for information lets say joses the power behind all this he kills kiko he kills or has paul killed he tries to kill bucks why so no one else is chasing after the money that only works if he has the money frank if he doesnt want to be chased himself im thinking he killed harry and doyle and stole the money frank shook his head how would jose know where the exchange was he followed eve or worse bucks told him the police should compare the bullets in kiko to the bullets in harry chyme and richard doyle whit finished his coffee jose stuck that money into kikos mouth if he was stealing the money why bother with gestures and symbols hes got his own agenda the waitress brought their omelettes hash browns grits with a warm little puddle of garlic and cheese on top they began to eat suddenly whit laughed what frank asked buttering a biscuit this is so freaking normal and domestic whit said like if eve had taken me with her when she took off i probably would have had a lot of breakfasts with you by now i would have been a crappy stepdad frank said be glad she left you behind because abandonment is so awesome get over it frank said actually you seem pretty welladjusted except for hunting down your mom you got a problem letting go no you need your mom for what to complete you as a person frank said you and bucks are more alike than you know excuse me him and his selfhelp tapes its all to reassure himself that if he screws up its not entirely his fault he can make it better with a quick fix you finding eve its all about fixing you whit not her at the beginning but not now i know she wasnt around frank said but im sure she loves you shes a thief and a crook so shes not a nutcase like bucks or jose put a premium on sanity whit thought of eve tending his wounds of remembering he liked pepperoni pizza of warning him to save himself do you love her frank asked id like to know whit put his fork down i dont want to talk about it but i want you to get bucks where i can talk to him alone bucks bucks is the key he wont meet with you frank said plus the cops have got to be watching him you want the cops knowing youre in deeper than you are seeing you with him whit theyll haul you in as a material witness offer a deal with you to testify against me your mother bucks whoever im going to give the police the movie of bucks carrying those bodies anonymously but as soon as i do bucks is behind bars and i cant ever get to him arresting him you could have more pressure put on him whit leaned forward call him tell him i have the movie franks eyes went wide you crazy im dead serious tell him bucks knows where jose would hide maybe thats why jose tried to kill him your mother wouldnt want this frank said shed be wanting you to head your ass back home bucks and i have a common enemy now in jose whit said its a deal with the devil i wont do it frank pulled a twenty out of his wallet tossed it on the table my treat think about my suggestion about getting bucks arrested theres your game plan son think about what i said frank we need bucks jesus and mary frank said you didnt answer me you love her i dont know her in the conventional sense you know your family but still i do know her or i want to believe i know her maybe im fooling myself whit shook his head love her i must frank polo left the diner watching whit drive off in charlie fulghams borrowed lexus whit was so like eve in certain ways resolve smarts singlemindedness frank drove around an extra twenty minutes before heading home stopping at lights watching his back he wasnt quite sure who he was looking for in his rearview mirror he imagined cops lanternjawed guys whod give him the tough eye or a woman cop with a lesbianshort haircut whod take him downtown call him mr polo be excruciatingly polite while panic tore his guts and ribs in half see what he was made of sitting there in their interrogation room the cops lobbing a suggestion or two about his involvement with paul bellini beyond being the topazs manager about his knowledge of any criminal activities about the family asking where eve michaels was probably good hed had to move the money hed taken from the club back into the clubs accounts it made him clean christ paul had done him a favor what you gonna do to me frank practiced saying in his mind to his imaginary interrogators make me give the grammy back that was always a hell of a line to keep in your pocket it made people know that they werent nearly as cool as you were the grammy he still had that up on a mantel in his bedroom usually one of the last things he saw before he went to sleep for a change there were no police cars parked near the house no lawyers waiting to talk to him and no bucks he had gone to the hospital straight from kikos with whit and gooch but stayed in the background not letting anyone know he was with the other two thank god he hadnt come home that night to find a furious and panicked bucks waiting for him anxious for help he got out of the car headed up to the front door the woman was waiting for him in the eaves of the porch darkhaired mildly pretty with a serious and intelligent face frank froze the keys in his hand the man in front of her looked older than the pictures of frank polo claudia remembered vaguely from her older sisters record covers hed been short for a singing star big black hair in a seventies flip gaudy with chains and the requisite longpointycollared shirt slit open to the belly bigheeled shoes pants tighter than skin this man was still short but quietly dressed in comfortable gray slacks and a plain blue shirt hair cropped short without a bit of gel but there was the toobig diamond on the ring the hint of gold chain under the modest collar yes he said a little fear in his voice the barest inflection because she was unexpected and he was tense expecting attack or trouble from a new angle claudia had given long thought on how to work this mr polo im looking for tasha strong i understand you have her address or phone number shes unlisted who are you a cop no a friend is worried about tasha and asked me to find her see me at the club i dont have the dancers contact info at home he fumbled for his house key on a thick ring im also looking for eve michaels shes out of town not looking at her where could i find her claudia asked i dont know you dont know what town she went to you have ten seconds to get off my porch he said then i call the cops eve michaels is missing isnt she wont one more investigation fill up your date book mr polo he crossed his arms eve and i had our differences she left town for a while satisfied she got a cell phone not for strangers to call im not exactly a stranger im claudia salazar im a friend of whits and goochs she watched his face he gave no reaction to their names is eve dead did the bellinis kill her or jose peron i dont know what you mean frank said eve wanted time alone time away from her son whits her son isnt he now he studied her and said i can give you her cell phone number if you want that would be great thanks i dont have it memorized he said you know how it is you press the speed dial code my phones inside youre welcome to come in suddenly friendly the frost gone or wait out here like knowing hed been too friendly ill come in thank you i was about to make coffee frank polo said he stopped tossed his suit coat onto the chair closed the door behind her you want a cup you could even try eves cell phone from here she pasted on a warm smile get him talking people nearly always told you more than they thought they would thatd be great my sisters a big fan of yours oh well thanks he said thanking her for her sisters devotion to disco seemed strange but then what else was he going to say she wondered a moment too late if saying her sister rather than she was a big fan was an insult but frank polo didnt seem to care whit know youre here yes it seemed the prudent answer claudia followed frank to the kitchen watched him putter with filter grounds and water over the brewer he turned to her leaned against the counter and smiled again im a bad guy claudia i told you a little white lie frank said eve didnt leave because of an argument she left because of whit claudia waited him being her kid looking for her finding her it upset her deeply im sure it was a shock for me too i didnt even know she had a kid she has six of them all boys whit is the youngest six god almighty the coffee maker gurgled in the quiet if youre whits friend maybe you can help convince him to give her a little space she didnt leave town because of paul bellini why would she things could be a little tough at the office now you both worked for him frank took down two coffee mugs from a cabinet gave her a blank smile technically i work for a holding company that owns topaz owned by tommy bellini a mobster frank shrugged put out milk sugar sweetener former mobster tommys a good guy who in his past did bad things it doesnt make him a bad person if hes good at heart my actions dont matter because i define myself as good claudia said sorry that excuse chafes me we all have our life philosophies frank poured coffee into her mug pushed the sugar bowl toward her look she doesnt want to have anything to do with whit okay i know those words hurt the poor kid it breaks your heart she leaves town right at the same time that kiko grace and paul bellini are murdered claudia shook her head im wondering what triggered all this bloodshed mr polo i dont know who kiko grace is she watched him sipped the coffee kiko grace is a drug lord from miami he was found shot to death the day after paul was two major crime figures gone in short order now something or someone set that off maybe eve she put down her coffee you must be looking for work to keep your mind busy are you another pi or a lawyer im a police investigator down in port leo where whits from but im not here in any official capacity im here as his friend you could have told me that from the beginning frank said almost reproachfully i didnt want you to run from me being a cop she said but im not going to lie when you ask me either im not allergic to cops frank said he smiled the bellinis have lots of cop friends always have great she said for my own curiosity or a memento for whit if eve doesnt want to see him again would you have a picture of her i could keep he seemed to weigh his options for whit let me see he set his coffee down wandered off down a hallway she didnt like him out of her sight but it was his house she knew the risks of stepping inside she noticed a picture of frank and a woman hanging on a dining room wall beyond the kitchen the woman was pretty must have been dropdead gorgeous in her shallow youth finefeatured highcheekboned thin lips parted in an honest smile for the camera she looked normal nothing bent or broken within her that would make her leave her family her children run off with an embezzler perhaps kill him then join a crime family she didnt look like a mom whod bake cookies for the pta but she looked like a mom whod let you eat ice cream until you got sick whit looked like her claudia could really see the resemblance across the eyes the mouth the cheekbones and she bit her lip her heart full for whit frank polo came back into the kitchen holding a small photo she stepped back into the kitchen to meet him and he handed her the picture took that last year on a trip to cozumel its a good likeness of eve claudia took the photo the same woman wearing capri pants and a white blouse turquoise jewelry at her throat smiling in bright sunlight you know her name isnt eve its ellen the woman named ellen should have had a life with her sons as she looked at the picture an acid dislike for ellen mosley settled in her mouth ellen it doesnt fit her too sundayschool teacher where is she mr polo i told you i dont know i find it hard to believe that if she left because of whit she didnt tell you where she was going but her voice stayed friendly she didnt want whit strongarming it out of me frank said i know you know claudia said trust me he said i dont having your unwanted kid show up is enough to make a woman like eve run for cover theres nothing else to it all right she said does that mean youre not going to give me her number he went to an address book wrote down numbers and an address handed them to her tasha strongs phone number and address eves number good luck tasha strongs address was on telephone road a major thoroughfare near hobby airport greg buckman she said you know him too he let three beats pass yes worked at energis the jerk bad freaking influence on paul a bad influence on a mobster pauls not a mobster no matter what you think but bucks hes a greedy mean bastard yet when bucks nearly gets killed the other night he comes running to you to this house claudia said its odd he probably thought paul would be here but paul was dead by then see if bucks killed paul he sure wouldnt have come to your house afterwards and sat waiting for you hed leave houston people are idiots frank said havent you noticed i havent really talked to bucks since paul died because the police are watching you all are they no ones at my door or window frank said and like i said its been nice talking to you bucks could turn cut a deal say you and eve are more to the bellinis than family friends with paul dead the structure may crumble and crush you underneath it sweetheart he said im not doing a halfassed plea deal because i didnt do anything wrong im going on with my life i got to get my throat into shape practice my arpeggios and finger snaps and hip swivels im glad you have your priorities you want to help your friend you know i like whit i know its tough losing his mom i loved my mom she was the best person next to eve ive known dont look surprised eve is a wonderful person you dont know her thanks for the coffee claudia said if eve calls frank said ill leave it up to her whether or not she wants to talk to you since youre whits friend you got a number where i can reach you yeah she set down the purse on the counter dug inside for paper and pen pulled them out wrote down her cell phone number handed it back to him you seem like a nice young lady frank said i know whits your friend and you want to help him can i give you friendly advice sure claudia said not wanting to burn this bridge quite yet stay out of this its between a mother and son or two people wondering if they can be a mother and son let them sort it out he gave her his best smile you still want an autograph for your sister sign it to me ill make her jealous i dont suppose well youre famous would you have a photo of yourself on hand i always do frank said claudia drove away from the house sure his eyes were watching her from the window from her car seat a thirtyyearsyounger openshirted frank polo smiled at her the words to claudia youre my groove your friend frank polo scrawled beneath his thenperfect chin frank watched her leave nice young woman but clearly not the kind who would give up he closed his eyes rested his forehead against the cool of the glass he wanted eve back so bad whit was right the best answer was to deal with one more devil jose peron has eve frank said he therefore has the money bucks sat across from him at the diningroom table monday night hands steepled in front of his mouth i knew it greg frank said and bucks looked up a little surprised at the use of his first name no one but his parents and robin who wasnt even talking to him now ever called him by his given name youre the dirty guy here the police know that youre dirty because jose tried to hit you theyll keep digging until they find evidence to truly connect you with jose kiko or paul its over your only hope is that money you can do anything go anywhere with it brazil ecuador thailand places where cash shuts folks up and they never ask questions you want me to have the money i just want eve back if shes still alive frank said thats all because you care bucks said because i love her frank said you dont have much time robins not gonna keep her mouth shut for long once the police start leaning on her robin doesnt know shit son women always know more than you think they do look at tasha i heard shes taken off because she knows too much about paul and she dont want the police bugging her or us whacking her to keep her quiet im not whacking robin bucks found to his surprise he was really missing her she wouldnt talk to him he had never felt so alone in his life even with chad channings reassuring words playing in his head for company you act like you still have choices frank shook his head the police can haul you in at any minute lean on you hard if youre not cooperating with them about why jose tried to kill you pauls dead and youre the one doing the dirty work for him and for kiko both trying to play them against each other has left you on the bottom son i didnt save it frank said i can guess what went down how long do you live if pauls guys knew youd helped kiko bucks swallowed i didnt have a choice frank i it seems to me though frank said like he didnt care about excuses you and i are the ones that truly suffered what ive lost the woman i love youve been through hell bucks looked like he hadnt slept in two days hed shaved but missed spots and one scraggly bit of stubble lay along the edge of his cheek the immaculate grooming was slipping so why are you even talking to me frank if i screwed paul so bad why do you want me to have the money you in jail is a bad thing not just for you for everyone the pressure on you to talk will be huge and any friends of kiko they believe you killed him and thats why jose tried to kill you well theyll whack you in jail simple as a phone call bucks raised an eyebrow but that would take care of the problem of me frank cleared his throat tented his hands under his chin how about a private little deal between you and me you take care of jose you get eve and the money back you give half the money to me and eve you keep the other half for yourself and nobody ever knows you screwed over paul ill keep my mouth shut i didnt kill paul i dont think you did you know they found goochs van where paul died bucks said nothing wasnt in the paper i know that from whit mosley now what does that suggest to you frank said quietly whit killed him getting gooch back im not gonna kill whit mosley because he killed paul bucks said im out of the ring i dont do revenge then get rid of whit because he can bring you down keep you from the money if eves dead he has no further reason to try to deal with you eve is his mother frank watched bucks blink so whit eventually will tell everything to the cops that you tried to have him and eve killed you kidnapped his friend youre in with drug dealers but if you and i have eve the money and plane tickets our worries are pretty much over you act like you know where jose has the money bucks said oh i do frank pulled a sig sauer out from under the table leveled it at bucks but you get rid of whit for me hes willing to meet you because he thinks you know where jose has eve and jose called him told him eve was still alive why do you want him dead i want eve with me not her kid hes a judge down on the coast she goes with him she gives up our life together and im not letting her go wow youre a really romantic old fart so wheres the money frank bucks asked the low growl coming back into his voice tell me or no deal at all you want whit dead thats sweet with me theyre at an old warehouse off mississippi frank said i know the dealers in this town the big ones who like to come to the club and i got more eyes than a fly our times running out son you take whit with you hell fight these guys to save his mom you get the money we get eve but make sure whit doesnt make it out alive can i state the obvious bucks said i could risk getting killed take the money myself and why should i worry about saving eve because if you dont ill tell the cops you killed kiko frank watched bucks frank knew that bucks probably thought jose had the movie had taken it after killing kiko because if the police had found it then his brooks brothers ass would be behind bars getting warmed up to be a jail boss new bitch bucks didnt know whit and frank had both seen the movie but i didnt but you had every reason to didnt you bucks bucks tented his cheek with his tongue frank waited let the greed and the fear work their magic it wasnt that different from dealing with music promoters if you appeared quiet and relaxed not desperate to sing even if every fiber in your body was screeching please god book me please let me get up onstage because i know they will love me then the other person usually blinked first frank never wanted a real agent not when he had tommy to cut the infrequent deals he had watched and learned all right bucks said you got a deal get mosley here he gave frank a wicked little smile chad channing always said you should turn enemies into friends if it shortens your todo list gomez will kill me for pulling this stunt vernetta said changing lanes to get around a stalled bus you dont work for him claudia said no vernetta said but hell kill my boss and then with his dying breath my boss will shoot me tasha strong lived in one of the many complexes near hobby airport along telephone road the complexes lay in a steady necklace with withered yards and peeling paint monday evening was settling in for another long stretch of unease claudia had hijacked vernetta at the harris county courthouse as she got off work insisting that vernetta come with her to find tasha strong he wont shoot you hell fire you think positive claudia said ill see if the bellinis are hiring vernetta said she pointed at one decrepit apartment building love what theyve done with it a chinese gang here took over a wing of one of these complexes ran a whorehouse and peddled dope out of it they had elementary school kids as their gofers she shook her head if i dont sound caustic ill cry here this is the address gomez and his team already tried to get in touch with her vernetta said no dice yes but were not the scary police are we you are youve scared me since you came into town vernetta said she pulled into the parking lot past three hardfaced working girls the bored ladies watched them ease into a slot and walk across to the stairs up to apartment claudia knocked no answer but she could hear the soft strains of a radio playing on the other side of the door tasha tasha strong she called softly im a friend of robin melvins shes worried about you please open up the door opened an old woman stood there dressed in a faded pink robe and a maroon baseball cap tasha dont live here she said sorry hello maam do you know where we could find her claudia said ignoring the womans blunt manner no the old woman said shes gone for good claudia and vernetta looked at each other then at the old woman im sorry maam when did tasha leave claudia asked after a moment who are you vernetta and claudia both showed their official ids oh god the old woman said shes in trouble im sure of it but she wont help herself get out and she sure wont listen to me we can help her vernetta said come inside then the woman said they came inside the apartment it was small but clean although there was a clutter of a tea mug tissues a rumpled newspaper a cane was next to the door and the woman used it as she headed back for a chair gettin over flu she said shouldnt be contagious any more sit are you tashas mother claudia asked grandmother the woman said mrs annie strong she sat i dont hold with lying and i havent slept well since the police called looking for her tasha asked me to lie for her and i cant do it no more because you folks are gonna keep knocking on my door what lie did she want you to tell first tasha told me that if anyone came looking for her say she was dead not to say she moved or gone on a trip but dead killed in a car accident in new orleans that was her story showed me what looked like a death certificate shed faked up i said youre crazy girl what kind of trouble you in mrs strong shook her head thats a tall order to give me after i done half the raising of her i told her id tell people shed left town but not that she was dead mrs strong spit out the last word so where is she mrs strong shook her head i dont know she aint lived here in years she gave this as her address to her employer huh she got her community college degree she moved uptown fast left me in the dust came to see me when it suited her claudia remembered robins mention of the photos does darius live here the old woman closed her eyes for a moment darius he really dead five years ago out playing basketball down the street with a group of boys who dealt other group of boys shot at em all killed darius he was fifteen she leaned against the door fifteenyearolds killin each other for crack tasha got everything in the world going for her she tells me to tell the world shes dead because shes in bad trouble she wont let nobody help her fix like i could bear her and darius both dead it would kill me i cant pull off such a lie for her i aint doing it no aint doing it you find her please shes running because of what happened to paul bellini vernetta said as they drove away but why would a woman whose brother was killed by drug dealers take up with a drug lord she didnt know bellinis business she knows enough to be scared so shes asking her grandmother to do clumsy lying for her claudia said can you ask hpd to look for her if shes a witness or shes charged in a crime but if shes left willingly and doesnt want to be found well you hire another pi to find her what if shes left willingly no claudia said you said another pi yeah i was thinking of your friend harry like him looking for eve michaels frank polo said something about another pi when she was getting ready to leave his house another like hed known of a first one harry perhaps whit had told frank about harry of course yes probably the thought irritated her brain like a thorn prick whoever killed harry had stripped him of his id possibly of his notes on the eve michaels case none of those had been found by the police and she knew harry kept his notes with him there was a simple way to test her theory have they identified all the prints at the chyme doyle murder scene i dont know gomez would i dont even know if they have suspect prints to compare to how quickly could gomez get prints done she asked why that photo of frank polo thats on my back seat claudia said lets put it under the powder see what shows at ten on monday night the front door of frank and eves house stood open a rectangle of glowing light in the darkness whit stepped inside franks phone call to him had been quiet and calm bucks is here and wants to talk we have a plan make no mention you have the film he doesnt need to know come alone and so whit had walked past the doctors and nurses and families facing down death at the icu left a sleeping gooch behind and driven to franks house in charlies borrowed lexus come on in a voice called from the den unhurried relaxed whit walked into the den and bucks sat at the edge of the couch pistol in hand but pointed down at the floor his suit was rumpled his tie gone the black eye whit gave him in full bruising bloom you want your mom back he asked where is she you bastard whit said but calm frank knows bucks said so wheres frank im here whit frank stood in the doorway truce bucks said because were all buddies now were all on the same side got a proposal for you whit waited you could have brought the police bucks said you didnt i could kill you i wont we got to trust each other at least for the next few hours he smiled i admire your steadfast focus give me a minute to come up with a compliment about you whit said maybe an hour peace treaty okay i know you dont have the money so why help us now whit glanced over at frank need good deeds for extra credit joses the bad guy bucks said we get your mom we get the money and then were all fine and we all go our separate ways yes whit and never open our mouths you want mommy with you right not dead or rotting in jail or worrying about getting whacked i want a nice little house on a beach that doesnt extradite where is she whit said a warehouse off mississippi street not far from the port used to be used by a south american importer who brought up fake precolombian art guatemalan weaving hippie crap frank said you know this how frank got a paid tip it cost me a thousand in cash whit frank said quietly a regular dealer who is a good customer at the topaz and liked paul told me joses started to put word on the street he wants to deal the coke the information is valid id like to talk to this informant whit said he doesnt want to talk to you though you can appreciate that cant you whit frank said be cool whit that warehouse if they dont have eve there we force them to tell us where shes at so our solution is simple whit said we call the police have them raid the warehouse arrest everybody that will get eve killed or in prison for the rest of her life you dont get your mom either way remember jose knows about your mom and montana whit frank said you dont want jose caught but cutting a deal with prosecutors that hurts your mom bucks asked what about montana whit said never mind he watched frank no police bucks said jose and i got our own issues to settle he killed paul right whit its simple we attack the warehouse rescue eve force jose to turn over the money jose has the money whit you were right its the only explanation hes got it all he killed doyle and your friend harry we get eve and then we all part ways frank crossed his arms and the two of you are millionaires whit said you too if you want bucks said but your mother is safe whit she can be with you frank said the police dont have anything hard on her and if they do we can hide her for a long while with that money you wont lose her again i dont want any of that cash whit said none of it i like you more and more bucks said so whats the plan whit said getting into bed with the devil you and me bucks said we go there kick ass save your mom ill stay here frank said no whit said after a moment you come with us i want to whit frank said but im not a young man im not good with guns youre coming with us frank whit said end of discussion three am tuesday morning and they were on the loop and frank polo sat in the back of the jag fighting down the temptation gnawing at him bucks drove whit sitting next to him it would be easy to blast whits head open nuzzle the warm bloodied gun barrel against bucks neck get him to pull over kill him take the jag and head down to galveston island wait for the bank to open in the earlymorning light open the big safedeposit box where hed hidden the five million that was a siren song that played constantly in franks ear but now was the time for selfcontrol to be cool because the money without eve was nice but not what he wanted if frank thought about eve too much he would cry and he hated that he hoped it had ended quickly for her if she were dead painlessly a single bullet in the brain he knew she wouldnt have screamed or begged if she could help it she was stonesolid stronger and better than him just as he had told whit but he believed she was alive he wished it hadnt unfolded this way it wasnt supposed to his plan was to frame bucks cleanly for killing richard doyle plant a little of the cash in bucks condo a hundred thousand to make him look guilty urge paul to have bucks whacked and then within a year or so part ways with the bellinis head to the west coast quietly vanish with eve but paul decided to send eve to the meeting and screwed up everything life twisted back on you but a smart guy could make it work out in the end it was the kind of selfboosting thought bucks lived by but it was true five million in cash to see him through retirement an extra bit to finance cutting a new record dance beats were back in tony bennett after all still wowed the kids he could be tony bennett with a beat have sexy backup dancers wear a suit that made him look cool and trim eve in the front row every night in vegas clapping for him he could see it but saving eve maybe that wouldnt work all this was going to do was to get bucks killed and whit caught and maybe dead because that was his deal with jose trade whit and bucks for eve that was okay because if jose won bucks and whit were dead and if bucks and whit won theyd see jose had no money but they wouldnt couldnt blame frank bucks would still have to kill whit and frank would kill bucks do it all in front of eve so shed think hed avenged her sons death thatd be good now he was halfway to free free if he didnt dwell on richard doyle begging him not to shoot saying he was a father didnt think about the pi giving him a glare of such defiant bravery frank almost couldnt pull the trigger didnt remember how hed wanted to vomit after hed killed them then how he wanted to scream at the top of his lungs as he drove away with five million in cash knowing he and eve would finally be on their way the plan hadnt worked out exactly right but it was going to work out tonight if he didnt lose his nerve he watched the back of whits head even the guys head reminded him of eve that slight tilt of it when he listened eve could never know he was behind her sons death hed comfort her when this was done take her shopping get her a puppy whatever she wanted frank started to hum his favorite of his hits when you walk away thinking that bucks and whit each trying to outmacho the other in the face of what was coming werent doing nearly a good enough job watching their backs a few cars streamed past them on the mighty highways constellations of lights spread across the coastal plains bleared by fog and mist at another point in our lives whit bucks said we might have been friends bucks drove easily fingertips barely on the wheel of the jag the night traffic was intermittent along the loop bucks had a tape playing in the console but it wasnt music a low thin cajoling voice of a man on the tape and when you visualize your goal you actualize your goal thats how you make the life you dream dramatic pause the life you lead frank sat in the back seat mad about coming scared whit thought but making a real effort not to show it whit glanced back at frank he hummed gazing into the night gave whit a wan smile friends yes perhaps as babies whit said hows gooch bucks asked better him i like bucks said i couldve used about a dozen of him with paul kiko wouldnt have messed with us then but kiko had you on his side whit said what else did he need that was an extremely temporary arrangement bucks said you betrayed your best friend whit said you wont have a qualm about shooting me and frank and eve if this rescue works out so understand this i took precautions a lot of them before i stepped into the snake pit tonight and if i get screwed over so do you precautions frank repeated a thin little smile came and went on bucks face like whit was trying a highschoolers bluff in hopes of being cool the only precautions you need to worry about bucks said is doing what i tell you wrong whit said youre not in charge i know the warehouse bucks said you dont you want to walk straight in and get your ass shot off listen to me and ill tell you the layout whit waited these warehouses the bellinis used one like it before a few blocks over the layouts are all the same it has two bays for the trucks has a glass door on the side theres a little office space off from the storage area probably thats where theyre keeping eve we go in through the office door bucks said frank too if he wants to go if hes got his dick screwed on now your dicks on now right frank whit said ha ha frank said walk right in whit said no bucks said probably have guards watching the lot well take care of them first take care of whit said shoot if we have to bucks said you want your mommy back right he didnt quite make it a sneer you know you must create your own moral center whit you cant get that from your parents then what whit said storm the door no go in quiet if we can shoot anyone we see we dont like grab eve grab jose grab the money if its there if its not then joses my worry not yours hell talk whit was silent he wondered how close a coffin would feel if you were really truly dead it was a mercy if you couldnt know the tight quarters of the casket the bare inch of air between your lips and the coffin silk then wondering if he could stand by and watch people get shot not innocent people but still he couldnt not in cold blood so he would have to change bucks plan what if we get caught whit asked dont be dense bucks said they kill us bucks turned onto the clinton exit off turned right onto mississippi the warehouse was one in a long chain of dreary industrial buildings the lamps giving off faint light thats it bucks said he drove on by four blocks then turned into a small office building two cars were parked far back in the shadows men inside them waiting oh shit frank said whits guts turned to slush this wasnt part of the deal frank said i took precautions too boys bucks said and in the moonlight his smile was ugly you dont need to know names bucks told whit and frank as the men stood in the cold of the night behind the office building but whit could guess one man looked like the guy whod shot at him on the chase on the loop owlish eyes watching whit with the careful regard of an accountant frank had said he was called the wart two other men one heavy the other lanky and wearing dreadlocks associates of the dead mackay whit guessed looking for a little payback no one said hello too many frank said to bucks too much not what we discussed whit thought too much for what we need all the strength we can get jesus frank quit worrying about how much moneys left at the end frank hush and let the men work bucks said guys heres the drill he explained they wanted eve alive they wanted the money mostly they wanted jose peron who was responsible for mackays death and who had stolen five million from its rightful owners weve got a goal men a goal we can reach his voice deepened and whit realized he sounded like the low murmuring on the tape in his car talking in the same empty cadence of blank reassurance he described how they would approach the lot fast and silent if jose and eve werent inside theyd take what was of value and leave keep an eye open for any dvds jose stored info on them i need ill pay a bonus for any you find in the dark behind bucks frank nudged whit bucks turned to whit you want to go first shes your mama thats fine whit said dont worry whit said bucks ill be right behind you they moved down a maze of alleys that reeked of dog piss and uncollected trash too many of the offices and warehouses had been empty for too long dragged down in the latest economic stumble a cloying mist hung in the night whit had the gun gooch had given him another gun tucked in the small of his back and a small knife strapped above his ankle all from charlies weapons collection but the heavyset jamaican walking by him toted an assault rifle and he felt unprepared this is it bucks said the six men hung back in the alleyway surveying the parking lot of the warehouse a high fence topped with barbed wire separated the lot from the adjoining side road an office light gleamed through the glass door three cars were parked nearby whit recognized one a little red honda tasha strongs car that shed driven over to frank and eves he started to speak thought and stayed quiet they waited ten minutes no movement or sound in the lot no guard whit said we go over the fence then through the side truck bay the service door quietly i got skeleton keys surprise them surprise is critical bucks said they waited another two minutes no sign of movement trevor wart go bucks whispered and the thin jamaican and the wart hurried forward trevor lifted the wart up high wart started cutting the stretch of barbed wire at the top of the fencing trevor balanced wart on his palms and the ribbon of wire curled away as wart moved down the fence then trevor boosted wart over the fence he eased himself down on the other side carefully then dropped to the asphalt whit bucks and heavy jamaican began to scale the fence trevor helping them frank hung back frank shake your ass up here bucks said frank started to climb tentatively whit was over the fence trying to be silent in making his jump down when the shadow bulleted out from the other side of the lot beelining toward wart who was crouched over waiting for the rest of them whit said oh no loudly as he dropped to the pavement next to bucks and the bullet a sleek doberman the color of night launched itself at wart the dog took him down in the shoulders hammered him to the concrete a horrible tearing noise rose from their struggle a spray of blood shot across the asphalt teeth sunk into flesh and ripped with ingrained precision wart screamed once as the dog yanked him around by the neck as fangs found new hold bucks and trevor fired the dog yelped twisted then bucks put a bullet right in the dogs skull wart lay there groaning cupping his hands under his chin the blood welling whit turned and the second dog was arrowing right for him eyes locked to his throat snout down ten paces away and whit fired the silencer bucks had attached to his gun making a softbark sound firing once twice catching the dog in its leap the bullets tearing dogflesh from ribs and it fell thudding into him knocking him to the ground but dying whit climbed out from under the dog it made a last feeble attempt to snap to fend off the dark then shivered into stillness they know were here now bucks said rush it full frontal he and the jamaicans charged the office door whit kneeling by wart he was fading gone as whit touched his wrist the carotid and jugular torn his throat nothing but wound the neck broken his eyes were still open in shock at the sudden enditall turn whit glanced back over at the fence frank was gone fled into the dark of the alley whit turned and headed for the building a couple of sharp pops from bucks gun shattered the door glass loud in the quiet of the industrial park bucks reached inside flipped the locks they were in heavy taking the lead and whit coming in last the entry office was dimly lit an empty desk a mountain of old newspapers scattered around the room the smell of gasoline rich unexpected filled the air two gas canisters stood on the side of the desk whit stopped the canisters were full but capped waiting to be used or moved bucks gestured down the hall and heavy jamaican bolted down it laying a spray of suppressing fire tearing chunks out of the wall and ceiling at the end of the hall a metal warehouse door stood shut wait whit called theyre torching the warehouse but heavy and trevor and bucks were blasting the door charging into the warehouse proper and now there was an answering hail of shots an intense staccato of bullets and screams he barreled down the hall after trevor and bucks and went through the door a storm of gunfire met his ears battle in full rage shrieks the horrible sound of metal impacting flesh they had been waiting for them two men taking cover behind boxes twenty feet beyond the door emptying rifles heavy stumbling as blood erupted from his chest no sign of trevor but then the men behind the boxes screamed fell bucks charged past a wall of boxes and gave out a bloodcurdling yell more gunfire erupted to whits right from two different guns a moment of quiet then bullets shot by his head and whit dove down skidding on the concrete floor crabbing for cover behind a set of crates near the door spanish scrawled along their sides bullets ripping into the wood he heard his mother scream his name whit eve screamed get out whit stayed down on the floor his gun close to his head she must have seen him come through the door he hadnt seen her he heard sobbing then he heard a soft cussing bucks in pain angrily moaning but no more shooting over in thirty seconds that felt like thirty hours he closed his eyes forced himself to breathe quietly whit a voice called jose perons come out now or i shoot her hell shoot me anyway eve said her voice calmer now ordering him get out whit risked a look past the crating the warehouse space was huge but most of the shooting had taken place in an open area within thirty feet of the door wooden crates stood stacked haphazardly and jose and his group had quickly retreated behind the boxes a forklift sat idle in a corner a small space had been cleared behind a tower of boxes and worn chairs and a desk were grouped there heavy lay in a heap by a desk half his face gone two men whit had not seen before dead near him heads and chests bloodied messes heavy had kept shooting after he went down probably taking the two men with him and the concrete floor was scarred and chipped with bullet hits whit could not see trevor but trevor wasnt shooting and he hoped the man had found cover tasha strong stood over bucks a gun locked at his temple relieving him of his pistol bucks bled from a leg wound had his palms open in surrender and jose stood looking to whits right listening like a wolf for the scrabble of the rabbit in the grass whit aimed at jose who didnt see him but stepped behind the forklift no clear shot whit ducked back behind the crate im counting to three then im shooting your mother if you dont come out toss the gun out arms up jose said one two counting fast im counting to three whit shouted and if you dont release bucks and my mother im calling the rest of our team outside and telling them to start your office fire for you excellence bucks yelled then groaned thats real excellence shut up tasha said shut your everrunning mouth wheres my movie bucks said jose you bastard a shot rang out and bucks shut up do you not know what be quiet means tasha said but jose had stopped his countdown lets all be cool wheres the money whit he called you tell me and ill let you and your mother go whit said nothing he thinks we still have the money but thats crazy he has it no clearly he didnt and the realization froze whits blood frank running from the fence once bucks changed the plans frank being more than a coward maybe frank hadnt gotten any tip from the street maybe frank cut a deal with jose to deliver whit and bucks he could hear franks voice smooth into a phone yeah say you know about montana thatll prove to him you really have his mom jose wanted eve to help him get the rest of the bellini money for them and she wouldnt do it so give them whit because eve would help them if they had a gun to his head give them bucks to tidy up the last of the loose ends and frank was set thats why he objected to the extra men bucks brought frank thought tonight would be a walkin and exchange for all intents and purposes some separate deal cut between him and jose whit had thought jose knew about montana because he killed harry but whoever killed harry could have coached jose frank never knew about montana until he saw harry chymes notes franks left us with guns pointing at each others throats while he has the money whit eased back from the crates the stack stood five feet high next to a long wall of shelving and he abandoned his original position ducked down tried to move silently under the shelving his pistol in front of him whit eve yelled you shut it down tasha said a hard slap scout tasha called the little nickname shed given him back at the club a thousand years ago come on now make it easy on her and you okay then silence whit knew that in the sudden quiet jose was hunting him moving into the maze of crates not waiting for him to show himself he moved further back along the wall heading south and in a bit of open space he spotted trevor dead on the floor eyes glassed a puddle of brainy gunk underneath his head hed come around in a swath through the boxes caught the two guys shooting at heavy killing them before catching a head shot an assault rifle lay by his side whit inched over knowing he was putting himself into the open but he didnt see tasha didnt see jose he carefully picked up the rifle pulled it close to him crabbed back behind a crate it was wicked an ar he guessed the kind popular in law enforcement and the military a sixteeninch barrel maybe thirty rounds in a magazine he thought claudia had told him once no idea how many trevor had used the rifle could be empty he checked the selector lever it was set on auto near him was a set of metal stairs that led to a catwalk that cut straight over the warehouse space at the level of the catwalk an array of fluorescent lights dimmed but active gleamed climb up there and he would be a dove in the sky an easy target but he was getting backed into a corner he could dash across the remaining open space of the warehouse that he could reach pray they couldnt see him in time and then what he heard footsteps a soft tread coming his way in the dim light he backed into the stairway trying not to clang the rifle barrel against the steel looking back he spotted red metal behind him beyond the stairs more canisters of gasoline stacked near another set of crates weird why gas where they had their drugs why werent they getting the cocaine out of here and onto the street as fast as they could perhaps the coke was gone but no these were the pottery crates that kiko had smuggled the goods in eve had said the dope was in pottery but hardly a crate opened the drugs staying put tasha and jose didnt want to deal the cocaine they were going to burn it hence the gasoline and flammables in the front office or he could they were going to kill him and eve he could not hide longer than perhaps another two minutes he made his choice he was going to kill people now including himself and he fought down the sharp throb of fear and regret in his chest because there was no other route no other way at the least jose wouldnt get away whit closed his eyes thought of his father his brothers claudia gooch eve said his goodbyes he opened a canister gently tipped it over let the fuel glug out onto the floor whit come out now twenty feet away from him you give us the money well let you go were really not the bad guys here whit upended another container of gasoline then a third and a fourth scurried back from the spreading puddle the smell rose like swamp gas jose had to know what he was doing he backed up into stairs that led to the catwalk that crossed the space looked up saw the fluorescents still dimmed were not the bad guys jose repeated were doing good were all about stopping the drug dealing man whit stopped counted the lights wondered how much they would spark either from the electricity being shorted or bullets hitting metal joses voice drew closer we call ourselves public service whit we rid the world of this scourge of drugs your mothers joined us willingly isnt that right eve shes nodding whit we could use a resourceful guy like you on our side dont be afraid true nobility is exempt from fear what we do is truly noble lets talk ten feet now if you join us jose started whit fired the assault rifle at the canisters stacked by the fuel hed poured they blossomed into flame then he spun and ran up the steel steps fired a long burst at the ceiling at the array of fluorescents the lights shattered sparking from the gunfire plummeting into the spreading gasoline debris hit his shoulder cut his arms he reached the top of the catwalk and heard the whoohumph of the gasoline catching in full fury felt the sudden heat beneath his feet the lights flickered in the other half of the warehouse and running hard along the catwalk harder than he ever had he saw his mother handcuffed to a folding chair tasha shoving her toward the office door jose screaming below him caught in the flush of fire screaming screaming and then not bucks limped after the women his pants leg torn and bloodied whit ran down the stairs at the other end of the catwalk thinking christ was i stupid the fire moves faster than me and then he was on the floor the crates erupting into fire as more canisters exploded the warehouses very air seeming to ignite he dropped the empty assault rifle grabbed bucks arm hurried him through the splintered warehouse door heat rose like a storm surge behind them they ran through the outer office into the thin rain of the night eve lay on the ground tasha standing over her forcing her to her feet stop whit yelled he grabbed the sig tucked into his pants tried to bring it to bear tasha spun and fired at them as they came through the busted door and bucks howled staggered fell to his knees whit jumped from the concrete steps no place for cover fired at tasha missed and then tasha had her gun at eves head scout back off the heat flooded the air behind him rising to an inferno he aimed the gun at tasha at her shoulder eve dragged her feet dragged the chair she was bound to trying to slow tasha pull her off balance let her go whit yelled you let me walk tasha shouted or she dies he moved faster toward them eve screamed whit run tasha aimed at whit fired as eve swatted at her arm and the bullet cracked inches past his head but eve and tasha were too close together for him to shoot get away from my mother whit shouted you let me walk tasha screamed and whit said fine fine go what tasha screamed disbelieving he turned the gun up away from her palms open go but dont kill my mother please dont do to me what was done to you okay eve said tasha backed away from them both and whit thought what are you doing shes guilty as hell dont let her go but letting her go meant saving his mother tasha ran whit hurried to eves side put himself between tasha and eve tasha bolted to her honda barreled the car through the closed gates windshield breaking metal screeching but then on the street and careening away eve was sobbing you came for me you came for me he held her for a moment then raced back over to bucks blood welled from his chest from his mouth he checked bucks pulse faint fading inside the warehouse a series of explosions shuddered fire department police would be here any second bucks opened his eyes did i get bucks said looking hard into whits eyes well get an ambulance bucks okay hold on did i get the money and then his eyes went vacant empty as a useless platitude whit closed bucks eyes and pulled the jags keys from the dead mans pocket we got to go mom we got to go he steadied his mothers arm shot the handcuff off the chair he hurried her through the nowbroken gates ran her back through the alleys to where the cars were hidden one car was already gone frank and a hot wire he decided they got in bucks jaguar and whit tore out of the lot headed down mississippi toward clinton in the distance they heard the rising whine of a fire engine whit she said oh god i love you she clutched his arm wouldnt let go mom let go i got to stickshift and im not good at it he yelled and it made her laugh a long hysterical laughter that put her low in the seat as he shot the jag onto loop where she asked were leaving town he said we are leaving houston mom right fricking now but frank frank is a lying murdering piece of shit whit said and eve went silent she held onto his arm shivering crying squeezing his arm like she couldnt believe he was there he steered the battered jaguar onto west toward austin and san antonio she spoke again when houston was well behind them the road an empty black band except for the occasional eighteenwheeler the gleam of the truck stops of brookshire ahead on the horizon he held the steering wheel in a death grip the money so where is the money she said i cant help but want to know he glanced over at her and now he could see the wreck her mouth was her lips badly cut her jaw a solid bruise frank has it has had the money all along oh christ frank no it doesnt matter mom it doesnt matter okay it doesnt matter were safe now she started to cry dont let them take me away from you whit okay dont let them take me from you they arrived in san antonio by seven in the morning and found a small motel she didnt want to be alone so he got a room with twin beds and while she showered he drove to a nearby target waited for it to open and bought them cheap jeans sneakers underwear shirts duffel bags when he got back to the hotel she was clean but sitting in her dirty clothes he showered while she changed and then he drove her to a nearby emergency room the doctor was a young pakistani woman who gave whit a fierce accusing glare as she inspected his mothers bruises what happened my boyfriend beat me up eve said my son came and rescued me she gave whit a little smile my word the doctor said checking in her mouth he pulled out two teeth broke two with pliers eve said you should file charges the doctor suggested perhaps later eve said i beat him up whit said good for you the young doctor cleaned and stitched up eves lip gave her painkillers and made an emergency appointment for them with an oral surgeon on call with the hospital while the surgeon worked on eves damaged teeth whit sat in the waiting room watching the texas cable news channel the report on the fire came third on the update two people found dead in the parking lot of a warehouse investigators sifting through the rubble had found at least two more remains it appeared to be arson and one of the dead had been identified as gregory buckman a former energis executive who had become of interest to the police after a recent attack at his home a second man as yet unidentified had been mauled to death by two dobermans who were also found killed police suspected the announcer said that the killings and fire were drugrelated they would find nothing left of jose he closed his eyes killing jose strangely didnt bother him it was almost as if he hadnt done it eve had told him about public service what jose had told her and he could not shake the thought that in letting tasha go he had released a woman who however misguided was trying to do good justice wasnt often a straight line but he wasnt sure what he had done was justice any more than what jose or tasha had done the oral surgeon took his time with eve and when she came out she was groggy her mouth padded with cotton armed with pills that wasnt fun she mouthed need to sleep so he took her back to the hotel she lost herself in a heavy doze he checked the voice mail on his cell phone one from vernetta westbrook one from arturo gomez five from claudia he called her where are you she said i found my mom in san antonio whit is frank polo with her no theyre not together anymore she left him we found a partial of a fingerprint of polos at harrys murder site claudia said actually on the underside of harrys rental car bumper if he was wearing gloves he probably tore the latex taking off harrys plates the police are looking for polo whit you cant protect this man i promise im not he paused well come back to houston in a few days she got hurt i had to get her medical attention is she okay yes frank polo roughed her up a cold rage settled in his bones franks prints at the murder scene that devious little bastard claudia i want to tell you everything im not sure i can because i have to take care of my mom first when you come back to houston you have to talk to the police and the das office you understand that ill call right now and set up a time to meet he said hows gooch continuing to improve continuing to not cooperate and greg buckman is dead really you dont know anything about that do you whit there was a coldness in her voice hed never heard before no he said watching his mother i dont come home whit this is over now he said i will claudia thank you im going back to port leo today whit without gooch i cant take off more time call me when you get home and she hung up without a goodbye he thought of calling her back but instead called charlie fulghams cell phone are you back home yes should i not be your house is safe now are we all still your clients still got my three dollars in my pocket charlie said buy some legal pads charlie fast i dont want to talk to the police whit eve said it was wednesday morning and she was curled on the hotel bed shed taken another vicodin but it hadnt kicked in hard he sat down next to her touched her shoulder where would frank run anywhere if hes got five million i really dont know dont lie to me mom he said he touched her swollen jaw you and frank strike me as people with contingency plans where is he i told you whitman i dont know he put you in mortal danger when he could have cleared your name in an instant he ran when it was time to save you whit said he doesnt really love you he loved me she said just not enough like how i loved you when you were little just not enough there is no parallel he said please why didnt you tell me you were a judge she said surprising him he kissed the top of her head i didnt want to scare you off she managed a smile im proud of you really proud of you honey he felt a little kindle of pride that died instantly sure you should be i killed a man let a criminal walk free lied to one of my best friends lied to the police im a real pride and joy mom but you saved your mother she said you saved me were going back to houston tomorrow okay she said suddenly surrendering im ready she closed her eyes sleepy again im actually very clean you know charlies going to represent us if needed that should be good for laughs she said and she went back to sleep the manifesto from public service appeared in six newspapers nationwide thursday morning including the houston chronicle they claimed responsibility for the deaths of five drug lords including paul bellini and kiko grace and three others in los angeles philadelphia and new york in the past month two of the dead had been found with rolledup money in their mouths a signature of the group the manifesto was both a scathing indictment of the governments war on drugs for not being tough enough and against the drug trade for its relentless waste of human lives police efforts and money the statement held a chilling promise we target the casual buyer for you are the cash cow of the drug trade if we see you buying drugs even simply a joint to share with a friend we will shoot you and ending it with god defend the right william shakespeare whit wondered where tasha was if she had written the letter or if jose had before he died the tv pundits had a field day on this twisting new front on the drug war when whit met charlie at his house charlie hugged eve shook whits hand and pointed to the letter in the paper this sweeties charlie said is called manna from heaven two hours later they sat in goochs private hospital room an artful arrangement by charlie whit and eve sat next to goochs bed arturo gomez two of his detectives and vernetta westbrook on the other side of the bed my clients will cooperate fully charlie fulgham said the partyloud shirt from his standup routine was gone replaced by a gray armani suit fitted to the millimeter the police officers all looked at charlie like they knew him and didnt like what they saw gomez started all right mr mosley actually you should refer to him as your honor charlie said judge mosley is a highly respected magistrate gomez surrendered on the point can you fill in the gaps for us judge mosley its really simple whit said and he told them he had hired harry chyme to find his mother harry told them that she was in houston he believed living under the name eve michaels and he and gooch came to houston to find her they never heard again from harry but after making inquiries at a club harry said her boyfriend managed found eve she agreed to meet us at pie shack whit said and this was the risky part gooch could go to jail for this when he had saved their lives saved the life of the young hostage the gunman had taken but ms michaels was followed there charlie said stepping smoothly in by gunmen possibly related to this public service group vigilantes mistakenly seeking to harm ms michaels due to her connection via frank polo to tommy bellinis businesses we certainly know that public service had declared war on the bellini family right or wrong gomez grilled all three of them but they stuck to their story with relentless precision they ran like everyone else and in fact went into hiding because eve was afraid the bellinis or these gunmen were after her if the bellinis did illegal activities eve said i didnt know about it i was the accountant for five of tommy bellinis companies and they are all perfectly legit if his son started dabbling in the drug trade or screwing around with his fathers companies it has nothing to do with me whats the relationship of the alvarez insurance firm to the bellinis here eve threw them a bone to chew i know tommy loaned money to the alvarez family when their company was in bad shape about to close he was a silent partner they sold a lot of life insurance but they did their own accounting i had nothing to do with them as a business she paused they always seemed like a nice family but you lived in a house owned by the bellini family this from vernetta that was provided to frank polo he was an old family friend so was i thats not illegal whits throat thickened as vernetta said mr guchinskis van was found at the paul bellini murder site the bellinis grabbed me when i stopped by eves house to pick up her things gooch said she didnt want to go back there she thought frank polo would force her to stay paul and his guys beat me up detained me paul bellini wanted mom to trade for gooch they knew about the shooting they were afraid gooch and i were involved with public service whit said they tried to get me to give them details on public service but i didnt know jack they pumped me full of drugs thinking if i were looped id talk gooch said whit said paul told me we could meet we did he had gooch in the trunk of his car he thought i was bringing my mother to him but of course i wasnt i drove goochs van paul and i were talking and he was shot he was clearly dead i ran and took his car because the shooter fired at me twice and i couldnt abandon gooch we took off and didnt call the police vernetta said i asked whit not to eve said because i was afraid and because hes a judge and i didnt want him to lose his job i take full responsibility for that decision whit said they asked more detailed questions about pauls shooting and whit answered truthfully of course you could charge judge mosley with fleeing a scene of a crime charlie said of course in doing so he saved his own life and that of mr guchinski he didnt report the crime gomez said at his mothers request theyd already been traumatized by one shooting detective and paul bellini and his thugs were already beyond help charge them if you like but then my clients will stop talking gomez made a noise in his throat the death at the greystoke vernetta said detective tarrant here is in charge of that investigation tarrant was a thin woman hair pulled back in a modest ponytail a man matching judge mosleys description retrieved a van from the parking valets two rooms were abandoned there belonging to an emily smith we were at the greystoke eve said but i dont know any emily smith i was going to meet frank there i wanted a public place because i was afraid of him but we didnt stay whit left because he wanted to see a friend of his a police officer from his hometown to explain to her what wed been through after whit left i thought i saw one of the gunmen from the diner a man in dreadlocks i left the hotel and called whit on his cell phone whit rushed back and picked me up i decided then to leave town he took me home frank was there i thought it best that whit leave us to talk and at my request he did frank was calm as we talked but he drank a bunch of wine and became violent he beat me knocked my teeth out he drank more passed out and i went to san antonio whered you stay gomez asked in my car after a couple of days i called whit he came and got me her mercedes was back in its garage at the house where it had been since gooch was caught and they had dumped bucks jag a mile from the burntout warehouse late last night after my mother left town whit said the bellinis left us alone intentionally or were occupied with attacks on them by public service we didnt know what was happening the detectives watched them in silence whit thought he saw a tug of resignation in vernetta westbrooks eyes your honor she said you told claudia salazar you thought greg buckman killed harry chyme and richard doyle you never explained why frank polo suggested it to me im sure now in an effort to put attention off of him this isnt complicated my clients were innocents caught up in the crossfire between the bellinis and public service charlie said ms michaels has offered her full cooperation with the fraud examiners in the das office if they want her help in identifying possible points where illegal bellini funds became legitimate revenue but i get immunity and so do whit and gooch eve said i can help you sift through every bellini financial record if you want to go after them otherwise youre on your own and youll find it i suspect very difficult to make a case against tommy and mary pat bellini that gets you their assets gomez and vernetta exchanged a glance charlie said you can try and make a case against my clients on rather circumstantial evidence or you can get unparalleled access to the bellini finances and also build a case against public service who are nothing more than selfproclaimed domestic terrorists choose your headlines ladies and gentlemen i wish youd stuck to the stage charlie vernetta said daddy did you hear what i said whit said i found mom whit broke the news as gently as possible to babe sitting at their breakfast table irina stared at him as though hed announced he had cancer himself what i found her over a week ago thats why ive been in houston we came back this morning babe blinked took a deep fortifying breath ellen she wants to see you whit said would you like to see her whit irina interrupted she moved from her chair a sickly smile of shock on her face to stand behind babe put her hand on his shoulders your father this is too much for him im okay babe patted her hand its okay he closed his eyes passed a hand over his face do i want to see her but not asking the question of anyone but himself when i asked you said yes you said you wanted to ask her why she did what she did whit said how the hell did you find her babe said long long story for later daddy babes lip trembled he put his hands over his face this was a bad idea whit said but if you wanted to make peace with her before the hands came down peace yes babe said with sudden hard resolve i would like to see her bring her in he gave a jagged little laugh why not lifes too short whit went out to the car where eve sat she followed him into the house touching the side of the door glancing around as if cataloging every change the house had weathered in her absence she walked into the kitchen behind whit hello babe eve said babe stared at her for several long moments whats with your hair he finally said i went red she said it dont suit you babe said he ran fingertips over his chemobald head but then i got a new look too dad maybe mom would like a cup of coffee would that be okay whit said can you be trusted around hot beverages trying to deflate the tension im not fixing breakfast for this woman irina usually the voice of calm reason announced whit your papa doesnt need this upset for gods sakes then a torrent of russian babe whispered in the babyish russian he knew kissed irinas cheek we moved the coffeemaker while youve been gone ellie its on the other counter help yourself eve didnt move i wont stay im sorry i left you babe i want you and the boys to know that it had nothing to do with you it was me the situation was such i thought it best i not come home so i chose not to im sorry for the pain i caused you the boys she stopped ran a finger along her lip im sorry i dont know what else to say two words dont sound adequate i know silence babe cleared his throat you know they didnt stop crying for a real long time wondering why their mama would leave them do you have any idea what you tell small kids why they matter why theyre still worthwhile human beings why theyre still lovable when their own mother cant be bothered to love them i took them to disneyland six months after you left for two weeks i thought it would help me herding all six of them trying to pretend rides and candy and mickey mouse could make up for you gone jesus we go they dont see anything but moms with their kids i was cruel trying to help them now his voice trembled i dont hate you for ripping my heart out but what you did to my boys his voice broke treating my sons as disposable is unforgivable ill ask for their forgiveness eve said yours is a separate issue you dont want my forgiveness babe said you show your sorry face in time to stand over my grave and decide you want to play mom thirty years too late he shook his head at whit whit you lose one you go find the other im not trying to replace you dad for gods sakes whit took a calming breath im trying to help you both youre my parents make your peace please whit eve said your father

sure was for me i said what i wanted babe got up from his chair shes dead to me she is back in our lives whit said she is not dead if yelling makes you happy babe eve said yell away i deserve it she dabbed at her eyes with her sleeve and i thought the chemo made me puke babe said tell me sweetie eve said to irina now that hes retired what does he talk about because i never heard a single word other than oil business golf oil golf and oh yes oil with a hint of golf it was enough to drive you nuts did you know he wouldnt change a diaper six kids and he wouldnt change a single diaper irina said very quietly i dont know you ellen and i dont want to were staying in the guest house whit said his chest full and hot he had never seen the look now on his fathers face dead love resurrected into absolute unforgiving hate just for tonight no babe said yes whit said i pay rent you dont have to see her if you dont want i wont stay here if its going to upset him eve said you know i did want to apologize i dont care if you believe me since when do you care about occupying the high ground babe said tell me whit did she hug you the moment she saw you he gave a jagged laugh does she think shes still in the will dad she came thats all that matters yeah right youre not gonna drive a wedge between me and my sons ellie babe said especially in the last five minutes of my life you hurt my boys again ill kill you i owe whit my life hurting him is the last thing i would ever do she turned for the door waited for whit i wont bother you again babe give him time whit said yeah hes got time to spare eve said the day had bloomed into bright sunshine and they sat on a deck at the waters end an old bar on the beach the other patrons were tourists and winter texans a quiet group eve didnt sip her beer put me in a trailer ill tell everyone im from michigan ill fit right in for the next month or so theres a plan this secret between us eve said its a nasty thing isnt it living with what you know and you dont tell whit sipped his beer yes ive been outlining my resignation letter in my head why what good does resigning do stay on the bench keep doing good i cant i killed for you in selfdefense screw the law books saving your mother is instinct she tasted her beer they had survived both the mob and the possibility of prosecution but he felt emptied his mother smiled a lot at him like she was seeing herself in him truly for the first time whit saw the bar door open claudia step outside onto the deck she headed straight toward him toward eve a family reunion claudia said she didnt pull up a chair but she gave eve a quick dismissive glance then looked back at whit its been a few days since we spoke how are you whit asked did you lose my phone number in the past week she said i only got back this morning this is your mother claudia said statement not question yes eve michaels mom this is my friend claudia salazar eve offered her hand claudia let three beats pass then she took it with the barest politeness whit speaks so highly of you eve said does he claudia said i used to be able to say the same about him until he threw away everything he stood for really eve said i suspect he stands for something greater than you know im sitting right here while you talk about me whit said i know what you are claudia said to eve i dont believe for two seconds that you were tommy bellinis simpleminded accountant who didnt know squat claudia i totally understand why youre upset whit said its okay son eve said what am i claudia her eyes were a little bright tell me a woman who would let her son ruin his life to save her own sorry ass thats enough whit said you dont know the truth because youve told it all right whit her voice was low but it was worse than if she was shouting whatever you believe about me eve said is true not that whit and i care do we honey were a team claudias jaw trembled i have nothing to say to you she glared at whit do you ever think about harry yes all the time i hope the police find frank polo really soon frank polo because he was the one bad guy in the picture right whit i didnt know he killed harry i didnt but you knew this group of people were connected to his death you knew and you said nothing every word like a small little explosion between them i told you about greg buckman whit said keeping his voice low you didnt tell anyone the whole picture all you cared about was protecting your mother i cant prove it but i know it you walked away from every value you once held dear whit like this woman walked away from you and your family i guess the acorn doesnt fall far from the tree even when the tree hauls ass nice that you have this moral clarity about my life whit said you know harry has a mother too two sisters an exwife people who loved him he was worth about a dozen of her she jerked her head at eve can we please discuss this later he said why are there voters here your honor maybe ill keep my opinions to myself maybe not i dont know yet we still have to work together for now but i dont like it im grateful to you for trying to help me whit said aware now of people on the deck starting to stare screw your gratitude you made your choice whit and im making mine it was nice knowing you once claudia turned walked out she tried to slam the bar door but it was hinged to shut slowly and even the angry yank she gave it couldnt overcome the mechanism she stormed out people are very territorial about you whit eve said but her voice was subdued yes she cares about you she did she will again eve said i dont think so whit said or it will be a long road for her and me she touched his hand what have i cost you son eve asked suddenly he thought of lance gartner that boy dead from heroin in the bay his mothers pleas for whit to change the death certificate i cant go against the law he had said and a sudden hard shame rose in him whit took a long swig of his beer its okay mom its okay he took eve back to the guest house he poured good cabernet and she went into the guest bathroom came out smiling holding a bar of soap gardenia she said isnt that what you used he had bought it as a surprise for her yes she said thank you he drank wine while they made phone calls five of them with whit talking first to whits brothers teddy hung up on her when she started to speak and did not answer when they called back mark talked to her for nearly an hour david and danny werent at their homes and whit simply left them short messages saying he had important but good news and to please call anytime night or day joe talked to whit but said no on talking to eve at least for now give him time eve sipped at her wine i didnt expect hugs right away no whit felt as tired as hed ever been you want to watch a movie she studied a long line of dvds on the shelf who is monty python british comedy hilarious shed moved on to the next section of films i dont much like woody allen he whines a lot hes selfdeprecating its an art caddyshack she said that one i like so he put in the movie one of his favorites and they sat on the couch and finished the bottle of cabernet he laughed where he usually did and so did she when he was putting away the disc she said did i tell you that if any of the boys ever came looking for me i figured itd be you why fiercely independent strong like me she said no holds barred about getting what you want he was suddenly unsure if this was a compliment or not i love you whit she kissed him with a quick almost embarrassed smack on the cheek you know that dont you yeah i love you too he said the words and the idea still a little strange they stayed up late hoping for joe or teddy or the twins to call back her opening a bottle of zinfandel him drinking more and finally he dragged himself back to bed happy and dizzysick and wondering exactly what the rest of his life was going to be like he awoke suddenly hearing the soft little click of the front door shutting a wetness on his cheek the linger of a kiss the scent of gardenia he sat up in the darkness the guest house too quiet knowing it was empty he glanced at the clock am whit went to the guest bedroom she was gone he hurried out the front door and up the driveway eve stood at the curb one of his duffel bags packed and sitting at her feet where are you going he said she turned oh honey i hoped you wouldnt wake i shouldnt have kissed you goodbye but i had to where the hell are you going i have unfinished business the less you know the better she drew a hand through her hair ill be back soon you dont leave in the middle of the night if you plan on coming back his voice rose he suddenly felt as scared as a child and he forced himself to calm down i dont fit in with your life whit i dont i do love you but bullshit bullshit im calling you on your bullshit mom im grateful for everything youve done for me but i need to do this alone he saw it then you know where frank is with the money she glanced down the darkened street did he call you after what he did youd go back to him of course not but i can find him who gives a shit about that money mom youre here youre home but its five million honey five million she gave a quick little shrug probably four by now knowing frank but still whit shook his head you arent going to do this to me again out of the dark a cab from a corpus christi taxi service rolled up and stopped three houses down of course she wouldnt give the cab this address the headlights might wake him up she tried to smile at him whit honey lets not have a brutal little scene you can either let me go or tie me up but ill go eventually thats the hard bitter truth love me but dont change me into what youll love better mom and i want to change you and i cant you dont want what i call life youre going to look at me every day and see the bad things you did dont be more like me be like your father your brothers even claudia i can tell the police about james powell he said desperation rising in his voice theres no statute of limitations on murder go right ahead she gave her little shrug he threatened to kill you and your brothers if i didnt do what he said so i killed him you want me to confess to a crime there you go im not one bit ashamed of it mom you killed him for that money believe what you want do what you like lock me up throw away the key she leaned over kissed his cheek again stay good baby please dont please dont do this he said she leaned down picked up her duffel she didnt look back didnt wave he watched her get into the cab vanish into the dark eve who became ellie im breaking one of my own rules now because im close to a beach beaches are okay for me now to the police im a city girl the mosleys think of me as a beach girl but whit wont come looking for me again and he wont find me if he does the beach here at princeville is absolutely pristine and the tourists are mostly honeymooners nice kids a few golf widows sunning and reading fat novels the beach here is far prettier than the ones in texas but its so pretty it almost doesnt seem real a dream so it seems safe here i am ellie again now ellie masters eve fit like a suit faded from fashion so i shed it i stayed a while at a small hotel on the south side of kauai waiting thinking until i found a condo for rent by a landlord living in california retired lady she and her husband moved here then he died and she moved back to san francisco to be close to her grandkids i hope she decides to sell and i bet shed like cash god knows i do jacksonville florida was where frank landed it was where he spent summers as a kid visiting grandparents and he always spoke fondly of it see he broke the first rule i traced him there via a false id he thought i didnt know about hed gotten it a few years ago from the same guy who got me the emily smith cards mistake number two i found him in a beachside house a modest little bungalow and walked right up to him on his back porch one cold night and before he could say im sorry put the bullet in his face no hello no goodbye you sorry piece of trash not in the mouth like james powell but right between the wide lying eyes frank was surprised i was surprised he had as much brain as he did voice but he was never stupid my mistake the money was hidden in the house in six different places i took it and then phoned the houston police anonymously reported that i thought id seen frank polo who they were looking for at the jax address and hung up my second good deed for the day frank had laid low hadnt spent more than a few thousand and i headed down to miami caught a plane to the caymans and started recleaning the money back through a series of accounts finally i put half in an account for me half in an unnumbered account for whit mailed him a note with the bank name the account and access numbers and i love you nothing else i hoped he wouldnt give it away or refuse to touch it or call the police about it like a highminded idiot i sort of tied my boys hands he wont tell the police now because its too many questions and the money can help make up for all the trouble i caused him and his brothers their whole lives i dont have to work what with my cash settlement from frank but i get restless sitting around so i took a parttime job in a little coffee shopbookstore in hanalei its a hippie town near princeville the young people here all have dirty feet and its not the kind of hawaiian destination anyone from my previous lives would pick so i am the worlds oldest barista and i sell travel books and bestselling paperbacks to the vacationers the dirtyfeet kids all like to read beat generation writers they dont know what life lived running is trust me but most of the customers are tourists who come in once and only once and the other clerks are nice but arent nosy i say im from california where it seems half the world is from and its answer enough but every day is a terrible temptation the bookstore owner doris a really sweet lady set up an internet access on a couple of computers in the store thought itd sell more coffee and it does the hippies love it they come in and email their parents for more money but when the stores not busy i sit down and i open to a search engine and i want to type in whits name so bad i could cry i want to know hes okay but im afraid every web site you visit on that machine is recorded in a file somewhere in the world im sure of it and having made myself vanish again i dont want to risk it i would for him and him alone because if i know hes okay will that be enough will i keep from emailing him or phoning him did he get the twoplus million out of the account is he having fun with his share or did he give it all away to charity out of pointless guilt i wont ever know the temptation is like hunger hell starvation of the worst sort because you imagine that the barest crumb would keep you going but i dont for weeks and weeks i dont then i get an idea i log on using doris account her password was doris for gods sakes go to the web site for the corpus christi callertimes i dont search by whits name on the archives i search for justice of the peace how many are there in the coastal bend not many right i find articles on him still in office conducting a death inquest on a homicide over in laurel point a mention in a story on babes passing dated two weeks ago babe gone whit grieving bad i know im aching to hold him now so whits safe he stayed in office i didnt ruin him hes tough like me but it made me miss him more bad enough where i felt sick and i went home early and lay on my bed i could buy one of those prepaid call cards pay cash make it impossible to trace let him know im okay hear his voice for a minute but no he let me walk away when i needed to and its not fair me opening the door again let it be shut let me be strong to keep it shut he doesnt need me at night i rent the movies caddyshack and monty python and all those woody allen ones full of jokes only new yorkers and whit get i pretend he and i are sitting together sharing popcorn watching the movies it is all im gonna get now and it has to be enough
