look to windward by iain m banks gentile or jew o you who turn the wheel and look to windward consider phlebas who was once handsome and tall as you ts eliot the waste land iv prologue near the time we both knew i would have to leave him it was hard to tell which flashes were lightning and which came from the energy weapons of the invisibles a vast burst of bluewhite light leapt across the sky making an inverted landscape of the ragged clouds undersurface and revealing through the rain the destruction all around us the shell of a distant building its interior scooped out by some earlier cataclysm the tangled remains of rail pylons near the craters lip the fractured service pipes and tunnels the crater had exposed and the massive ruined body of the wrecked land destroyer lying half submerged in the pool of filthy water in the bottom of the hole when the flare died it left only a memory in the eye and the dull flickering of the fire inside the destroyers body quilan gripped my hand still tighter you should go now worosei another smaller flash lit his face and the oilscummed mud around his waist where it disappeared under the war machine i made a show of consulting my helms readout the ships flyer was on its way back alone the display told me that no larger craft was accompanying it while the lack of any communication on the open channel meant there was no good news to report there would be no heavy lift there would be no rescue i flipped to the closequarter tactical view nothing better to report there the confused pulsing schematics indicated there was great uncertainty in the representation a bad enough sign in itself but it looked like we were right in the line of the invisibles advance and we would soon be overrun in ten minutes maybe or fifteen or five that uncertain still i smiled as best i could and tried to sound calm i cant get to anywhere safer until the flyer gets here i said quietly neither of us can i shifted on the muddy slope trying to find a better footing a series of booms shook the air i crouched over quilan protecting his exposed head i heard debris thudding onto the slope across from us and something splashed into the water i glanced at the level of the pool in the bottom of the crater as the waves slapped against the chisel shape of the land destroyers fore armour and fell back again at least the water didnt seem to be rising any more worosei he said i dont think im going anywhere not with this thing on top of me please im not trying to be heroic and neither should you just get out now go theres still time i told him well get you out of there you were always so impatient light pulsed above us again picking out each lancing drop of rain in the darkness and you were whatever he was going to say was drowned out by another fusillade of sharp concussions the noise rolled over us as though the very air was being torn apart loud night i said as i crouched over him again my ears were ringing more light flickered to one side and close up i could see the pain in his eyes even the weathers against us quilan dreadful thunder that was not thunder oh it was there and that is lightning i said as i crouched further over him go now worosei he whispered youre being stupid i i began then my rifle slipped from my shoulder and the stock hit him on the forehead ouch he said sorry i shouldered the weapon again my fault for losing my helmet still i slapped one of the sections of track above us you gained a land destroyer he started to laugh then winced he forced a smile and rested one hand against the surface of one of the vehicles guide wheels its funny he said im not even sure if its one of ours or one of theirs you know i said neither am i i looked up at its ruptured carcass the fire inside seemed to be spreading thin blue and yellow flames were starting to show in the hole where the main turret had been the crippled land destroyer had kept its tracks on this side as it had half trundled half slid into the crater on the far side the stripped track lay flat on the craters slope a stridewide strip of flat metal sections leading up like a ramshackle escalator almost to the holes jagged lip in front of us huge guide wheels protruded from the war machines hull some supported the giant hinges of the tracks upper course others ran on the tracks beneath quilan was trapped beneath their lower level squashed into the mud with only his upper torso free our comrades were dead there were only quilan and me and the pilot of the light flyer returning to pick us up the ship just a couple of hundred kilometres above our heads could not help i had tried pulling quilan ignoring his bittenoff moans but he was held fast i had burned out my suits ag unit trying to shift the track sections trapping him and cursed our supposedly wonderful n generation projectile weapons so good for killing our own species and penetrating armour so useless for cutting through thick metal noise crackled nearby sparks flicked out of the fire in the turret aperture rising and fading in the rain i could feel the detonations through the ground transmitted by the body of the wrecked machine ammunition going off quilan said his voice strained time you went no i think whatever blew the turret off accounted for all the ammunition and i dont it could still blow up get out no im comfortable here youre what im comfortable here now youre being idiotic i am not being idiotic stop trying to get rid of me why should i youre being idiotic stop calling me idiotic will you youre bickering i am not bickering im trying to get you to behave rationally i am behaving rationally this doesnt impress me you know its your duty to save yourself and yours not to despair not despair my comrade and mate is acting like an imbecile and ive got a quilans eyes widened up there he hissed pointing behind me what i twisted bringing my rifle round and then going still the invisible trooper was at the crater lip peering down at the wreckage of the land destroyer he had some sort of helmet on but it didnt cover his eyes and probably wasnt very sophisticated i gazed up through the rain he was lit by firelight from the burning land destroyer we ought to be mostly in shadow the troopers rifle was held in one hand not both i stayed very still then he brought something up to his eyes scanning he stopped looking straight at us i had raised the rifle and fired by the time hed let the night sight drop and begun to bring his weapon to bear he exploded in light just as another flash erupted in the skies above most of his body tumbled and slipped down the slope towards us shorn of one arm and his head suddenly youre a halfdecent shot quilan said i always was dear i told him patting his shoulder i just kept it quiet because i didnt want to embarrass you worosei he said taking my hand again that one will not have been alone now really is the time to go i i began then the hulk of the land destroyer and the crater around us shook as something exploded inside the wreck and glowing shrapnel whizzed out of the space where the turret had been quilan gasped with pain mud slides coasted down around us and the remains of the dead invisible slid another few strides closer his gun was still clutched in one armoured glove i glanced at my helms screen again the flyer was almost here my love was right and it really was time to go i turned back to say something to him just fetch me that bastards rifle he said nodding at the dead trooper see if i cant take another one or two of them with me all right i said and found myself scrambling up the mud and debris and grabbing the dead soldiers rifle and see if he has anything else quilan shouted grenades anything i slid back down overshooting and getting both boots in the water all he had i said handing him the rifle he checked it as best he could thatll do he fitted the stock against his shoulder and twisted round as far as his trapped lower body would allow settling into something approaching a firing position now go before i shoot you myself he had to raise his voice over the sound of more explosions tearing at the wreck of the land destroyer i fell forward and kissed him ill see you in heaven i said his face took on a look of tenderness just for a moment and he said something but explosions shook the ground and i had to ask him to repeat what hed said as the echoes died away and more lights strobed in the skies above us a signal blinked urgently in my visor to tell me the flyer was immediately overhead i said theres no rush he told me quietly and smiled just live worosei live for me for both of us promise i promise he nodded up the slope of the crater good luck worosei i meant to say good luck in return or just goodbye but i found i could not say a thing i just gazed hopelessly at him looking upon my husband for that one last time and then i turned and hauled myself upwards slithering on the mud but pulling myself away from him past the body of the invisible i had killed along the side of the burning machines hull and traversing its rear beneath the barrels of its aft turret while more explosions sent flaming wreckage soaring into the rainfilled sky and splashing into the rising waters the sides of the crater were slick with mud and oils i seemed to slip down more than i was able to climb up and for a few moments i believed i would never make my way out of that awful pit until i slid and hauled myself over to the broad metal ribbon that was the stripped track of the land destroyer what would kill my love saved me i used the linked sections of the embedded track as a staircase at the end almost running to the top beyond the lip in the flamelit distances between the ruined buildings and the squalls of rain i could see the lumbering shapes of other great war machines and the tiny scurrying figures behind them all moving this way the flyer swooped from the clouds i threw myself aboard and we lifted immediately i tried to turn and look back but the doors slammed closed and i was thrown about the cramped interior while the tiny craft dodged rays and missiles aimed at it as it rose to the waiting ship winter storm the light of ancient mistakes the barges lay on the darkness of the still canal their lines softened by the snow heaped in pillows and hummocks on their decks the horizontal surfaces of the canals paths piers bollards and lifting bridges bore the same full billowed weight of snow and the tall buildings set back from the quaysides loomed over all their windows balconies and gutters each a line edged with white it was a quiet area of the city at almost any time kabe knew but tonight it both seemed and was quieter still he could hear his own footsteps as they sank into the untouched whiteness each step made a creaking noise he stopped and lifted his head sniffing at the air very still he had never known the city so silent the snow made it seem hushed he supposed muffling what little sound there was also tonight there was no appreciable wind at ground level which meant thatin the absence of any trafficthe canal though still free of ice was perfectly still and soundless with no slap of wave or gurgling surge there were no lights nearby positioned to reflect from the canals black surface so that it seemed like nothing like an absolute absence on which the barges appeared to be floating unsupported that was unusual too the lights were out across the whole city across almost all this side of the world he looked up the snow was easing now spinwards over the city centre and the still more distant mountains the clouds were parting revealing a few of the brighter stars as the weather system cleared a thin dimly glowing line directly abovecoming and going as the clouds moved slowly overheadwas farside light no aircraft or ships that he could see even the birds of the air seemed to have stayed in their roosts and no music usually in aquime city you could hear music coming from somewhere or other if you listened hard enough and he was good at listening hard but this evening he couldnt hear any subdued that was the word the place was subdued this was a special rather sombre night tonight you dance by the light of ancient mistakes ziller had said in an interview that morning with only a little too much relish and the mood seemed to have infected all of the city the whole of xarawe plate indeed the entire orbital of masaq and yet even so there seemed to be an extra stillness caused by the snow kabe stood for a moment longer wondering exactly what might cause that additional hush it was something that he had noticed before but never quite been bothered enough about to try and pin down something to do with the snow itself he looked back at his tracks in the snow covering the canal path three lines of footprints he wondered what a humanwhat any bipedalwould make of such a trail probably he suspected they would not notice even if they did they would just ask and instantly be told hub would tell them those will be the tracks of our honoured homomdan guest ambassador kabe ischloear ah so little mystery these days kabe looked around then quickly did a little hopping shuffling dance executing the steps with a delicacy belying his bulk and weight he glanced about again and was glad to have apparently escaped observation he studied the pattern his dance had left in the snow that was better but what had he been thinking of the snow and its silence yes that was it it produced what seemed like a subtraction of noise because one was used to sound accompanying weather wind sighed or roared rain drummed or hissed orif it was mist and too light to produce noise directlyat least created drips and glugs but snow falling with no wind to accompany it seemed to defy nature it was like watching a screen with the sound off it was like being deaf that was it satisfied kabe tramped on down the path just as a whole sloped roofload of snow fell with a muffled but distinct crump from a tall building onto ground nearby he stopped looked at the long ridge of whiteness the miniature avalanche had produced as a last few flakes fell swirling around it and laughed quietly so as not to disturb the silence at last some lights from a big barge four vessels away round the canals gradual curve and the hint of some music too from the same source gentle undemanding music but music nevertheless fillin music biding music as they sometimes called it not the recital itself a recital kabe wondered why he had been invited the contact drone e h tersono had requested kabes presence there in a message delivered that afternoon it had been written in ink on card and delivered by a small drone well a flying salver really the thing was kabe usually went to tersonos eighthday recital anyway making a point of inviting him to it had to mean something was he being told that he was being in some way presumptuous having come along on earlier occasions when he hadnt been specifically invited that would seem strange in theory the event was open to allwhat was not in theorybut the ways of culture people especially drones and most especially old drones like e h tersono could still surprise kabe no laws or written regulations at all but so many little observances sets of manners ways of behaving politely and fashions they had fashions in so many things from the most trivial to the most momentous trivial that paper message delivered on a salver did that mean that everybody was going to start physically moving invitations and even daytoday information from place to place rather than have such things transmitted normally communicated to ones house familiar drone terminal or implant what a preposterous and deeply tedious idea and yet just the sort of retrospective affectation they might fall in love with for a season or so ha at most momentous they lived or died by whim a few of their more famous people announced they would live once and die forever and billions did likewise then a new trend would start amongst opinionformers for people to backup and have their bodies wholly renewed or new ones regrown or to have their personalities transferred into android replicas or some other more bizarre design or well anything there was really no limit but the point was that people would start doing that sort of thing by the billion too just because it had become fashionable was that the sort of behaviour one ought to expect from a mature society mortality as a lifestyle choice kabe knew the answer his own people would give it was madness childishness disrespectful of oneself and life itself a kind of heresy he however was not quite so sure which either meant that he had been here too long or that he was merely displaying the shockingly promiscuous empathy towards the culture that had helped bring him here in the first place so musing about silence ceremony fashion and his own place in society kabe arrived at the ornately carved gangway that led from the quayside into the gently lit extravagance in gilded wood that was the ancient ceremonial barge soliton the snow here had been tramped down by many feet the trail leading to a nearby subtrans access building obviously he was odd enjoying walking in the snow but then he didnt live in this mountain city his own home here hardly ever experienced snow or ice so it was a novelty for him just before he went aboard the homomdan looked up into the night sky to watch a vshaped flock of big pure white birds fly silently overhead just above the barges signal rigging heading inland from the high salt sea he watched them disappear behind the buildings then brushed the snow off his coat shook his hat and went aboard its like holidays holidays yes holidays they used to mean the opposite of what they mean now almost the exact opposite what do you mean hey is this edible what this i dont know bite it and see but it just moved it just moved what under its own power i think so well now theres a thing evolve from a real predator like our friend ziller and the instinctive answers probably yes but whats this about holidays ziller was what he was saying opposite meaning once holidays meant the time when you went away really yes i remember hearing that primitive stuff age of scarcity people had to do all the work and create wealth for themselves and society and so they couldnt afford to take very much time off so they worked for say half the day most days of the year and then had an allocation of days they could take off having saved up enough exchange collateral money technical term in the meantime so they took the time off and they went away excuse me are you edible are you really talking to your food i dont know i dont know if it is food in very primitive societies there wasnt even that they got only a few days off each year but i thought primitive societies could be quite primitive industrial he meant take no notice will you stop poking that youll bruise it but can you eat it you can eat anything you can get into your mouth and swallow you know what i mean ask you idiot i just did not it grief what are you glanding should you be out wheres your minder terminal whatever well i didnt want to just oh i see did they all go away at once how could they things would stop working if they all did nothing at the same time oh of course but sometimes they had days when a sort of skeleton crew operated infrastructure otherwise they staggered their time off varies from place to place and time to time as you might expect ah ha whereas nowadays what we call holidays or core time is when you all stay home because otherwise thered be no period when you could all meet up you wouldnt know who your neighbours were actually im not sure that i do because were just so flighty one big holiday in the old sense and hedonistic itchy feet itchy feet itchy paws itchy flippers itchy barbels hub can i eat this itchy gas sacs itchy ribs itchy wings itchy pads okay i think we get the idea hub hello itchy grippers itchy slime cusps itchy motile envelopes will you shut up hub come in hub shit my terminals not working or hubs not answering maybe its on holiday itchy swim bladders itchy muscle frills itchymmph what was there something stuck in my teeth yes your foot i think thats where we kicked off appropriate hub hub wow this has never happened to me before ar ischloear hmm his name had been spoken kabe discovered that he must have gone into one of those strange trancelike states he sometimes experienced at gatherings like this when the conversationor rather when several conversations at oncewent zinging to and fro in a dizzying alienly human sort of way and seemed to wash over him so that he found it difficult to follow who was saying what to whom and why hed found that later he could often remember exactly the words that had been said but he still had to work to determine the sense behind them at the time he would just feel oddly detached until the spell was broken as now and he was awakened by his name he was in the upper ballroom of the ceremonial barge soliton with a few hundred other people most of them human though not all in human form the recital by the composer zilleron an antique chelgrian mosaikeyhad finished half an hour earlier it had been a restrained solemn piece in keeping with the mood of the evening though its performance had still been greeted with rapturous applause now people were eating and drinking and talking he was standing with a group of men and women centred on one of the buffet tables the air was warm pleasantly perfumed and filled with soft music a wood and glass canopy arced overhead hung with some ancient form of lighting that was a long way from anybodys fullspectrum but which made everything and everybody look agreeably warm his nose ring had spoken to him when he had first arrived in the culture he hadnt liked the idea of having com equipment inserted into his skull or anywhere else for that matter his family nose ring was about the only thing he always carried with him so they had made him a perfect replica that happened to be a communications terminal as well sorry to disturb you ambassador hub here youre closest would you let mr olsule know he is speaking to an ordinary brooch not his terminal yes kabe turned to a young man in a white suit who was holding a piece of jewellery in his hand and looking puzzled ah mr olsule yeah i heard the man said stepping back to look up at the homomdan he appeared surprised and kabe formed the impression that he had been mistaken for a sculpture or an article of monumental furniture this happened fairly often a function of scale and stillness basically it was one hazard of being a glisteningly black threeandabitmetretall pyramidal triped in a society of slim matteskinned twometretall bipeds the young man squinted at the brooch again i could have sworn this sorry about that ambassador said the nose ring thank you for your help oh youre welcome a gleaming empty serving tray floated up to the young man dipped its front in a sort of bow and said hi hub again what you have there mr olsule is a piece of jet in the shape of a ceerevell explosively inlaid with platinum and summitium from the studio of ms xossin nabbard of sintrier after the quarafyd school a finely wrought work of substantial artistry but unfortunately not a terminal damn where is my terminal then you left all your terminal devices at home why didnt you tell me you asked me not to when one hundred and oh never mind well replace that umm change that instruction next time i leave home without a terminal get them to make a fuss or something very well it will be done mr olsule scratched his head maybe i should get a lace one of those implant things undeniably forgetting your head would pose considerable difficulties in the meantime ill second one of the barges remotes to accompany you for the rest of the evening if youd like yeah okay the young man put the brooch back on and turned to the laden buffet table so anyway can i eat this oh its gone itchy motile envelope said the tray quietly floating off eh ah kabe my dear friend here you are thank you so much for coming kabe swivelled to find the drone e h tersono floating at his side at a level a little above head height for a human and a little below that of an homomdan the machine was a little less than a metre in height and half that in width and depth its roundedoff rectangular casing was made of delicate pink porcelain held in a lattice of gently glowing blue lumenstone beyond the porcelains translucent surface the drones internal components could just be made out shadows beneath its thin ceramic skin its aura field confined to a small volume directly underneath its flat base was a soft blush of magenta which if kabe recalled correctly meant it was busy busy talking to him tersono he said yes well you did invite me indeed i did do you know it occurred to me only later that you might misinterpret my invitation as some sort of summons even as an imperious demand of course once these things are sent hoho you mean it wasnt a demand more of a petition you see i have a favour to ask you you do this was a first yes i wonder if we might talk somewhere wed have a little more privacy privacy thought kabe that was a word you didnt hear very often in the culture probably more used in a sexual context than any other and not always even then of course he said lead on thank you the drone said floating towards the stern and rising to look over the heads of the people gathered in the function space the machine turned this way and that making it clear it was looking for something or someone actually it said quietly we are not yet quite quorate ah here we are please this way ar ischloear they approached a group of humans centred on the mahrai ziller the chelgrian was nearly as long as kabe was tall and covered in fur that varied from white around his face to dark brown on his back he had a predators build with large forwardfacing eyes set in a big broadjawed head his rear legs were long and powerful a striped tail woven about with silver chain curved between them where his distant ancestors would have had two middlelegs ziller had a single broad midlimb partially covered by a dark waistcoat his arms were much like a humans though covered in golden fur and ending in broad sixdigit hands more like paws almost as soon as he and tersono joined the group around ziller kabe found himself engulfed by another confusing babble of conversation of course you dont know what i mean you have no context preposterous everybody has a context no you have a situation an environment that is not the same thing you exist i would hardly deny you that well thanks yeah otherwise youd be talking to yourself youre saying we dont really live is that it that depends what you mean by live but lets say yes how fascinating my dear ziller e h tersono said i wonder because we dont suffer because you scarcely seem capable of suffering well said now ziller oh this is such an ancient argument but its only the ability to suffer that hey ive suffered lemil kimp broke my heart shut up tulyi you know that makes you sentient or whatever its not actually suffering but she did an ancient argument you said ms sippens yes ancient meaning bad ancient meaning discredited discredited by whom not whom what and that what would be statistics so there we are statistics now then ziller my dear friend you are not serious i think she thinks she is more serious than you zil suffering demeans more than it ennobles and this is a statement derived wholly from these statistics no i think youll find a moral intelligence is required as well a prerequisite in polite society im sure wed all agree now ziller a moral intelligence which instructs us that all suffering is bad no a moral intelligence which will incline to treat suffering as bad until proved good ah so you admit that suffering can be good exceptionally ha oh nice what did you know that works in several different languages what what does tersono ziller said turning at last to the drone which had lowered itself to his shoulder level and edged closer and closer as it had tried to attract the chelgrians attention over the past few moments during which time its aura field had just started to shade into the bluegrey of politely heldincheck frustration mahrai ziller composer half outcast half exile rose from his crouch and balanced on his rear haunches his midlimb made a shelf briefly and he put his drink down on the smoothly furred surface while he used his forelimbs to straighten his waistcoat and comb his brows help me he said to the drone i am trying to make a serious point and your compatriot indulges in word play then i suggest you fall back and regroup and hope to catch her again later when she is in a less trenchantly flippant mood youve met ar kabe ischloear i have we are old acquaintances ambassador you dignify me sir the homomdan rumbled i am more of a journalist yes they do tend to call us all ambassadors dont they im sure its meant to be flattering no doubt they mean well they mean ambiguously sometimes ziller said turning briefly to the woman he had been talking to she raised her glass and bowed her head a fraction when you two have entirely finished criticising your determinedly generous hosts tersono said this would be the private word you mentioned would it ziller asked precisely indulge an eccentric drone very well this way the drone continued past the line of food tables towards the stern of the barge ziller followed the machine seeming to flow along the polished deck lithely graceful on his single broad midlimb and two strong rear legs the composer still had his crystal full of wine balanced effortlessly in one hand kabe noticed ziller used his other hand to wave at a couple of people who nodded to or greeted him as they passed kabe felt very heavy and lumbering in comparison he tried drawing himself up to his full height so as to appear less stockily massive but nearly collided with a very old and complicated light fitting hanging from the ceiling the three sat in a cabin which extended from the stern of the great barge looking out over the inkdark waters of the canal ziller had folded himself onto a low table kabe squatted comfortably on some cushions on the deck and tersono rested on a delicatelooking and apparently very old webwood chair kabe had known the drone tersono for all the ten years he had spent on masaq orbital and had noticed early on that it liked to surround itself with old things this antique barge for example and the ancient furniture and fittings it contained even the machines physical makeup spoke of a sort of antiquarianism it was a generally reliable rule that the bigger a culture drone appeared the older it was the first examples dating from eight or nine thousand years ago had been the size of a bulky human subsequent models had gradually shrunk until the most advanced drones had for some time been small enough to slip into a pocket tersonos metretall body might have suggested that it had been constructed millennia ago when in fact it was only a few centuries old and the extra space it took up was accounted for by the separation of its internal components the better to exhibit the fine translucency of its unorthodox ceramic shell ziller finished his drink and took a pipe from his waistcoat he sucked on it until a little smoke rose from the bowl while the drone exchanged pleasantries with the homomdan the composer was still trying to blow smoke rings when tersono finally said which brings me to my motive in asking you both here and what would that be ziller asked we are expecting a guest composer ziller ziller gazed levelly at the drone he looked round the broad cabin and stared at the door what now who not now in about thirty or forty days im afraid we dont know exactly who quite yet but it will be one of your people ziller someone from chel a chelgrian zillers face consisted of a furred dome with two large black almost semicircular eyes positioned above a greypink furless nasal area and a large partially prehensile mouth there was an expression on it now that kabe had never seen before though admittedly he had known the chelgrian only casually and for less than a year coming here ziller asked his voice was icy was the word decided kabe indeed to this orbital possibly to this plate zillers mouth worked caste he said the word was more spat than pronounced one of the tacted possibly a given tersono said smoothly of course their caste system at least part of the reason that ziller was here and not there ziller studied his pipe and blew more smoke possibly a given eh he muttered my you are honoured hope you get your etiquette exquisitely correct youd better start practising now we believe this person may be coming here to see you the drone said it turned frictionlessly in the webwood seat and extended a maniple field to work the cords which lowered the gold cloth drapes over the windows cutting off the view to the dark canal and the snowenfolded quays ziller tapped the bowl of his pipe frowning at it really he said oh dear what a shame i was thinking of embarking on a cruise before then deep space for at least half a year perhaps longer in fact i had quite decided upon it you will convey my apologies to whatever simpering diplomat or supercilious noble theyre sending im sure theyll understand the drone dropped its voice im sure they wont me too i was being ironic but im serious about the cruise ziller the drone said quietly they want to meet with you even if you did leave on a cruise they would doubtless attempt to follow you and meet up on the cruise ship and of course you wouldnt try to stop them how could we ziller sucked on his pipe for a moment i suppose they want me to go back do they the drones gunmetal aura indicated puzzlement we dont know really cr ziller i am being perfectly open with you really well can you think of another reason for this expedition many my dear friend but none of them are especially likely as i said we dont know however if i was forced to speculate id tend to agree with you that requesting your return to chel is probably the main reason for the impending visit ziller chewed on his pipe stem kabe wondered if it would break you cant force me to go back my dear ziller we wouldnt even think of suggesting to you that you do the drone said this emissary may wish do so but the decision is entirely yours you are an honoured and respected guest ziller culture citizenship to the extent that such a thing really exists with any degree of formality would be yours by assumption your many admirers amongst whose number i count myself would long ago have made it yours by acclamation if only that would not have seemed presumptuous ziller nodded thoughtfully kabe wondered if this was a natural expression for a chelgrian or a learned translated one very flattering ziller said kabe had the impression the creature was genuinely trying to sound gracious however i am still chelgrian not quite naturalised yet of course your presence is trophy enough to declare this your home would be excessive ziller said pointedly the drones aura field flushed a sort of muddy cream colour to indicate embarrassment though a few flecks of red indicated it was hardly acute kabe cleared his throat the drone turned to him tersono the homomdan said im not entirely sure why im here but may i just ask whether in all this you are talking as a representative of contact of course you may yes i am speaking on behalf of the contact section and with the full cooperation of masaq hub i am not without friends admirers ziller said suddenly staring at the drone without tersono said field glowing a ruddy orange why as i say you have almost nothing but i mean amongst some of your minds your ships tersono the contact drone ziller said coldly the machine rocked back in its chair a little melodramatic thought kabe ziller went on i might well be able to persuade one of them to accommodate me and provide me with my own private cruise one which this emissary might find much more difficult to intrude upon the drones aura lapsed back to purple it wobbled minutely in the chair you are welcome to try my dear ziller however that might be taken as a terrible insult fuck them yes well but i meant by us a terrible insult on our part an insult so terrible that in the very sad and regrettable circumstances oh spare me ziller looked away ah yes the war thought kabe and the responsibility for it contact would regard this as all very delicate the drone misted in purple went quiet for a moment kabe shifted on his cushions the point is tersono continued that even the most wilful and ah characterful of ships might not accede to the sort of request you have indicated you might make in fact id wager quite heavily on it that they wouldnt ziller chewed some more on his pipe it had gone out which means that contact has already fixed this doesnt it tersono wobbled again lets just say that the wind has been tested yes lets of course this is always assuming that none of your ship minds were lying oh they never lie they dissemble evade prevaricate confound confuse distract obscure subtly misrepresent and wilfully misunderstand with what often appears to be a positively gleeful relish and are generally perfectly capable of contriving to give one an utterly unambiguous impression of their future course of action while in fact intending to do exactly the opposite but they never lie perish the thought ziller did a good stare kabe decided he was quite glad that those big dark eyes were not directed at him though certainly the drone seemed impervious i see the composer said well then i suppose i might as well just stay put i imagine i could just refuse to leave my apartment why of course not very dignified perhaps but that would be your prerogative quite but if im given no choice dont expect me to be welcoming or even polite he inspected the bowl of his pipe that is why i asked kabe to be here the drone turned to the homomdan kabe we would be so grateful if youd agree to help play host to our guest chelgrian when he or she appears you would be half of a double act with me possibly with some assistance from hub if thats acceptable we dont yet know how much time this will take up on a daily basis or how long the visit will last but obviously if it proved to be extended we would make additional arrangements the machines body tipped a few degrees to one side in the webwood chair would you do this i know it is a lot to ask and you neednt give a definitive answer quite yet sleep on it if you please and ask for any further information youd like but you would be doing us a great favour given cr zillers perfectly understandable reticence kabe sat back on his cushions he blinked a few times oh i can tell you now id be happy to be of help he looked at ziller of course i wouldnt want to distress mahrai ziller i shall remain undistressed depend on it ziller told him if you can distract this bilepurse theyre sending youll be doing me a favour too the drone made a sighing noise rising and falling fractionally above the seat well that is satisfactory then kabe can we talk more tomorrow wed like to brief you over the next few days nothing too intense but considering the unfortunate circumstances of our relationship with the chelgrians over recent years obviously we dont want to upset our guest through any lack of knowledge of their affairs and manners ziller made a noise like a snarled huh of course kabe told tersono i understand kabe spread all three of his arms my time is yours and our gratitude yours now the machine said rising into the air im afraid ive kept us chattering in here for so long weve missed hubs avatars little speech and if we dont hurry well be late for the main if rather sad event of the evening that time already kabe said rising too ziller snapped the cap shut on his pipe and replaced it in his waistcoat he unfolded himself from the table and the three returned to the main ballroom as the lights were going out and the roof was rumbling and rolling back to reveal a sky of a few thin ragged clouds multitudinous stars and the bright thread of the orbitals far side on a small stage at the forward end of the ballroom the hubs avatarin the shape of a thin silverskinned humanstood head bowed cold air flowed in around the assembled humans and varied other guests all save for the avatar gazed up at the sky kabe wondered in how many other places within the city across the plate and along this whole side of the great bracelet world similar scenes were taking place kabe tilted his massive head and stared up too he knew roughly where to look masaq hub had been quietly persistent in its prepublicity over the last fifty days or so silence then a few people muttered something and a number of tiny chimes sounded from personal terminals distributed throughout the huge open space and a new star blazed in the heavens there was just the hint of a flicker at first then the tiny point of light grew brighter and brighter exactly as though it was a lamp on which somebody was turning up a dimmer switch stars nearby began to disappear their feeble twinklings drowned out by the torrent of radiation pouring from the newcomer in a few moments the star had settled to a steady barely wavering greyblue glare almost outshining the glowing string of masaqs farside plates kabe heard one or two breaths nearby and a few brief cries oh grief a woman said quietly someone sobbed not even particularly pretty ziller muttered so softly that kabe suspected only he and the drone had heard they all watched for a few more moments then the silverskinned darksuited avatar said thank you in that hollow not loud but deep and carrying voice that avatars seemed to favour it stepped down from the stage and walked away leaving the opened room and heading for the quayside oh we had a real one ziller said i thought wed have an image he looked at tersono which allowed itself a faint glow of aquamarine modesty the roof started to roll back gently shaking the deck beneath kabes trio of feet as though the old barges engines had woken again the lights brightened fractionally the light of the newly bright star continued to pour through the gap between the halves of the closing roof then through the glass after the segments had met and locked again the room was much darker than it had been before but people could see well enough they look like ghosts thought kabe gazing round the humans many were still staring up at the star some were heading outside to the open deck a few couples and larger groups were huddled together individuals comforting one another i didnt think it would affect so many so deeply the homomdan thought i thought they might almost laugh it off i still dont really know them even after all this time this is morbid ziller said drawing himself up im going home i have work to do not that tonights news has exactly been conducive to inspiration or motivation yes tersono said forgive a rude and impatient drone but might i ask what youve been working on lately cr ziller you havent published anything for a while but you do seem to have been very busy ziller smiled broadly actually its a commissioned piece really the drones aura rainbowed with brief surprise for whom kabe saw the chelgrians gaze flick briefly towards the stage where the avatar had stood earlier all in due course tersono ziller said but its a biggish piece and itll be a while yet before its first performance ah most mysterious ziller stretched putting one long furred leg out behind him and tensing before relaxing he looked at kabe yes and if i dont get back to work on it itll be late he turned back to tersono youll keep me informed about this wretched emissary you will have full access to all we know right good night tersono the chelgrian nodded to kabe ambassador kabe bowed the drone dipped ziller went softly bounding through the thinning crowd kabe looked back up at the nova thinking eighthundredandthreeyearold light shone steadily down the light of ancient mistakes he thought that was what ziller had called it on the interview kabe had heard just that morning tonight you dance by the light of ancient mistakes except that no one was dancing it had been one of the last great battles of the idiran war and one of the most ferocious one of the least restrained as the idirans risked everything including the opprobrium even of those they regarded as friends and allies in a series of desperate wildly destructive and brutal attempts to alter the increasingly obvious likely outcome of the war only if that was a word one could ever use in such a context six stars had been destroyed during the nearly fifty years the war had raged this single battle for a tendril of galactic limb lasting less than a hundred days had accounted for two of them as the suns portisia and junce had been induced to explode it had become known as the twin novae battle but really what had been done to each of the suns had generated something more like a supernova on each neither star had shone upon a barren system worlds had died entire biospheres had been snuffed out and billions of sentient creatures had sufferedalbeit brieflyand perished in these twin catastrophes the idirans had committed the acts the gigadeathcrimestheir monstrous weaponry not that of the culture had been directed first at one star then the otheryet still arguably the culture might have prevented what had happened the idirans had attempted to sue for peace several times before the battle started but the culture had continued to insist on unconditional surrender and so the war had ground onwards and the stars had died it was long over the war had ended nearly eight hundred years ago and life had gone on still the real space light had been crawling across the intervening distance for all these centuries and by its relativistic standard it was only now that those stars blew up and just at this moment that those billions died as the outrushing shell of light swept over and through the masaq system the mind that was masaq orbital hub had its own reasons for wanting to commemorate the twin novae battle and had asked the indulgence of its inhabitants announcing that for the interval between the first nova and the second it would be observing its own private term of mourning although without affecting the execution of its duties it had intimated there would be some sort of more upbeat event to mark the end of this period though exactly what form this would take it hadnt yet revealed kabe suspected he knew now he found himself glancing involuntarily in the direction ziller had taken just as the chelgrians gaze had strayed towards the stage earlier when hed been asked who had commissioned whatever he was working on all in due course kabe thought as ziller had said for tonight all hub had wanted was that people look up and see the sudden silent light and think perhaps contemplate a little kabe had half expected the locals to take no notice whatsoever and just carry on with their busy little onelongparty lives as usual however it appeared that here at least the hub minds wish had been granted all very regrettable the drone e h tersono said at kabes side and made a sighing sound kabe thought it probably meant to sound sincere salutary for all of us kabe agreed his own ancestors had been the idirans mentors and fought alongside the idirans in the early stages of the ancient war the homomda felt the weight of their own responsibilities as keenly as the culture did its we try to learn tersono said quietly but still we make mistakes it was talking now about chel the chelgrians and the caste war kabe knew he turned and looked at the machine as the people moved away in the steady ghostly light you could always do nothing tersono he told it though such a course usually brings its own regrets i am too glib sometimes kabe thought i tell them too exactly what they want to hear the drone tipped back to make clear that it was looking up at the homomdan but said nothing winter storm the hull of the ruined ship bowed away on all sides curving out and then back arcing overhead they had fitted lights in the centre of what had become the ceiling directly above the curious glazedlooking floor reflections glowed from the glassily swirled distorted surface itself and from the few stumps of unidentifiable equipment that protruded above it quilan tried to find a place to stand where he thought he could distinguish what it was he was standing on then switched off the suits field pack and let his feet touch the surface it was hard to tell through his boots but the floor seemed to have the feel of what it looked like glass the spin theyd given the hull produced what felt like about a quarter gravity he patted the fastenings securing his bulky backpack he looked up and around the hulls interior surface looked hardly damaged there were various indentations and a scattering of holes some circular and some elliptical but all quite symmetrical and smooth and part of the design none went all the way through the hull material and none looked ragged the only aperture which led to the outside was right in the nose of the craft seventy metres away from where he stood more or less in the centre of the spoonshaped mass of floor that twometrewide hole had been cut in the hull weeks ago to gain access after the hulk had been located and secured that was how he had gained entry he could see various discoloured patches on the hulls surface that didnt look right and a few small dangling tubes and wires up near the newly emplaced lights part of him wondered why they had bothered with the lights the hulls interior was evacuated open to space nobody would be coming in here without a full suit so they would have the concomitant sensory equipment that made lights unnecessary he looked down at the floor maybe the technicians had been superstitious or just emotional the lights made the place seem a little less forbidding less haunted he could understand that wandering around in here with only ambient radiations to impinge upon the augmented senses might well induce terror if you were of a sensitive nature theyd found much of what theyd hoped to find enough for his mission sufficient to save a thousand or so other souls almost certainly not enough to fulfil his hopes he looked about it appeared they had removed all the sensory and monitoring equipment theyd been using to inspect the wreck of the privateer winter storm he felt a shudder through his boots he glanced up to the side as the slicedoff bow of the ship was put back in place enclosed in this ship of the dead at last isolation established it says said a voice in his head the machine in his backpack produced a faint vibration it says the proximity of the suits systems are interfering with its instruments youll have to switch your com off now its saying please remove the pack from your back will we still be able to talk you and i will be able to talk to each other and itll be able to talk to me all right he said slipping the pack off the lights are all right he asked theyre just lights nothing else where shall i puthe started to say but then the pack went light in his hands and began to tug away from him it wants us to know it has its own motive power the voice in his head informed him oh yes of course ask it to work fast would you tell it were pressed for time because theres a culture warship braking towards our position as we speak coming to think thatll make any difference major i dont know tell it to be thorough too quilan i think itll just do what it has to do but if you really want me to no no sorry sorry dont look i know this is hard on you quit ill leave you alone for a bit okay yes thanks huylers voice went offline it was as though a hiss right on the boundary of hearing had suddenly been removed he watched the navy drone for a moment the machine was silvery grey and nondescript like the pack from an ancient space suit it floated silently across the nearflat floor keeping about a metre off its surface heading for the near bow end of the ship to start its search pattern it would be too much to ask he thought to himself the chances are too remote it was a small miracle we discovered anything at all in here that we are able to rescue those souls from such destruction a second time to ask for more was probably pointless but no more than natural what intelligent creature possessed of wit and feeling could do otherwise we always want more he thought we always take our past successes for granted and assume they but point the way to future triumphs but the universe does not have our own best interests at heart and to assume for a moment that it does ever did or ever might is to make the most calamitous and hubristic of mistakes to hope as he was hoping hoping against likelihood against statistical probability in that sense against the universe itself was only to be expected but it was also almost certainly forlorn the animal in him craved something that his higher brain knew was not going to happen that was the point he was impaled upon the front on which he suffered that struggle of the lower brains almost chemical simplicities of yearning pitched against the withering realities revealed and comprehended by consciousness neither could give up and neither could give way the heat of their battle burned in his mind he wondered if despite what hed been told huyler could hear any hint of it all our tests confirm that the construct has been fully recovered all errorchecks have been completed the construct is now available for interaction and downloading the sister technician announced in his head she seemed to be trying to sound more like a machine than machines ever did he opened his eyes and blinked into the light for a moment the headset he wore was just visible from the corners of his eyes the reclined couch he lay on felt firm but comfortable he was in the medical facility of the mendicant sisters temple ship piety across the racks of gleaming spotless medical gear near the side of a stained batteredlooking thing about the size of a domestic chill cabinet the sister technician talking to him was a youngster with a severe expression dark brown fur and a head which had been partially shaved ill download it now she continued do you wish to interact with it immediately yes i do a moment please wait what will itwill heexperience awareness sight in the form of a humancompensated feed from this camera she tapped a tiny wand protruding from the headset she wore hearing in the form of your voice continue yes there was the very faintest impression of a hiss and then a sleepysounding deeply male voice saying seven eight nine hello what where is this what is this where whats happened it was a voice that went from slurred sleepiness to suddenly fearful confusion and then on to a degree of control within just a few words the voice sounded younger than hed been expecting he supposed there was no need for it to sound old sholan hadesh huyler he responded calmly welcome back who is that i cant move there was still a trace of uncertainty and anxiety in the voice this isnt the beyond is it my name is calledtoarmsfromgiven major quilan iv of itirewein im sorry you cant move but please dont worry your personality construct is currently still inside the substrate you were originally stored within in the military technology institute cravinyr on aorme at the moment the substrate youre inside is aboard the temple ship piety its in orbit around a moon of the planet reshref four in the constellation of the bow along with the hulk of the star cruiser winter storm there you are ah you say youre a major i was an admiralgeneral i outrank you the voice was perfectly under control now still deep but clipped and crisp the voice of somebody used to giving orders your rank when you died was greater than mine now certainly sir the sister technician adjusted something on the console in front of her whose are those hands they look female those belong to the sister technician who is looking after us sir your point of view is from a headset shes wearing can she hear me no sir ask her to take the headset off and show me what she looks like sir are you major if you would quilan felt himself sigh sister technician he thought he asked her to do as huyler had asked she did but looked annoyed about it sourlooking frankly wish i hadnt bothered so what has been happening major what am i doing here a great deal has been happening sir youll be given a full historical briefing in due course date it is the ninth of spring just eightysix years i expected more somehow so major why have i been resurrected frankly sir i do not entirely know myself then frankly major i think youd better rapidly put me in touch with somebody who does know there has been a war sir a war who with with ourselves sir a civil war this some sort of caste thing yes sir i suppose it was always coming so am i being conscripted are the dead being used as the reserves no sir the war is over we are at peace again though there will be changes there was an attempt to rescue you and the other stored personalities from the substrate in the military institute during the waran attempt i was involved inbut it was only partially successful until a few days ago we thought it had been completely unsuccessful so am i being brought back to life to appreciate the manifest glories of the new order to be reeducated tried for past incorrectness what our superiors think that you may be able to help with a mission that lies before both of us before both of us uhhuh and what exactly would that mission be major i cant tell you that at the moment sir you seem worryingly ignorant to be the one whos pulling all the strings here major im sorry sir i believe that my current lack of knowledge may be a safety procedure but i would guess that your expertise regarding the culture could be of some help my thoughts on the culture proved politically unpopular when i was alive major thats one of the reasons i took the offer of being put into storage on aorme rather than either die and go to heaven or keep banging my head against a wall in combined forces intelligence are you telling me the top brass have come round to my point of view perhaps sir perhaps just your knowledge of the culture would prove useful even if its eightandahalf decades old quilan paused then expressed something hed been preparing for some days since theyd rediscovered the substrate sir considerable thought and great effort went into both retrieving you and preparing me for my mission i would hope that no part of that thought or effort was either wasted or without point huyler was silent for a moment there were about five hundred others besides me in that machine in the institute did they all get out too the final figure for those stored was nearer a thousand but yes sir they all appear to have come through though only youve been revived so far all right then soldier perhaps you should start by telling me what you do know about this mission i know only what you might call our cover story sir ive been induced to forget the real mission goal for the time being what its a security measure sir youll be briefed with the full mission details and you wont forget them i ought to remember gradually what my mission is anyway but in the event that something goes wrong youll be the backup they frightened somebody might read your mind major i imagine so sir though of course the culture doesnt do that so were told extra precaution eh must be an important mission but if you can still remember that you have a secret mission in the first place i am reliably informed that in a day or two ill even forget that as well well all very interesting so what would that cover story be i will be on a cultural diplomatic mission to a world of the culture a cultural cultural mission in a sense sir just an old soldiers lame joke son relax that frozen sphincter a bit wont you im sorry sir i need to have your agreement both to undertake the mission and to be transferred into another substrate within myself that process may take a little time did you say another machine inside you yes sir there is a device inside my skull designed to look like an ordinary soulkeeper but able to accommodate your personality as well you dont look that much of a fathead major the device is no larger than a small finger sir and what about your soulkeeper the same device functions as my soulkeeper too sir they can make something that clever that small yes sir they can there probably isnt time to go into all the technical details well i beg your pardon major but take it from an old soldier that war in general and limited personnel missions in particular are often all about the technical details plus youre rushing me son you have the advantage of being at the controls here ive got eightysix years of catching up to do i dont even know that youre telling me the truth about any of this it all sounds suspicious as hell so far and about this being transferred inside you you trying to tell me i dont even get my own goddamned body im sorry there wasnt more time to brief you sir we thought we had lost you twice in a sense when we discovered that your substrate had survived my mission had already been decided on and yes your consciousness would be transferred entirely into the substrate within my body you would have access to all my senses and we would be able to communicate though you would not be able to control my body unless i became deeply unconscious or suffered brain death the only technical detail i know is that the device is a crystalline nanofoam matrix with links to my brain so id just be along for the ride what son of itchshit mission profile is that whos putting you up to this major it would be a novel experience for both of us sir and one that i would consider a privilege it is believed that your presence and advice would increase the likelihood of the missions success as to who put me up to it i was trained and briefed by a team under the command of estodien visquile visquile is that old horror still alive and made it to estodien too ill be damned he sends his regards sir i carry a personal and private communication from him addressed to you let me hear it major sir we thought you might like a little more time to major quilan im mightily suspicious that im being shovelled into something pretty damn dubious here ill be honest with you youngster its not very likely that im going to agree to take part in your unknown mission even after ive heard visquiles message but im sure as shit not going willingly through your ears up your ass or anywhere else unless i do hear what that old whoreboys got to say and i might as well hear it now as later making myself clear here very sir sister technician please replay the message from estodien visquile to hadesh huyler proceeding said the female quilan was left alone with his thoughts he realised how tense he had become communicating with the ghost of hadesh huyler and deliberately relaxed his body easing his muscles and straightening his back again his gaze swept over the gleaming surfaces of the medical facility but what he was seeing was the interior of the hull of the ship they were floating alongside the privateer cruiser winter storm he had been aboard the wreck once so far while they were still trying to locate and extract huylers soul from the thousand or so others stored within the rescued substrate which theyd located in the wreck with a specially adapted navy drone he had been promised that later if there was time he would be allowed to go back to the wreck with that drone and attempt to discover any other souls the original sweeps had missed time was running out though it had taken time to get permission for what he wanted to do and it was taking time for the navy technical people to adjust the machine meanwhile theyd been told that the culture warship was on its way just a few days out at the moment the techs were pessimistic that theyd get the drone finished in time the image of the wrecked ships scoopedout hull seemed fixed in his brain major quilan sir reporting for duty major permission to come aboard just so sir sister technician transfer hadesh huyler into the substrate within my body directly the female said proceeding he had wondered if hed feel anything he did a tingling then a warmth in a small area on the nape of his neck the sister technician kept him informed the transfer went well and took about two minutes checking it had gone perfectly took twice that time what bizarre fates our technologies dream up for us he thought as he lay there here i am a male becoming pregnant with the ghost of an old dead soldier to travel beyond the bounds of light older than our civilisation and carry out some task i have spent the best part of a year training for but of which i presently have no real knowledge whatsoever the spot on his neck was cooling he thought his head felt very slightly warmer than it had before he might have been imagining it you lose your love your heart your very soul he thought and gaina land destroyer he heard her say so falsely bravely cheerful in his mind while the rainfilled sky flashed above her and the vast weight pinned him utterly some memory of that pain and despair squeezed tears from his eyes complete testing testing said the dry laconic voice of hadesh huyler hello sir you okay son im fine sir did that hurt you there major you seem a little distressed no sir just an old memory how do you feel pretty damn strange i dare say ill get used to it looks like everything checks out shit that female techie doesnt look any better through a males eyes than she does through a camera of course what he could see huyler could see before he could reply huyler added you sure youre okay positive sir im fine he stood within the hulk of the winter storm the navy drone went back and forth across the strange almost flat floor of the wreck searching in a grid pattern it passed the hole in the floor where the substrate from aorme had been wrenched out in the two days since theyd found the substrate quilan had persuaded the techs that it was worth recalibrating the drone to look for substrates much smaller than the one huyler had been in substrates the size of a soulkeeper in fact they had already performed a standard search but he got them at least to try and look more closely the mendicant sisters on the temple ship had helped with the persuading any chance to rescue a soul had to be pursued to the utmost by the time the drone was ready though the culture ship which would take him on the first leg of his journey was already starting to decelerate the navy drone would have time for one sweep and one sweep only he watched it make its passes following its own unseen grid across the flat floor he looked up and round the gaping shell of the ships hull he tried to recreate in his mind the interior of the vessel as it had been when it had been intact and wondered in what part of it she had stayed where she had moved and where she had lain her head to sleep in the ships false night the main drive units might be up there filling half the ship the flyer hangar was there in the stern the decks would spread here and here individual cabins would have been over there or over there maybe he thought maybe there was still a chance maybe the techs had been wrong and there was still something left to find the hull only held because it was energised somehow they still didnt understand everything about these great gifted ships perhaps somewhere within the hull itself the machine floated up to him clicking ceiling lights glittering across its metallic carapace he looked at it sorry to break in quil but it wants you to get the hell out the way of course sorry quilan stepped to one side not too clumsily he hoped it had been a while since hed worn a suit ill leave you alone again no its all right talk if you want to talk hmm okay ive been wondering what weve spent so much time doing technical calibrating stuff but we havent touched on some of the basic assumptions being made here like is it really true we can hear each other when we talk like this but not when we think seems a damn fine distinction to me well thats what weve been told why have you had any hint of no its just that when you look at something through another persons eyes and you think something after a while you start to wonder if its really what you think or some sort of bleedover from what theyre thinking i think i see what you mean so think we should test it out i suppose we could sir all right see if you can catch what im thinking sir i dont think he thought but there was silence even as his own thoughts tailed off he waited a few more moments then a few more the drone continued on its search pattern each time passing by further and further away well catch anything no sir sir i you dont know what you missed major okay your turn go on think of something anything he sighed the enemy shipno he shouldnt think of them that way the ship could be here by now he felt that what he and huyler were doing right now was a waste of time but on the other hand there was nothing they could do to make the drone carry out its task any faster so they werent really wasting any time at all all the same it felt like it what a strange interval he thought to be here in this hermetic mausoleum standing in the midst of such forlorn desolation with another mind inside his own trading absences in the face of a task he knew nothing about and so he thought of the long avenue at old briri in the fall the way she scuffed through the amber drifts of fallen leaves kicking golden explosions of leaves into the air he thought of their marriage ceremony in the gardens of her parents estate with the oval bridge reflected in the lake as theyd made their vows a wind out of the hills had ruffled the reflection and taken it away snapping at the awning above them blowing off hats and making the priest clutch at her robes but the same strong springscented breeze had stroked the tops of the veil trees and sent a shimmering white cloud of blossom falling around them like snow a few of the petals were still resting on her fur and eyelashes at the end of the service when he turned to her removed his own ceremonial muzzle and hers and kissed her their friends and family hurrahed hats were thrown into the air and some were caught by another gust of wind to land in the lake and sail off across the little waves like a dainty flotilla of brightly coloured boats he thought again of her face her voice those last few moments live for me he had said and made her promise how could they have known it would be a promise she could never keep and he would still live to remember huylers voice broke in done your thinking major yes sir did you catch anything no just physiological stuff looks like weve still got some degree of privacy oh the machine says its finished quilan looked at the drone which had arrived at the far end of the spoon of floor what does it look huyler can i talk to that thing directly i think i can set that up now its finished ill still be able to hear though i dont mind i just there try that machine drone yes major quilan are there any other personality constructs in here anywhere within the hull no only the one i was tasked with discovering earlier which now shares coordinates with yourself that of admiralgeneral huyler are you sure he asked wondering if any hint of his hope and despair could colour his communicated words yes what about within the fabric of the hull material itself that is not relevant have you scanned it i cannot it is not open to my sensors the machine was merely clever not sentient it would probably not have been able to recognise the emotions behind his words anyway even if they had been communicated are you absolutely certain have you scanned everything i am certain yes the only three personalities present within the ships hull in any form appreciable to my senses are you the personality through which i am communicating to you and my own he looked down at the sworl of floor between his feet so there was no hope i see he thought thank you you are welcome gone gone utterly and forever gone in a way that was new bereft of the comforts of ignorance and without appeal before we believed that the soul might be saved now our technology our better understanding of the universe and our vanguard in the beyond has robbed us of our unreal hopes and replaced them with its own rules and regulations its own algebra of salvation and continuance it has given us a glimpse of heaven and made more intense the reality of our despair when we know that truly it exists and that those we love will never be found there he switched on his communicator there was a message waiting theyre here said the letters on the suits little screen it was timed eleven minutes earlier a lot more time had passed than hed have estimated looks like our rides arrived yes ill let them know were ready you do that major major quilan here he transmitted i understand our guests have arrived major it was the voice of mission co colonel ustremi everything all right in there everything is fine sir he looked across the glassy floor and around the huge empty space just fine did you find what you were looking for quil no sir i did not find what i wanted im sorry quil thank you sir you can open the hatchway again the machines finished its work let the techs see what else they can find by just digging opening now one of our guests wants to come and say hello in here he said watching the tiny cone in the ships bow hinge away yes that okay with you i suppose quil looked back at the drone which was hovering where it had completed its search tell your machine to switch itself off first will you done the navy drone settled to the floor okay send them in when theyre ready the figure appeared in the blackness of the removed hatchway it looked human and yet could not be one of them would have been no more able to survive in the vacuum without a suit than he was quilan upped the magnification on the visor zooming in as the creature began to walk down the slope of the hulls interior the biped had what looked like jet black skin and its clothing was shiny grey it looked very thin but then they all did its feet met the flat surface he was already standing on and brought it closer it swung its arms as it walked theyd look like prey if there was just more eating on them he didnt reply the zoomed window in the visor kept the creature at the same magnification until the distinction between the window and the rest of the view disappeared the things face was narrow and pointed its nose thin and sharp and the eyes set in the nightblack face were small and vividly blue surrounded by white shit they dont look any more appetising closer up major quilan the creature said the skin above its eyes moved when it spoke to him but not its mouth yes he said how do you do i am the avatar of the rapid offensive unit nuisance value pleased to meet you ive come to take you on the first leg of your trip to masaq orbital i see quick suggestion ask how to address it do you have a name or rank what should i call you i am the ship it said raising and dropping its narrow shoulders call me nuisance if you like its mouth twisted up at the edges or avatar or just ship or just abomination very well ship okay it held up its hands i just wanted to say hello personally well be waiting for you let us know when youre ready to go it let its gaze arc up and around they said it was all right to come in here i hope i didnt interrupt anything i had finished in here i was looking for something but i didnt find it im sorry so you should be you wormfucker yes shall we go he started towards the circle of night in the bow of the ship the avatar fell into step alongside its gaze took in the floor briefly what happened to this ship we dont know exactly he told it it lost a battle something hit it very hard the hull survived but everything else inside it was destroyed the avatar nodded compacted fused state it stated and the crew we are walking on them im sorry the creature immediately floated off the floor by half a metre it stopped making the walking motion and posed itself as though sitting it crossed its legs and arms this happened in the war i take it they came to the slope and started up it he kept on walking he turned briefly to the creature yes ship it happened during your war infra dawn but you might die thats the whole point really i see no i dont think you do do you no the woman laughed and continued to adjust the flying harness all about them the landscape was the colour of drying blood kabe stood on a rugged but still elegant platform made from wood and stone and perched on the edge of a long escarpment he was talking with feli vitrouv a woman with wild black hair and deep brown skin over hardlooking muscles she wore a tight blue body suit with a small belly pack and was in the process of strapping herself into a wing harness a complicated device full of compressed slatted fins that covered most of her rear surfaces from ankles to neck and down her arms about sixty other peoplehalf of them also wingflierswere distributed about the platform which was surrounded by the blimp tree forest dawn was just starting to break antispinwards throwing long slanting rays across the cloudwhisped indigo sky the fainter stars had long since been submerged in the slowly brightening vault barely a handful still twinkled the only other heavenly objects visible were the lobed shape of dorteseli the larger of the two ringed gas giants in the system and the wavering white point that was the nova portisia kabe looked around the platform the sunlight was so red it almost looked brown it shone from the vastly distant atmospheres above the orbitals trailing plates over the escarpments edge across the dark valley with its pale islands of mist and sank onwards to the low rolling hills and the distant plains on the far side the cries of the forests nocturnal animals had slowly disappeared over the past twenty minutes or so and the calls of birds were beginning to fill the nightchilled air above the low forest the blimpers were dark domes scattered amongst the taller groundhugging trees they looked threatening to kabe especially in this ruddy glow the giant black gas sacs loomed shrivelled and deflated but still impressively rotund over the bloated bulk of the banner reservoir while their strangler roots snaked across the ground all around them like giant tentacles establishing their territory and keeping ordinary trees at bay a breeze stirred the branches of the ground trees and set their leaves rustling pleasantly the blimpers at first appeared not to be affected by the wind then moved slowly creaking and crackling adding to the effect of monstrousness the crimson sunlight was just starting to catch the tops of the more distant blimp trees hundreds of metres away along the shallow side of the scarp a handful of wingfliers had already disappeared and headed down barely discernible paths into the forest on the other side of the platform the view sank over cliffs scree and forest into the shadows of the broad valley where the meandering loops and oxbow lakes of tulume river could be glimpsed through the slowly drifting patches of mist kabe ah ziller ziller wore a closefitting dark suit with only his head hands and feet showing where the suits material covered the pad of his midlimb it had been reinforced with hide it had been the chelgrian whod wanted to come out here originally to see the wingfliers kabe had already watched this particular sport albeit from a distance a few years earlier shortly after hed first arrived on masaq then hed been on a long articulated river barge heading down the tulume for the ribbon lakes the great river and the city of aquime and had observed the distant dots of the wingfliers from the vessels deck this was the first time kabe and ziller had met since the gathering on the barge soliton five days earlier kabe had completed or put on hold various articles and projects he had been working on and had just begun to study the material on chel and the chelgrians which the contact drone e h tersono had sent him he had half expected ziller not to contact him at all and so had been surprised when the composer had left a message asking him to meet him at the wingfliers platform at dawn ah cr ziller feli vitrouv said as the chelgrian loped up and folded himself to a crouch between her and kabe the woman flicked an arm out above her a wing membrane snapped out for a few metres translucent with a hint of bluegreen then flipped back she clicked her mouth seemingly satisfied we still havent succeeded in persuading you to have a go no no what about kabe im too heavy fraid so feli said too heavy to do it properly you could fit him with a float harness i suppose but that would be cheating i thought the whole point of this sort of exercise was to cheat the woman looked up from tightening a strap round her thigh she grinned at the crouched chelgrian did you cheating death oh that thats just a form of words isnt it it is yeah its cheat as in deprive not cheating in the technical sense of agreeing to follow certain rules and then secretly not while everybody else does the chelgrian was silent for a moment then said uhhuh the woman stood up straight smiling when are we going to get to a statement of mine you agree with cr ziller im not sure he glanced about the platform where the remaining fliers were completing their preparations and the others were packing up breakfast picnics and transferring to the various small aircraft hovering silently nearby isnt all of this cheating feli exchanged shouts of good luck and last minute advice with a few of her fellow wingfliers then she looked at kabe and ziller and nodded towards one of the aircraft come on well cheat and take the easy way the aircraft was a little arrowheadshaped sliver of a thing with a large open cabin kabe thought it looked more like a small motorboat than a proper plane he guessed it was big enough to take about eight humans he weighed the same as three of the bipeds and ziller was probably almost the mass of two so they should be under its maximum capacity but it still didnt look up to the task it wobbled very slightly as he stepped aboard seats morphed and rearranged themselves for the two nonhuman shapes feli vitrouv swung into the lead seat with a sort of clacking noise from the stowed wing fins which she flicked out of the way as she sat she pulled a control grip from the cockpits fascia and said manual please hub you have control the machine said the woman clicked the grip into place and after a look around pulled twisted and pushed it to send them gently backing out and away from the platform and then racing off just above the tops of the ground trees some sort of field prevented more than a gentle breeze from entering the passenger compartment kabe reached out and poked it with one finger feeling an invisible plastic resistance so how is all of this cheating feli called back ziller looked over the side could you crash this he asked casually she laughed is that a request no just a question want me to try not particularly well then no i probably couldnt im flying it but if i did anything really stupid the automatics would take over and haul us out of trouble is that cheating depends not what i call cheating she angled the craft down towards a group of blimp trees in a large clearing id call it a reasonable combination of fun and safety she turned back to glance at them the craft wriggled fractionally in the air aiming between two tall ground trees though of course a purist might say i shouldnt be using an aircraft to get to my blimp in the first place the trees rushed past one on either side very close kabe felt himself flinch there was a hint of a thud and when he looked back kabe saw a few leaves and twigs whirling and falling in their slipstream the craft bellied down towards the largest blimp tree aiming close in underneath the curve of the gas sac where the giant tentacle roots joined together and merged into the dark brown bulbous pod of the banner reservoir a purist would walk suggested ziller yup the woman made a sort of tappingdown motion with the grip and the craft settled onto the roots she stowed the grip control in the panel in front of her heres our boy she said nodding up at the dark blackgreen balloon blotting out most of the morning sky the blimp tree towered fifteen metres over them casting a deep shadow the gas sacs surface was rough and veined and yet still looked thin as paper giving the impression of having been sewn together clumsily from giant leaves kabe thought it looked like a thunder cloud how would they get here in the first place to this forest ziller asked i think i see what youre getting at feli said jumping out of the craft and landing on a broad root she checked her harness points again squinting at them in the semidarkness most of them would come by underground she said glancing round at the blimp tree and then up at the ruby light sifting through the ground trees a few would powerglide she added frowning at the blimper which seemed to be stretching tautening kabe thought he detected sounds coming from the banner reservoir some would take an aircraft she went on then flashed a smile at them and and said excuse me i think its time i got into place she took a pair of long gloves from the belly pack and pulled them on curved black nails half as long as her ringers extended from their tips when she flexed them then she turned and clambered up the side of the reservoir pod until she was at its lip where the springy material curled under the blimp the tree was creaking loudly now the gas sac expanding and becoming taut others might come by ground car or bike or boat and then walk feli went on settling down in a crouch on the lip of the reservoir of course the real purists the sky junkies they live out here in huts and tents and survive off hunting and wild fruits and vegetables they travel everywhere on foot or by wing and you never see them in town at all they live for flying its a ritual a what do you call it a sacrament almost a religion with them they hate people like me because we do it for fun lot of them wont talk to us actually some of them wont talk to each other and i think some have lost the power of speech altowhoo feli turned away as the blimp suddenly parted company with the banner reservoir and rose into the sky like a giant black bubble from a vast brown mouth beneath the gas sac attached to it by a thick mass of filaments rose a broad green streamer of tissuethin leaf eight metres across and webbed with darker veins feli vitrouv stood flicked out the claws in her gloves and flung herself at the mass of filaments just under the blimp thumping into the great curtain of leaf and making it shudder and ripple she kicked at it with her feet and more blades punctured the membrane the blimp hesitated in its ascent then continued up into the sky released from the shadow of the blimp the air around the aircraft seemed to lighten as the huge shape swept into the still brightening sky with a noise like a sigh ha ha shouted feli ziller leant over to kabe shall we follow her why not flying machine ziller said hub here cr ziller said a voice from their seats headrests take us up wed like to follow ms vitrouv certainly the aircraft rose almost straight up smoothly and quickly until they were level with the blackhaired woman who had twisted so that she faced out from the banner under the blimp kabe looked over the side of the craft they were about sixty metres up by now and gaining height at a respectable rate looking right down he could see into the blimpers base pod where the reams of banner leaf unfolded from their reservoir and were hauled rippling into the air feli vitrouv smiled broadly at them her body being pulled this way and that as the banner leaf flapped and ruffled in the roaring wind of the plants ascent okay there she said laughing her hair flew about her face and she kept shaking her head oh i think were fine ziller shouted and you never better the woman yelled looking up at the blimp and then down at the ground to go back to this thing about cheating ziller said she laughed yes what this whole place is a cheat how so she flicked one hand and hung dangerously by a single arm while her other hand claws stowed brushed her hair away from her mouth the movement made kabe nervous if hed been her hed have worn a cap or something its made to look like a planet ziller shouted its not kabe was watching the still rising sun it was bright red now an orbital sunrise like an o sunset took much longer than the same event on a planet the sky above you brightened first then the rising star seemed to coalesce out of the infrared a shimmering vermilion spectre emerging out of the haze line and then sliding along the horizon shining dimly through the plate walls and the distant abundances of air and only gradually gaining height though once it had properly begun the daylight lasted longer than on a globe all of which was arguably a gain kabe thought as sunset and sunrises often produced the days more spectacular and attractive vistas so what feli had both hands anchored again so why bother with this ziller shouted indicating the blimp fly up here use a floater harness do it all in a dream do it all in vr she laughed would it be any less false thats not the question the question is would it be any less real well would it she nodded vigorously absofuckinglutely her hair caught in a sudden updraught swirled above her head like black flames so you only think its fun if theres a certain degree of reality involved its more fun she shouted some people blimp jump as their main recreation but they only ever do it in her voice was lost as a gust of wind roared around them the blimper shuddered and the aircraft trembled a fraction in what ziller bellowed in dreams she shouted there are vr wingflier purists who make a point of never doing the real thing do you despise them ziller yelled the woman looked mystified she leant out from the rippling membrane then detached one handthis time she left the glove where it was anchored in the thick filament membranedug in her belly pack and clipped something tiny to one nostril then she put her hand back into the glove and relaxed back when she spoke again it was in a normal speaking voice andrelayed through kabes own nose ring and whatever terminal setup ziller was usingit was as though she was sitting right beside each of them despise them did you say yes said ziller why in the world would i despise them they achieve with minimal effort and no risk what you have to gamble your life on thats their choice i could do that too if i wanted and anyway she said glancing up at the blimp above her then taking a longer look at the skies around its not exactly the same thing you achieve is it isnt it no you know youve been in vr not reality you could fake that too she appeared to sigh then grimaced look sorry its time to fly and i prefer to be alone no offence she took her hand out of the glove again put the nosestud terminal in her belly pack and after a struggle got her hand back in the glove kabe thought she looked cold they were over half a kilometre above the escarpment now and the air spilling over the aircrafts fields felt chill on his carapace their rate of ascent had slowed appreciably and felis hair was blowing out to one side rather than whipping all about her head see you later she yelled through the air then she let go she leant out gloves coming free first then boots kabe saw the shining claws flick back in reflecting orangeyellow in the sunlight as she dropped away released the blimp set off into the sky again kabe and ziller looked out over the same side of the aircraft it pushed back keeping level then spun around so they could watch the woman as she swooped she kicked her legs and threw out her arms the wing slats deployed turning her in a single flicker into a giant bluegreen bird over the noise of the wind kabe heard her wild yahooing she curved away heading towards the sunrise then kept on turning and disappeared momentarily behind the banner leaf in the skies around them kabe could make out a handful of other fliers tiny dots and shapes angling through the air beneath the tethered balloons of the risen blimp trees feli was banking round gaining height now heading back on a rising curve that would take her underneath them the aircraft swivelled slowly in the air keeping her in view she passed twenty metres beneath them performing a roll and yelling at them a huge grin on her face then she swung back over to present her back to the sky and swooped again pulling her wings in and tearing away and down she seemed to be diving into the ground oh kabe heard himself say suppose she died he had already started to compose in his head the next voicepiece he would send to the homomdan farflung correspondents news service kabe had been sending these illustrated letters back home every six days for nearly nine years now and had built up a small but devoted band of listeners he had never had to describe an accidental death in one of his recordings and he did not relish the idea of doing so now then the bluegreen wings flicked out again and the woman rose once more a kilometre away before finally disappearing behind a fence of banner leaves our angel is not immortal is she ziller asked no kabe said he was not sure what an angel was but thought it would be rude to ask either ziller or hub for the information no shes not backedup feli vitrouv was one of about half of the wingfliers for whom no recording of her mindstate existed to revive them if they dived into the ground and were killed it gave kabe an unpleasant feeling just thinking about it they call themselves the disposables he said ziller was silent for a moment strange that people are happy to adopt epithets they would fight to the death to throw off had they been imposed a yelloworange highlight reflected off part of the aircrafts brightwork there is a chelgrian caste called the invisibles i know ziller looked up yes how are your studies going oh well enough ive only had four days and there were various pieces of my own ive had to finish however ive made a start an unenviable task youve taken on kabe id offer an apology on behalf of my species except i feel it would be superfluous as that is more or less what my entire body of work consists of oh now kabe said embarrassed to feel such shame for ones own was well shameful whereas this lot ziller said nodding over the side of the aircraft at the wheeling dots of the wingfliers are just odd he settled back in his seat and produced his pipe from a pocket shall we stay here a while and admire the sunrise yes kabe said lets from up here they could see for hundreds of kilometres across frettle plate the systems star lacelere was still rising and slowly yellowing to full brightness shining through the continents of air to antispinward its radiance obliterating any detail on the lands still in shade to spinwardbeneath the fuzzily broad then sharp but slowly diminishing line of the plates that had risen into full sunlight hanging in the sky like a bright beaded braceletthe tulier mountains rose capes of snow about their shoulders spinright the view just faded away across the savannas disappearing into haze left there was a hint of hills in the blue distance one edge of a broad estuary where masaq great river decanted into frettle sea and the waters beyond you dont think i bait the humans too much do you ziller asked he sucked on his pipe frowning at it i think they enjoy it kabe said really oh ziller sounded disappointed we help to define them they like that define them is that all i dont think thats the only reason they like to have us here certainly not in your case but we give them an alien standard to calibrate themselves against that sounds slightly better than being uppercaste pets you are different dear ziller they call you composer ziller cr ziller an address mode ive never heard of before they are intensely proud you chose to come here the culture as a whole and hub and the people of masaq in particular obviously obviously ziller murmured pulling on his still stubbornly unlit pipe and staring across the plains you are a star amongst them a trophy of a sort but very respected they have their own composers ziller frowned into the bowl of the pipe tapping it and tutting dregs one of their machines their minds could outcompose all of them put together but that kabe said would be cheating the chelgrians shoulder shook and he made a sort of huhing noise that might have been a laugh they wouldnt let me cheat to get away from this fucking emissary he looked sharply at the homomdan any more news on that kabe already knew from masaq hub that ziller had been diligently ignoring anything to do with the envoy being sent from his home they have dispatched a ship to bring him or her here kabe said well to start the process there appeared to be a sudden change of plan at the chelgrian end why from what they tell me they dont know a rendezvous was agreed then changed by chel kabe paused there was something about a wrecked ship what wrecked ship ah hmm we might have to ask hub hello hub he said tapping his nose ring unnecessarily and feeling foolish kabe hub here what can i do for you this wrecked ship that the chelgrian envoy was being picked up from yes do you have any details it was an itirewein clan articled privateer of the loyalist faction lost in the closing stages of the caste war the hulk was discovered near the star reshref a few weeks ago it was called the winter storm kabe looked at ziller who was obviously being included in the conversation the chelgrian shrugged never heard of it is there any more information on the identity of the emissary theyre sending kabe asked a little we dont have his name yet but apparently he is or was a moderately senior military officer who later took religious orders ziller snorted caste he asked heavily we believe he is a given of the house itirewein i have to point out that there is a degree of uncertainty in all this however chel has not been very forthcoming with information you dont say ziller said looking across the rear of the aircraft to watch the yellowwhite sun complete its rise when do we expect the emissary to arrive now kabe asked in about thirtyseven days i see well thank you youre welcome i or dn tersono will talk to you later kabe ill leave you guys in peace ziller was adding something to the bowl of his pipe does it make a difference the caste status of this envoy kabe asked not really ziller said i dont care who or what they send i dont want to talk to them certainly dispatching somebody from one of the more militant ruling cliques who happens also to be some sort of holy bootboy shows they arent trying particularly hard to ingratiate themselves with me i dont know whether to feel insulted or honoured perhaps he is a devotee of your music yes maybe he doubles or triples as a musicology professor for one of the more exclusive universities ziller said sucking on the pipe again some smoke drifted from the bowl ziller kabe said td like to ask you a question the chelgrian looked at him he went on the extended piece youve been working on would it be to mark the end of the twin novae period commissioned by hub he found himself glancing without meaning to in the direction of portisias bright point ziller smiled slowly between ourselves he asked of course you have my word then yes ziller said a fullblown symphony to commemorate the end of hubs period of mourning and encompass both a meditation on the horrors of the war and a celebration of the peace which has with only the most trivial of blemishes reigned since to be performed live just after sunset on the day the second nova ignites if my conducting is of its usual accurate standard and i time it right the light should hit at the start of the final note ziller spoke with relish hub thinks its going to arrange some sort of light show for the piece im not sure ill allow that but well see kabe suspected the chelgrian was relieved that somebody had guessed and he could talk about it ziller this is wonderful news he said it would be the first fulllength piece ziller had completed since his selfimposed exile some people kabe included had worried that ziller might never again produce anything on the truly monumental scale he had proved such a master of i look forward to it is it finished nearly im at the tinkering stage the chelgrian looked up at the lightpoint that was the nova portisia it has gone very well he said sounding thoughtful wonderful raw material something i could really get my teeth into he smiled at kabe without warmth even the catastrophes of the other involveds are somehow on another level of elegance and aesthetic refinement compared to those of chel my own species abominations are efficient enough in terms of the death and suffering produced but pedestrian and tawdry youd think theyd have the decency to provide me with better inspiration kabe was silent for a few moments it is sad to hate your own people so much ziller yes it is ziller agreed looking out towards the distant great river though happily that hatred does produce vital inspiration for my work i know there is no chance that you will go back with them ziller but you should at least see this emissary ziller looked at him should i not to do so will make it appear you are frightened of his arguments really what arguments i imagine he will say that they need you kabe said patiently to be their trophy instead of the cultures i think trophy is the wrong word symbol might be better symbols are important symbols do work and when the symbol is a person then the symbol becomes dirigible a symbolic person can to some extent steer their own course determine not just their own fate but that of their society at any rate they will argue that your society your whole civilisation needs to make peace with its most famous dissident so that it can make peace with itself and so rebuild ziller gazed levelly at him they chose you well didnt they ambassador not in the way i think you mean i am neither sympathetic nor unsympathetic to such an argument but it is likely to be one they would wish to put to you even if you really havent thought about this and havent tried to anticipate their propositions then nevertheless you must know that if you had you would have worked this out for yourself ziller stared at the homomdan kabe found that it was not quite as difficult as hed imagined meeting the gaze of those two large dark eyes nevertheless it was not something hed have chosen as a recreation am i really a dissident ziller asked at last ive just got used to thinking of myself as a cultural refugee or a political asylum seeker this is a potentially unsettling recategorisation your earlier comments have stung them ziller as have your actions firstly coming here at all and then staying on after the background to the war became clear the background to the war my studious homomdan pal is three thousand years of ruthless oppression cultural imperialism economic exploitation systematic torture sexual tyranny and the cult of greed ingrained almost to the point of genetic inheritability that is bitterness my dear ziller no outside observer would make such a hostile summation of your species recent history three thousand years counts as recent history you are changing the subject yes i find it comical that three millennia count as recent to you certainly thats more interesting than arguing over the exact degree of culpability ascribable to my compatriots behaviour since we came up with our exciting idea for a caste system kabe sighed we are a longlived species ziller and have been part of the galactic community for many millennia three thousand years are far from insignificant by our reckoning but in the lifetime of an intelligent spacefaring species it does indeed count as recent history you are disturbed by these things arent you kabe what things ziller the chelgrian pointed the stem of his pipe over the side of the aircraft you felt for that human female as she seemed to be about to plunge into the ground and splatter her unbackedup brains across the landscape didnt you and you find it uncomfortableat leastthat i am as you put it bitter and that i hate my own people all that is true is your own existence so replete with equanimity you find no outlet for worry except on behalf of others kabe sat back thinking i suppose it appears so hence perhaps your identification with the culture perhaps so you would feel for it in its current oh shall we say embarrassment regarding the caste war encompassing all thirtyone trillion of the cultures citizens might stretch even my empathy a little ziller smiled thinly and looked up at the horizon of the orbital hanging in the sky the bright ribbon began at the haze line to spinward thinning and sweeping into the sky a single strip of and punctuated by vast oceans and the ragged iceshored barriers of the transatmospheric bulkhead ranges its surface speckled green and brown and blue and white waisted here broadening there usually hemmed by the edge seas and their scattered islands though in placesand invariably where the bulkhead ranges rearedstretching right to the retaining walls the thread that was masaq great river was visible in a few of the nearer regions overhead the orbitals far side was just a bright line the details of its geography lost in that burnished filament sometimes if you had very good eyesight indeed and looked up to the far side directly above you could just make out the tiny black dot that was masaq hub hanging free in space one and a half million kilometres away in the otherwise empty centre of the worlds vast bracelet of land and sea yes said ziller they are so many arent they they could easily have been more they have chosen stability ziller was still gazing into the sky do you know there are people whove been sailing the great river since the orbital was completed yes a few are on their second circuit now they call themselves the time travellers because heading against the spin they are moving less quickly than everybody else on the orbital and so incur a reduced relativistic time dilation penalty negligible though the effect is ziller nodded the great dark eyes drank in the view i wonder if anyone goes against the flow a few do there are always some kabe paused none of them have yet completed a circuit of the entire orbital they would need to live a very long time to do so theirs is a harder course ziller stretched his midlimb and arms and put his pipe away just so he made a shape with his mouth kabe knew was a genuine smile shall we return to aquime i have work to do scorched ground are our own ships not good enough theirs are faster still im afraid so and i hate this chopping and changing first one ship then another then another then a fourth i feel like a delivery package this wouldnt be some obscure form of insult or way of trying to delay us would it you mean not giving us our own ship yes i dont think so in an obscure sort of way they may even be trying to impress us theyre saying that theyre taking so much care to correct the mistakes they made that they wont spare any ships from normal duty for anybody sparing four ships at different times makes more sense it does the way theyll have their forces set up the first ship was very much a war craft theyre keeping those close to chel in case the war should begin again they may loop a certain distance out for example to ferry us but no further the one we are on now is a superlifter a sort of fast tug the one were approaching is a general systems vehicle a kind of giant depot or mother ship it carries other warships they could deploy in the event of further hostilities if they went beyond the scale their immediately available materiel could deal with the gsv can loop further out than the war vessel but still cant stray too far from chelgrian space the last ship is an old demilitarised war craft of a type commonly used throughout the galaxy for this sort of picket duty throughout the galaxy somehow that still always comes as a shock yes decent of them to take such an interest in our relatively puny wellbeing if you believe them that is all they were ever trying to do do you believe them major i think i do i am just not convinced that that is sufficient excuse for what happened damn right it isnt the first three days of their journey had been spent aboard the torturer class rapid offensive unit nuisance value it was a massive cobbledtogether object a bundle of gigantic engine units behind a single weapon pod and a tiny accommodation section that looked like an afterthought god that thing is ugly huyler said when they first saw it riding across from the wreck of the winter storm in the tiny shuttle with the ships blackskinned greysuited avatar and these people are supposed to be decadent aesthetes there is a theory that they are ashamed of their weaponry as long as it looks inelegant rough and disproportionate they can pretend that is not really theirs or not really a part of their civilisation or only temporarily so because everything else they make is so subtly refined or it could just be form following function however i confess thats a new one on me which university whizzkid came up with that theory you will be glad to know hadesh huyler that we now have a civilisational metalogical profiling section in naval intelligence i can see i have a lot of catching up to do with the latest terminology what does metalogical mean it is short for psychophysiophilosophilogical well naturally of course it is glad i asked it is a culture term a fucking culture term yes sir i see and what the hell does this metalogical section of ours actually do it tries to tell us how other involveds think involveds also one of their terms it means spacefaring species beyond a certain technological level which are willing and able to interact with each other i see always a bad sign when you start using the enemys terminology quilan glanced at the avatar sitting in the seat next to him it smiled uncertainly at him i would agree with that sir he returned his gaze to the view of the culture warship it was indeed rather ugly before huyler had expressed his own thoughts quilan had been thinking how brutally powerful the craft looked how odd to have somebody else in your head who looked through the same eyes and saw exactly the same things you did and yet came to such different conclusions experienced such dissimilar emotions the craft filled the screen as it had since they had set off they were approaching it quickly but it had been a long way off some few hundred kilometres a readout at the side of the screen was counting the magnification level back towards zero powerful quilan thoughtentirely to himselfand ugly perhaps in some sense that was always the case huyler broke into his thoughts i take it your servants are already aboard i am not taking any servants sir what i am going alone sir apart from yourself of course youre going without servants are you some sort of fucking outcast or something major youre not one of these embryonicist caste deniers are you no sir partly my not bringing servants reflects some of the changes that have occurred in our society since your bodydeath these will no doubt be explained in your briefing files yes well ill be taking a further look at those when i have the time you wouldnt believe the amount of tests and stuff theyve been putting me through even while you were asleep i had to remind them that constructs need naps too or theyd have burned me out in here but look major this thing about servants i read up on the caste war but i thought it ended up a draw dear scum in heaven does this mean we lost it no sir the war ended in a compromise following the cultures intervention i know that but a compromise which involves having no servants no sir people still have servants officers still employ squires and equerries however i am of an order which eschews such personal help visquile mentioned you were some sort of monk i didnt realise youd be quite so selfdenying there is another reason for travelling alone sir if i might remind you the chelgrian we are being sent to meet is a denier oh yeah this ziller guy some spoiled furrending liberal brat who thinks its his godgiven duty to do the whining for those who cant be bothered whining for themselves best thing you can do with these people is kick them out these shits dont understand the first thing about responsibility or duty you cant renounce your caste any more than you can renounce your species and were indulging this arseleaf he is a great composer sir and we didnt chuck him out ziller left chel to go into selfexile in the culture he renounced his given status and took oh let me guess he declared himself an invisible yes sir pity he didnt go the whole way and make himself a spayed at any rate he is not well disposed to chelgrian society the idea was that by going without an entourage i might make myself less intimidating and more acceptable to him we should not be the ones having to make ourselves acceptable to him major we are in a position where we have no choice sir it has been decided at cabinet level that we must try to persuade him to return i have accepted that mission as indeed you have yourself we cannot force him to return so we must appeal to him is he likely to listen i really have no idea sir i knew him when we were both children i have followed his career and i have enjoyed his music i have even studied it however that is all i have to offer i imagine people closer to him by family or conviction might have been asked to do what i am doing but it would seem that none of them were prepared to take on the task i have to accept that while i may not be the ideal candidate i must be the best of those available for the job and just get on with it this all sounds a little forlorn major i worry about your morale my spirits are at something of a low ebb sir for personal reasons however my morale and sense of purpose are more robust and when alls said and done orders are orders yes arent they just major the nuisance value carried a human crew of twenty and a handful of small drones two of the humans greeted quilan in the cramped shuttle hangar and showed him to his quarters which comprised a single cabin with a low ceiling his meagre baggage and belongings were already there transferred from the navy frigate that had taken him to the hulk of the winter storm something like a navy officers cabin had been created for him one of the drones had been assigned to him it explained that the cabins interior could deform to create something closer to his desires he told the drone he was content with the present arrangements and was happy to unpack and remove the rest of his vacuum suit by himself was that drone trying to be our servant i doubt it sir it may do as we ask if we do so nicely huh so far they all seem quite diffident and determined to be helpful sir right suspicious as hell quilan was attended to by the drone which to his surprise did indeed act as an almost silent and very efficient servant cleaning his clothes sorting his kit and advising him on the minimalalmost nonexistentetiquette that applied on board the culture vessel there was what passed for a formal dinner on the first evening they still dont have uniforms this is a whole society run by fucking dissidents no wonder i hate it the crew treated quilan with fastidious civility he learned almost nothing from them or about them they seemed to spend a great deal of time in simulations and had little time for him he wondered if they just wanted to avoid him but didnt care if they did he was happy to have the time to himself he studied their archives through the ships own library hadesh huyler did his own studying finally absorbing the historical and briefing files that had been loaded along with his own personality into the soulkeeper device within quilans skull they agreed a schedule that would allow quilan some privacy if nothing important was taking place then for the hour before sleep and the hour after waking huyler would detach from quilans senses huylers reactions to the detailed history of the caste war which against quilans advice he turned to first went through amazement incredulity outrage anger and finallywhen the cultures part became clearsudden fury followed by icy calm quilan experienced these varying emotions from the other being inside his head over the course of an afternoon it was surprisingly wearing only afterwards did the old soldier go back to the beginning and study in chronological sequence all the things that had happened since his bodydeath and personality storage like all revived constructs huylers personality still needed to sleep and dream to remain stable though this comalike state could be achieved in a sort of fastforward time which meant that instead of sleeping all night huyler could get by on less than an hours rest the first night he slept in the same realtime as quilan the second night he studied rather than slept and partook of just that brief period of unconsciousness the following morning when quilan reestablished contact after his hours grace the voice in his head said major sir you lost your wife im sorry i didnt know its not something i talk about much sir was that the other soul you were looking for on the ship where you found me yes sir she was army too yes sir also a major we joined up together before the war she must have loved you a lot to follow you into the army actually it was more me following her sir enlisting was her idea trying to rescue the souls stored in the military institute on aorme before the rebels got there was her idea too she sounds like quite a female she was sir im really sorry major quilan i was never married myself but i know what it is to love and to lose i just want you to know i feel for you thats all thank you i appreciate that i think maybe you and i need to study a bit less and talk a bit more for two people in such intimate contact we havent really told each other that much about ourselves what do you say major i think that might be a good idea sir lets start by dropping the sir shall we doing my homework i did notice the bit of legalese attached to the standard wakeup briefing which basically says that my admiralgeneralship lapsed with my bodydeath my status is reserve honorary officer and youre the ranking grade on this mission if anyones going to get called sir around here it should be you anyway just call me huyler if youre happy with that thats how people usually knew me as you say ah huyler given our intimacy perhaps rank isnt entirely relevant please call me quil done deal quil the few days passed without incident they travelled at absurd speed leaving chelgrian space far far behind the rou nuisance value passed them via its little shuttle craft to a thing called a superlifter another big chunky ship though with a less extemporised look to it than the war craft the vessel called the vulgarian greeted them by voice only it had no human crew quilan sat in what looked like a little used open area where pleasantly bland music played never married huyler an accursed weakness for smart proud and insufficiently patriotic females quil they could always tell my first love was the army not them and not one of those heartless bitches was prepared to put her male and her people before her own selfish interests if id only had the basic common sense to have been taken with airheads id have been happily married withand probably even more happily survived bya doting wife and several grownup children by now sounds like a narrow escape i notice youre not specifying who for the general systems vehicle sanctioned parts list appeared on the screen in the superlifters lounge as another point of light in the starfield it became a silver dot and grew quickly to fill the screen though there was no sign of detail on the shining surface thatll be it i suppose so weve probably passed near several escort craft though they wouldnt be making their presence so obvious what the navy calls a high value unit you never send them out alone i thought it might look a little more grand they always look pretty unimposing from the outside the superlifter plunged into the centre of the silver surface within it was like looking from an aircraft inside a cloud then there was the impression of plunging through another surface then another then dozens more in quick succession flicking past like thumbed paper pages in an antique book they burst from the last membrane into a great hazy space lit by a yellowwhite line burning high above beyond layers of wispy cloud they were above and aft of the crafts stern the ship was twentyfive kilometres long and ten wide the top surface was parkland wooded hills and ridges separated by and studded with rivers and lakes bracketed by colossal ribbed and buttressed outriggers chevroned in red and blue the gsvs sheer sides were a golden tawny colour scattered with a motley confusion of foliagecovered platforms and balconies and punctured by a bewildering variety of brightly lit openings like a glowing vertical city set into sandstone cliffs three kilometres high the air swarmed with thousands of craft of every type quilan had ever seen or heard of and more besides some were tiny some were the size of the superlifter still smaller dots were individual people floating in the air two other giant vessels each barely an eighth of the size of the sanctioned parts list shared the envelope of the gsvs surrounding field enclosure riding a few kilometres off each side plainer and more denselooking they were surrounded with their own concentrations of smaller flying craft it is a little more impressive on the inside isnt it hadesh huyler remained silent he was made welcome by an avatar of the ship and a handful of humans his quarters were generous to the point of extravagance he had a swimming pool to himself and the side of one cabin looked out into the chasm of air whose far wall a kilometre distant was the gsvs starboard outrigger another selfeffacing drone played the part of servant he was invited to so many meals parties ceremonies festivals openings celebrations and other events and gatherings that the suites engagementmanaging ware filled two screens just listing the variety of different ways of sorting all his invitations he accepted a few mostly those featuring live music people were polite he was polite back some expressed regret about the war he was dignified placatory huyler fumed in his mind spitting invective he walked and travelled through the vast ship attracting glances everywherein a ship of thirty million people not all of them human or drone he was the only chelgrianbut was only rarely forced into conversation the avatar had warned him that some of the people who would want to talk to him would be in effect journalists and might broadcast his comments on the ships news services huylers indignation and sarcasm were an advantage in such circumstances quilan would have carefully measured his words before speaking them anyway but he would also listen to huylers comments at such moments seemingly lost in thought and was quietly amused to see that he gained a reputation for inscrutability as a result one morning before huyler had made contact again after the hour of grace he rose from his bed and went to the window which gave out onto the external view andwhen he ordered the surface transparentwas not surprised to see the phelen plains outside scorched and cratered and stretching into the smokefilled distance beneath an ashen sky they were traversed by the punctured ribbon of the ruined road on which the blackened crippled truck moved like a winterslowed insect and he realised that he had not awakened or risen at all and was dreaming the land destroyer jerked and shook beneath him sending waves of pain through his body he heard himself groan the ground must be shaking he was supposed to be beneath the thing trapped by it not inside it how had this happened such pain was he dying he must be dying he could not see and breathing was difficult every few moments he imagined that worosei had just wiped his face or had just sat him up to make him comfortable or had just spoken to him quietly encouraging gently funny but each time it was as though he had somehowunforgivablyfallen asleep when she had done these things and only woken up after she had slipped away from him again he tried to open his eyes but could not he tried to talk to her to shout out to her and bring her back but he could not then a few more moments would elapse and he would jerk awake again and feel certain once more that he had just missed her touch her scent her voice still not dead eh given whos that what people were talking around him his head hurt so did his legs your fancy armour didnt save you did it they could feed most of you to the chasers wouldnt even have to mince you up first somebody laughed pain jolted from his legs the ground shook beneath him he must be inside the land destroyer with its crew they were angry that it had been hit and they had been killed were they talking to him he must have dreamt it turretless and burning or perhaps it was very big inside and he was in an undamaged part not all dead worosei said a voice he realised it must be his own oo worosei worosei another voice said mimicking him please he said he tried to move his arms again but only pain came oo worosei oo worosei please in the old faculty building beneath the rebound courts in the military technical institute cravinyr city aorme thats where they had stored them the souls of the old soldiers and military planners unwanted in peace now they were seen as an important resource besides a thousand souls were a thousand souls and worth saving from destruction by the rebel invisibles woroseis mission her idea daring and dangerous shed pulled strings to make it happen the way she had before when theyd joined up to make sure that she and quilan would be posted together time to go move now jump had they been there he seemed to remember the look of the place the warren of corridors the heavy doors all dark and cold glowing falsely in the helmet visor the others two squires hulpe and nolica his best trusted and true and the navy special forces triune worosei nearby rifle balanced her movements graceful even in the suit his own wife he should have tried harder to stop her but shed insisted her idea the substrate device was there bigger than theyd been expecting the size of a domestic chiller cabinet well never get this onto the flyer not with us at the same time hey given help me get this off come on it might help somebody laughing get this off never get this back the flyer and shed been right two of the navy people went with the thing theyd never get off never was that worosei shed just wiped his face he could have sworn he struggled to call her back to say anything whats he saying no idea who cares one arm was very sore left arm or right arm he was angry at himself for not being able to tell which how absurd ow ow ow worosei why you trying to tear it off just the glove must come off hell have rings or stuff they always do worosei murmured something in his ear hed fallen asleep shed just gone worosei he tried to say the invisibles came with heavy weaponry they must have a ship probably escorted the winter storm would try to stay hidden then they were on their own waiting for the flyer to return for them then the discovery attack and losing them all madness flashes and explosions all over as the loyalist side shelled and counterattacked from whoknewwhere away they ran out into the rain the building behind them burned and slumped and fell turned to glowing slag by the energy weapons it was night by then and they were alone leave him alone we just you just do as youre fucking told or ill drop you on the fucking road understand if he lives were going to ransom him even dead hes worth more than you two braindead fuckwits so make sure hes alive when we get to golse or youll be following him to heaven make sure hes alive look at him hell be lucky if he lasts the night well if we pick up any medics less fucked up than he is well make sure they deal with him first in the meantime you do it here medpac ill see you get extra rations if he lives oh and theres nothing worth taking hey hey we want a cut in the ransom hey theyd dived into the crater sliding and falling a big explosion had punched them half into the mud killed them if they hadnt been suited up something whacked into his helmet sending the speakers crazy and filling the visor with blinding light he pulled the helmet off it rolled into the pool of water in the foot of the crater more explosions stuck jammed into the mud given youre just a heap of fucking trouble you know that whats this do fuck knows the land destroyer turretless trailing smoke and leaving one wide segmented track unravelled on the slope behind it ground and skidded and rumbled its way into the crater worosei had recovered first hauling herself out of the ooze she tried to pull him free then fell back as the machine rolled down on top of him he screamed as the huge weight pressed him into the ground and his legs caught against something hard breaking bones pinning him he saw the flyer leave taking her to the ship to safety the sky was full of flashes his ears were pounded by the concussions the land destroyer shook the ground as its munitions detonated each pulse making him cry out rain lashed down soaking his face and fur hiding his tears the water in the crater was rising offering an alternative way to die until another explosion in the burning machine hammered the ground and air blew out of the centre of the filthy pool and it all frothed and drained away into a deep tunnel that side of the crater collapsed into it as well and the land destroyers nose tipped down its rear went up and it pivoted off him thundering down into the steam of the hole and shaking with another series of explosions he tried to drag himself out with his hands but could not he started trying to dig his legs free the next morning an invisible search and recovery team found him in the mud semiconscious surrounded by a shallow trench hed dug around his legs but still unable to free himself one of them kicked his head a few times and put a gun against his forehead but he had just enough wits left to tell them his rank and title so they pulled him from the muds embrace ignoring his screams dragged him up the slope and threw him into the back of a halfwrecked armoured truck with the rest of the dead and dying they were the slowest of the slow the expectedtodie consigned to a wagon which itself was not expected to complete the journey the truck had lost its tail doors in whatever engagement had resulted in its being unable to travel at much more than walking speed once theyd moved him and cleaned the blood from his eyes he could look out to watch the phelen plains unroll behind they were black and scorched as far as the eye could see sometimes smudges of smoke adorned the horizon the clouds were black or grey and sometimes ash fell like soft rain real rain pelted down only once when the truck was on a part of the road sunk below the level of the plains turning the roadway into a greasy stream of rushing grey and washing over the tailgate and into the rear compartment he had been lifted mewing with pain to a sitting position on one of the rear benches he could move his head and one arm very weakly and so watched helplessly as three of the wounded died struggling on their stretchers drowned under the swirling grey tide he and one of the others shouted but it seemed that nobody heard the truck went light and slewed from side to side as it was nearly washed away in the flood he stared wideeyed at the battered ceiling as the filthy water swirled over the submerged bodies and around his knees he wondered if he cared any more whether he died or not and decided that he did because there was just a chance he might see worosei again then the truck settled and found traction and climbed slowly out of the waters and grumbled onwards the slurry of ash and water drained out through the rear exposing the dead coated in grey as though by shrouds the truck took frequent detours round shell holes and larger craters it crossed two makeshift bridges swaying a few vehicles whizzed past them going in the other direction and once a pair of aircraft slammed overhead supersonic so low their passing raised dust and ash nothing overtook the wagon he was attended to minimally by the two invisible orderlies whod been told to look after him by their co they were really unheards a caste above invisibles by the loyalist way of thinking the two seemed to veer unpredictably between relief that he was going to live and perhaps furnish them with part of his ransom and spite that he had survived at all he had named them shit and fart in his head and took some pride in not being able to recall their real names at all he daydreamed mostly he daydreamed about catching up with worosei without her having heard that he had survived so that when she saw him it would come as a complete surprise he tried to imagine the look on her face the succession of expressions he might see of course it would never happen that way she would be like him if their circumstances were reversed she would try to find out for sure what had happened to him hoping no matter how hopelessly that by some miracle he had survived so she would find out or she would be told once news of his escape became known and he would not see that look on her face still he could imagine it and spent hours doing just that as the truck squealed and thumped and rumbled its way across the sintered plains he had told them his name once hed been able to speak but they hadnt seemed to pay any attention all that appeared to matter was that he was a noble with a noblemales markings and armour he wasnt sure whether to remind them of his name or not if he did and it was communicated to their superiors then worosei might find out all the quicker that he was alive but there was a superstitious cautious part of him that was afraid of doing that because he could imagine her being toldthat hope against hope fulfilledand imagine the look on her face at that point but he could also imagine himself dying even yet because they hadnt been able to treat his injuries properly and he was feeling weaker and weaker all the time that would be too cruel to be told that he had survived against all the odds and then discover later he had died of his wounds so he did not press the point had there been any chance of paying for rescue or even faster passage he might have made more of a fuss but he had no immediate means of payment and the loyalist forcesalong with any privateers that might have been acceptable to both sideshad dropped even further back into home space around chel regrouping it didnt matter worosei would be there with them safe he kept on imagining the look on her face he lapsed into a coma before they got to what was left of the city of golse the ransom and transfer took place without him being aware that anything was going on it was quarter of a year later the war was over and he was back on chel before he discovered what had befallen the winter storm and that worosei had died in it he left during the gsvs night when the sunline had dimmed and disappeared and a deep red light bathed the three great ships and the few lazily flying machines weaving about them he was on yet another vessel a thing called a very fast picket on the last leg of his journey to masaq orbital the craft disappeared through the interior stern fields of the sanctioned parts list and a little later exited and separated from the silvery ellipsoids exterior curving away to set course for the star and system of lacelere and leaving the gsv to begin its long loop back to chelgrian space a vast bright cave of air flashing through the void between the stars airsphere uagen zlepe scholar hung from the leftside subventral foliage of the dirigible behemothaur yoleus by his prehensile tail and his left hand he held a glyphwriting tablet with one foot and wrote inside it with his other hand his remaining leg hung loose temporarily surplus to requirements he wore baggy cerise pantaloons currently rolled up above the knee secured with a stout pocketbelt a short black jacket with a stowed cape chunky mirrorfinish anklebracelets a singlechain necklace with four small dull stones and a tasselled box hat his skin was light green he was about two metres standing straight on his hind legs and a little longer measured from nose to tail around him beyond the hanging fronds of the behemothaurs slipstreamruffled skin foliage the view faded away to a hazy blue nothing in every direction except up where the creatures body filled the sky two of the seven suns were dimly visible one large and red to right and just above assumed horizon one small and yelloworange to left about a quarter off directly below no other mega fauna were visible though uagen knew that there was one nearby just above yoleus top surface the dirigible behemothaur muetenive was in heat and had been for the last three standard years yoleus had been following the other creature for all that time diligently cruising after it always hanging just below and behind paying court arguing its case patiently waiting to reach its own season and insulting infecting or just ramming out of the way all other potential suitors by dirigible behemothaur standards a threeyear courtship indicated little more than an infatuation arguably no more than a passing fancy but yoleus seemed committed to the pursuit and it was this attraction that had brought them so low in the oskendari airsphere over the last fifty standard days usually such mega fauna preferred to stay higher up where the air was thinner down here where the air was so dense and gelatinous that uagen zlepe had noticed his voice sounded different it took a great deal of a dirigible behemothaurs energy to control its buoyancy muetenive was testing yoleus ardour and its fitness somewhere above and ahead of the twoperhaps another five or six days at this slow rate of driftwas the gigalithine lenticular entity buthulne where the pair might eventually mate but more likely would not it was far from certain that they would even get to the great living continent in the first place messenger birds had brought news of a massive convection bubble that was looking likely to well up from the airspheres lower reaches in the next few days and which would if intercepted correctly provide a rapid and easy ascent to the floating world that was buthulne however the timing was tight gossip amongst muetenive and yoleus assorted populations of slaved organisms symbiotes parasites and guests indicated there was a good chance that muetenive would dawdle for the next two or three days and then make a sudden maximumspeed dash for the air space just above the convection bubble to see if yoleus was capable of keeping up if it was and they both made it then they would make a splendidly dramatic entrance into buthulnes presence where a huge parliament of thousands of their peers would be able to witness their glorious arrival the problem was that over the last few tens of thousands of years muetenive had proved itself to be something of an incautious gambler when it came to such matters often it left such sportive or mating sprints until too late so they might not make it to the appropriate region until the bubble had gone and the two mega fauna and all their crawlersinside hangerson and floatersabout would be left with nothing but turbulence or evenworse stilldescending air currents while the bubble rose upwards in the airsphere even more alarmingly for those committed to yoleus given the fabulous legendary reputation of the gigalithine lenticular entity buthulne the messenger birds reckoned it was going to be a particularly big bubble and that buthulne was in the mood for a change of scenery and therefore likely to position itself directly above the upwelling air to ride it to the airspheres upper reaches if that happened it might be years or even decades before they encountered another gigalithine lenticular entity and centuriespossibly millenniabefore buthulne itself hove into view again yoleus invited guests quarters consisted of a gourdshaped growth situated just ahead of the creatures third dorsal fin complex not far from its summit it was inside this structure which reminded uagen of a hollowedout fruit albeit one fifty metres across that he had his rooms uagen had stayed there observing yoleus the other mega fauna and the entire ecology of the airsphere for thirteen years he was now thinking about drastically altering both his life expectancy and his shape to suit better the scale of the airsphere and the length of its larger inhabitants lives uagen had been fairly humanbasic for most of the ninety years hed lived in the culture his present simian formplus the use of some culture technology though no fieldbased science which the mega fauna had a never entirely specified objection tohad seemed a sensible adaption strategy for the airsphere recently however he had started wondering about being altered to resemble something more like a giant bird and living for potentially a very long time indeed and possibly indefinitely long enough for example to experience the slow evolution of a behemothaur if say yoleus and muetenive did mate exchanging and merging personalities what would the two resulting behemothaurs be called yoleunive and mueteleus how exactly did this offspringless coupling affect the two protagonists how would they each change was it an equal trade or did one partner dominate the other were there ever any offspring did behemothaurs ever die of natural causes nobody knew these and a thousand other questions remained unanswered the mega fauna of the airspheres were scrupulous in keeping their own counsel on such matters and in all recorded historyor at least all that hed been able to access through the notoriously immodest data reservoirs of the culturethe evolution of a behemothaur had never been recorded uagen would give almost anything to be the person who witnessed such a process and came up with those answers but just the chance of doing so would mean a huge longterm commitment he supposed if he was to do any of this hed have to go back to his home orbital and talk it over with his professors mother relations friends and so on they were expecting him back for good in another ten or fifteen years but he was increasingly certain that he was one of those scholars who devoted their lives to their work rather than one of those who use a period of intense study to make themselves more rounded beings he felt no great sense of loss at such a prospect by original humanoid standards of lifeexpectancy he had already lived a long full life by the time hed decided to become a student in the first place the long trip back home however did seem slightly daunting the airsphere oskendari was not in regular contact with the culture or anybody else for that matter andthe last uagen had heardthe next culture ship with a course schedule that brought it anywhere near the system wasnt due for another two years there might be other craft calling by before then but it would take even longer to get home if he had to start out on an alien vessel assuming theyd take him even taking a culture ship there would be at least a year travelling home say a year once he got there and then for the return journey no vessels had even coursescheduled that far ahead when hed last checked he had been offered his own ship fifteen years earlier when news had arrived that a dirigible behemothaur had consented to play host to a culture scholar but tying up a star craft for a single person who would use it twice in twenty or thirty years had seemed well overly profligate even by culture standards nonetheless if he was going to stay and possibly never see his friends and family alive again then he really had no choice about returning in any event he needed to think about it yoleus invited guests quarters had been sited where they were to give the creatures visitors a pleasant and airy view with the courtship of muetenive and yoleus tactic of following the other creature just below and behind the quarters had become overshadowed and oppressive a lot of people had left and the remaining guests seemed excessively gossipy and nervous to uagen who was in the end there to study so he spent less time socialising than he had done and more time either in his study or roaming the behemothaurs bulbous surfaces he hung from the foliage working quietly flocks of falficores roamed the spin winds about the two huge creatures columns and clouds of infinitesimal dark shapes it was the flight of a falficore flock uagen was attempting to describe in the glyphwriting tablet writing of course was hardly the right word for what uagen was doing you did not merely write within a glyphwriting tablet you reached inside its holod space with the digital stylo and carved and shaped and coloured and textured and mixed and balanced and annotated all at once glyphs of this sort were solid poetry fashioned from nothing solid they were real spells perfect images ultimate crosssystem intellectualisations they had been invented by minds or their equivalent and there was an infamous rumour that they had only been thought up to provide a means of communication that humans or their equivalent would be unable ever to understand or produce people like uagen had devoted their lives to proving that the minds were either not as differentially smart as they thought or that the paranoid cynics had been wrong there finished uagen said holding the tablet away from his face and squinting at it he turned it and inclined his head he showed the tablet to his companion the interpreter praf who was hanging from a nearby branch at uagens shoulder praf was a fifthorder decider in the dirigible behemothaur yoleus foliage gleaner troupe who had been given upgraded autonomous intelligence and the title interpreter when shed been assigned to uagen she inclined her head at the same angle and stared into the tablet i see nothing she spoke in marain the cultures language you are hanging upside down the creature shook its wings her eye pit band looked straight at uagen does that make a difference yes its polarised observe uagen turned the tablet straight on to the interpreter and inverted it praf flinched her wings jerking halfway out and her body hunching as though getting ready to fly she collected herself and settled back swaying to and fro oh yes there they are i was attempting to use the phenomenon whereby one is looking at a flock offor examplefalficores from a great distance but is unable to see them because of ones inability to distinguish individual creatures at such a range whereupon they suddenly coalesce and flock together gathering into a tighter grouping and becoming suddenly visible as though out of nothing as a metaphor for the often equally precipitous experience of conceptual comprehension praf turned her head opened her beak flicked out her tongue to groom a twisted skinleaf straight then looked at him again that is done how umm with great skill uagen said and then gave a delicate slightly surprised laugh he stowed the stylo and clicked the tablet to store the glyph the stylo must not have been properly stowed because it clicked out of its housing in the side of the tablet and fell away into the blueness below oh damn uagen said i knew i should have replaced that lanyard the stylo swiftly became a dot they both watched it praf said that is your writing instrument uagen took hold of his right foot yes do you have another uagen chewed on one of his toenails umm not really no praf tilted her head hmm uagen scratched his head i suppose id better go after it it is your only one uagen let go with his hand and tail dropping into the air to follow the instrument praf released her claw holds and followed him the air was very warm and thick it roared around uagens ears buffeting i am reminded praf said as they plummeted together what uagen said he clipped the writing tablet to his belt popped a pair of windgoggles over his already watering eyes and twisted in the air to keep an eye on the stylo which was almost out of sight such styli were small but very dense and also effectively if unintentionally quite streamlined it was falling alarmingly quickly his clothes fluttered and snapped like a flag in a gale uagens tasselled hat flew off he grabbed at it but it floated away upwards above the cloudsized bulk of the dirigible behemothaur yoleus drew slowly away as they fell shall i get your hat praf shouted over the wind roar no thank you uagen yelled we can retrieve it on the way back up uagen twisted back round and peered into the blue depths the stylo was tearing through the air like a crossbow quarrel praf drifted closer to uagen until her beak was close to his right ear and her body feathers were fluttering in the disturbed air just past his shoulder as i was saying she said yes the yoleus would know more of your conclusions regarding your theory on the effects of gravitational susceptibility influencing the religiosity of a species with particular reference to their eschatological beliefs uagen was losing sight of the stylo he glanced round frowning at praf what now i just remembered umm well just wait a moment cant you i mean this things fairly hurtling away down here uagen fingered a button on his left wrist cuff his clothes sucked in about him and stopped flapping he assumed a diving position placing his hands together and wrapping his tail round his legs by his side praf drew her wings in tighter and also took on a more aerodynamic aspect i cannot see the thing you dropped i can just i think oh bugger and blast it was getting away from him the stylos air resistance must be just that little less than his even in a headdown dive he looked at the interpreter for a moment i think ill have to power down to it he shouted praf seemed to draw herself in bringing her wings even closer to her body and stretching her neck she gained very slightly on uagen starting to move past him downwards then relaxed and drifted back up i cannot go any faster right then ill see you in a bit uagen clicked a couple of buttons on his wrist tiny motors in his ankle bracelets swung out and revved up keep clear he shouted to the interpreter the motors propeller blades were expandable and while he would not need much extra power to increase his rate of fall sufficiently to catch up with the stylo he had a horror of accidentally mincing one of yoleus most trusted servants praf had already angled a few metres away i shall attempt to catch your hat and try not to become eaten by falficores oh right uagens speed through the air increased the wind howled in his ears and tiny popping crackling sounds from his ears and skull cavities told him the pressure was increasing he had lost sight of the stylo just for a moment and now it seemed to be quite gone swallowed up by the oceanic blue of the apparently infinite sky if only hed kept his eyes on it he was sure hed still be able to see it now there was a similarity here perhaps with the glyph of the suddenly visible falficores something to do with perceptual concentration with the way that ones vision pulled meaning from the semichaos of the visual field perhaps the stylo had drifted away to one side perhaps a wellcamouflaged raptor mistaking it for a meal had swept in and gobbled it up perhaps he would not regain sight of it untilhaving started out so lowthey both hit the insloping side of the sphere he supposed he might see it bounce how steep was the slope the airsphere was not really a sphere indeed neither of its two lobes was a sphere at a certain level the bottom of the airspheres curving sides inverted dipping under the mass of the detritus neck how far away were they from the pole line of the airsphere he recalled theyd been quite near by all accounts the gigalithine lenticular entity buthulne hadnt strayed far from the pole line for several decades perhaps he would have to land on the detritus neck he peered downwards no sign of anything solid ahead at all besides hed been told youd have to fall for days before youd even see it and anyway if the stylo fell into the rubbish and muck of the neck hed never find it gracious there were things down there he might as praf had put it become eaten what if he landed on the detritus neck just as it was about to eject then he would surely die in vacuum as part of a glorified dung ball how horrible airspheres migrated round the galaxy orbiting once every fifty to a hundred million years depending on how close they were to the centre they swept up dust and gas on their forwardfacing sides and from their bases every few hundred thousand years they passed the waste that their scavenger flora and fauna had not been able to process any further droppings the size of small moons issued from globular impossibilities as big as brown dwarfs leaving a trail of detritus globes scattered through the spiral arms that dated the bizarre worlds first appearance in the galaxy to one and a half billion years earlier people assumed airspheres must be the work of intelligence but really nobodyor at least nobody willing to share their thoughts on the matterhad any idea the mega fauna might know butfrustratingly for scholars like uagen zlepecreatures like yoleus were so far far beyond the term inscrutable that for all practical purposes the word might as well have been a synonym of forthright or a simplehearted chatterbox uagen wondered how fast he was falling now perhaps if he fell too fast he would fly straight into the stylo and impale and kill himself how delightfully ironic but painful he checked his velocity on a little readout in the corner of one eyegoggle he was falling at twentytwo metres per second and this rate of descent was smoothly increasing he adjusted his speed to a constant twenty he turned his attention back to the blue gulf ahead and below and saw the stylo wobbling fractionally as it fell as though somebody invisible was doodling a spiral with it he judged that he was drifting towards the thing at a satisfactory rate when he was a few metres away he cut his speed still further until he was catching up with the instrument no quicker than a feather might fall through still air uagen reached out and caught the stylo he tried to halt his fall the impressive way the way a person of action might uagen for all his studiousness was a sucker for action adventures however implausible by swinging himself round so that his feet were underneath him and the propeller blades on his ankle bracelets were biting down into the air rushing up towards and past him in retrospect he had probably stood a good chance of mutilating himself with his own propellers but instead he just lost all control and tumbled chaotically through the air shouting and cursing trying to keep his tail curled up tight and away from the propellers and letting go of the stylo again he spread out his limbs and waited until there was some sort of regularity to his tumble then twisted back into a dive to regain control and once more looked about for the stylo he could see the vaguest hint of yoleus shape high high above and a tiny outlinejust close enough to be a shape and not a dotalso above and to one side this looked like praf and there was the stylo now above him just stopping tumbling and beginning to settle into its crossbow quarrel attitude he used his wrist controls to reduce power to the propellers the wind roar decreased the stylo fell gently into his hand he attached it to the side of the writing tablet then used his wrist controls to feather and then repitch the motors blades blood rushed to his head adding another roaring to that of the wind and making the blue view pulse and darken his necklacea gift from his aunt silder presented just before he leftslid down under his chin he let the propellers freewheel for a bit then fed in the power again he still felt very headdown heavy but that was the worst he experienced his headlong plummet became a slow fall the thick air stopped shaking him and the slipstream became a gentle breeze finally he stopped he thought the better of trying to balance on the ankle bracelet motors he would activate the cape and let it float him back up he hung there head down effectively motionless as the ankle motors spun lazily in the thick air his eyes narrowed there was something down there something far below almost but not quite lost in the haze a shape a very big shape filling about the same part of his visual field as his hand would have held outstretched and yet still so far away that it was barely visible in the haze he squinted looked away and looked back there was definitely something there from the finned airship shape it looked like another behemothaur though yoleus had let it be known that muetenive had taken them unfashionably hurtfully almost unprecedentedly and arguably disgracefully low and so uagen thought it very strange to see another of the giant creatures so much deeper still beneath the courting couple the shape also did not look quite right there were too many fins and in planmaking the very reasonable assumption that he was looking down on its backthe thing looked asymmetrical very unusual even alarming there was a fluttering noise nearby here is your hat he turned to look at praf flapping her wings slowly in the dense air and holding his tasselled box hat in her beak oh thank you he said and rammed the hat on tight you have the stylo umm yes yes i do look down there can you see something looked down eventually she said there is a shadow yes there is isnt there does it look like a behemothaur to you the interpreter cocked her head no no the interpreter turned her head the other way yes yes no and yes both at once ahha he looked down again i wonder what it can be i wonder too shall we return to the yoleus umm i dont know do you think we ought yes we have fallen a long way i cannot see the yoleus oh oh dear he looked up sure enough the creatures giant shape had disappeared in the haze above i see or rather we cant see ha ha indeed umm still i do wonder what that is down there the shadowy outline beneath appeared to be stationary air currents in the haze made it almost disappear for a few moments so that all that was left was the bias in the eye making the assumption that it must still be there and then it was back distinguishable but still no more than a shape a oneshadedeeper blue shadow against the colossal gulf of air below we should return to the yoleus do you think yoleus will have any idea what it is yes it does look like a behemothaur doesnt it yes and no maybe sick sick injured injured what canhow can behemothaurs become injured it is very unusual we should return to the yoleus we could take a closer look uagen said he wasnt really sure he wanted to but he felt he ought to say it it was interesting after all on the other hand it was a little disturbing too as praf had said they had lost visual contact with yoleus it ought to be easy enough to find it againyoleus had not been moving quickly and so simply going straight back up would probably still bring them up almost underneath the creaturebut well even so what if muetenive decided to make a bolt for the anticipated convection bubble now rather than in a day or two good grief he and praf could both be left stranded yoleus might not have noticed that theyd gone if it had realised they were no longer aboard and then took off after a suddenly frisky muetenive it would probably leave some raptor scouts behind to protect them and escort them back but there was no guarantee that it did know he and praf were not safely within its foliage uagen looked around for falficores he didnt even have a weapon when hed refused any sort of bodyguard device the university had insisted he at least take a pistol with him but hed never even unpacked the damn thing we should return to the yoleus the interpreter spoke very quickly which was as close as she ever got to sounding nervous or disturbed praf had probably never been in a position where she couldnt see the great creature that was her home host leader parent and beloved she must be afraid if such beings felt fear uagen was afraid he could admit that not very afraid but afraid enough to hope that praf would refuse to accompany him down to the huge shape below and they would have to go down quite a long way further he didnt like to think how many more kilometres we should return to the yoleus she said again you really think so yes we should return to the yoleus oh i suppose so all right he sighed discretion and all that best let yoleus decide what to do we should return to the yoleus yes yes he used the wrist controls to activate the stowed cape it unfurled collapsed slowly into a ball theneven more slowlybegan to expand we should return to the yoleus we are praf we are were going now he could feel himself starting to drift upwards and a faint pull on his shoulders began to lift him towards the horizontal we should return to the yoleus praf please thats what were doing dont keep we should return to the yoleus we are he let the power to the braceletankle motors tail off the ballooning cape still a perfect black sphere blossoming behind his head slowly took all his weight and hoisted him upright we should praf the propellers cut out and stowed themselves back in his ankle bracelets he was floating upwards at last praf beat her wings a little harder to keep up with him she looked up at the still enlarging black sphere of the cape another thing she said uagen was staring down between his boots already the vast shape beneath was starting to disappear into the haze he glanced at the interpreter what the yoleus would like to know more of the vacuum dirigibles in your culture he looked up at the black balloon above his head the cape produced lift by compressing itself into a ball and then expanding its surface area while leaving a vacuum inside that vacuum was lifting him by the shoulders up into the sky what oh well he wished he hadnt mentioned the damn things now he also wished hed brought a more complete technical library from the culture im hardly an expert i have been a tourist on them a few times on my home orbital you mentioned pumping vacuum how is that done praf seemed to be labouring to keep up with him now flapping her wings as hard as the thickened atmosphere would allow uagen adjusted the dimensions of the cape his rate of climb tailed off ah well as far as i understand it you keep the vacuum in spheres spheres very thinshelled spheres you keep the spaces between the spheres full of ah well helium or hydrogen i think depending on your inclination though i dont think you get a vast amount of extra lift compared to using hydrogen or helium alone just a few per cent one of those things that tend to be done because they can be rather than because they need to be one sees then you can pump it them the spheres and the gas one sees and what is the manner of this pumping umm he looked down again but the great shadowy shape had gone a very attractive system recording this is a great simulation its not a simulation yeah of course still it is though isnt it push push im pushing im pushing well push harder you dont think this is a fucking simulation do you oh no not a fucking simulation look i dont know what youre on but whatever it is its the wrong stuff the flames are coming up the shaft so get some water down it i cant reach the im really impressed you are on something arent you he must be glanding nobody can be this stupid straight im so glad we waited till night arent you absolutely look at the day side ive never seen it shimmer like that have you not that i can recall ha i love this brilliant simulation its not a simulation you buffoon will you listen we should get this guy out of here what is that anyway who not what homomdan guy called kabe oh they were lavarafting kabe sat in the centre of the flatdecked craft staring at the mottled yellowbright flowing river of molten rock ahead and the darkly desolate landscape through which it ran he could hear the humans talking but he wasnt paying much attention to who said what hes already out of it just brilliant look at that and the heat i agree get him zapped its on fire pole on the dark bits you idiot not the bright bits bring it in and put it out what fuck its hot yeah it is isnt it i never felt a sim this hot this is not a simulation and youre getting zapped can anybody help oh throw it away grab another oar they were on one of masaqs last eight uninhabited plates hereand for three plates to spinward and four antispinwardmasaq great river flowed dead straight through a seventyfivethousandkilometrelong basematerial tunnel across a landscape still in the process of being formed wow hot hot hot some sim get this guy out of here he shouldnt have been invited in the first place there are onetimers here with no savers if this clown thinks were in a sim he could do anything jump overboard hopefully need more bods on the starboard side the what right the right this side this side here fuck dont even fucking joke about that hes so twisted i wouldnt trust him to punch out if he did fall in tunnel ahead going to get hotter oh shit it cant get hotter they dont let it will you fucking listen this is not a simulation as was by now longstanding established practice for the culture asteroids from masaqs own systemmost of them collected and parked in planetary holding orbits several thousand years earlier when the orbital had first been constructedwere tugged in by lifter craft and lowered to the plates surface where any one of several energy delivery systems planetary crustbusting weapons if you insisted on looking on them that way heated the bodies to liquid heat so that even more mindboggling matter and energymanipulating processes either let the resulting slag flow and cool in certain designated directions or sculpted it to cloak the already existing morphology of the strategic base matter on what on you fall on not in dont look at me like that its the density i bet you know all about fucking density got a terminal no implanted no me neither try and find somebody who does or is and get that cretin off here it wont come out the pin you have to knock the pin out first oh yeah peopleespecially culture people whether human once human alien or machinehad been building orbitals like this for thousands of years and not very long after the process had become a mature technology still thousands of years earlier some fun or at any rate risk loving individual had thought of using a few of the lava streams naturally generated by such processes as the medium for a new sport excuse me i have a terminal oh yeah kabe of course what i have a terminal here ship oars mind your heads its fucking glowing in there man sep hit the cover covering now oh wow ship them or lose them hub see this guy simshitter zap him out now done and so lavarafting became a pastime on masaq the tradition was that you did it without the aid of field technology or anything clever in the way of material science the experience would be more exciting and you would come closer to its reality if you used materials that were only just up to the demands being made in it it was what people called a minimalsafetyfactor sport watch that oar its caught well push it oh shit what the aaah its okay its okay fuck you are all quite mad by the way happy rafting the raft itselfa flatdecked platform four metres by twelve with metrehigh gunwaleswas ceramic the cover protecting the rafters from the heat of the lava tunnel they were now shooting down was aluminised plastic and the steering oars were wood to introduce a note of the corporeal my hair oh i want to go home water bucket whered that guy stop whining good grief lavarafting had always been exciting and dangerous once the eight plates had been filled with air it had become more of a hardship radiated heat was joined by convected and while people felt it was somehow more authentic to raft without breathing gear having your lungs scorched was generally no more fun than it sounded ah my nose my nose thanks sprays youre welcome im with the other guy i dont believe this kabe sat back he had to crouch the windrippled undersurface of the rafts foil cover was just above his head the canopy was reflecting the heat of the tunnels ceiling but the air temperature was still extreme some of the humans were pouring water over themselves or spraying it onto each other coils of steam filled the little mobile cave that the raft had become the light was very dark red spilling from either end of the pitching bucking craft this hurts well stop it hurting zap me out too nearly out ohoh we got hangspikes the downstream mouth of the lava tunnel had teeth it was strung with jagged protrusions like stalactites spikes get down one of the hangspikes ripped the rafts flimsy protective cover away and flung it onto the yellowglowing surface of the lava stream the cover shrank burst into flames and then caught in the thermals coming off the braided flow rose flapping like a burning bird a blast of heat rolled over the raft people screamed kabe had to fling himself back flat to avoid being hit by one of the pendulous spears of rock he felt something give beneath him there was a snap and another scream the raft flew out of the tunnel into a broad canyon of craggy cliffs whose basalt dark edges were lit by the broad stream of lava coursing between them kabe levered himself back up most of the humans were throwing or spraying water around cooling themselves after the final blast of heat many had lost hair some were sitting or lying looking singed but uncaring staring blankly ahead blissed out on some secretion one couple were just sitting hunched up on the flat deck of the raft crying loudly was that your leg kabe asked the man sitting on the deck behind him the man was holding his left leg and grimacing yes he said i think its broken yes i think it is too im very sorry is there anything i can do try not falling back like that again not while im here kabe looked forward the glowing river of orange lava meandered into the distance between the canyon walls there were no more lava tunnels visible i think i can guarantee that kabe said i do apologise i was told to sit in the centre of the deck can you move the man slid back on one hand and his buttocks still holding his leg with the other hand people were calming down some were still crying but one was shouting that it was okay there were no more lava tunnels you all right one of the females asked the man with the broken leg the womans jacket was still smouldering she had no eyebrows and her blonde hair looked uneven and had crispedlooking patches broken ill live my fault kabe explained ill get a splint the woman went to a locker near the stern kabe looked round there was a smell of burned hair and oldfashioned clothing and lightly crisped human flesh he could see a few people with discoloured patches on their faces and a few had their hands submerged in water buckets the crouched couple were still wailing most of the rest who hadnt blissed out were comforting each other tearstreaked faces lit by the livid light reflected from the glasssharp black cliffs high above twinkling madly in the browndark sky the nova that was portisia gazed balefully down and this is meant to be fun kabe thought does it become any more ridiculous what somebody yelled from the rafts bows rapids not really somebody started sobbing hysterically ive seen enough shall we by all means once was probably enough recording ends kabe and ziller faced each other across a large elegantly furnished room lit by golden sunlight that spilled through the opened balcony windows already filtered through the gently waving branches of an everblue growing outside a myriad of soft needleshadows moved on the creamily tiled floor lay across the ankledeep abstractly patterned carpets and fluttered silently on the sculpted surfaces of gleaming wooden sideboards richly carved chests and plumply upholstered couches the homomdan and the chelgrian both wore devices which looked like they might have been either protective helmets of dubious effectiveness or rather garish headjewellery ziller snorted we look preposterous perhaps that is one reason people take to implants they each took the devices off kabe sitting on a graceful relatively flimsylooking chaise longue with deep bays designed especially for tripeds placed his headset on the couch beside him ziller curled on a broad couch set his on the floor he blinked a couple of times then reached into his waistcoat pocket for his pipe he wore palegreen leggings and an enamelled groin plate the waistcoat was hide jewelled this was when he asked about eighty days ago the hub mind was right they are all quite mad and yet most of the people you saw there had lavarafted before and had just as awful a time i have checked up since and all but three of the twentythree humans you saw there have taken part in the sport again kabe picked up a cushion and played with the fringing though it has to be said that two of them have experienced temporary bodydeath when their lava canoe capsized and one of thema onetimer a disposablewas crushed to death while glaciercaving completely dead very completely and forever they recovered the body and held a funeral service age she was thirtyone standard years old barely an adult ziller sucked on his pipe he looked towards the balcony windows they were in a large house in an estate in the tirian hills on osinorsi lower the plate to spinwards of xarawe kabe shared the house with an extended human family of about sixteen individuals two of them children a new top floor had been built for him kabe enjoyed the company of the humans and their young though he had come to realise that he was probably a little less gregarious than hed thought he was he had introduced the chelgrian to the half dozen other people present in and around the house and shown him round from downslopefacing windows and balconies and from the roof garden you could see looming bluely across the plains the cliffs of the massif that carried masaq great river across the vast sunken garden that was osinorsi lower plate they were waiting for the drone e h tersono which was on its way to them with what it called important news i seem to recall ziller said that i said i agreed with hub that they were all quite mad and you began your reply with the words and yet ziller frowned and then everything you said subsequently seemed to agree with my original point what i meant is that however much they appeared to hate the experience and despite being under no pressure to repeat it other than pressure from their equally cretinous peers they nevertheless chose to because however awful it might have seemed at the time they feel that they gained something positive from it oh and what would that be that they lived through it despite their stupidity in undertaking this totally unnecessary traumatic experience in the first place what one should gain from an unpleasant experience should be the determination not to repeat it or at least the inclination they feel they have tested themselves and found themselves to be mad does that count as a positive result they feel they have tested themselves against nature whats natural around here ziller protested the nearest natural thing to here is ten light minutes away its the fucking sun he snorted and i wouldnt put it past them to have meddled with that i dont believe they have in fact it was a potential instability in lacelere that produced the high backup rate on masaq orbital in the first place before it became famous for excessive fun kabe put the cushion down ziller was staring at him are you saying the sun could explode well sort of in theory its a very youre not serious of course i am the chances are they never told me that actually it wouldnt really blow up as such but it might flare it does flare ive seen its flares yes pretty arent they but there is a chanceno more than one in several million during the time the star spends on the mainsequencethat it might produce a flare sequence that hub and the orbitals defences would be unable to deflect or shelter everyone from and they built this thing here i understand it was a very attractive system otherwise and besides i believe that over time theyve added extra protection underplate which could stand up to anything short of a supernova though of course any technology can go wrong and sensibly the culture of backingup as a matter of course is still common ziller was shaking his head they could have mentioned this to me perhaps the risk is deemed so tiny they have given up bothering ziller smoothed his scalp fur hed let his pipe go out i dont believe these people the chances of disaster are very remote indeed especially for any given year or even sentient lifetime kabe rose and lumbered over to a sideboard he picked up a bowl of fruits fruit no thank you kabe selected a ripe sunbread he had had his intestinal flora altered to enable him to eat common culture foods more unusually he had had his oral and nasal senses modified so that he could taste food as a standard culture human would he turned away from ziller as he popped the sunbread into his mouth chewed the fruit a couple of times and swallowed the action of averting his face from others when eating had become habitual members of kabes species had very big mouths and some humans found the sight of him eating alarming but to return to my point he said dabbing at his mouth with a napkin lets not use the word nature then let us say they feel they have gained something from having pitted themselves against forces much greater than themselves and this is somehow not a sign of madness ziller shook his head kabe you may have been here too long the homomdan crossed to the balcony gazing out at the view i would say that these people are demonstrably not mad they live lives that seem quite sane otherwise what glaciercaving that is not all they do indeed they do lots of other insane things naked bladefencing mountain freeclimbing wingflying very few do nothing but take part in these extreme pastimes most have otherwise fairly normal lives ziller relit his pipe by culture standards well yes and why not they socialise they have workhobbies they play in more gentle forms they read or watch screen they go to entertainments they sit around grinning in one of their glanded drug states they study they spend time travelling ahhah apparently just for the sake of it or they simply potter and of course many of them indulge in arts and crafts kabe made a smile and spread his three hands a few even compose music they spend time thats just it they spend time travelling the time weighs heavily on them because they lack any context any valid framework for their lives they persist in hoping that something they think theyll find in the place theyre heading for will somehow provide them with a fulfilment they feel certain they deserve and yet have never come close to experiencing ziller frowned and tapped at his pipe bowl some travel forever in hope and are serially disappointed others slightly less selfdeceiving come to accept that the process of travelling itself offers if not fulfilment then relief from the feeling that they should be feeling fulfilled kabe watched a springleg bounce from branch to branch through the trees outside its ruddy fur and long tail dappled with leaf shadows he could hear the shrill voices of human children playing and splashing in the pool at the side of the house oh come ziller arguably any intelligent species feels that to some extent really does yours kabe fingered the soft folds of the drapes at the side of the balcony window we are much older than the humans but i think we probably did once he looked back at the chelgrian crouched on the wide seat as though ready to pounce all naturally evolved sentient life is restless at some scale or stage ziller appeared to consider this then shook his head kabe was not yet sure if this gesture meant that he had said something too preposterous to be worth dignifying with an answer perpetrated an appalling cliche or made a point that the chelgrian could not find an adequate reply to the point is ziller said that having carefully constructed their paradise from first principles to remove all credible motives for conflict amongst themselves and all natural threats he paused and glanced sourly at the sunlight flaring off the gilt border of his seatwell almost all natural threats these people then find their lives are so hollow they have to recreate false versions of just the sort of terrors untold generations of their ancestors spent their existences attempting to conquer i think that is a little like criticising somebody for owning both an umbrella and a shower kabe said it is the choice that is important he rearranged the curtains more symmetrically these people control their terrors they can choose to sample them repeat them or avoid them that is not the same as living beneath the volcano when youve just invented the wheel or wondering whether your levee will break and drown your entire village again this applies to all societies which have matured beyond the age of barbarism there is no great mystery here but the culture is so insistent in its utopianism ziller said sounding kabe thought almost bitter they are like an infant with a toy demanding it only to throw it away kabe watched ziller puff at his pipe for a while then walked through the cloud of smoke and sat trefoil on the fingerdeep carpet near the other males couch i think it is only natural and a sign that one has succeeded as a species that what used to have to be suffered as a necessity becomes enjoyed as sport even fear can be recreational ziller looked into the homomdans eyes and despair kabe shrugged despair well only in the short term as when one despairs of completing a task or winning at some game or sport and yet later does the earlier despair makes the victory all the sweeter that is not despair ziller said quietly that is temporary annoyance the passing irritation of foreseen disappointment i meant nothing so trivial i meant the sort of despair that eats your soul that contaminates your senses so that every experience however pleasant becomes saturated with bile the sort of despair that drives you to thoughts of suicide kabe rocked back no he said no they might hope to have put that behind them yes they leave it in their wake for others ah kabe nodded i think we touch upon what happened to your own people well some of them feel remorse close to despair about that it was mostly our own doing ziller crumbled some smoke block into his pipe tamping it down with a small silver instrument and producing further clouds of smoke we would doubtless have contrived a war without the cultures help not necessarily i disagree regardless at least after a war we might have been forced to confront our own stupidities the cultures involvement meant that we suffered the wars depredations while failing to benefit from its lessons we just blamed the culture instead short of our utter destruction the outcome could hardly have been worse and sometimes i feel that even that is an unjustified exception kabe sat still for a while blue smoke rose from zillers pipe ziller had once been giftedfromtacted mahrai ziller viii of wescrip born into a family of administrators and diplomats he had been a musical prodigy almost from infancy composing his first orchestral work at an age when most chelgrian children were still learning not to eat their shoes he had taken the designation giftedtwo caste levels below that he had been born intowhen he dropped out of college scandalising his parents despite garnering outrageous fame and fortune in his career he scandalised them still further to the point of illness and breakdown when he became a radical caste denier entered politics as an equalitarian and used his prestige to argue for the end of the caste system gradually public and political opinion began to shift it started to look as though the long talkedabout great change might finally happen after an unsuccessful attempt on his life ziller renounced his caste altogether and so was deemed the lowest of the noncriminal low an invisible a second assassination attempt very nearly succeeded it left him near death and in hospital for quarter of a year it was moot whether his months out of the political scrum had made any crucial difference but unarguably by the time he was recovered the tide had turned again the backlash had begun and any hope of significant change appeared to have vanished for at least a generation zillers musical output had suffered during the years of his political involvement in quantity at least he announced that he was quitting public life to concentrate on composition so alienating his former liberal allies and delighting the conservatives who had been his enemies even so despite great pressure he did not renounce his invisible statusthough increasingly he was treated as an honorary givenand he never gave any sign of support for the status quo save for that studied silence on all matters political his prestige and popularity increased still further cascades of prizes awards and honours were lavished upon him polls proclaimed him the greatest living chelgrian there was talk of him becoming ceremonial president one day with his celebrity and prominence at this unprecedented crescendo of acclaim he used what was supposed to be his acceptance speech for the greatest civilian honour the chelgrian state could bestowat a grand and glittering ceremony in chelise the chelgrian states capital which would be broadcast over the whole sphere of chelgrian spaceto announce that he had never changed his views he was and always would be a liberal and an equalitarian he was more proud to have worked with the people who still espoused such views than he was of his music he had grown to loathe the forces of conservatism even more than he had in his youth he still despised the state the society and the people that tolerated the caste system he was not accepting this honour he would be returning all the others he had acquired and he had already booked passage to leave the chelgrian state immediately and forever because unlike the liberal comrades he loved respected and admired so much he just did not have the moral strength to continue living in this vicious hateful intolerable regime any longer his speech was greeted with stunned silence he left the stage to hisses and boos and spent the night in a culture embassy compound with a crowd at the gates baying for his blood a culture ship lifted him away the following day he travelled extensively within the culture over the next few years and finally made his home on masaq orbital ziller had remained on masaq even after the election of an equalitarian president on chel seven years after hed left reforms were put in place and the invisibles and the other castes were fully enfranchised at last but still despite numerous requests and invitations ziller had not returned to his home and had offered little in the way of explanation people assumed it was because the caste system would still exist part of the compromise which had sold the reforms to the higher castes was that titles and caste names would be retained as part of ones legal nomenclature and a new property law would give ownership of clan lands to the immediate family of the house chief in return people of all levels of society were now free to marry and procreate with whoever would have them partnered couples would each take the caste of the highestdesignated of the two their young would inherit that caste elected caste courts would oversee the redesignation of applying individuals there would no longer be a law to punish people who claimed to be of a higher caste and so in theory anybody could claim to be whatever they wanted to be though a court of law would still insist on calling them as they had been born or redesignated it was an enormous legal and behavioural change from the old system but it still included caste and it did not seem to be enough for ziller then the ruling coalition on chel had elected a spayed as president as an effective but surprising symbol of how much had changed the regime survived a coup attempt by some guards officers and appeared strengthened by the experience with power and authority seemingly being distributed even more fully and irrevocably down the ladder of original castes yet still ziller arguably more popular than ever had not returned he claimed to be waiting to see what would happen then something terrible happened and he saw and still did not go home even after the caste war which broke out nine years after he left and was by its own admission largely the cultures fault eventually kabe said my own people fought the culture once unlike us we fought ourselves ziller looked at the homomdan did you profit from the experience he asked tartly yes we lost much many brave people and many noble ships and we did not succeed in our initial war aims directly but we maintained our civilisational course and gained in as much that we discovered that the culture could be lived with honourably and that it was what we had been worried it was not another temperate dweller in the galactic house our two societies have since become companionable and we are occasionally allies they didnt crush you utterly then they didnt try to nor we them it was never that sort of war and besides that is neither their way nor ours it is not really anybodys way these days in any event our dispute with the culture was always a sideshow to the principal action which was the conflict between our hosts and the idirans ah yes the famous twin novae battle ziller said sounding disparaging kabe was surprised at the tone is your symphony past the tinkering stage yet pretty much youre still pleased with it yes very there is nothing wrong with the music however i do begin to wonder whether my enthusiasm got the better of me perhaps i was wrong to become so involved with our hub minds memento mori ziller fidgeted with his waistcoat then waved one hand dismissively oh take no notice i always become a little disheartened when ive just finished something this size and i will confess to a degree of nervousness at the prospect of standing up and conducting in front of the sort of numbers hub is talking about plus im still not sure about all the extraneous stuff hub wants to add around the music ziller snorted i may be more of a purist than i thought i am sure it will go wonderfully well when does hub intend to announce the concert very soon now ziller said sounding defensive it was one of the reasons i came over here i thought i might be besieged if i stayed home kabe nodded slowly i am glad to be of service and i cannot wait to hear the piece thank you im pleased with it but i cant help feeling complicit with hubs ghoulishness i wouldnt call it ghoulish old soldiers are rarely so depressed disturbed and morbid sometimes but not ghoulish that is a civilian preoccupation hub isnt a civilian ziller asked hub might be depressed and disturbed is this something else they didnt tell me about masaq hub has never been either depressed or disturbed to my knowledge kabe said however it was once the mind of a waradapted general systems vehicle and it was there at the twin novae battle at the end of the war and suffered near total destruction at the hands of an idiran battle fleet not quite total not quite they dont believe in the captain going down with the ship then i understand that being last to abandon it is considered sufficient but do you see masaq mourns and honours those it lost those who died and seeks to atone for whatever part it played in the war ziller shook his head the scummer might have told me some of this he muttered kabe pondered the wisdom of remarking that ziller might have discovered all of this easily enough himself had he been so inclined but decided against it ziller tapped his pipe out well let us hope it does not suffer from despair drone e h tersono is here the house announced oh good about time invite it in the drone floated in through the balcony window sunlight dappling its rosy porcelain skin and blue lumenstone frame i noticed the window was open hope you dont mind not at all eavesdropping outside were we ziller asked the drone settled delicately on a chair my dear ziller certainly not why were you talking about me no so tersono kabe said it is very kind of you to visit i understand we owe the honour to further news of our envoy yes i have learned the identity of the emissary being sent to us by chel the drone said his full name is and i quote calledtoarmsfromgiven major tibilo quilan iv autumn of itirewein griefling sheracht order good heavens kabe said looking at ziller your full names are even longer than the cultures yes an endearing trait isnt it ziller said he looked into his pipe brows puckered so our emissarys a warlordpriest a rich broker boy from one of the sovereign families whos found a taste for soldiering or been shunted into it to keep him out of the way and then found faith or found it politic to find it parents traditionalists and hes a widower probably you know him kabe asked actually i do from a long time ago we were at infant school together we were friends i suppose though not particularly close we lost touch after that havent heard of him since ziller inspected his pipe and seemed to be contemplating lighting it again instead he replaced it in his waistcoat pocket even if we werent once acquainted though the rest of the name rigmarole tells you most of what you need to know he snorted culture full names act as addresses ours act as potted histories and of course they tell you whether you should bow or be bowed to our major quilan will certainly expect to be bowed to you may be doing him a disservice tersono said i have a full biography you might be interested in well im not ziller said emphatically turning away to look at a painting hanging on one wall it showed longago homomdans riding enormous tusked creatures waving flags and spears and looking heroic in a hectic sort of way id like to look at it later kabe said certainly so thats what twentythree twentyfour days till he gets here about that oh i do so hope hes having a pleasant journey ziller said in a strange almost childish voice he spat into his hands and smoothed the tawny pelt over each forearm in turn stretching each hand as he did so so that the claws emerged gleaming black curves the size of a humans small finger glinting in the soft sunlight like polished obsidian blades the culture drone and the homomdan male exchanged looks kabe lowered his head resistance is characterforming quilan wondered about their ship names perhaps it was some elaborate joke to send him on the final leg of his journey aboard a onetime warshipa gangster class rapid offensive unit which had been demilitarised to become a very fast picketcalled resistance is characterforming it was a jokey name yet pointed so many of their ship names were like that even if more were just jokey chelgrian craft had romantic purposeful or poetic names but the culturewhile it had a sprinkling of ships with names of similar naturesusually went for ironic meticulously obscure supposedly humorous or frankly absurd names perhaps this was partly because they had so many craft perhaps it reflected the fact that their ships were their own masters and chose their own names the first thing he did when he stepped aboard the ship into a small foyer floored with gleaming wood and edged with bluegreen foliage was to take a deep breath it smells like he began home said the voice in his head yes quilan breathed and experienced a strange weakening pleasantly sad sensation and suddenly thought of childhood careful son major quilan welcome aboard the ship said from nowhere in particular i have introduced a fragrance into the air which should be reminiscent of the atmosphere around lake itir chel during springtime do you find this agreeable quilan nodded yes yes i do good your quarters are directly ahead please make yourself at home hed been expecting a cabin as cramped as the one hed been given on the nuisance value but was pleasantly surprised the resistance is characterformings interior had been refitted to provide comfortable accommodation for about half a dozen people rather than cramped quarters for four times that number the ship was uncrewed and chose not to use an avatar or drone to communicate it just spoke to quilan out of thin air and carried out mundane housekeeping duties by creating internal maniple fields so that clothes for example just floated around seeming to clean and fold and sort and store themselves its like living in a fucking haunted house huyler said good job neither of us is superstitious and it means its listening to you all the time spying that could be interpreted as a form of honesty or arrogance these things dont choose their names out of a hat resistance is characterforming if nothing else as a motto it was a little insensitive given the circumstances of the war were they trying to tell him and through him chel itself that they didnt really care about what had happened despite all their protestations or even that they did care and were sorry yet it had all been for their own good more likely the ships name was coincidence there was a sort of carelessness about the culture sometimes a reverse side to the coin of the societys fabled thoroughness and tenacity of purpose as though every now and again they caught themselves being overly obsessive and precise and tried to compensate by suddenly doing something frivolous or irresponsible or might they not get bored being good supposedly they were infinitely patient boundlessly resourceful unceasingly understanding but would not any rational mind with or without the capital letter grow tired of such unleavened niceness eventually wouldnt they want to cause just a little havoc just once in a while just to show what they could do or did such thoughts merely betray his own inheritance of animal ferocity chelgrians were proud of having evolved from predators it was a kind of double pride too even if a few people regarded it as contradictory in nature they were proud that their distant ancestors had been predators but they were also proud that their species had evolved and matured away from the kind of behaviour that inheritance might imply maybe only a creature with that ancient inheritance of savagery would think the way he in his mind had accused the minds of thinking maybe the humanswho could not claim quite such a purity of predatoriness in their past as chelgrians but who had certainly behaved savagely enough towards those of their own species and others since they began to become civilisedwould also think that way but their machines didnt perhaps that was even why they had handed over so much of the running of their civilisation to the machines in the first place they didnt trust themselves with the colossal powers and energies their science and technology had provided them with which might be comforting but for one fact that many people found worrying andhe suspectedthe culture found embarrassing most civilisations that had acquired the means to build genuine artificial intelligences duly built them and most of those designed or shaped the consciousness of the ais to a greater or lesser extent obviously if you were constructing a sentience that was or could easily become much greater than your own it would not be in your interest to create a being which loathed you and might be likely to set about dreaming up ways to exterminate you so ais especially at first tended to reflect the civilisational demeanour of their source species even when they underwent their own form of evolution and began to design their successorswith or without the help and sometimes the knowledge of their creatorsthere was usually still a detectable flavour of the intellectual character and the basic morality of that precursor species present in the resulting consciousness that flavour might gradually disappear over subsequent generations of ais but it would usually be replaced by another adopted and adapted from elsewhere or just mutate beyond recognition rather than disappear altogether what various involveds including the culture had also tried to do often out of sheer curiosity once ai had become a settled and even routine technology was to devise a consciousness with no flavour one with no metalogical baggage whatsoever what had become known as a perfect ai it turned out that creating such intelligences was not particularly challenging once you could build ais in the first place the difficulties only arose when such machines became sufficiently empowered to do whatever they wanted to do they didnt go berserk and try to kill all about them and they didnt relapse into some blissedout state of machine solipsism what they did do at the first available opportunity was sublime leaving the material universe altogether and joining the many beings communities and entire civilisations which had gone that way before it was certainly a rule and appeared to be a law that perfect ais always sublime most other civilisations thought this perplexing or claimed to find it only natural or dismissed it as mildly interesting and sufficient to prove that there was little point in wasting time and resources creating such flawless but useless sentience the culture more or less alone seemed to find the phenomenon almost a personal insult if you could designate an entire civilisation as a person so a trace of some sort of bias some element of moral or other partiality must be present in the cultures minds why should that trace not be what would in a human or a chelgrian be a perfectly natural predisposition towards boredom caused by the sheer grinding relentlessness of their celebrated altruism and a weakness for the occasional misdemeanour a dark wild weed of spite in the endless soughing golden fields of their charity the thought did not disturb him which itself seemed odd some part of him some part that was hidden dormant even found the idea if not pleasant at least satisfactory even useful he increasingly had the feeling that there was more to discover about the mission he had undertaken and that it was important and that he would be all the more determined to do whatever it was that had to be done he knew that he would know more about it later remember more later because he was remembering more now all the time and how are we today quil colonel jarra dimirj lowered himself into the seat by quilans bed the colonel had lost his midlimb and one arm in a flyer crash on the very last day of the war these were regrowing some of the casualties in the hospital seemed unconcerned about wandering around with developing limbs exposed and some often the more grizzled and proudly scarred ones even made a joke of the fact that they had what looked exactly like a childs arm or midlimb or leg attached to themselves colonel dimirj preferred to keep his rematuring limbs covered up whichto the extent that he really cared about anythingquilan found more tasteful the colonel seemed to have made it his duty to talk to all the patients in the hospital on a rota obviously it was his turn he looked different today quilan thought he seemed energised perhaps he was due to go home soon or had been promoted im fine jarra uhhuh hows your new self coming along anyway they seem happy enough apparently im making satisfactory progress they were in the military hospital at lapendal on chel quilan was still confined to bed though the bed itself was wheeled powered and selfcontained and could had he wanted have taken him throughout most of the hospital and a fair part of the grounds quilan thought this sounded like a formula for chaos but allegedly the medical staff actually encouraged their charges to wander it didnt matter nothing mattered quilan hadnt used the beds mobility at all he left it where it was just to the side of the tall window which he was told looked out across the gardens and the lake to the forests on the far shore he hadnt looked out of the window he hadnt read anything except for the screen when they tested his eyesight he hadnt watched anything except for the comings and goings of the medical staff patients and visitors in the corridor outside sometimes when the door was left closed he only heard the people in the corridor mostly he just stared ahead at the wall on the far side of the room which was white thats good yes the colonel said when do they think youll be out of that bed they think perhaps another five days his injuries had been severe one more day in the halfwrecked truck struggling across the phelen plains on aorme and he would have died as it was he had been delivered to golse city triaged and transferred to an invisible depot ship with only hours to spare the depot vessels hopelessly overstretched medics did their best to stabilise him still he nearly died several more times the loyalist military and his family negotiated his ransom a neutral medical shuttle craft from one of the caring orders took him to a navy hospital ship he was barely alive when he arrived they had to throw away his body from the midriff down necrosis had eaten as far as his midlimb and was busily destroying his internal organs in the end they disposed of those too and amputated his midlimb putting him on a total lifesupport machine until the rest of his body regrew part by part skeleton organs muscles and ligaments skin and fur the process was almost complete though he had recovered more slowly than theyd expected he could not believe that he had come so close to dying so many times and had been so unlucky not to perhaps the thought of seeing worosei of surprising her of seeing the expression on her face that he had daydreamed about in the crippled truck lurching across the plains perhaps that had kept him going he didnt know because all he could remember after the first few days in the truck was in the form of momentary and disconnected sensations pain a smell a flash of light a sudden feeling of nausea an overheard word or phrase so he did not know what his thoughtsassuming hed had any thoughtshad been during that fevered scrambled time but it seemed to him perfectly possible and even likely that only those daydreams of worosei had sustained him and made exactly the difference between his death and his survival how cruel that thought was to have been so close to a death he would now happily welcome but prevented from embracing it by the misguided belief that he could ever see her alive again he had only been told that she was dead after hed arrived here in lapendal hed been asking about her since he woke up from the first major operation on the navy hospital ship when they had reduced him to his head and upper trunk he had brushed aside the doctors solemn careful explanation of how radical they had had to be and how much of his body they had had to sacrifice in order to save his life and he had demanded through his confusion and nausea and pain to know where she was the doctor hadnt known hed said he would find out but then never reappeared in person and nobody else on the staff seemed to be able to find out either a chaplain from a caring order had done his best to determine the whereabouts of the winter storm and worosei but the war was still being waged and discovering the location of a fighting ship or anybody who might be on it was not the sort of information you really expected to be told he wondered who had known then that the ship was missing presumed lost only the navy probably it was likely that not even their own clan had been informed before it became obvious had there been a time when he could have been told of woroseis fate and still have been close enough to death to have stepped easily over that threshold perhaps perhaps not hed finally been told by his brotherinlaw woroseis twin the day after the clan had been told the ship was lost presumed destroyed it and its single escort craft had been surprised by an invisible fleet a few days out of aorme the enemy attacked with what sounded like a sort of gravitywave impactor weapon the larger ship was hit first the escort vessel reported that the winter storm suffered total internal destruction almost instantaneously there had been no trace of any souls being saved from it the escort craft tried to escape was pursued and run down its own destruction terminated its last message before it could even give its position a few souls had been saved from it much later they confirmed the details of the engagement worosei had died instantly which quilan supposed he ought to treat as some sort of blessing but the calamity that had overtaken the winter storm had happened so quickly that there had been no time for the people aboard to be saved by their soulkeepers and the weaponry used against them had been specifically configured to destroy the devices themselves it would be half a year before quilan was able to appreciate the irony that in tuning the attack to wreck soulkeeperscale technology the impactor had left the oldtech substrate rescued from aorme almost unharmed woroseis twin had broken down and cried when hed told quilan the news quilan felt a kind of distant concern for his brotherinlaw and made some of the noises of comforting but he did not cry andtrying to look into his own thoughts and feelingsall he could make out was a terrible barrenness an almost complete lack of emotion save for a feeling of puzzlement that he should experience so limited a reaction in the first place he suspected his brotherinlaw felt ashamed of crying in front of quilan or was offended that quilan did not show any sign of sorrow in any event he only ever came for that one visit others of quilans own clan made the journey to see him his father and various other relations he found it difficult to know what to say to them their visits tailed off and he was quietly relieved a grief counsellor was assigned to him but he didnt know what to say to her either and felt he was letting her down not being able to follow her leads into emotional areas she said she thought he needed to explore chaplains were no more comfort when the war ended suddenly unexpectedly just a few days earlier hed thought something like well im glad thats over but he realised almost immediately that he hadnt really felt anything the rest of the patients and the staff of the hospital wept and laughed and grinned and those who could got drunk and partied into the night but he felt oddly dissociated from it all and experienced only resigned annoyance at the noise which kept him awake after hed normally have been safely asleep now his only regular visitor save for the medical staff was the colonel dont suppose youve heard have you colonel dimirj said his eyes seemed to shine and he looked quilan thought like somebody who has just escaped death or won an unlikely bet heard what jarra about the war major about how it started who caused it why it ended so suddenly no i havent heard anything about that didnt you think it stopped hell of a quick i didnt really think about it i suppose i rather lost touch with things while i was unwell i didnt appreciate how quickly the war ended well now we know the reason why the colonel said and slapped the side of quilans bed with his good arm it was those bastard culture people they stopped the war chel had had contact with the culture for the last few hundred years they were known to be widespread throughout the galaxy and technologically superiorthough without the chelgrians apparently unique link with the sublimedand prone to allegedly altruistic interference one of the more forlorn hopes people had cleaved to during the war was that the culture would suddenly step in and gently prise the combatants apart making everything all right again it hadnt happened neither had the chelgrianpuen chels own advanced force amongst the sublimed stepped in which had been an even more pious hope what had happened more prosaically but scarcely less surprisingly was that the two sides in the war the loyalists and the invisibles had suddenly started talking and with surprising speed come to an agreement it was a compromise that didnt really suit anybody but certainly it was better than a war that was threatening to tear chelgrian civilisation apart was colonel dimirj saying that the culture somehow had intervened oh they stopped it if you want to look at it that way the colonel leant close over quilan you want to know how quilan did not particularly care but it would be rude to say so how they told us and the invisibles the truth they showed us who the real enemy was oh so they did intervene after all quilan was still confused who is the real enemy them the culture thats who the colonel said slapping quilans bedside again he sat back nodding his eyes bright they stopped the war by confessing that they started it in the first place thats what they did uhhuh i dont understand the war had begun when the newly enfranchised and empowered invisibles had turned all their recently acquired weaponry on those who had been their betters in the old enforced caste system new militias and equalitarian guard companies had been created as a result of the abortive guards revolt when part of the army had tried to stage a coup after the first equalitarian election the militias and companies and the accelerated trainingup of the onetime lower castes so that they could take command of a majority of the navys ships were part of an attempt to democratise chels armed forces and ensure that through a system of power balances no single branch of the armed forces could take control of the state it was an imperfect and expensive solution and it meant that more people than ever before had access to vastly powerful weaponry but all that had to happen for it to work was that nobody behaved insanely but then muonze the spayed caste president had seemed to do just that and been joined by half of those who had gained most through the reforms how could the culture have had anything to do with that quilan suspected the colonel was determined to tell him it was the culture that got that equalitarian idiot kapyre elected president before muonze dimirj said leaning over quilan again their fingers were on the scales all the time they were promising the parliamentarians the whole fucking galaxy if they voted for kapyre ships habitats technologies the gods only know what so in comes kapyre out goes common sense out goes three thousand years of tradition out goes the system in comes their precious fucking equality and that ballless cretin muonze and do you know what no what they got him elected too same tactics basic bribery oh and what are they saying now quilan shook his head theyre saying they didnt know he was going to go crazy that it never occurred to them that a bit of equalityexactly what these people had been shouting for all this timemight not be enough for them that some of them might just be stupid and vicious enough to want revenge never dawned on them that their shitcaste friends might want to do some scoresettling no that wouldnt make sense that wouldnt be logical the colonel almost spat that last word so when it all blew up in our faces they were still moving their own ships and military people away from us didnt have the forces to intervene couldnt find ninetenths of the people theyd been paying off and whispering to because they were dead like muonze or being held hostage or in hiding the colonel sat back again so our civil war wasnt really one at all it was all these dogooders work frankly i dont know that even this is the truth how do we really know theyre as powerful and advanced as they claim maybe their science is little better than ours and they were getting frightened of us maybe they meant all this to happen quilan was still trying to take all this in after a few moments while the colonel sat there nodding he said well if they had they wouldnt suddenly admit it would they ha maybe it was about to come out anyway so they tried to look as good as they could by confessing but if they told both us and the invisibles in the first place to stop the war same thing maybe we were about to find out on our own they were just making the best of a bad job i mean dimirj said tapping one claw on the side of quilans bed can you believe theyve actually had the gall to quote figures statistics at us telling us that this hardly ever happens that ninetynine per cent or whatever of these interferences go according to plan that weve just been really unlucky and theyre really sorry and theyll help us rebuild the colonel shook his head the nerve of them if we hadnt lost most of our best in that insane fucking war that they caused id be tempted to go to war with them quilan stared at the other male the colonels eyes were wide his head fur was standing straight as he shook his head he found that his own head was shaking too in disbelief is all this true he asked really the colonel stood up as though impelled by his anger you should watch the news quil he looked around as though for something to take his rage out on then took a deep breath wont be the end of this i tell you major not the end not by a long long way he nodded ill see you later quil goodbye for now he slammed the door on his way out and so quilan did switch on a screen for the first time in months and discovered that it was indeed all very much as the colonel had said and that the pace of change in his own society had truly been forced by the culture and it by its own confession had offered what they called help and others might have called bribes to get elected the people it thought ought to be elected and advised and cajoled and wheedled and arguably threatened its way to what it thought was best for the chelgrians it had started to slacken off its involvement and stand down the forces it had secretly brought up to near the chelgrian sphere of influence and colonisation in case things went wrong when without any warning it had all gone quite spectacularly wrong their excuses were as the colonel had laid out though there was also quilan thought a hint that they werent as used to predatorevolved species as they were to others and that had been a factor in their failure to anticipate either the catastrophic behaviour change which started with muonze and cascaded down through the restructured society or the suddenness and ferocity with which it occurred once it had begun he could hardly believe it but he had to he watched a lot of screen he talked to the colonel and to some other patients whod started to come to visit him it was all true all of it one day the day before he was to be allowed out of his bed for the first time he heard a bird singing in the grounds outside his window he clicked at the buttons on the beds control panel and made it turn and raise him up so that he could look out of the window the bird must have flown off but he saw the cloudscattered sky the trees on the far side of the glittering lake the breaking waves on the rocky shore and the windstroked grasses of the hospital grounds once in a market in robunde he had bought her a caged bird because it sang so beautifully he took it to the room they were hiring while she completed her thesis paper on temple acoustics she thanked him graciously walked to the window opened the cages door and shooed the little bird out it flew away over the square singing she watched the bird for a moment until it disappeared then looked round to him with an expression that was at once apologetic defiant and concerned he was leaning against the door frame smiling at her his tears dissolved the view peer group important visitors to masaq were usually transshipped by a giant ceremonial barge of gilded wood glorious flags and generally fabulous aspect encased within an ellipsoid envelope of perfumed air sewn with half a million perfumed candle balloons for the chelgrian emissary quilan hub thought that such flagrant ostentation might strike a discordant overly celebratory note and so instead a plain but stylish personnel module was sent to rendezvous with the exwarship resistance is characterforming the welcoming party consisted of one of the hubs thin silverskinned avatars the drone e h tersono the homomdan kabe ischloear and a human female representative from the orbitals general board called estray lassils who both looked and was old she had long white hair currently gathered into a bun and a very tanned deeply lined face and for all her age she was tall and slim and carried herself very upright she wore a formallooking plain black dress with a single brooch her eyes were bright and kabe formed the impression that a lot of the grooves on her face were smile and laughter lines he immediately liked her andgiven that the general board had been elected by the human and drone population of the orbital and itself had duly chosen her to represent itdecided that so must everybody else hub estray lassils said in an amusedsounding voice your skin looks more matte than usual the orbitals avatar wore white trousers and a tight jacket over its silvery skin which did indeed kabe thought seem less reflective than it usually appeared the creature nodded there are chelgrian source tribes which once had superstitious beliefs concerning mirrors it said in its incongruously deep voice its wide black eyes blinked estray lassils found herself looking at a pair of tiny images of herself depicted in the avatars eyelids which it had briefly turned fully reflective i thought just to be on the safe side i see and how is everybody on the board ms lassils the drone tersono asked it appeared if anything more reflective than usual its rosy porcelain skin and lacy lumenstone frame looking highly polished the woman shrugged as ever i havent seen them for a couple of months the next meetings she looked thoughtful in ten days time supplied her brooch thank you house she said she nodded at the drone there you are the general board was supposed to represent the inhabitants of the orbital to hub at the highest level it was pretty much an honorary office given that each individual could talk directly to hub whenever they wanted but as that carried even the most thinly theoretical possibility that a mischievous or deranged hub could play every single person on an orbital off against each other to further some unspecified nefarious scheme it was usually thought sensible to have a conventionally elected and delegated setup as well it also meant that visitors from more autocratic or layered societies were provided with somebody they could identify as an official representative of the whole population the main reason that kabe decided he liked estray lassils was that despite being there in this arguably quite consequential ceremonial roleshe did represent nearly fifty billion people after allshe had apparently on a whim brought along one of her nieces a sixyearold child called chomba the girl was thin and blonde and sat quietly on the padded edge of the central pool in the personnel modules circular main lounge area as it sped out to meet the still decelerating resistance is characterforming she wore a pair of deep purple shorts and a loose jacket of vivid yellow her feet were dangling in the water where long red fish swam amongst artfully arranged rocks and beds of gravel they eyed the childs waggling toes with leery curiosity and were gradually approaching the others stoodor in tersonos case floatedin a group in front of the lounges forward screen section the screen extended right round the circular wall of the lounge so that when it was all activated it looked as if you were riding through space standing on one large disc with another suspended over your head the ceiling could act as a screen too as could the floor though some people found the full effect unsettling the tallest deepest part of the screen faced directly forwards and it was there that kabe glanced now and again but all it showed was the star field with a slowly flashing red ring showing the direction the ship was approaching from two broad bands of masaq orbital traversed the screen from floor to ceiling and there was a big storm system of whorled clouds visible on one mostly oceanic plate but kabe was more distracted by the sinuously swimming fish and the human child it was one of the effects of living in a society where people commonly lived for four centuries and on average bore just over one child each that there were very few of their young around andas these children tended to stick together in their own peer groups rather than be found distributed throughout the societythere seemed to be even fewer than there really were it was more or less accepted in some quarters that the cultures whole civilisational demeanour resulted from the fact that every single human in the society had been thoroughly comprehensively and imaginatively spoiled as a child by virtually everyone around them its all right the child said to kabe when she noticed him looking at her she nodded at the slowly swimming fish they dont bite are you sure kabe asked squatting trefoil to bring his head closer to the childs she watched this manoeuvre with what looked like wideeyed fascination but seemed to think the better of commenting yes she said they dont eat meat but you have such very tastylooking little toes kabe said meaning to be funny but instantly worrying that he might frighten her she frowned briefly then hugged herself and snorted with laughter you dont eat people do you not unless im terribly hungry kabe told her gravely and then silently cursed himself again he was starting to recall why hed never been very good with children of his own species she looked uncertain about this thenafter one of those vacant expressions you got used to when people were consulting a neural lace or other implanted deviceshe smiled youre vegetarians homomdans i just checked oh he said surprised do you have a neural implant hed understood that children didnt usually possess them as a rule they had toys or avatar companions who fulfilled that sort of role being fitted with your first implant was about as close as some bits of the culture got to a formal adult initiation rite another tradition was to move smoothly from a cuddly talking toy via other gradually less childish devices to a tasteful little pen terminal brooch or jewel stud yes i do have a lace she said proudly i asked she pestered estray lassils said coming to stand by the poolside the girl nodded well beyond the established limit that any normal and reasonable child would have given up at or before she said in gruff tones that were probably meant to impersonate a mans voice chomba is seeking to redefine the term precocious estray lassils told kabe ruffling the childs short blonde curls with considerable success so far the girl ducked away under estrays hand tutting her feet splashed in the water driving the circling fish further away i hope you said hello properly to ambassador kabe ischloear estray told the child you were uncharacteristically shy when i introduced you earlier the girl sighed theatrically and stood up in the water putting out one tiny hand and taking the massive slab of hand that kabe offered she bowed ar kabe ischloear im masaq sintriersa chomba lassils dam palacope how do you do i do well kabe said inclining his head how do you do chomba as she pleases basically the older female said chomba rolled her eyes unless im mistaken kabe said to the child your precocity hasnt extended to nominating a middle name yet the girl smiled with what was probably meant to be a sly expression kabe wondered if hed used too many long words she informs us she has estray explained looking at the child through narrowed eyes shes just not telling us what it is yet chomba turned her nose up and looked away smirking then she grinned widely at kabe do you have any children ambassador sadly no are you just here by yourself then yes i am dont you get lonely chomba estray lassils chided gently its all right no i dont get lonely chomba i know too many people to become lonely and i have so much to do what do you do i study i learn and i report what about us yes i set out many years ago to try to understand humans and perhaps therefore people in general he spread his hands slowly and tried to make a smile that quest continues i write articles and essays and pieces of prose and poetry which i send back to my original home seeking where i can and my modest talents allow to explain the culture and its people more fully to my own of course both our societies know everything about the other in terms of raw data but sometimes a degree of interpretation is required for sense to be extracted from such information i seek to provide that personal touch but isnt it funny being surrounded by us just say when this all starts to get too much ambassador estray lassils said apologetically thats quite all right sometimes its funny chomba sometimes baffling sometimes very rewarding but were completely different arent we we have two legs youve got three dont you miss other homomdans only one whos that somebody i once loved unfortunately she did not love me is that why you came here chomba perhaps it is chomba distance and difference can heal at least here surrounded by humans i need never see somebody i might mistake even for an instant for her wow you must have loved her a lot i suppose i must here we are the hubs avatar said it turned to face the rear of the lounge on the curve of screenwall the stubby cylinder of the resistance is characterforming was sliding across the darkness from ahead to astern there were hints of the crafts field complex becoming briefly visible like layers of gauze the module seemed to be slipping through as it closed with the larger vessel the module went astern floating towards the accommodation unit near the front of the exwarship where a rectangle of hull was picked out in small lights there was an almost imperceptible thud as the two craft connected kabe watched the water in the pool it didnt even ripple the avatar walked up to the rear of the lounge with the drone floating just behind its left shoulder the view astern disappeared to show the modules wide rear doors dry your feet kabe heard estray lassils tell her niece why the modules doors jawed open revealing a plantlined vestibule and a tall chelgrian dressed in formal grey religious robes something that looked like a large tray floated at his side carrying two modest bags major quilan the silverskinned avatar said walking forward and bowing i represent masaq hub you are very welcome thank you the chelgrian said kabe smelled something tangy as the atmospheres of the module and the ship mingled the introductions were made the chelgrian seemed polite but reserved kabe thought he spoke marain at least as well as zillerand with the same accentand like ziller really had learned the language rather than chosen to rely on an interpretation device last to be presented was chomba who recited her almost full name to the chelgrian dug into a jacket pocket and presented the male with a small posy of flowers theyre from our garden she explained sorry theyre a bit crushed but they were in my pocket dont worry about that its just dirt do you want to see some fish major we are so very pleased you were able to come the drone tersono said floating smoothly between the chelgrian and the child i know i speak not just for all of us here but for every single person on the orbital of masaq when i say we feel truly honoured that you are visiting us kabe thought this would be major quilans opportunity to mention ziller if he was of a mind to puncture this rather unrealistic image of politeness but the male just smiled chomba was glaring at the drone quilan tilted his head to see past tersonos body and look at her as tersono extending a bluepink field in an arc towards the chelgrians shoulders ushered him forwards the floating platform carrying quilans bags followed him into the module the doors closed and became a screen again now said the drone we are all here to say welcome obviously but also to let you know that we are entirely at your disposal for the duration of your visit however long that may be im not ive got stuff to do ha ha ha ha said the drone well all of us whore grown up at any rate tell me how was your journey satisfactory i hope it was please take a seat they arranged themselves on some couches while the module moved off chomba went back to dip her feet in the pool behind the resistance is characterforming did the ship equivalent of a backflip became a dot and vanished kabe was pondering the differences between quilan and ziller they were the only two chelgrians he had ever met face to face though he had done a deal of studying of the species since tersono had first asked him to help at the recital on the barge soliton he knew the major was younger than the composer and thought he looked leaner and fitter too there was a sleek sheen to his light brown fur and he had a more muscled frame even so he appeared more careworn around his large dark eyes and broad nose perhaps that was not so surprising kabe knew quite a lot about major quilan the chelgrian turned to him do you represent the homomda officially here ar ischloear he asked no major kabe began ar ischloear is here at contacts request tersono said they asked me to help play host to you kabe told the chelgrian i am shamefully weak in the face of such flattery and so accepted immediately even though i have no real diplomatic training to tell the truth i am more of a cross between a journalist a tourist and a student than anything else i hope you dont mind me mentioning this now its just in case i commit some terrible fauxpas of protocol if i do i wouldnt want it to reflect on my hosts kabe nodded to tersono which gave a stiff little inclinatory bow are there many homomdans on masaq quilan asked im the only one kabe said major quilan nodded slowly the task of representing our average citizen falls to me major estray said ar ischloear is not representative however he is very charming she smiled at kabe who realised he had never come up with a translatable gesture to indicate humility i think the woman continued that we probably asked kabe to help play host to prove that were not so awful on masaq that we frighten away all our nonhuman guests certainly mahrai ziller seems to have found your hospitality irresistible quilan said cr ziller continues to grace us with his presence tersono agreed its aura field looked very rosy against the cream of the couch it rested on hub here is being very modest in not immediately extolling the numerous virtues of masaq orbital but let me assure you it is a place of almost innumerable delights masaq great i assume that mahrai ziller does know that i am here quilan said quietly looking from the drone to the avatar the silverskinned creature nodded he has been kept informed of your progress unfortunately he is not here to welcome you personally i wasnt particularly expecting him to be quilan said ar ischloear is one of cr zillers best friends tersono said im sure when the time comes youll all find plenty to talk about i think i can safely claim to be the best homomdan friend he has on masaq agreed kabe i understand your own connection with cr ziller goes further back major estray said to school is that right yes quilan said however we havent met or talked since then we are more onetime friends than old friends how is our absent genius ambassador he asked kabe he is well kabe said still busily writing away missing home the chelgrian asked there was just the suggestion of a smile on his broad face he would claim not to be kabe said though i think in his music over the last few years i have detected a certain plaintive harking back to traditional chelgrian folk themes with hints of eventual resolution implicit in their serial development from the corner of one eye kabe saw tersonos aura field blush with pleasure as he said this though that may mean nothing of course he added the drones field collapsed back to a frosty blue you are a fan i take it ambassador the chelgrian said oh i think we all are tersono said quickly i im not chom said estray the darling child may find the maestros music still beyond her the drone said kabe caught a hint of a blossoming purple field flattening and dissipating in the direction of the girl sitting on the edge of the pool he saw chombas mouth work but suspected tersono had thrown some sort of field wall between her and the rest of the party he could just about hear that she had said something but had no idea what it was chomba herself either hadnt noticed or didnt care she was concentrating on the fish i count myself one of cr zillers most fervent aficionados the drone was saying loudly i have seen ms estray lassils applaud loudly at several of cr zillers concerts and recitals and i know that to this day hub delights in occasionally reminding all of its nearneighbour orbitals that your compatriot chose to make his second home here rather than on any of them we are all positively quivering with anticipation at the prospect of listening to cr zillers latest symphony in a few weeks time i am quite certain it will be splendid quilan nodded he held his hands out well as im sure youve guessed ive been asked to try to persuade mahrai ziller to return to chel he said looking round the others but settling his gaze on kabe i dont imagine that this will be an easy task ar ischloear please call me kabe well kabe what do you think am i right in believing its going to be an uphill struggle kabe thought i cant imagine began tersono that cr ziller would really dream of passing up the chance to meet with the first chelgrian i think that you are absolutely right major quilan kabe told him to set foot please call me quil on masaq for frankly quil theyve given you a stinker of a job all these many many years thats just what i thought all right yes thank you for that you are very welcome huyler sent impersonating the deep voice of the hub avatar i was almost too busy taking stuff in to pass any comments anyway well it wasnt really necessary as it turned out they had been worried that quilans welcome might be overwhelming either accidentally or deliberately his momentary slip when they had first boarded the resistance is characterforming and had spoken aloud in reply to a transmitted thought of huylers had made them wary and so theyd agreed that for the first part of quilans reception at least huyler would stay in the background keeping silent unless he spotted something alarming that he felt he had to draw quilans attention to so huyler anything interesting bit of a menagerie dont you think only one of thems human what about the child well and the child if it really is a child let us not become paranoid huyler let us not become complacent either quil anyway it looks like theyre going for the cuteness angle rather than the topbrass approach there is a sense in which estray lassils is president of the world and the silverskinned avatar is under the direct control of the god which holds the power of life or death over the orbital and everybody on it yes and there is a sense in which the woman is a powerless temporary figurehead and the avatar is just a puppet and the drone and the homomdan the machine claims to be from contact so that may well mean its from special circumstances the big threelegged guy seems genuine so id give him the benefit of the doubt for now they probably think hes a suitable host because hes got more than the number of legs theyre used to hes got three legs weve got three counting the midlimb it could be that simple i suppose anyway were here indeed we are and quite an impressive here it is dont you think its all right i suppose quilan smiled thinly he leant on the deckside rail and looked around the river stretched into the distance the view dropped away to either side masaq great river was a single loop of water stretching unbroken right round the orbital and flowing slowly as a result of nothing more than the huge spinning worlds coriolis effect fed by tributary rivers and mountain streams throughout its length it was depleted by evaporation where it ran through deserts drained by overflow waterfalls and the runoffs into seas swamps and irrigation networks and absorbed into giant lakes vast oceans and entire continentwide river systems and networks of canals only to reappear via great converse estuaries which eventually bundled it into a single gathered current once again it ran its unending course through labyrinths of caverns under raised continents their depths lit sporadically by plunging holes and immense troughs deep as the roots of mountains it traversed the slowly decreasing numbers of yet unformed plate topographies within transparent tunnels which gave out onto landscapes still being moulded and inscribed by the manufactured vulcanologies of orbital terraforming techniques it disappeared under bulkhead ranges in colossal watery mazes slung beneath those hollow ramparts and slippedflooding sometimes for whole seasonsacross entire horizonwide plains before running through winding canyons kilometres deep and thousands long it iced over from one end of a continent to another during the orbitals aphelion or within the local winters produced by a plate groups sun lenses set on disperse its course took in dozens of neatly circumscribed or lushly sprawling cities andwhen it reached plates like osinorsi whose median level was well below the streams steady elevationthe river was carried above the plains savannas deserts or swamps on single or braided massifs towering hundreds or thousands of metres above the surrounding ground hoisted ribbons of land crowned with cloud edged with falls strewn with hanging vegetation and vertical towns punctured by caves and tunnels andas herewith artfully carved and soaring arches that turned the monumental massifs into a more precise image of exactly what they were vast aqueducts on a water course ten million kilometres long the parapet of the massif here just a few kilometres from the cliffs and the plains that marked the beginning of xarawe was a flowerstrewn grassy bank less than ten metres wide from his vantage point here standing on a raised forecastle of the ceremonial barge bariatricist quilan could look down through wisps of cloud to rolling hills and meandering rivers unwinding through misty forests two kilometres below they had asked him whether he wanted to go straight to the house they had provided for him or if he would like to take in part of masaq great river and one of its famous barges where a small reception had been arranged hed said he would be happy to take them up on their kind offer the hub avatar had looked quietly pleased the drone tersono had positively glowed with rosy approval the personnel module had lowered itself gently towards the atmosphere of the orbital the crafts ceiling had also become a screen showing off the soaring arc of the orbitals evening and night farside while the vessel submerged into the slowly warming morning air above osinorsi plate the module had swung out over one end of the vastly elongated s shape of the central massif carrying the river above the plates lower level they rendezvoused with the bariatricist near the border of xarawe at about four hundred metres the barge was nearly twice as long as the river here was wide it was a tall beamy craft tiered with decks and studded with masts some of which held highly decorated sails most of which trailed banners and flags quilan had seen lots of people though the vessel was hardly crowded this isnt all for me is it hed asked the drone tersono as the module approached one of the barges halfdecks stern first well it had said sounding uncertain no why would you prefer to have a private craft no i was just wondering there are various other receptions parties and different events taking place on the barge just now the avatar had told him plus there are several hundred people for whom the vessel is their temporary or permanent home how many people have come to see me about seventy the avatar replied major quilan the drone had said if youve changed your mind no i major might i make a suggestion estray lassils had said please do and so the module had positioned itself so that he could walk straight out onto the barges high forecastle estray lassils had disembarked at the same time and shown him the route to take shed hung back while he found his way across a sort of gantry through a rather riotous party and eventually fetched up on one of the setback decks looking out over the vessels bows there were a few humans there mostly in couples he had remembered a hot hazy day on a much smaller boat on a broad but almost infinitely tinier river thousands of light years away now her touch and smell the weight of her hand on his shoulder the humans had looked at him with curiosity but had left him alone hed gazed out taking in the view the day was bright but cool the great river and the vast stunning world flowed and revolved beneath him taking him with them both the retreat at cadracet after a while he turned away from the view estray lassils emerged from a dance at the noisy partyflushed and breathing heavilyand walked with him towards the section of the barge set aside for his reception youre sure youre quite happy to meet all these people major she asked quite certain thank you well do say the instant you want to get away we wont think you rude i did some research into your order you sound quite ah ascetic and semitrappist im sure wed all understand if you found our gibbering gaggle tiresome wonder just how much they were able to research im sure ill survive good for you im supposed to be an old hand at this sort of thing but even i find it pretty damn tedious sometimes still receptions and parties are pancultural so were told ive never been sure whether to be reassured or appalled by that i suppose both are appropriate depending on ones mood well said son think ill go back to hovering you concentrate on her this ones devious i can feel it major quilan i do hope you appreciate how sorry we are for what happened to your people the woman said looking at her feet then up at him you may all be heartily fed up hearing this by now in which case i can only apologise for that as well but sometimes you feel you just have to say something she glanced away into the hazy depth of the view the war was our fault well make what amends and reparations we can but for what its worthand i realise it may not seem like very muchwe do apologise she made a small gesture with her old lined hands i think all of us feel that we owe you and your people a particular debt she looked down at her feet again for a moment before catching his gaze once more do not hesitate to call upon it thank you i appreciate your sympathy and your offer ive made no secret of my mission her eyes narrowed then she gave a small hesitant smile yes well see what we can do youre not in too great a hurry i hope major not too great he told her she nodded and continued walking in a lighter tone she said i hope you like the house hubs prepared for you major as you say my order is not renowned for its indulgence or its luxury im sure you will have provided me with more than i need i imagine we probably have do let us know if theres anything else you require including less of anything if you know what i mean i take it this house is not next door to mahrai zillers she laughed not even next plate youre two away but im told it has a very nice view and its own subplate access she looked at him through narrowed eyes you know what all this stuff means the terminology i mean he smiled politely i have done my own research ms lassils yes of course well just let us know what sort of terminal or whatever you want to use if youve brought a communicator of your own im sure hub can patch you through or its certainly prepared to put an avatar or some other familiar at your disposal or well its up to you what would you prefer i think one of your standard pen terminals would suffice major i strongly suspect by the time you get to your house therell be one there waiting for you ah ha they were approaching a broad upper deck scattered with wooden furniture partially covered by awnings and dotted with people and it may well be a more welcome sight than this a bunch of people all desperate to talk your ears off remember bail out any time amen everybody turned to face him we must join the fray major there were indeed about seventy people there to meet him they included three from the general boardwhom estray lassils recognised hailed and went into a huddle with as soon as was decentvarious scholars of matters chelgrian or whose speciality description included the word xenomostly professorsand a handful of other nonhumans none of whose species quilan had even heard of who coiled floated balanced or splayed about the deck tables and couches the situation was complicated by various other nonhuman creatures which but for the avatar quilan might easily have mistaken for other sentient aliens but that turned out to be no more than animal pets all this was in addition to a bewildering variety of other humans who had titles that were not titles and job descriptions that had nothing to do with jobs infracultural mimetic transcriptioneer what the hell does that mean no idea assume the worst file under reporter the hubs avatar had introduced all of them aliens humans and drones which really did seem to be treated as full citizens and people in their own right quilan nodded and smiled and nodded or shook hands and made whatever other gesture appeared appropriate i supposed this silverskinned freak is just about the perfect host for these people it knows all of them and knows all of them intimately too foibles likes dislikes everything not what we were told oh yes all it knows is your name and that youre somewhere here within its jurisdiction thats the tale it only knows what you want it to know ha dont you find that just a little hard to believe quilan didnt know how close a watch on all its citizens a culture orbital hub kept it didnt really matter he did know a lot about such avatars though he realised when he thought about it and what huyler had said about their social skills was perfectly true tireless endlessly sympathetic with a flawless memory and with what must seem like a telepathic ability to tell exactly who would get on with who the presence of an avatar was understandably judged indispensable at every social occasion above a certain size with one of these silvery things and an implant people here probably never have to actually remember the name of a single other person i wonder if they ever forget their own quilan talked guardedly to a lot of people and nibbled from the tables loaded with food all of it served on plates and trays which were imagecoded to indicate what was suitable for which species he looked up at one point and realised that they had left the colossal aqueduct and were travelling across a great grassy plain punctuated by what looked like the frameworks of gigantically tall tents dome tree stands ah ha the river had slowed here and broadened to over a kilometre from bank to bank ahead just starting to show above and through the haze another sort of massif was beginning to make itself visible what he had earlier assumed were clouds in the far distance turned out to be the peaks of snowcovered mountains strung around the massifs top deeply corrugated cliffs rose almost straight up bannered with thin white veils that might be waterfalls some of these slender columns stretched all the way down to the base of the cliffs while other still thinner white threads faded and disappeared partway down or vanished into and merged with layered clouds drifting slowly across the great serrated wall of rock aquime massif apparently this little creek of theirs goes round both sides and straight through aquime city in the middle on the shores of the high salt sea is where our friend ziller lives he stared at the great folded sweep of snowsettled cliff and mountain as it materialised out of the haze becoming more real with each beat of his heart in the grey mountains was the monastery of cadracet which belonged to the sheracht order he went there on a retreat once he was released from the hospital becoming a griefling he was taking extended furlough from the army which allowed such compassionate leave at his rank the offer of deenlistment and an honourable discharge plus a modest pension had been left open for him he already had a batch of medals he was given one for being in the army at all one for being a combatant whod held a gun another for being a given who could easily have avoided fighting in the first place another for being wounded with a bar because he had been seriously wounded yet another for having been on a special mission and a last medal which had been decreed when it had been realised that the war had been the cultures responsibility not that of the chelgrian species the soldiers were calling it the notourfault prize he kept the medals in a small box within the trunk in his cell along with the posthumous ones awarded to worosei the monastery sat on a rocky outcrop on the shoulder of a modest peak within a small stand of sigh trees by a tumbling mountain stream it looked across the forested gorge beneath to the crags cliffs snow and ice of the tallest peaks in the range behind it crossing the stream by a modest but ancient stone bridge celebrated in songs and tales three thousand years old passed the road from oquoon to the central plateau momentarily straightening from its series of precipitous hairpins during the war a troupe of invisible servants who had already put to death all their own masters at another monastery further up the road had taken over cadracet and captured the half of the monks who had not fledmostly the older ones they had thrown them over the parapet of the bridge into the rockstrewn stream below the fall was not quite sufficient to kill all the old males and some suffered moaning throughout that day and into the night only dying in the cold before dawn the following morning two days later a unit of loyalist troops had retaken the complex and tortured the invisibles before burning their leaders alive it had been the same story of horror malevolence and escalatory retribution everywhere the war had lasted less than fifty days many warsmost wars even those restricted to one planetbarely properly began in that time because mobilisations had to be carried out forces had to be put in place a war footing had to be established within society and territory had to be attacked captured and consolidated before further attacks could be prepared and the enemy could be closed with wars in space and between planets and habitats of any number could in theory effectively be over in a few minutes or even seconds but commonly took years and sometimes centuries or generations to come to a conclusion depending almost entirely on the level of technology the civilisations involved possessed the caste war had been different it had been a civil war a species and society at war with itself these were notoriously amongst the most terrible conflicts and the initial proximity of the combatants distributed throughout the civilian and military population at virtually every level of institution and facility meant that there was a kind of explosive savagery about the conflict almost the instant that it commenced taking many of the first wave of victims utterly by surprise noble families were knifed in their beds unaware that any real problem existed whole dormitories of servants were gassed behind locked doors unable to believe those theyd devoted their lives to were murdering them passengers or drivers in cars captains of ships pilots of aircraft or space vessels were suddenly assaulted by the person sitting next to them or were themselves the ones who did the attacking cadracet monastery itself had escaped relatively unscarred from the war despite its brief occupation some rooms had been ransacked a few icons and holy books had been burned or desecrated but there had been little structural damage quilans cell was at the back of the buildings third courtyard looking out onto the grooved cobbled roadway to the dank green mountainside and the sudden yellow of the gaunt sigh trees his cell contained a curlpad on the stone floor a small trunk for his personal possessions a stool a plain wooden desk and a washstand there was no form of communication allowed in the cell apart from reading and writing the former had to be conducted with scriptstring frames or books and the latterfor those who like him had no facility with the knotting beading and braiding of scriptstringwas restricted to that possible utilising loose paper and an ink pen talking to anyone else inside the cell was also forbidden and by the strictest interpretation of the laws even a monk who talked to himself or cried out in his sleep ought to confess as much to the monastery superior and accept some extra duty as punishment quilan had terrible dreams as he had had since halfway through his stay in the hospital at lapendal and frequently woke up in a panic in the middle of the night but he was never sure if hed cried out or not he asked monks in neighbouring cells they claimed never to have heard him he believed them on balance talking was allowed before and after meals and during those communal tasks with which it was judged not to interfere quilan talked less than the others in the tiered fields where they grew their foods and on the walks down the mountain paths to gather wood the others didnt seem to mind the exertions made him strong and fit again they tired him out too but not sufficiently to stop him waking each night with the dreams of darkness and lightning pain and death the library was where most studying was done the reader screens there were intelligently censored so that monks could not fritter their time away on vapid entertainments or trivia they allowed religious and reference works and scholarly troves to be accessed but little else that still left many lifetimes worth of material the machines could also act as links to the chelgrianpuen the gonebefore the already sublimed it would however be a while before a newcomer like quilan would be allowed to use them for that purpose his mentor and counsellor was fronipel the oldest monk left alive after the war he had hidden from the invisibles in an old grainstore drum deep in a cellar and had remained there for two days after the loyalist troops detachment had retaken the monastery not knowing that he was now safe too weak to climb back out of the drum he had almost died of dehydration and was only discovered when the troops mounted a thorough search to flush out any remaining invisibles where it showed above his robes the old males pelt was scraggy and tufted with dark patches of thick coarse fur other areas were almost bare showing his creased drylooking grey skin beneath he moved stiffly especially when the weather was damp which was often the case at cadracet his eyes set behind antique glasses looked filmed as though there was some grey smoke within the orbs the old monk wore his decrepitude with no hint of pride or disdain and yet in this age of regrown bodies and replacement organs such decay had to be voluntary even deliberate they talked usually in a small bare cell set aside for the purpose all it contained was a single sshaped curlseat and a small window it was the old monks prerogative to use the first name of those junior to him and so he called quilan tibilo which made him feel like a child again he supposed this was the desired effect he in turn was expected to address fronipel as custodian i feel i feel jealous sometimes custodian does that sound mad or bad jealous of what tibilo her death that she died quilan stared out of the window unable to look into the older males eyes the view from the little window was much the same as from that of his own cell if i could have anything at all i would have her back i think i have accepted that is impossible or very unlikely indeed at the very least but you see there are so few certainties any more this is something else everything is contingent these days everything is provisional thanks to our technology our understanding he looked into the old monks clouded eyes in the old days people died and that was that you might hope to see them in heaven but once they were dead they were dead it was simple it was definite now he shook his head angrily now people die but their soulkeeper can revive them or take them to a heaven we know exists without any need for faith we have clones we have regrown bodiesmost of me is regrown i wake up sometimes and think am i still me i know youre supposed to be your brain your wits your thoughts but i dont believe it is that simple he shook his head then dried his face on the sleeve of his robe you are envious of an earlier time then he was silent for a few moments then said that as well but i am jealous of her if i cant have her back then all im left with is a desire not to have lived not a desire to kill myself but to have through having no choice died if she cant share my life i would share her death and yet i cant and so i feel envy jealousy those are not quite the same things tibilo i know sometimes what i feel is im not sure a feeble yearning for something i dont have sometimes it is what i think people mean when they use the word envy and sometimes it is real raging jealousy i almost hate her for having died without me he shook his head hardly believing what he was hearing himself saying it was as though the words at last expressed to another gave final shape to thoughts he had not wanted to admit to harbouring even to himself he stared through his tears at the old monk i did love her though custodian i did the older male nodded im sure you did tibilo if you didnt you wouldnt still be suffering like this he looked away again i dont even know that any more i say i loved her i think i did i certainly thought i did but did i maybe what im really feeling is guilt at not having loved her i dont know i dont know anything any more the older male scratched at one of his bare patches you know that you are alive tibilo and that she is dead and that you might see her again he stared at the monk without her soulkeeper i dont believe that sir im not sure i even believe i would see her again even if it had been recovered as you pointed out yourself we live in a time when the dead can return tibilo they knew now that there came a time in the development of every civilisationwhich lasted long enoughwhen its inhabitants could record their mindstate effectively taking a reading of the persons personality which could be stored duplicated read transmitted and ultimately installed into any suitably complex and enabled device or organism in a sense it was the most radically reductivist position made real an acknowledgement that mind arose from matter and could be fundamentally and absolutely defined in material terms and as such it did not suit everyone some societies had reached the horizon of such knowledge and been on the brink of the control it implied only to turn away unwilling to lose the benefits of the beliefs such a development threatened other peoples had accepted the exchange and suffered from it losing themselves in ways that seemed sensible even worthy at the time but which finally led to their effective extinction most societies subscribed to the technologies involved and changed to deal with the consequences in places like the culture the consequences were that people could take backups of themselves if they were about to do something dangerous they could create mindstate versions of themselves which could be used to deliver messages or undertake a multiplicity of experiences in a variety of places and in an assortment of physical or virtual forms they could entirely transfer their original personality into a different body or device and they could merge with other individualsbalancing retained individuality against consensual wholenessin devices designed for such metaphysical intimacy amongst the chelgrian people the course of history had diverged from the norm the device which was emplaced in them the soulkeeper was rarely used to revive an individual instead it was used to ensure that the soul the personality of the dying person would be available to be accepted into heaven the majority of chelgrians had long believed like the majority of many intelligent species in a place where the dead went after death there had been a variety of different religions faiths and cults on the planet but the belief system that came to dominate chel and was exported out to the stars when the species achieved space traveleven if by then it was taken as having a symbolic rather than a literal truthwas one which still spoke of a mythical afterlife where the good would be rewarded by an eternity of noble joy and the evil would be condemnedno matter what their caste had been in the mortal worldto servitude forever according to the carefully kept and minutely analysed records of the galaxys more nitpicking elder civilisations the chelgrians had persisted in their religiosity for a significant time after the advent of scientific methodology andin continuing to cleave to the caste systemwere unusual in retaining such a manifestly discriminatory social order so long into postcontact history none of this though prepared any of the observing societies for what happened not long after the chelgrians became able to transcribe their personalities into media other than their own individual brains subliming was an accepted if still somewhat mysterious part of galactic life it meant leaving the normal matterbased life of the universe behind and ascending to a higher state of existence based on pure energy in theory any individualbiological or machinecould sublime given the right technology but the pattern was for whole swathes of a society and species to disappear at the same time and often the entirety of a civilisation went in one go only the culture was known to worry that suchto itunlikely absoluteness implied a degree of coercion there were generally a host of warning signs that a society was about to sublimea degree of societywide ennui the revival of longquiescent religions and other irrational beliefs an interest in the mythology and methodology of subliming itselfand it almost always happened to fairly wellestablished and longlived civilisations to flourish make contact develop expand reach a steady state and then eventually sublime was more or less the equivalent of the stellar main sequence for civilisations though there was an equally honourable and venerable tradition for just quietly keeping on going minding your own business mostly and generally sitting about feeling pleasantly invulnerable and just saturated with knowledge again the culture was something of an exception neither decently subliming out of the way nor claiming its place with the other urbane sophisticates gathered reminiscing round the hearth of galactic wisdom but instead behaving like an idealistic adolescent in any event to sublime was to retire from the normal life of the galaxy the few real rather than imagined exceptions to this rule had consisted of little more than eccentricities some of the sublimed came back and removed their home planet or wrote their names in nebulae or sculpted on some other vast scale or set up curious monuments or left incomprehensible artifacts dotted about space or on planets or returned in some bizarre form for a usually very brief and topologically limited appearance for what one could only imagine was some sort of ritual all this of course suited those who remained behind quite well because the implication was that subliming led to powers and abilities that gave those who had undergone the transformation an almost godlike status if the process had been just another useful technological step along the way for any ambitious society like nanotechnology ai or wormhole creation then everybody would presumably do it as soon as they could instead subliming seemed to be the opposite of useful as the word was normally understood rather than let you play the great galactic game of influence expansion and achievement better than you could before it appeared to take you out of it altogether subliming was not utterly understoodthe only way fully to understand it appeared to be to go ahead and do itand despite various involveds best efforts studying the process it had proved astonishingly frustrating it had been compared to trying to catch yourself falling asleep whereas it was felt that it ought to be as easy as watching somebody else fall asleep but there was a strong and reliable pattern to its likelihood onset development and consequences the chelgrians had partially sublimed about six per cent of their civilisation had quit the material universe within the course of a day they were of all castes they were of all varieties of religious belief from atheists to the devout of diverse cults and they included in their number several of the sentient machines chel had developed but never fully exploited no discernible pattern in the partial subliming event could be determined none of this was especially unusual in itself though for any of them to have gone at all when the chelgrians had only been in space for a few hundred years did seemperverselyimmature in the eyes of some what had been remarkable even alarming was that the sublimed had then maintained links with the majority part of their civilisation which had not moved on the links took the form of dreams manifestations at religious sites and sporting events though people tended not to dwell on this the alteration of supposedly inviolate data deep inside government and clan archives and the manipulation of certain absolute physical constants within laboratories a number of longlost artifacts were recovered a host of careers were ruined when scandals were revealed and several unexpected and even unlikely scientific breakthroughs occurred this was all quite unheard of the best guess that anyone could make was that it was something to do with the caste system itself its practice down the millennia had ingrained in the chelgrians the idea of being part and yet not part of a greater whole the mindset it implied and encouraged had hierarchic and continuant implications which had proved stronger than whatever processes drove the normal course of a subliming event and its aftermath for a few hundred days a lot of involveds started watching the chelgrians very carefully indeed from being a not particularly interesting and arguably slightly barbaric species of middling abilities and average prospects they suddenly acquired a glamour and mystique most civilisations struggled over millennia to develop across the galaxy research programmes into subliming were quietly instituted dragged out of dormancy and reenergised or accelerated as the horrible possibilities sank in the fears of the involveds proved unfounded what the chelgrianpuen the gonebefore did with their still applicable super powers was to build heaven they made matter of fact what had until then required an act of faith to believe in when a chelgrian died their soulkeeper device was the bridge that carried them across to the afterlife there was an inevitable vagueness associated with the whole procedure that involveds throughout the galaxy had become used to when dealing with anything to do with subliming but it had been proved to the satisfaction of even the most sceptical of observers that the personalities of dead chelgrians did survive after death and could be contacted through suitably enabled devices or people those souls described a heaven very similar to that of chelgrian mythology and even talked of entities which might have been the souls of chelgrians dead long before the development of soulkeeper technology though none of these remote ancestor personalities could be contacted by the mortal world directly and the suspicion was that they were constructs of the chelgrianpuen best guesses at what the ancestors might have been like if heaven had really existed from the start there could however be no real doubt that people were saved by their soulkeeper and did indeed enter the heaven fashioned for them by the chelgrianpuen in the image of the paradise envisaged by their ancestors but are the returned dead really the people we knew custodian they appear to be tibilo is that enough just appearing tibilo you might as well ask when we awake whether we are the same person who went to sleep he gave a thin bitter smile i have asked that and what was your answer that sadly yes we are you say sadly because you feel bitter i say sadly because if only we were different people with every wakening then the me that wakes up would not be the one who lost his wife and yet we are different people very slightly with every new day we are different people very slightly with every new eyeblink custodian only in the most trivial sense that time has passed during the moment of that blink we age with every moment but the real increments of our experience are measured in days and nights in sleep and dreams dreams quilan said staring away again yes the dead escape death in heaven and the living escape life in dreams is this something else you have asked yourself it was not uncommon nowadays for people with terrible memories either to have them excised or to retreat into dreams and live from then on in a virtual world from which it was relatively easy to exclude the memories and their effects that had made normal life so unbearable you mean have i considered it yes not seriously that would feel as though i was denying her quilan sighed im sorry custodian you must get bored hearing me say the same things day after day you never say quite the same thing tibilo the old monk gave a small smile because there is change quilan smiled too though more as a polite response what does not change custodian is that the only thing i really wish for with any sincerity or passion now is death it is hard to believe feeling as you do at the moment that there will come a time when life seems good and worthwhile but it will come no custodian i dont think it will because i wouldnt want to be the person who had felt as i do now and then walkedor driftedaway from that feeling until things felt better that is precisely my problem i prefer the idea of death to what i feel just now but i would prefer to feel the way i do now for ever than to feel better because feeling better would mean that i am not the one who loved her any more and i could not bear that he looked at the old monk with tears in his eyes fronipel sat back blinking you must believe that even that can change and it will not mean you love her less quilan felt almost as good at that point as he had since they had told him worosei was dead it was not pleasure but it was a sort of lightness a kind of clarity he felt that he had at last come to some sort of decision or was just about to i cant believe that custodian then what tibilo is your life to be submerged in grief until you die is that what you want tibilo i see no sign of it in you but there can be a form of vanity in grief that is indulged rather than suffered i have seen people who find that grief gives them something they never had before and no matter how terrible and real their loss they choose to hug that awfulness to them rather than push it away i would hate to see you even seem to resemble such emotional masochists quilan nodded he tried to appear calm but a frightful anger had coursed through him as the older male had spoken he knew fronipel meant well and was sincere when he said that he did not think quilan was not such a person but even to be compared to such selfishness such indulgence made him almost shake with fury i would have hoped to have died with honour before such a charge might be levelled against me is that what you wish tibilo to die it has come to seem the best course the more i think about it the better it becomes and suicide we are told leads to utter oblivion the old religion had been ambivalent about taking ones own life it had never been encouraged but different views of its rights and wrongs had been taken over the generations since the advent of a real and provable heaven it had been firmly discouragedfollowing a rash of mass suicidesby the chelgrianpuen who made it clear that those who killed themselves just to get to heaven more quickly would not be allowed in there at all they would not even be held in limbo they would not be saved at all not all suicides would necessarily be treated so severely but the impression was very much that youd better have an unimpeachable reason for showing up at the gates of paradise with your own blood on your hands there would be little honour in that anyway custodian i would rather die usefully in battle preferably there is no great tradition of such martial severity in your family tibilo quilans family had been landowners traders bankers and insurers for a thousand years he was the first son to carry anything more lethal than a ceremonial weapon for generations perhaps its time such a tradition started the war is over tibilo there are always wars they are not always honourable one may die a dishonourable death in an honourable war why should the converse not apply and yet we are here in a monastery not the briefing room of a barracks i came here to think custodian i never did renounce my commission are you determined to return to the army then i believe i am fronipel looked into the younger males eyes for some time finally straightening himself in his side of the curlchair he said you are a major quilan a major who would lead his troops when he wishes only to die might be a dangerous officer indeed i would not want to force my decision on anyone else custodian that is easily said tibilo i know and it is not so easily done but i am not in any hurry to die i am quite prepared to wait until i can be quite certain i am doing the right thing the old monk sat back taking off his glasses and extracting a grubbylooking grey rag from a waistcoat he breathed on the two large lenses in turn and then polished each he inspected them quilan thought they looked no better than when he had started he put them back with some care and then blinked at quilan this is you realise major something of a change quilan nodded it feels more like a like a clarification he said sir the old male nodded slowly dirigible uagen zlepe scholar was preparing an infusion of jhagel leaves when praf suddenly appeared on the window ledge of the small kitchen the simianadapted human and the fifthorder deciderturnedinterpreter had returned to the dirigible behemothaur yoleus without mishap after retrieving the errant glyph stylo and spotting whatever it was they had spotted all that way below them in the airspheres blue blue depths praf had immediately flown off to report to her superior uagen had decided to have a snooze after all the excitement this proved difficult so he forced himself to sleep with some glanded shush on waking after exactly one hour he had smacked his lips and come to the conclusion that some jhagel tea might be in order the circular window of his little kitchen looked out across the sloping forest that was yoleus upper forward surface the window had a series of gauzy curtains he could fasten over it but he usually left those gathered to each side the view had once been wonderful and airy but for the last three years it had been in shadow beneath the looming bulk of muetenive yoleus prospective mate yoleus skin foliage was starting to look shrunken and anaemic in the shade of the other creature uagen sighed and began the process of making the infusion the jhagel leaves were very precious to him he had only brought a few kilos from home he had about a third of that amount left now and hed been rationing himself to one cup every twenty days to eke out his supply he should have brought seeds as well he supposed but somehow hed forgotten making the infusion had become something of a ritual for uagen jhagel tea was supposed to be calming however it had occurred to him that the process of making it was itself quite relaxing perhaps when his supply was entirely gone he ought to go through the motions with some placebo mixturestopping short of actually drinking itto observe what degree of tranquillity might be induced just by the ceremony of preparation frowning with concentration he began to transfer some of the steaming pale green infusion into a warmed cup through a deep container which held twentythree graduated layers of filters variously chilled to between four and twentyfour degrees below then interpreter praf thudded onto his window ledge without warning uagen gave a start some of the hot liquid splashed over his hand ow umm hello praf umm yes ow he put the strainer and the pot down then placed his hand under cold running water the creature hopped through the circular window keeping its leathery wings tightly folded in the small scullery it suddenly seemed very big it looked at the puddle of splashed infusion a time for dropping it observed eh oh yes uagen said he looked at his reddened hand what can i do for you praf the yoleus would talk with you this was unusual what now immediately what face toumm well yes uagen felt just a little frightened he could do with some calming down he pointed at the pot simmering on his little cooker what about my jhagel tea praf looked at it then him its presence is not required are you sure yoleus umm i mean well sufficiently sure do you desire a percentage to be expressed no no no need for that its just this is awfully im not sure that its very uagen zlepe scholar you are not finishing your sentences amnt i well i mean uagen felt himself go gulp do you really think i need to go down there yes oh umm the umm whatever it is couldnt come up here then no and youre sure sufficiently sure that which it is thought that you would be best to experience is in a situationsetting similar to this ah i see uagen was standing a little precariously on what felt like a particularly wobbly bit of marsh in fact he was deep inside the body of the dirigible behemothaur yoleus within a chamber he had only once ever seen before and had rather hoped he might not have to visit again during his stay the place was about the size of a ballroom it was a hemisphere with ribs and curves everywhere even the floor had curves low swells and hollows the walls looked like gigantic folded curtains gathered into a sphincter shape at the summit it was unlit and uagen was having to use his inbuilt ir sense which made everything look grey and grainy and even more frightening the smell was that of a sewer under an abattoir stuck to the wall were dead livingdead and still living things one of themone of the latter category thankfullywas praf underneath praf dwarfing her were the recently attached and now drainedlooking carcasses of two falficores their wings and talons hanging loosely alongside the interpreter was the even bigger body of a raptor scout praf didnt look too bad she appeared perched wings neatly folded feet drawn up the creature hanging by her side whose body was nearly the size of uagens and whose wings were easily fifteen metres from tip to tip looked limp andif not deadnear death its eyes were half closed its huge beaked head was slumped across its chest its wings looked pinned to the incurving wall of the chamber and its legs hung slackly what looked like a root or cable led from the back of its skull and into the wall where the cable entered its head something like blood had leaked out soaking its dark scaly skin the creature trembled suddenly and let out a low moan the raptor scouts report on the fellowcreature below is not sufficient the dirigible behemothaur yoleus said through praf the captured falficores knew less still only that there was a recent rumour of food below your report might be sufficient uagen swallowed umm he stared at the raptor scout it had not been tortured or really mistreated by the locally prevailing standards but whatever had happened to it didnt look very pleasant it had been dispatched to reconnoitre the shape that uagen and praf had seen when theyd gone after the falling glyph stylo the raptor scout had dived into the depths escorted by the rest of its wing it had landed on what was apparently another dirigible behemothaur but one which had been injured or damaged which had possibly lost its way and probably lost its mind it had investigated inside a little then it had rushed as fast as it could back to yoleus who had listened to its report and then concluded that the creature was not articulate enough to explain properly what it had seenthe raptor scout had not even been able to determine the identity of the other behemothaurand so had decided to look directly into its memories by burrowing in with a direct link between its mind and yoleus ownwhatever and wherever that was there was nothing all that unusual about this or even anything cruel the raptor scout was in a sense a part of the dirigible behemothaur and would have had no sense of having had interests or even an existence separate from the vast creature probably it would have been proud that the information it was carrying was of such importance that yoleus wanted to look at it directly nevertheless to uagen it still looked like some poor wretch chained to a wall in a torture chamber after the torturer had extracted what he wanted the creature moaned again umm yes uagen said ah i would be able to make this report umm verbally wouldnt i yes the dirigible behemothaur said through praf uagen felt just a little relief then the interpreter sat back against the wall behind her she blinked a few times and then said hmm what uagen said suddenly conscious of a funny taste in his mouth he was aware that he was fingering the necklace his aunt silder had given him he put his hands down by his sides they were shaking yes yes what there would also be what what he was aware that his voice was more of a yelp now your glyph tablet what the glyph tablet that belongs to you if it might be used for the recording of the impressions you have that would be of use to me ha the tablet yes yes of course yes then you will go and are so agreed oh umm well yes i suppose that is i release the fifthorder decider of the foliage gleaner troupe which is now interpreter praf there was a sound like a noisy kiss and praf hinged away from her perch on the wall falling untidily for the first couple of metres before collecting herself in an undignified clatter of wings and looking wildly about as though she had just woken up praf hovered in front of uagens face wings beating the smell of something rotten against him she cleared her throat seven wings of raptor scouts will accompany you she told him they will take a deeplight signalling pod with them they await what now soon equates to good later to worse uagen zlepe scholar therefore immediacy umm they fell en masse hurtling mobhanded into the dark blue abyss of air uagen shivered and looked around one of the suns had gone out the other had moved they were not real suns of course they were more like immense spotlights eyeballs the size of small moons whose annihilatory furnaces switched on and off according to a pattern dictated by their slow dance round the vast world sometimes they glowed just sufficiently to stop themselves from falling further into oskendaris gravity faint well sometimes they blazed bathing the airspheres nearest volumes in radiance while the pressure of that released light kicked them further up and out so that they would have escaped the airspheres pull altogether if they hadnt then swivelled and sent out a pulse of light that sent them falling back in again the sunmoons were worth lifetimes of study all on their own uagen knew though probably they were more the province of somebody interested in physics rather than someone like himself he turned up the heating in his suityoleus had been persuaded to allow him time to return to his quarters and put on something more in keeping with the role of explorerbut then he started to sweat he wasnt really cold he decided just afraid he turned the heating down again the three wings of raptor scouts fell all around him their long dark bodies streamlined darts slowly twisting as they aimed their armlong beaks plummeting down through the thick blue air uagens ankle motors hummed gently keeping his pace up to that of the sleekly profiled raptor scouts praf clung to his back her body laid along his from nape to rump her wings wrapped round his chest she would have held them up if shed dived separately her embrace was tight and uagen had already felt himself becoming breathless and had to ask her to slacken her grip to let him breathe he had half hoped the other dirigible behemothaur might have disappeared but it was suddenly there an alarmingly extensive area of darker blue deep beneath them uagen felt his heart sink and wondered if the creature clamped to his back could feel his fear he tried to decide if he was really ashamed of being afraid and decided that he was not fear was there for a purpose it was wired into any creature that had not completely turned its back on its evolutionary inheritance and so remade itself in whatever image it coveted the more sophisticated you became the less you relied on fear and pain to keep you alive you could afford to ignore them because you had other means of coping with the consequences if things went badly he wondered how imagination fitted in he had a feeling it ought to any organism could learn to avoid experiences of a sort that had earlier resulted in damage and therefore pain but with real intelligence came a more sophisticated form of anticipation of damage to oneself which preempted the injury there should be a set of glyphs in this he decided he would work on them later assuming he survived he looked up yoleus was invisible its vast bulk lost in the scattering haze of air above all he could see up there was the blob that was the infrared signalling pod and its attendant raptor scouts falling after the main force as fast as possible around him tearing down towards the vast blue shadow beneath two hundred sleek blueblack shapes rustled and whistled in the thick warm air it seemed like only moments later that those shapes were all suddenly expanding stretching out and grabbing at the atmosphere with their great darkribbed wings praf kicked away from his back and fell separately wings half extended uagen could see detail on the upper surface of the dirigible behemothaur beneath scars and gouges on the forests of the creatures back and tattered fins a hundred metres tall trailing strips of gauzy material for kilometres behind in the creatures languid slipstream some fins were missing altogether and towards the rear of the enormous shape a huge chunk appeared to have been scooped away as though bitten out by something even larger looks pretty chewed up doesnt it uagen shouted to praf she turned her head slightly towards him tacking slowly towards him as she said the yoleus believes that such damage is unprecedented in living memory uagen just nodded then recalled that dirigible behemothaurs lived for tens of millions of years at least that was a fairly long time to be without precedent he looked down the scarred curved back of the unnamed behemothaur rose up to meet them there was a lot of activity there now uagen saw the dying creature had been discovered by more than just one diving humansimian and a few falficores it had been like a horrific cross between cancer and civil war the entire ecosystem that was the dirigible behemothaur sansemin was tearing itself apart now others were joining in they had discovered its name through description praf had flown round it recording any distinguishing marks not altered or obliterated by the destruction taking place then landed on the little hummock of naked envelope skin high on its back where the raptor scout troupe had established its primary base the interpreter had communicated its findings via the giant seedshaped signalling pod in the centre of the hastily established compound the pods infrared light had found yoleus tens of kilometres above and then received the reply a little later according to the library memories yoleus shared with its kind the dying behemothaur was called sansemin sansemin had always been an outsider a renegade almost an outlaw it had disappeared from polite society thousands of years ago and was presumed to be haunting the less hospitable and less fashionable volumes of the airsphere perhaps alone possibly in the company of the small number of other misfit behemothaurs known to exist there had been a few hazy unconfirmed sightings of the creature over the first several centuries of its selfimposed exile but nothing for the last few now it had been rediscovered but it was at war with itself and about to die flocks of falficores surrounded the giant in squabbling clouds feeding off its foliage and outer skins smerines and phuelerids the largest winged creatures in the airsphere divided their time between the living flesh of the behemothaur and the swarming clusters of falficores driven to recklessness by the sheer glut of food on offer the sleekly bulbous bodies of two ogrine disseisorsa rare form of lithe behemothaur only a hundred metres in length and the worlds largest predatorswam through the air in tremendous sinuous flicks dipping to tear pieces from the body of sansemin and snapping up handfuls of careless falficores and even the occasional smerine and phuelerid tendonstrutted fragments of behemothaur skin fell into the blueness below like dark sails torn from cyclonestruck clippers puffs of gas made brief dispersing vapour clouds in the air as the colossal creatures outer ballonets and gas sacs were ruptured the torn bodies of falficores smerines and phuelerids tumbled in bloody cartwheeling spirals into the abyss their screams frighteningly close in the compacted depth of air yet nearly drowned out in the vast noise of frenzied feeding going on all about the raptor scouts cloud attackers envelopian defenders and other creatures which were part of sansemins dispersed self and that would normally easily have kept such aggressors at bay were nowhere to be seen the remains of a few had been discovered where they had fallen and been picked clean by others the most telling pair of skeletons had been found with their jaws clamped around the others neck uagen zlepe stood on the seemingly solid surface of the dirigible behemothaurs vast back looking out over a landscape of tattered withered skin foliage being torn apart by falficore flocks he stood beside the sevenmetrewide bulk of the signalling pod it was anchored to the envelopes surface by a dozen small hooks made from falficore talons and tended to by a handful of deciders nearly identical to praf spread in a circle about them were a hundred of yoleus raptor scouts forming a living defensive barrier which was patrolled from above by another fifty or sixty of the creatures flying slow circuits so far they had repelled all attacks and had not lost any of their number even one of the ogrine disseisors obviously intrigued by the activity round the signalling pod had turned tail when confronted by twenty of the raptor scouts in attack formation and returned instead to the easier pickings on offer all over the dying behemothaurs surface two hundred metres away across sansemins back near the knobbled ridge of a longeron spine a smerine swooped down scattering the smaller creatures in a blizzard of piercing cries it thudded into a giant wound in the behemothaurs skin uagen saw the flesh around the tear ripple under impact the predator flapped its twentymetre wings and dipped its long head flaying the exposed tissue a gas sac severed from its supporting structure wobbled out of the spreading wound and into the air it began to climb the smerine looked up but let it go the falficore flock above attacked it screeching until it punctured and jetted slowly off deflating in a long exhaling scream of gas and scattering enraged falficores behind it there was a thud at his feet uagen jumped oh praf he said as the interpreter stowed its wings it had gone with a dozen of the raptor scouts to investigate the interior of the behemothaur find anything he asked praf watched the distant gas sac as it finally fell deflated into the foliage forest near sansemins upper forefins we have found something come and look inside uagen asked nervously yes is it safe umm in there praf looked up at him umm i mean umm the central gas bladders the hydrogen core i thought there was a possibility those might that is it might umm an explosion is possible praf said in a matteroffact manner this would be of a catastrophic nature uagen felt himself gulp catastrophic yes the dirigible behemothaur sansemin would be destroyed yes and umm us too too we too would be destroyed yes well then this outcome will grow more likely with delay therefore delay is not wise expedition is advisable praf shuffled its feet extremely advisable praf uagen said do we have to do this the creature rocked back on its heel talons and squinted up at him of course it is duty to the yoleus and if i say no what do you mean what if i refuse to go inside and look at whatever it is youve found then our investigations will take longer uagen stared at the interpreter longer of course what have you found we do not know then it is a creature a creature many creatures all dead but one of an unknown type what sort of unknown type that is what is unknown well what does it look like it looks a little like you the creature looked like an alien childs doll thrown against a barbed wall and left hanging there it was long with a tail that was half its body length the head was broad furred andhe thoughtstriped though in the darkness using only his ir sense he couldnt tell what colours its pelt might be the creatures big forwardfacing eyes were closed it had a thick neck broad shoulders two arms about the size of a large humans but with very wide heavy hands which looked more like paws only a dirigible behemothaur or one of its acolytes would have imagined it looked much like uagen zlepe it was one of twenty similar forms strung out along one wall of the chamber all the others were dead and rotting below the creatures arms supported by a second still wider set of shoulders rested what at first appeared to be a giant flap of furred skin looking closer uagen realised this was a limb a dark pad of toughened skin extended across its end in an shape and stubby hints of toes or claws dotted the perimeter of the pad below the torso two powerfullooking legs hung from a broad set of hips a furred mound probably concealed genitals of some sort the tail was striped one of the rootcables uagen had seen attached to the raptor scout in the similar chamber in yoleus led from the back of the creatures head and into the ribbed wall behind the smell in here was even worse than it had been in yoleus the journey had been horrific dirigible behemothaurs were riddled with fissures chambers cavities and tunnels disposed so that their collection of tributary fauna could carry out their various tasks many of these were large enough to admit raptor scouts and it was down one of these that they had journeyed from an entrance behind the behemothaurs rear dorsal fin complex the effects of the creatures own attendant entities turning against it were everywhere great gouges and tears had been slashed through the tunnels walls making the curved floor slick with liquid in some places and cloyingly sticky in others flaps of decaying tissue hung from the ceiling like obscene banners and rents in the floor could swallow a leg a wing or evencertainly in uagens casea whole body here and there smaller creatures still feasted upon the body of the being they had served other corpses littered the floor of the winding tunnel and where the two raptor scouts accompanying praf and uagen zlepe down into the body of the behemothaur could do so without delaying their progress they swiped out at the parasites and tore them to pieces leaving them twitching on the floor behind finally they had arrived at the chamber where the behemothaur sought knowledge from its selfkin and guests a great tremor ran through the cavern just as they entered making the walls shake and dislodging some of the halfrotted bodies two of the specialist raptor scouts had clawed their way up the wall beside the creature which still appeared to be alive they were intent on an examination of its head where the cable root disappeared into it one of the raptor scouts held something small and glittering do you know the nature of this being praf asked uagen stared up at the creature no he said well not properly it looks vaguely familiar i might have seen it on screen or something but i dont know what it is it is not of your sort well of course not look at it its bigger its got enormous eyes and a totally different sort of head i mean umm im not of my sort not originally if you know what i mean he said turning to praf who blinked up at him but the main thing umm difference is that middle bit that looks like a sort of extra leg and foot well like two that have grown together do you see those ah ridges ill bet those are the bones of what used to be two separate legs in its forebears before it evolved into a single limb it is not known to you hmm umm sorry no do you think if it can be made to speak it will be able to be understood in its talking by you what it is not dead it is linked to the mind of the sansemin but the mind of the sansemin is dead but the creature is not dead if we are able to sever its link to the mind of the sansemin which is dead then it might be able to speak if this were to happen would you be able to understand that which it says oh umm i doubt it that is unfortunate praf was silent for a moment and yet this means that we would be wise to sever its link soon rather than later and that is good because then we would be less likely to die when the sansemin suffers its catastrophic explosion what uagen yelped the interpreter started to repeat itself talking slightly slower but he waved both hands at it never mind sever its links now lets get out quick i mean quickly this will be done praf said it babbled and clicked at the two raptor scouts clinging to the wall by the side of the alien creature they turned and jabbered back there seemed to be a disagreement another tremor shook the whole chamber the floor under uagens feet quaked he put his arms out to each side to balance himself and felt his mouth go dry there was a draught then a distinct breeze of warm air scented with a smell he suspected was methane it took most of the smell of rotting flesh away but he felt sickened with terror his skin had gone cold and clammy please lets go he whispered the raptor scouts on either side of the hanging creature did something behind its head it slumped forward and down then the thing trembled as though shivering and brought its head back up it worked its jaw then opened its eyes they were very large and black it looked around at the raptor scouts on either side at the rest of the chamber then at praf then at uagen zlepe it made a sound or set of sounds but it was no language that uagen had ever heard before this is not a speechform which is known to you the interpreter asked on the barbed wall of living dying tissue the alien creatures eyes went suddenly wide no uagen said doesnt mean a thing to me im afraid umm look can we please please get the hell out of here you you there gasped the creature on the wall in accented but recognisable marain it was staring at uagen who was staring right back help me it wheezed whwhwhat uagen heard himself say please the creature said culture agent it swallowed with obvious pain and croaked plot assassin need get word please help urgent very urgent uagen tried to speak but could not there was a smell of something burning in the wind blowing through the chamber praf adjusted her footing as another huge tremor shook the chamber and made the floor swell she looked from uagen to the creature on the wall and back again this speechform is known to you she asked uagen nodded the memory of running the figure seemed to coalesce out of nothing out of the air anyone or anything watching would have needed more than natural senses to have noticed the slow fall of dust spread out over an hour of time and a radial kilometre of the grasslands that anything out of the ordinary was happening would only have become obvious a little later when an odd sort of wind seemed to stir itself out of the gentle breeze disturbing the grass on the broad plain and producing what appeared to be a slowly revolving dust devil whirling quietly in the air and gradually shrinking and tightening and darkening and speeding up until suddenly it disappeared and where it had been there stood what looked like a tall and graceful chelgrian female dressed in the country day clothes of the given caste the first thing she did when she felt she was complete was to crouch down and dig into the earth beneath the grass with her fingers her claws slid out spearing the ground she ripped out a handful of the soil and grass she held the handful of earth and vegetation up to her broad dark nose and sniffed slowly she was waiting she had nothing better to do for the moment and so she thought that she would take a good hard look and a good long sniff at the ground she stood on there were so many different tones and flavours to the smell the grass held a spectrum of odours of its own all of them fresher and brighter than the heavy notes of the soil giving it a scent of the air and the winds rather than the ground she raised her head letting the breeze ruffle her head fur she took in the view it was almost perfectly simple anklehigh grass stretching in every direction there was a hint of cloud to the far northeast where the xhesseli mountains were she had seen them on the way down above and everywhere else in the sky just aquamarine clarity no sign of contrails that was good the sun was halfway up the southern sky to the north both moons shone full face and a single day star twinkled near the eastern horizon she was aware of some part of her mind using the information in the sky to calculate her position the time and the precise compass direction she was facing in the resulting knowledge made its existence felt but did not force itself upon her it was like the presence of somebody in an anteroom signalled by a polite knock on the door she called up another layer of data and was presented with an overlay across the sky suddenly she could see a grid superimposed across the heavens and drawn on it were the paths of numerous satellites and a few suborbital transport craft with identities attached and a further stratum of more finely detailed information on each implied the satellites whose images were slowly flashing were the ones which had been interfered with then she saw a couple of dots on the eastern horizon and turned to them her eyes adjusting inside her something exactly like a heart thumped hard and fast for a single beat before she could control it again some of the earth fell from the handful she held the dots were birds a few hundred metres away she relaxed the birds rose into the air facing each other and flapping wildly they were half displaying half fighting there would be a female sitting crouched in the grass nearby watching the two males the scientific and common names of the species their range feeding and mating habits and a variety of other information about the creatures seemed to hover at the back of her mind the two birds fell back into the grass again their calls came thinly through the air she had never heard their voices before but knew that they sounded as they ought to of course it was still possible that the birds were not as innocent and unthreatening as they appeared they might be real but altered animals or not biological at all in either case they might be part of a surveillance system well there was nothing to be done she would go on waiting a little longer she returned her attention to the clump of turf she held bringing it up to her eyes soaking up the sight there were many different types of grasses and tiny plants in the handful most of them a pale yellowgreen colour she saw seeds roots tendrils petals husks blades and stems the relevant information describing each different species duly made its existence known at the back of her mind she was by now also aware that the data presenting itself had already been evaluated by some other part of her mind if anything had looked wrong or seemed out of placeif for example those birds had moved in a manner so as to imply that they were heavier than they were supposed to bethen her attention would have been drawn to the anomaly so far everything seemed to be reassuringly normal the data was a distant comforting awareness patiently lingering on the outskirts of her perception a few tiny animals moved within the mass of soil and on the surfaces of the vegetation she knew their names and details too she watched a pale threadthin worm waving about blindly in the humus she put the divot back pressing the clump of soil into the hole it had left and patting it down she dusted off her hands while she looked around once more still no sign of anything amiss the birds in the distance rose into the air again then descended a warm wave of air unfolded itself across the surface of the grass and flowed around her stroking her fur where it was not covered by her plain hide waistcoat and pants she picked up her cloak and fastened it round her shoulders it became part of her just like the waistcoat and pants the wind came from the west it was freshening taking the cries of the displaying birds away so that when they rose in the distance for a third time they seemed to do so quite silently there was just a hint a faint tang of salt in the wind it was sufficient to decide her enough of waiting she looped the cloaks tailloop over her long tawny tail then turned her face to the wind she wished that she had chosen a name if she had she would have spoken it now voiced it to the clear air like some declaration of intent but she did not have a name because she was not what she appeared to be not a chelgrian female not a chelgrian not even a biological creature at all i am a culture terror weapon she thought designed to horrify warn and instruct at the highest level a name would have been a lie she checked her orders just to be sure it was true she had complete discretion in the manner a lack of instruction could be interpreted as a quite specific instruction she could do anything she was off the leash very well she leant back on her rear legs and brought her arms up to slip them into the glove pouches at the top of her waistcoat thenwith an initial bound very like a pounceshe set off settling quickly into an easylooking lope that carried her away across the grass in a series of long smoothly sinuous bounds that stretched and compressed her powerful back and brought her heavily muscled rear legs and broad midlimb almost together then pushed them flying apart with every surging leap she felt the joy of the run and understood the ancient rightness of the wind in her face and fur to run to chase to hunt to bring down and kill the cloak rippled across her back in the slipstream her tail flicked from side to side pylon country id almost forgotten this place existed myself kabe looked at the silverskinned avatar really nothing much has happened here for two hundred years apart from gentle decay the creature explained couldnt that be said of the whole orbital ziller asked in what was probably meant to be a falsely innocent tone the avatar pretended to look hurt the antique cable car creaked around them as it swung past a tall pylon it rumbled and squeaked through a system of overhead points hanging from a ring round the masts top and then tacked away on a new heading towards a distant pylon on a small hill across the fractured plain do you ever forget anything hub kabe asked the avatar only if i choose to it said in its hollow voice it was half sitting half lying on one of the plump red polished hide couches its booted feet up on the brass rail which separated the rear passenger compartment from the pilots control deck where ziller was standing watching the various instruments adjusting levers and fiddling with a variety of ropes that emerged from a slot in the cars floor and were tied off on cleats mounted on the forward bulkhead and do you ever choose to kabe asked he was squatting trefoil on the floor there was just enough headroom for him in the ornate cabin like that the car was designed to carry about a dozen passengers and two crew the avatar frowned not that i can recall kabe laughed so you might choose to forget something then choose to forget forgetting it ah but then id have to forget forgetting the original forgetting i suppose you would is this conversation going anywhere ziller shouted over his shoulder no said the avatar its like this journey drifting we are not drifting ziller said we are exploring you might be the avatar said im not i can see exactly where we are from hub central what do you want to see i can provide detailed maps if youd like the spirit of adventure and exploration is obviously alien to your computer soul ziller told it the avatar reached out and flicked a speck of dust from the top of one boot do i have a soul is that meant to be a compliment of course you dont have a soul ziller said pulling hard on one rope and tying it off the cable car picked up speed swaying gently as it crossed the scrubstrewn plain kabe watched the cars shadow as it undulated over the dustily fawn and red ground below the dark outline slid away and lengthened as they crossed a dry gravelbraided river bed a gust of wind raised eddies of dust on the ground below then hit the car and tipped it fractionally making the glass windows rattle in their wooden frames thats good the avatar said because i didnt think i had one and if i did i must have forgotten ah ha said kabe ziller made an exasperated sound they were in a windpowered cable car crossing the epsizyr breaks a huge area of semiwilderness on canthropa plate nearly a quarterway spinwards round the orbital from ziller and kabes homes on xarawe and osinorsi the breaks were a vast driedup river system a thousand kilometres broad and three times that in length from space they looked thrown across the dun plains of canthropa like a million twisted lengths of grey and ochre string the breaks rarely carried much water there was the occasional rain shower over the plains but the region remained semiarid every hundred or so years a really big storm managed to cross the canthrops the mountain range between the plains and sard ocean which occupied the whole of the plate to spinward and only then did the river system live up to its name transporting the fallen rain from the mountains to the epsizyr pans which filled and shimmered for a few days and supported a brief riot of plant and animal life before drying to salty mud flats again the breaks had been designed to be that way masaq had been modelled and planned as carefully as any other orbital but it had always been envisaged as a big world and a varied one it contained just about every form of geography possible given its apparent gravity and humanfriendly atmosphere and most of that geography was humanfriendly too but it was rare for any selfrespecting orbital hub to be happy without at least some wilderness around humans tended to complain after a while too filling every available bit of each and every plate with gently rolling hills and babbling brooks or even spectacular mountains and broad oceans was not seen as producing a properly balanced orbital environment there ought to be wastes there should be badlands the epsizyr breaks were just one of hundreds of different types of wasteland scattered about masaq they were dry and windy and barren but otherwise one of the more hospitable badlands people had always come to the breaks they came to walk to camp out under the stars and the farside light and feel themselves apart from things for a while and though a few people had tried living there almost nobody had stayed for more than a few hundred days kabe was looking out over zillers head through the front windscreen of the car from the tall pylon they were heading for cables stretched away in six different directions along lines of masts disappearing into the distance some in straight lines others in lazy curves looking out over the fractured landscape all around kabe could see the pylonseach between twenty and sixty metres high and shaped like an inverted leverywhere he could see why the epsizyr breaks were also known as pylon country why was the system built in the first place kabe asked he had been quizzing the avatar about the cablecar system when it had made its remark about almost forgetting the place existed all down to a man called bregan latry the avatar said stretching out across the couch and clasping its hands behind its head eleven hundred years ago he got it into his head that what this place really needed was a system of sailing cable cars but why kabe asked the avatar shrugged no idea this was before my watch dont forget back in the time of my predecessor the one who sublimed you mean you didnt inherit any records from it ziller asked incredulously dont be ridiculous of course i inherited a full suite of records and archives the avatar stared up at the ceiling and shook his head looking back its very much as though i was there it shrugged there just wasnt any record of exactly why bregan latry decided to start covering the breaks in pylons he just thought there should be this here apparently perfectly fine idea ziller said he pulled on a line tightening one of the sails underneath the car with a squeak of wheels and pulleys and so your predecessor built it for him kabe asked the avatar snorted derisively certainly not this place was designed as wilderness it couldnt see any good reason to start running cables all over it no it told him to do it himself kabe looked round the haze horizon he could see hundreds of pylons from here he built all this himself in a manner of speaking the avatar said still staring up at the ceiling which was painted with scenes of ancient rustic life he asked for manufacturing capacity and design time and he found a sentient airship which also thought it would be a hoot to dot pylons all over the breaks he designed the pylons and the cars had them manufactured and then he and the airship and a few other people hed talked into supporting the project started putting the pylons up and stringing the cables in between didnt anyone object he kept it quiet for a surprisingly long time but yes people did object there are always critics ziller muttered he was studying a huge paper chart through a magnifying glass but they let him go ahead grief no the avatar said they started taking the pylons down some people like their wilderness just as it is but obviously mr latry prevailed kabe said looking round again they were approaching the mast on the low hill the ground was rising towards the cars lower sails and their shadow was growing closer all the time he just kept building the pylons and the airship and his pals kept planting them and the preservationeers the avatar turned and glanced at kabe they had a name by this time always a bad signkept taking them down more and more people joined in on both sides until the place was swarming with people putting up pylons and hanging cable off them rapidly followed by people tearing everything down and carting it away again didnt they vote on it kabe knew this was how disputes tended to be settled in the culture the avatar rolled its eyes oh they voted and mr latry won no he lost so how come actually they had lots of votes it was one of those rolling campaigns where they had to vote on who would be allowed to vote just people whod been to the breaks people who lived on canthropa everybody on masaq or what and mr latry lost he lost the first vote with those eligible to vote restricted to those whod been to the breaks beforewould you believe there was one proposal to weight everybodys votes according to how many times theyd been here and another to give them a vote for each day theyd been here the avatar shook its head believe me democracy in action can be an unpretty sight so he lost that one and in theory my predecessor was then mandated to stop the manufacturing but then the people who hadnt been allowed to vote were complaining and so there was another ballot and this time it was the whole plate population plus people whod been to the breaks and he won that one no he lost that one too the preservationeers had some very good pr better than the pylonists they had a name too by this time kabe asked of course this isnt going to be one of those idiotic local disputes that end up being put to a vote of the whole culture is it ziller said still poring over his chart he looked up briefly at the avatar i mean that doesnt really happen does it he asked it really happens the avatar said its voice sounded particularly hollow more often than youd think but no in this case the quarrel never went out of masaqs jurisdiction the avatar frowned as though finding something objectionable in the painted scene overhead oh ziller by the way mind that pylon what the chelgrian said he glanced up the pylon on the hill was only five metres away oh shit he dropped the chart and the magnifying glass and moved quickly to adjust the levers controlling the cars overhead steering wheels there was a clanking grinding noise from overhead the stubby pylon whooshed past to starboard its foametal girders streaked with bird droppings and dotted with lichen the cable car shook and rattled as it crunched over the first set of points while ziller loosened his ropes letting the sails flap free the car was now on a sort of ring round the top of the pylon from which the other cable routes left a set of vanes on the top of the pylon powered a chain drive set into the ring pulling the car round ziller watched a pair of hanging metal boards go past they bore large numbers in fading flaking paint at the third board he shoved one of the steering levers forward the cars overhead wheels reconnected and with a screech of metal and a sudden jolt it slipped onto the appropriate cable sliding down by gravity alone at first until ziller hauled on his ropes and reconfigured the sails to haul the swaying gently bouncing car along a long bowed length of cable that led to another distant hillock there ziller said but eventually mr latry got his way kabe said obviously obviously the avatar agreed in the end he just got enough people sufficiently enthused about the whole ridiculous scheme the final vote was over the whole orbital the preservationeers saved face by getting him to agree he wouldnt clutter up any other wildernesses even though there was no evidence to show he had any plans to do so in the first place so he went ahead planting pylons spinning cables and producing cars to his hearts content lots of people helped he had to form separate teams with a couple of airships each and some went their own way though they mostly worked under a general plan drawn up by latry the only interruptions came during the idiran war andonce id taken overin the shaladian crisis when i had to commandeer all the spare production capacity to be ready to build ships and military stuff even then he kept building pylons and spinning cables using homemade machinery some of his followers had built by the time hed finished six hundred years after hed started hed covered almost the whole of the breaks in pylons and thats why its called pylon country thats three million square kilometres ziller said he had retrieved the chart and the magnifying glass and gone back to studying one through the other near enough the avatar said uncrossing then recrossing its legs i counted the number of pylons once and totted up the kilometrage of cable and kabe asked the avatar shook its head they were both very big numbers but otherwise uninteresting i could search them out for you if you wanted but please kabe said not on my account so did mr latry die with his lifes work completed ziller asked he was staring out of a side window now and scratching his head he held the map up and turned it one way then the other no the avatar said mr latry was not one of lifes diers he spent a few years travelling the cables in a car all by himself but eventually he grew bored with it he did some deep space cruising then settled on an orbital called quyeela sixty thousand years away from here hasnt been here or even inquired about the cablecar system to my knowledge for over a century last i heard he was trying to persuade a pack of gsvs to take part in a scheme to induce patterns of sun spots on his local star so theyd spell out names and mottoes well ziller said staring at the chart again they say a man should have a hobby at the moment yours seems to be keeping about two million kilometres between you and our major quilan the avatar observed ziller looked up heavens are we really that far from home pretty much and how is our emissary is he enjoying himself has he settled in to his billet has he sent any souvenir cards back home yet it was six days after quilan had arrived on the resistance is characterforming the major had liked his quarters in yorle city on the plate of the same name well enough yorle was two plates two continents away from aquime city where ziller lived the major had visited aquime a couple of times since once accompanied by kabe once alone on each occasion he had announced his intention and asked hub to tell ziller what he was doing ziller wasnt spending much time at home anyway he was visiting parts of the orbital he hadnt seen before or as today places hed been to before and been taken with he has settled in very well hub said through the avatar shall i tell him you were asking after him better not we dont want him getting too excited ziller gazed through the side windows as the swaying car tipped in a gust of wind and then still creaking and rattling picked up speed along the monofil cable surprised youre not with him kabe ziller said glancing at the homomdan i thought the idea was you had to hold his hand while hes here the major hopes that i might be able to persuade you to grant him an audience kabe said obviously i cant do much persuading if i never leave his side ziller inspected kabe over the top of the chart tell me kabe is that him trying to be disarmingly honest through you or just your usual naivete kabe laughed a little of each i think ziller shook his head he tapped at the chart with the magnifying glass what do all these cable lines crosshatched in pink and red mean he asked the pink lines have been judged unsafe the avatar said the red ones are the stretches that have fallen down ziller held up the chart towards the avatar he indicated one area the size of his hand you mean you cant use these bits at all not in a cable car the avatar agreed you just let them fall down ziller said staring at the chart again and sounding kabe thought distinctly peeved the avatar shrugged like i said they werent my responsibility in the first place nothing to do with me whether they stand or fall unless i choose to adopt them as part of my infrastructure and given that hardly anybody uses them these days im not about to anyway i kind of enjoy their gradual entropic decay i thought you people built to last kabe said oh said the avatar brightly if id built the pylons id have anchored them into the base material thats the main reason the lines have collapsed or are unsafe the pylons have been washed away in floods they werent founded on the substrate just the geolayer and not very far into that a big flood comes along after a supercyclone andwhumfa bunch of them fall down plus the monofils so strong it can drag whole lines down once the first one or two pylons get washed into the flood streams they didnt put enough safety breaks into the cables there have been four big storms since the system was finished im surprised more of it hasnt been compromised still it does seem a shame to let it all fall into such disrepair kabe said the avatar looked up at him you really think so i thought there was something rather romantic about it crumbling slowly away for a work of such selfreferential artifice to be attritionally sculpted by what passes for the forces of nature round here seemed appropriate to me kabe thought about this ziller was studying the chart again what about these lines hatched in blue he asked oh said the avatar those just might be unsafe zillers face took on an expression of consternation he held up the chart but were on a blue line yes the avatar said looking up through the glass panels in the centre of the rustic painting where the cars guide and steering wheels could be seen sliding along the cable hmm it said ziller put the chart down crumpling it hub he said are we in any danger no not really there are safety systems plus if there was a failure and we fell off the wire i could zap down an ag platform before wed fallen more than a few metres so as long as im all right we all are ziller looked suspiciously at the silverskinned creature lying on the couch then returned to his chart have we settled on a venue for the first performance of my symphony yet he asked not looking up i thought the stullien bowl on guerno the avatar said ziller looked up kabe thought he looked both surprised and pleased really i think i have little choice the avatar said been a lot of interest need a maximumcapacity venue ziller smiled broadly and looked to be about to say something then he smiled almost bashfully kabe thought and buried his head in the chart again oh ziller the avatar said major quilan has asked me to ask you if youd mind him moving to aquime city ziller put the chart down what he hissed yorle is very nice but its quite different from aquime the avatar said its warm even at this time of year he wants to experience the same conditions you do up there on the massif send him to the top of a bulkhead range ziller muttered taking up the magnifying glass again would it concern you the avatar asked youre hardly there these days anyway its still where i prefer to lay my head most nights ziller said so yes it would concern me then i should tell him youd prefer he didnt move there yes are you sure he wasnt asking to move in next door just somewhere in the city centre still too close for comfort hub kabe began hmm the avatar said he said hed be happy to let you know where he was so you wouldnt bump into oh dear fucking god ziller threw the chart down and shoved the magnifying glass into a waistcoat pocket look i dont want the guy here i dont want him anywhere near me i dont want to meet him and i dont like being told that even if i want to i cant get away from the son of a bitch my dear ziller kabe said then stopped im starting to sound like tersono he thought the avatar brought its boots down off the top of the couch and swung itself into a sitting position nobodys forcing you to meet the fellow ziller yes but nobodys letting me get as far away from him as id like either youre a long way from him now kabe pointed out and how long did it take us to get from there to here ziller asked they had come by subplate car that morning the whole journey had taken just over an hour hmm well im practically a prisoner ziller said spreading his arms the avatars face contorted no youre not it said i might as well be i havent been able to write a note since that bastard showed up the avatar sat up looking alarmed but you have finished the ziller waved one hand exasperatedly its complete but i usually wind down with shorter pieces after something this big and this time i havent been able to i feel constipated well kabe said if you might as well be forced into contact with quilan why not see him and get it over with the avatar groaned and flopped back on the couch it put its feet up again ziller was staring at kabe is that it he asked is that you using your powers of argument to convince me i should see this piece of shit from your tone kabe said voice rumbling i take it you are not persuaded ziller shook his head persuasion whats reasonable would i mind am i concerned would i be insulted i may do as i please but then so may he ziller pointed angrily at the avatar you people are polite to the point of it becoming worse than any direct insult all this pussyfooting mealymouthed bullshit dancing round each other afteryounoafteryounoafteryou he waved his arms around as his voice rose to a shout i hate this hopeless congealment of fucking good manners cant anyone just do something kabe thought about saying something then decided not to the avatar looked mildly surprised it blinked a few times such as what it inquired would you prefer that the major called you out and challenged you to a duel or moved in next door you could kick him out why would i do that because hes annoying me the avatar smiled ziller it said i feel hunted were a predator species were only used to hiding when were stalking were not used to feeling like prey you could move home kabe suggested hed follow me you could keep moving why should i i like my apartment i like the silence and the views i even like some of the people there are three concert halls in aquime with perfect acoustics why should i be driven from the place just because chel sends this military bagboy to do godknowswhat what do you mean godknowswhat asked the avatar maybe he isnt here just to talk me into going back with him maybe hes here to kidnap me or kill me oh really kabe said kidnaps impossible hub said unless he brought a fleet of warships ive missed the avatar shook its head murder is almost impossible it frowned attempted murder is always possible i suppose but if you were worried i could make sure that if and when you did meet there would be a few combat drones and knife missiles and that sort of thing around and of course you could be backedup i am not ziller said deliberately going to need combat drones and knife missiles or backingup because i am not going to meet him but hes obviously annoying you just by being here kabe said oh does it show ziller asked snarling so assuming that hes not going to get bored and go away kabe went on youd almost be better off agreeing to see him and getting it over with will you just stop this getting it over with nonsense ziller shouted talking of not being able to get away from people the avatar said heavily e h tersono has discovered our whereabouts and would like to drop by ha ziller said whirling round to look out of the windscreen again i cant get away from that damn machine either it means well kabe said ziller looked round appearing genuinely mystified so kabe sighed is tersono nearby he asked the avatar it nodded its already on its way here about ten minutes away flying in from the nearest tunnel port more than just the terrain made the breaks wasteland there were only a few subplate access points and they were all on the outskirts of the area so to get deep into the barrens at more than walkingtrail pace you either had to use the cablecar system or fly what does it want ziller checked the wind gauge then loosened two ropes and tightened another to no appreciable effect social visit it says the avatar told him ziller tapped a gimballed horizontal dial you sure this compass works are you accusing me of not having a viable magnetic field the hub asked i was asking you if this thing works ziller tapped the instrument again should do the avatar said putting its clasped hands behind its head again very inefficient way of determining your heading though i want to head into the wind on the next turn ziller said looking ahead to the hill they were approaching and the stubby pylon at its scrubby summit youll need to start the propeller oh kabe said they have propellers big twobladed thing stowed at the back the avatar said nodding to the rear where two curved windows cupped a broad panelled section batterypowered should be charged up if the generator vanes are working how do i determine that ziller asked he pulled his pipe from a waistcoat pocket see the big dial on the right just under the windscreen with a lightning flash symbol ah yes is the needle in the brownblack section or the bright blue section ziller peered he stuck his pipe in his mouth there is no needle the avatar looked thoughtful that could be a bad sign it sat up and looked about the pylon was about fifty metres away the ground was rising underneath them id ease off on that mizzen sheet the what slacken the third rope from the left ah ziller loosened the rope and tied it off again he pulled on a couple of the levers braking the car and readying the steering wheels above he clicked a couple of large switches and looked hopefully towards the rear of the car he caught the avatars gaze oh let the fucking emissary move to aquime he said in an exasperated voice see if i care just keep us apart certainly the avatar said grinning then its expression changed ohoh it said it was staring straight ahead kabe felt a spark of worry leap in his breast what ziller said is tersono here already then he was thrown off his feet as with a crashing tearing noise the cable car decelerated rapidly and came to a shuddering swaying stop the avatar had slid along the couch kabe had been thrown forwards only stopping himself from falling on his face by putting out one arm and bracing himself on the brass rail separating the passenger compartment from the crews area the brass rail bent and came away from the bulkhead on one side with a creak and a bang ziller ended up sitting on the floor between two of the instrument binnacles the car rocked to and fro ziller spat out a piece of his pipe what the fuck was that i think we snagged a tree the avatar said sitting upright everybody all right fine said kabe sorry about this rail ive bitten my pipe in half ziller said he picked one half of his severed pipe up from the floor itll repair the avatar said it pulled back the carpet between the couches and lifted open a wooden door wind gusted in the creature lay on the floor and stuck its head out yes its a tree it shouted it levered itself back inside must have grown a bit since the last time anybody used this line ziller was picking himself up of course it wouldnt have happened if youd been responsible for the system would it of course not the avatar said breezily shall i send a repair drone or shall we try and fix it ourselves i have a better idea ziller said smiling as he looked out of a side window kabe looked too and saw a mainly rosecoloured object flying through the air towards them ziller slid open a window on that side and turned to his two companions with a smile before hailing the approaching drone tersono good to see you glad youre here see that mess down below the seastacks of youmier and was tersono equal to the task more than equal physically hub tells me despite its protestations that it risked tearing itself apart however i think that whatever empowers its will is also charged with maintaining its dignity and so is normally pretty much fully occupied with that but was it able to free your car from the tree yes finally though it took its time and it made a terrible mess of things it shredded the cars mainsail broke the mast and cut away half the tree and what of zillers pipe bitten in half hub repaired it for him ah i was wondering if i might have made him a present of a replacement im not sure hed take it in the spirit it was meant quil especially as its something he would be putting in his mouth you suspect he might think i was trying to poison him it might occur to him i see i still have a way to go dont i yes you do and how much further do we have to go here on our walk another three or four kilometres kabe looked up at the sun we should be there nicely in time for lunch kabe and quilan were walking along the cliff tops of the vilster peninsula on fzan plate to their right thirty metres below fzan ocean beat against the rocks the haze horizon swam with scattered islands closer in a few sailboats and larger craft cut through the spreading patterns of the waves a cool wind came off the sea it whipped kabes coat about his legs and quilans robes snapped and fluttered about him as he led the way along the narrow path though the tall grass to their left the ground sloped away to deep grassland and then a forest of tall cloudtrees ahead the land rose to a modest headland and a ridge heading inland notched with a cleft for one branch of the path they were on they were taking the more strenuous and exposed route along the cliff top quilan turned his head to look down towards the waves falling against tumbled rocks at the cliffs base the smell of brine was the same here remembering again quil yes youre close to the edge mind you dont fall i will snow was falling in the courtyard of the monastery of cadracet sinking gently from a silent grey sky quilan had brought up the rear of the firewood foraging detail preferring to walk in solitude and silence as the others trudged up the trail ahead the other monks had all gone inside to the warmth of the great halls hearth by the time he closed the postern door behind him scuffed through the light covering of snow on the courtyards stones and dumped his basket of wood with the rest under the gallery he dallied a moment soaking up the fresh clean smell of the woodhe remembered a time when theyd taken a hunting cabin in the loustrian hills just the two of them the axe that came with the cabin was blunt hed sharpened it with a stone hoping to impress her with his handiness but then when hed come to swing it at the first piece of wood the head had sailed off and disappeared into the trees he could still exactly recall her laughter and then when he must have looked hurt her kiss they had slept under furs on a platform of moss he remembered one cold morning when the fire had gone out overnight and it was freezingly cold in the cabin and they had coupled him straddling her his teeth nipped gently in the fur at the nape of her neck moving slowly over and in her watching the smoke of her breath as it billowed in the sunlight and rolled out across the room to the window where it froze in curving recursive motifs a coalescence of pattern out of chaos he shivered blinking away cold tears when he turned away he saw the figure standing in the centre of the courtyard looking at him it was a female dressed in a cloak falling halfopen over an army uniform the snow fell between them in soundless spirals he blinked just for an instant he shook his head brushed his hands together and walked out to her putting up the hood of his griefling robe he realised as he made those few steps that he hadnt even seen a female in the flesh for half a year she did not look like worosei at all she was taller her fur was darker and her eyes looked more narrowed and wizened he guessed she was ten or so years older than him the pips on her cap identified her as a colonel can i help you maam he asked yes major quilan she said in a precise controlled voice perhaps you can fronipel brought them both goblets of mulled wine his office was about twice the size of quilans cell and cluttered with papers screens and the ancient fraying string frames which were the holy books of the order there was just enough room for the three of them to sit colonel ghejaline warmed her hands round the goblet her cap lay on the desk at her side her cloak across the seat back they had exchanged a few pleasantries about her journey up the old road by mount and her role during the war in charge of a space artillery section fronipel settled himself slowly into his secondbest curlchairthe best had been given to the coloneland said i asked colonel ghejaline to come here major she is familiar with your background and history i believe she has a proposal for you the colonel looked as though she would have been happy to have spent rather more time approaching the reason for her visit but gave a shrug of good grace and said yes major there is something you might be able to do for us quilan looked at fronipel who was smiling at him who would the us here be colonel he asked her the army the colonel frowned not really the army is involved but this would not strictly speaking be a military assignment it would be more like the one you and your wife undertook on aorme though even further afield and on a quite different level of security and importance the us i refer to would be all chelgrians but especially those whose souls are currently held in limbo quilan sat back in his seat and what would i be expected to do i cant tell you exactly yet i am here to find out if you will even consider undertaking the mission but if i dont know what it is major quilan the colonel said taking a small sip of her steaming wine and thenafter a minimal nod to fronipel to acknowledge the drinkputting the goblet down on the desk ill tell you all i can she drew herself up a little straighter in the seat the task we would ask you to undertake is one that is very important indeed that is almost all i know about that aspect of it i do know a little more but im not allowed to talk about it the mission would require that you undergo a considerable amount of training again i cant say much more about that the clearance for the mission comes from the top of our society she took a breath and the reason that it doesnt matter too much at this stage exactly what it is you are being asked to do is that in one sense whats being asked of you is as bad as it gets she looked into his eyes this is a suicide mission major quilan he had forgotten the sheer pleasure of staring into a females eyes even if she was not worosei and even if that pleasure like some emotional internalisation of physical law created an equal and opposite feeling of grief and loss and even guilt he gave a small sad smile oh in that case colonel he said ill definitely do it quil hmm he turned to face the tall triangular bulk of the homomdan who had bumped into him are you all right you stopped very suddenly there did you see something nothing no im fine i just im fine come on im hungry they walked on i just recalled the lady colonel told me this is a oneway mission ah yes there is that it is all coming back isnt it unlike us yes thats the way theyve arranged it thats what we both agreed to it seems to have worked so far you knew too then yes that was part of visquiles briefing which is why they kept you backedup in that substrate which is why they kept me backedup in that substrate well i cant wait for the next instalment he reached the summit of the cliff path and saw the town a scimitar of white towers and spires lying cradled in a bowl of wooded valley bordered by rising chalk cliffs its bay protected from the sea by a spit of sand waves beat whitely on the strand the homomdan joined him standing massively at his side and all but blocking out the wind there was a hint of rain in the air the following day she left her mount in the monastery stables with her uniform she dressed in the waistcoat and leggings of a handed he was to impersonate a grafted so wore trousers and an apron they both put on nondescript grey winter cloaks he said goodbye to fronipel but to nobody else they waited until all the work parties had departed before leaving the monastery then they walked down the lower path through the falling snow and the bare husks of spall trees past the distant woodgathererstheir songs heard through the quietly falling snow as though they were the voices of ghostsdown through a level of wispy cloud where the colonels grey cloak seemed almost to disappear at times and then through the drumming rain beneath and the dripping forest of dark leaves that descended towards the valley floor where they turned and followed the deeply shaded track above the river rushing whitely in the chasm below the rain slackened and ceased a group of tallier caste hunters in an old allterrain on their way back from the forests after stalking jhehj offered them a lift but they refused politely the trailer behind the allterrain was piled with the carcasses of the animals it bounced down the track into the gloom with its cargo of the dead so that from then on they followed a line of fresh bloodspots finally in the foothills of the grey mountains towards sunset they came out onto the girdling turnpike where cars and trucks and buses hummed past trailing spray a large car was waiting for them by the roadside a young male who looked uncomfortable in civilian clothes opened the door for them and completed threequarters of a salute to the colonel before remembering the vehicles interior was warm and dry they took off their cloaks the car swung out onto the road and set off down the route towards the plains the colonel plugged into a military com set in a briefcase on the rear seat and left him to his own thoughts as she sat with eyes closed communicating he watched the traffic the outskirts of the city of ubrent sparkled out of the gloom it looked in better repair than the last time hed seen it within an hour they had reached the airport and a sleek black suborbiter sitting on the mistcurdled runway he was about to reach out and touch the colonel to let her know theyd arrived when she opened her eyes slipped the induction coil from the back of her head and nodded at the aircraft as though to say were here the acceleration pressed him firmly back into the frameseat he saw the lights of the coastal cities of sherjame the midocean islands of delleun and the small sparks of oceanic ships above the stars became bright and steady and looked very close in the ghostly silence of nearvacuum flight the suborbiter plunged back into the atmosphere in a gathering roar there were a few lights then a smooth touchdown and deceleration he dozed in the closed transport which took them away from the private field when they transferred to a helicopter he could smell sea they flew briefly in darkness and rain and clattered down into a great circular courtyard he was shown to a small comfortable room and fell promptly asleep in the morning waking to a thudding not quite regular booming noise and the distant screeches of birds he opened the shutters to look down over a sheer gulf of air at a bluegreen sea streaked with foam and breaking waves boiling round a jagged coastline fifty metres away and a hundred down a line of cliffs vanished into the distance on either side and immediately opposite him there was a huge double bowl cut out of the cliffs so that the drop from the bottom of the bowl to the sea was only thirty metres or so clouds of seabirds wheeled in the sunlight like scraps of foam blown up from the fretful sea he recognised this place he had seen it in books and on screen the seastacks at youmier were part of an extensive cliff system on mainland one of the tailquiff islands which lay in a long curved line to the east of meiorin the cliffs dropped between two and three hundred metres into the ocean and the seventeen seastacksthe remains of great arches that the oceans swells and waves had first created and then destroyedrose like the fingers of two drowning people local legend had once held that they were the fingers of a pair of drowning lovers whod thrown themselves from the cliffs rather than be forced to marry others the stacks were named as though they were fingers and the last and smallest of them which was only forty metres above the waves was called the thumb the others ranged between one and two hundred metres in height and were about the same circumference where the sea washed incessantly around their bases tapering slightly to their basalt summits building had begun upon them four thousand years earlier when the areas ruling family had constructed a single small stone castle on the stack nearest the cliff top and linked the two by a wooden bridge as the familys power had grown so had the castle until work was started on another stack and then another and another the fortress complex spread across the various rocky pinnacles linked by a succession of bridgesat first wood later stone then later still iron and steeland became a centre of government a place of worship and pilgrimage and a seat of learning over the centuries and millennia every stack except the thumb had been permanently settled in some form or another and it had even been a fortress for a while equipped with heavy naval guns for a century or so gradually the seastacks had grown to become a city with its greatest part ashore spreading out over the heathland behind the cliffs it had duly suffered the same fate as a handful of cities round the globe during the last unification war fifteen hundred years earlier falling to a scatter of nuclear warheads which demolished one stack completely halved the height of another and had left a crater shaped like a giant scooped out of the cliffs where most of the mainland districts had been the city was never rebuilt the seastacks cut off from the mainland by the twin craters were derelict for centuries a place for ghoulish tourism and home only to a few hermits and a million sea birds two of the stacks became a monastery during one of chels more religious phases then the combined services had commandeered all of them as a training base and rebuilt almost everything save for the bridges to the mainland before moving offworld before the whole complex was finished and leaving the stacks mothballed with only a caretaker staff behind now it was his home quilan leant on a parapet and looked down to the white ruff of surf washing the males middle fingers base three hundred metres below the water looked slow from up here he thought as though each wave was tired from its long journey across the ocean from wherever waves were born he had been here for a twomoon month they were training him and assessing him he still knew no more about the task beyond the fact that it was supposed to be a suicide mission it was still not certain that he would be going on it he knew that he was one of several contenders for the dubious honour he had already agreed that if he was not chosen he would submit to a memory wipe which would leave him apparently just another wartraumatised monk in cadracet retreat struggling to come to terms with his experiences colonel ghejaline was present about half the time overseeing his training his principal instructor in the arts and crafts of most things martial was a scarred stocky and taciturn male called wholom he seemed obviously army or exarmy but would admit to no rank quilans other tutor was called chuelfier a frail whitefurred old male whose years and infirmity seemed to drop away from him when he was teaching there were a few army specialists he saw every few days who obviously also lived in the complex a handful of servants of various castes and a number of blinded invisibles who had remained faithful to the old ways through the caste war quilan watched the blinded go about their duties their upper faces covered by the green band of their rank feeling their way with an easy familiarity or using the highpitched clicks they made with their claws to navigate their way amongst the concrete and rockcarved spaces of the stack to be blinded here with the drop to the rocks and the ocean was he thought to put your faith forever in walls and thoughtful design he was not allowed off this stack he strongly suspected that some of his unseen comradeadversariesthe others who might be chosen to go on the mission rather than himwere on some of the other stacks across the long locked bridges the combined services had thrown between the rocky columns he held up one arm and studied his unsheathed claws he turned his arm left and right he had never been so muscled so fit he wondered if he really needed to be at such a physical peak for this mission or whether the armyor whoever was really behind thisjust trained you up like this as a matter of course a large circular parade ground was located high up on the seaward side of the stack it was open at the sides but roofed by white awnings like oldfashioned ship sails there they had taught him fencing trained him with a crossbow and with projectile weapons and early laser rifles they inculcated in him the finer and less fine points of fighting with knives and with teeth and claws the point had been made that closein fighting would differ when you tackled species other than your own but it had been left at that a small team of medics flew in one day and took him to a big but obviously rarely used hospital hollowed out of the rock deep beneath the stacks buildings they equipped him with an improved soulkeeper but that was the only implant they touched or introduced he had heard of agents and people on special missions being fitted with brainlinked communications rigs poisondetection nasal glands poisonproducing sacs subcutaneous weapon systems the list was long but he apparently was going to receive none of these he wondered why at one point there was a hint that whoever undertook the mission might not be entirely alone he wondered about that too not all his training and education was martial at least half of each waking day was spent being a student again sitting in a curlchair learning through screens or listening to chuelfier the old male instructed him in chelgrian history in religious philosophy both before and after the partial sublimation of the chelgrianpuen and in the discovered history of the rest of the galaxy and its other sentient beings he learned more than hed ever imagined wanting or needing to know of what soulkeepers did and how they did it and what limbo and heaven were like he learned where the old religion had been overly fanciful or just plain wrong in its assumptions and tenets where it had inspired the chelgrianpuen and so been made real and where it had been superseded he had no direct contact with any of the gonebefore but he came to understand the afterlife better than he ever had before sometimes knowing that it was almost beyond doubt that worosei would never experience anything of this created glory he felt that they had chosen him only to torture him that all of this was an elaborate and cruel charade to find the knife of woroseis loss that was forever buried in his flesh and twist it with all their might he learned all there was to know about the caste war and the cultures involvement in the changes that had led to it he learned about the personalities who had contributed to the wars background and listened to some of the music of mahrai ziller at turns so achingly full of loss he cried at others so full of anger he wanted to smash something a number of suspicions and possible scenarios began to form in his mind though he kept them to himself sometimes now he dreamt of worosei in one dream they were being married here on the seastack and a great wind off the sea whipped peoples hats away he went to grab hers as it flew towards the parapet and then crashed into the whitewashed concrete tipping over it with her hat still just out of reach he started to fall towards the sea and felt himself gather in the breath for a scream then recalled that of course worosei wasnt really here and could not be here she was dead and he might as well be he smiled at the waves as they rushed up to meet him and woke before he hit with a feeling of somehow having been cheated the salty dampness on his pillow like sea one morning he was walking across the parade ground beneath the snapping white tents of the awnings heading towards chuelfiers class room for the first lecture of the day when he saw a small group of people directly ahead colonel ghejaline wholom and chuelfier were standing talking to the white and blackclothed figure in the middle of the group there were five others three on the right of the central group two on the left all were males dressed as clerks the male in the middle was small and oldlooking with a sort of sideways hunch to his stance it was something of a shock for quilan to realise that the male was dressed in the black and white striped robe of an estodien one of those who went between this world and the next he wore a lopsided smile and held onto a long mirror staff his fur looked slick as though it had been oiled quilan was about to greet the colonel but as he approached the three people he knew dropped back to let the estodien take a couple of small steps forward estodien quilan said bowing deeply major quilan the old male said in a soft smooth voice he reached his hand out to quilan who had become aware that the male standing on the extreme right of the group bulked out his clerical robes differently to the rest and that this same male had started moving round to the side as if starting to circle behind him when the male disappeared from his view the semishadow he cast by the attenuated light coming through the white awnings suddenly moved faster what finally made quilan certain he might be about to be attacked was something about the way that the old estodien stretched when he reached out his hand he was frail and could not help but keep his distance from something that might prove violent quilan made as though to take the older males hand then ducked and spun went back on his haunches and brought his midlimb and hands out in the classic pouncedefence stance the bulkylooking male dressed as a clerk had been about to strike he had rocked back on his haunches and his sleeves were rolled back to reveal tightly muscled arms though his claws were only half exposed there was a radiant almost feral look on his whitefurred face that lasted for a moment and even brightened for an instant as quilan turned to confront him but then he glanced at the estodien and relaxed sitting back and lowering his arms and his head in what might have been a bow quilan stayed exactly as he was his head turning slightly to and fro his gaze flicking as far behind him as he could manage without losing sight of the whitefurred male there did not appear to be any other movement or threat there was a frozen moment when nothing happened save for the distant calls of the sea birds the faraway thudding of the waves then the estodien clicked his staff on the parade grounds concrete once and the whitefurred male rose and turned in one fluid movement and went to stand where he had before major quilan the old male said again please stand he held out his hand once more no more unpleasant surprises at least not for today i give you my word quilan took the estodiens hand and rose from his crouch colonel ghejaline came forward she looked pleased quilan thought major quilan this is estodien visquile sir quilan said as the older male released his hand and this is eweirl visquile said indicating the whitefurred male to his left the bulkylooking male nodded and smiled i hope you have the wit to realise you passed two little tests there major not one yes sir or the same one twice sir visquiles smile broadened revealing small sharp teeth you dont really have to call me sir major though i confess i rather like it he turned to wholom and chuelfier and then to colonel ghejaline not bad he looked back to quilan looking him down then up come along major well have a talk i think we are told it is very unusual for them to make such a mistake we are told that we should feel flattered they took such an interest in us in the first place we are told that they respect us we are told that it is an accident of development and the evolution of galaxies stars planets and species that we meet them on less than equal technological terms we are told that what happened is unfortunate but that we may eventually gain from it we are told they are honourable people who only wished to help and now feel that they are in our debt because of their carelessness we are told that we may profit more through their crushing guilt than we might have gained thanks to their easy patronage the estodien visquile smiled his thin sharp smile none of this matters the estodien and quilan sat alone in a small tower perched out over the side of one of the stacks lowest levels of superstructure air and sea showed on three sides and the warm wind blew in through one glassless window and out another laden with the scent of brine they sat curled on grass mats what matters the old male went on is what the chelgrianpuen have decided there was a pause quilan suspected he was supposed to fill it and so said and what would that be estodien the old males fur had the odour of expensive perfume he sat up and back on his mat looking out of a window towards the long swells of the sea it has been a consistent article of our faith for twentyseven hundred years he said casually that the souls of the departed are held in limbo for a full year before being accepted into the glory of heaven that has not changed since weour gonebeforemade heaven real nor have many of the other doctrines associated with such matters they have become rules in a sense he turned and smiled again at quilan before looking away through the window once more what im about to tell you is known to very few people major quilan it must stay that way do you understand yes estodien colonel ghejaline does not know and nor do any of your tutors i understand the old male turned to him suddenly why do you want to die quilan he rocked back thrown iin a way i dont estodien i just dont particularly want to live i want to be no more you want to die because your mate is dead and you are pining for her is that not the truth i would put it a little stronger than pining for her estodien but it was her death that took the meaning out of my life the lives of your family and your society in this time of need and restructuring these mean nothing to you not nothing estodien but not enough either i wish that i could feel otherwise but i cannot it is as though all the people i care about but feel i ought to care about more are already in another world from the one i inhabit she was just a female quilan just a person just one individual what makes her so special that her memoryforever irretrievable apparentlyoutranks the more pressing needs of those still alive for whom something can still be done nothing estodien it is nothing indeed it is not her memory it is yours it is not her specialness or uniqueness that you celebrate quilan but your own you are a romantic quilan you find the idea of tragic death romantic you find the idea of joining hereven if it is joining her in oblivionromantic the old male drew himself up as though getting ready to go i hate romantics quilan they do not really know themselves but what is worse they do not really want to know themselvesor ultimately anybody elsebecause they think that will take the mystery out of life they are fools you are a fool probably your wife was a fool too he paused probably you were both romantic fools he said fools who were doomed to a life of disillusionment and bitterness when you discovered that your precious romanticism faded away after the first few years of marriage and you were left to confront not just your own inadequacies but those of your mate you were lucky she died she was unlucky it was her and not you quilan looked at the estodien for a few moments the old male was breathing a little deeper and harder than should have been necessary but otherwise he was controlling any fear he felt very well he would be thoroughly backedup and as an estodien he would be reborn or reincarnated as and when he wished that however would not prevent the animal self from contemplating being bundled through a window and falling to the sea with anything other than terror of course this assumed the old male wasnt wearing some sort of ag harness in which case he might simply be afraid of quilan ripping his throat out before eweirl or anybody else could do anything about it estodien quilan said evenly i have thought of all of that and been through all of that i have accused myself of all of these things that you mention and in rather less temperate language than you have used you find me at the end of the process you might have wished to initiate with such assertions not the start the estodien looked at him quite good he said speak more honestly more fully i am not to be riled into violence by someone who never knew her calling my wife a fool i know she was not which is enough and i think you just wanted to find out how easy i might be to anger perhaps not easy enough quilan the old male said not all tests are passed or failed as one might expect i am not trying to pass your tests estodien i am trying to be honest i assume your tests are good ones if they are and i do my best and fail while somebody else succeeds then that is better than me succeeding by telling you what i think you want to hear rather than what i feel that is calm to the point of smugness quilan perhaps this mission requires somebody with more aggression and cunning than that reply indicates you to be in possession of perhaps it does estodien the old male kept his gaze locked on quilan for some time eventually he looked away out of the window again the war dead will not be allowed into heaven quilan he had to listen to the comment in his head replaying it to be sure he had heard correctly he blinked estodien it was a war major not a civilian disturbance or a natural disaster the caste war he asked and immediately felt stupid yes of course the caste war visquile snapped he composed himself again the chelgrianpuen have told us that the old rules apply the old rules he thought he already knew what was meant they must be avenged a soul for a soul this was the stuff of barbarism of the old cruel gods the death of each chelgrian had to be balanced by the death of an enemy and until that balance had been achieved the fallen warriors were held from heaven why ought one to leap to the idea of a onetoone correspondence the estodien asked with a cold smile perhaps one death would be all that might be required one important death he looked away again quilan was silent for a while and motionless when visquile did not look back to him from the window and the view he said one death the estodien fixed him with his gaze again one important death much might result from that he looked away humming a tune quilan recognised the melody it was by mahrai ziller absence of gravitas the point is what happens in heaven unknowable wonderfulness nonsense the answer is nothing nothing can happen because if something happens in fact if something can happen then it doesnt represent eternity our lives are about development mutation and the possibility of change that is almost a definition of what life is change have you always thought that if you disable change if you effectively stop time if you prevent the possibility of the alteration of an individuals circumstancesand that must include at least the possibility that they alter for the worsethen you dont have life after death you just have death there are those who believe that after death the soul is recreated into another being that is conservative and a little stupid certainly but not actually idiotic and there are those who believe that upon death the soul is allowed to create its own universe monomaniacal and laughable as well as provably wrong then there are those who believe that the soul well there are all sorts of different beliefs however the ones that interest me are those concerning the idea of heaven thats the idiocy it annoys me that others cannot see of course you could just be wrong dont be ridiculous in any case even if heaven did not exist originally people have created it it does exist in fact lots of different heavens exist pa technology these socalled heavens will not last there will be war in them or between them and the sublimed at last something beyond heaven and unfortunately therefore useless but a start or rather an end or a start again of another sort of life so proving my point youve lost me were all lost we are found dead are you really a professor of divinity of course i am you mean it isnt obvious cr ziller you met the other chelgrian yet im sorry have we met yeah thats what im asking no i meant have you and i met trelsen scofford we met at the gidhoutans did we you said what i said about your stuff was singular and uniquely viewpointed i think i hear myself in there somewhere great so you met this guy yet no no but hes been here twenty days someone said he only lives are you really as ignorant as you appear trelsen or is this some sort of bizarre act perhaps even meant to be amusing sorry you should be if you paid more than the most passing i just heard there was another chelgrian attention to whats going on youd know that the other chelgrian is a feudal tough a professional bully come to attempt to persuade me to go back with him to a society i despise i have no intention of meeting the wretch oh i didnt realise then youre simply ignorant rather than malevolent congratulations so youre not going to meet him at all thats right not at all my plan is that after keeping him waiting for a few years hell either get fed up and slope home to be ritually chastised or hell gradually become seduced by masaq and its many attractions in particular and by the culture and all its wonderful manifestations in general and become a citizen then i might meet him brilliant strategy dont you think you serious im always serious never more so than when im being flippant think itll work i neither know nor care its just amusing to contemplate thats all so why do they want you to go back apparently im the true emperor i was a foundling swapped at birth by a jealous godmother for my longlost evil twin fimmit what really no of course not really hes here to deliver a summons for a minor traffic violation youre kidding drat you guessed no the thing is i have this secretion that comes from my anterior glands every chelgrian clan has one or two males in each generation who produce this substance without it the males of my clan cant pass solids if they dont lick the appropriate spot at least once per tidal month they start to experience terrible wind unfortunately my cousin kehenahanaha junior the third recently suffered a bizarre grooming accident which left him unable to produce the vital secretion so they need me back there before all the males in my family explode from compressed shit there is a surgical alternative of course but sadly the medical patent rights are held by a clan we havent acknowledged for three centuries dispute over a mistimed bid caused by an involuntary eructation during a bridebidding auction apparently we dont like to discuss it you youre not serious i really cant get a thing past you can i no its really about an unreturned library book you really are just kidding me now arent you yet again youve seen right through me its almost as though i neednt be here so you really dont know why they want you back well what reason could there possibly be dont ask me thats just what i was thinking hey why not just ask better still as its you who seems to care why dont you ask the one you charmingly call the other chelgrian to tell you why they want me back no i meant ask hub well it does know everything after all look theres its avatar over there hey right lets oh ah see you then ah oh hi you must be the homomdan well spotted so what does this woman actually do she listens to me she listens is that it yes i talk and she listens to what i say well so i mean im listening to you now what does this woman do thats so special well she listens without asking the sort of question youve just asked frankly what do you mean i was just asking yes but dont you see youre already being aggressive youve made up your mind that somebody just listening to somebody else is but is that all she does more or less yes but its very helpful havent you got friends of course i have friends well isnt that what theyre for no not always not for everything i want to talk about your house i used to talk about things with my house but then i realised i was just talking to a machine that not even the other machines pretend to think is sentient what about your family i especially do not want to share everything with my family they figure largely in what i need to talk about really thats terrible you poor thing hub then its a good listener well i understand but there are those of us who think that it only seems to care what its designed to care no its designed to seem to care with a person you feel that youre communicating on an animal level an animal level yes and thats supposed to be a good thing yes its sort of instinct to instinct so you dont think hub cares its just a machine so are you only in the widest sense i feel better talking to another human some of us feel that hub controls our lives too much does it i thought if you wanted to have nothing to do with it you could yes but you still live on the o dont you so well it runs the orbital thats what i mean yeah well somebodys got to run it yes but planets dont need anybody to run them theyre just sort of there so you want to live on a planet no i think id find them a bit small and weird arent they dangerous dont they get hit by stuff no planets have defence systems so those need running yes but youre missing the point i mean you wouldnt want a person in charge of stuff like that would you thatd be scary that would be like the old days like barbarism or something no but the point is wherever you live you can accept that something has to be minding the infrastructure but it shouldnt run your life as well thats why we feel we need to talk amongst ourselves more not to our houses or to hub or drones or anything like that thats deeply weird are there a lot of people like you well no not many but i know a few do you have a group do you hold meetings have you got a name yet well yes and no there have been a lot of ideas for names there was a suggestion we call ourselves the fastidians or the cellists or the carboniphiles or the rejectionists or the spokists or the rimmers or the planetists or the wellians or the circumferlocuans or circumlocuferans but i dont think we should adopt any of those why not hub suggested them sorry who was that the homomdan ambassador bit monstrous dont you think what what they have very good hearing hey cr ziller i forgot to ask hows the piece trelsen isnt it yeah of course what piece you know the music music oh yes yes ive written quite a lot of that oh stop joshing so hows it coming along do you mean generally or did you have a particular work in mind the new one of course ah yes of course so you mean at what stage of preparation is the symphony yes hows it coming along fine fine yes its coming along fine oh great well done look forward to hearing it great right yes fuck off through the crowd you cretin hope i didnt use too many technical terms oh hello kabe you still here how are you anyway i am well and yourself beset by idiots good job im used to it present company excepted i hope kabe if i suffered only one fool gladly i assure you it would be you hmm well i shall take that as i hope you meant it rather than as i suspect hope is a more pleasing emotion to the spirit than suspicion your reservoir of graciousness astonishes me kabe how was the emissary quilan i believe thats what he answers to he is resigned to a long wait i heard you took him walking along the coastal path at vilster yes all those kilometres of clifftop path and not a single slip almost beggars belief doesnt it he was a pleasant walking companion and seems a decent sort of person a little dour perhaps dour reserved and quiet quite serious with a sort of stillness in him stillness the sort of stillness there is in the centre of the third movement of tempest night when the steelwinds fall silent and the basses hold those long descending notes oh a symphonic stillness and is this mooted affinity with one of my works supposed to endear him to me that was the entirety of my purpose you are a quite shameless procurer arent you kabe am i dont you feel even the slightest shame at doing their bidding like this whose bidding hubs the contact section the culture as a whole not to mention my own enchanting society and splendid government i dont think your government is bidding me do anything kabe you dont know what sort of help they asked for or demanded from contact well i oh grief did i hear our name mentioned ah cr ziller ar ischloear dear friends so good to see you tersono you look positively polished thank you and a very pleasant crowd youve gathered as ever kabe you are one of my most important weathervanes if i may elevate and reduce you at the same time i rely utterly on you to tell me whether something is genuinely going well or whether people are just being polite so im so glad that you feel that way and kabe is glad that you are glad i was asking him about our chelgrian chum ah yes poor quilan poor yes you know his wife no i dont know what is she particularly ugly no shes dead a condition that rarely attends an improvement in looks ziller really the poor fellow lost his wife in the caste war didnt you know no i think ziller has been as assiduous in avoiding all knowledge of major quilan as i have been in accumulating it and you havent shared that knowledge with ziller kabe for shame my shame seems an especially popular subject this evening but no i have not i might have been about to just before you arrived yes it was all terribly tragic they hadnt been married long at least they can look forward to a reunion in the absurd blasphemy of our manufactured heaven apparently not her implant was not able to save her personality she is gone forever how very careless and what of the majors implants what of them dear ziller what are they have you checked him for any unusual ones the sort of things that special agents spies assassins tend to have well have you checked him over for that sort of thing its gone quiet do you think its broken i think its communicating elsewhere is that what those colours mean i dont think so thats just grey isnt it i think technically its gunmetal and is that magenta more violet though of course your eyes are different from mine ahem oh youre back indeed the answer is that emissary quilan was scanned several times on the way here ships dont let people aboard without inspecting them for anything that might be dangerous youre certain my dear ziller hes been transported by what are in effect three culture warships do you have any idea how nanoscopically fanatical those things can be about potentialharm hygiene what about his soulkeeper not scanned directly that would imply reading his mind which is terribly impolite ahha ahha what ziller is worried that the major might be here to kidnap or murder him that would be preposterous nevertheless ziller my dear friend please if that is what is preying on your mind have no fears kidnap is i cant tell you how unlikely murder no major quilan has brought nothing with him more harmful than a ceremonial dagger ah so i might be put to death ceremonially thats different lets meet up tomorrow we could go camping share a tent is he gay we could fuck im not but its been a while aside from hubs dreamhouris kabe stop laughing you ought not to encourage him ziller the dagger is a dagger no more not a knife missile then not a knife missile not even in disguise or memoryform it is simple solid steel and silver its little better than a letteropener really im sure if we asked him to leave it forget the stupid dagger maybe its a virus a disease or something hmm what do you mean hmm well our medicine effectively became perfect about eight thousand years ago and weve had all that time to get used to evaluating other species rapidly to develop a full understanding of their physiology so any ordinary disease even a new one is unable to establish a foothold thanks to the bodys own defences and will certainly be utterly helpless against external medical resources however somebody did once develop a genetic signaturekeyed brainrotting virus which worked so quickly it proved effective on more than one occasion five minutes after the assassin had sneezed in the same room as the intended victim their brainsand only theirswere turning to soup and so we look for that sort of thing and quilan is clean so theres nothing here but the pure cellular him apart from his soulkeeper well what about this soulkeeper its a simple soulkeeper as far as we can tell certainly its the same size and has a similar outward appearance a similar outward appearance as far as you can tell yes its and these people my homomdan friend have established a reputation for thoroughness throughout the galaxy incredible was it thoroughness i thought it was eccentricity well there you are ziller let me tell you a story oh must you it appears i must somebody once thought of a way they might outwit the security of contact serial numbers instead of ridiculous ship names no they thought they could smuggle a bomb aboard a gcu ive met one or two contact ships i confess the idea has occurred to me too the way they did it was to create a humanoid who appeared to have a form of bodily defect called hydrocephaly have you heard of such a condition water on the brain fluid fills the foetus head and the brain grows smeared in a thin layer round the inside of the adults skull not something you see in a developed society but they had a plausible excuse for this individual having it a milliners mascot a prophetsavant i was close the point was that this individual carried a small antimatter bomb in the centre of his skull oh wouldnt you hear it bumping around when he shook his head its containment vessel was tethered by atomic monofil and dont you see they thought that by hiding it inside his skull surrounded by his brain it would be safe from any culture scan because we famously do not look inside peoples heads so they were right it worked it blew the ship to smithereens and im supposed to feel reassured no i didnt really think so they were wrong the device was spotted and the ship sailed serenely on what happened it came loose he sneezed and out it embarrassingly popped a standard mind scan looks at something from hyperspace from the fourth dimension an impenetrable sphere looks like a circle locked rooms are fully accessible you or i would look flat to them flat hmm i have experienced certain critics who must have had access to hyperspace obviously i owe numerous apologies damn the ship did not read the unfortunate creatures brainsit had no need to scan at such detailbut it was as obvious that he was carrying a bomb as if hed balanced it on the top of his head i have the feeling this is all just a longwinded way of telling me not to worry if i have been longwinded i apologise i was seeking only to reassure you consider me reassured i no longer imagine that this piece of shit is here to assassinate me so youll see him absolutely no fucking way whatsoever all through with this niceness and negotiation stuff yeah like it offensive unit but of course had to be yeah your turn someone elses problem hmm hmm just hmm yeah well doesnt do it for me how about lacking that small match temperament bit obscure well ive just always liked it poke it with a stick ou gcu i said ive got a big stick sorry its called i said ive got a big stick you have to say it quietly when you write it its in small type an ou as you might imagine oh right probably my favourite i think thats just the best no not as good as hand me the gun and ask me again well thats okay but not as subtle well but less derivative on the other hand but whos counting yeah germane riposte we havent met but youre a great fan of mine oh yeah what no i just meant isnt this fun yes well im glad you finally agree what do you mean finally agree i mean finally agree that the names are worth mentioning in polite company what are you talking about i was quoting you ship names for years before you started noticing let me quote you one back all the same i saw it first what you heard ha well then ravished by the sheer implausibility of that last statement oh come on you have zero credibility and youre charming but irrational while youre demented but determined and you may not be the coolest person here youre making these up no im hold on sorry was that a ship name no but heres one youre talking lucid nonsense awkward customer thorough but unreliable advanced case of chronic patheticism another fine product from the nonsense factory conventional wisdom in one ear fine till you came along i blame the parents inappropriate response a momentary lapse of sanity lapsed pacifist reformed nice guy pride comes before a fall injury time now look what youve made me do kiss this then look if you two are going to fight do it outside is that one dont think so should be yeah hub ziller good evening are you enjoying yourself no how about you of course of course can real happiness be so foregone as that how depressing ziller i am a hub mind i have an entireand if i may say soquite fabulous orbital to look after not to mention having fifty billion people to tend to certainly i wasnt going to mention them right now im observing a fading supernova in a galaxy two and a half billion years away closer to home a thousand years off im watching a dying planet orbiting inside the atmosphere of a red giant sun as it spirals slowly down towards the core i can also watch the results of the planets destruction on the sun a thousand years later via hyperspace insystem im tracking millions of comets and asteroids and directing the orbits of tens of thousands of them some to use as raw material for plate landscaping some just to keep them out of the way next year im going to let a big comet come right through the orbital between the rim and the hub that should be pretty spectacular several hundred thousand smaller bodies are speeding towards us right now earmarked to provide an overthetop light show for the first night of your new orchestral work at the end of the twin novae period it was that at the same time of course im in simultaneous communication with hundreds of other minds thousands over the course of any given day ship minds of every type some approaching some just having left some old friends some sharing interests and fascinations similar to my own plus other orbitals and university sages amongst others i have eleven roving personality constructs each one flitting over time from place to place in the greater galaxy rooming with other minds in the processor substrates of gsvs and smaller vessels other orbitals eccentric and ulterior craft and with minds of various other types what they will be like and how these once identical siblings might change me when they return and we consider remerging i can only imagine and look forward to it all sounds while i am at the moment hosting no other minds i look forward to that as well fascinating now additionally subsystems like manufactury processoverseeing complexes keep up a constant and fascinating dialogue within the hour for example in a shipyard in a cavern under the buzuhn bulkhead range a new mind will be born to be emplaced within a gcv before the year is out no no keep going meanwhile via one of my planetary remotes im watching a pair of cyclonic systems collide on naratradjan prime and composing a glyph sequence on the effects of ultraviolent atmospheric phenomena on otherwise habitable ecospheres here on masaq im watching a series of avalanches in the pilthunguon mountains on hildri a tornado whirling across the shaban savannah on akroum a sworlisland calving in the picha sea a forest fire in molben a seiche bore funnelling up gradeens river a firework display above junzra city a wooden house frame being hoisted into place in a village in furl a quartet of lovers on a hilltop in youve made your ocutti then there are drones and other autonomous sentients able to communicate directly and at speed plus the implanted humans and other biologicals also able to converse immediately plus of course i have millions of avatars like this one the majority of them talking with and listening to people right now have you finished yes but even if all the other stuff seems a bit esoteric just think of all those other avatars at all those other gatherings concerts dances ceremonies parties and meals think of all that talk all those ideas all that sparkle and wit think of all that bullshit the nonsense and nonsequiturs the selfaggrandisement and selfdeception the boring stupid nonsense the pathetic attempts to impress or ingratiate the slowwittedness the incomprehension and the incomprehensible the glandaddled meanderings and general suffocating dullness that is the chaff ziller i ignore that i can respond politely and where necessary felicitously to the most intense bore forever without flagging and it costs me nothing its like ignoring all the boring bits in space between the neat stuff like planets and stars and ships and even thats not completely boring anyway i cannot tell you how glad i am that you live such a full life hub thank you may we talk about me for just a little while as long as you like a terrible terrible thought has just occurred to me what would that be the first night of expiring light ah you have a title for your new work yes ill let the relevant people know as well as the meteorite showers i mentioned earlier well have a conventional laser and firework show plus there will be troupe dancing and a holoimage interpretation yes yes im sure my music will provide suitable aural wallpaper for all this spectacle ziller i hope you know it will all be done with exquisite taste it will all fade for the end when the second nova ignites thats not what im worried about im sure it will all go splendidly then what youre going to invite that sonofapreybitch quilan arent you ah yes ah you are arent you i knew it i can just feel the tumorous pusbrain circling in i should never have said he could move to aquime dont know what i was thinking of i think it would be very bad form not to invite emissary quilan the concert will probably be the single most important cultural event on the whole orbital this year what do you mean probably all right definitely there has been a vast amount of interest even using the stullien bowl the number of people who are going to have to be disappointed in the matter of live tickets is going to be immense ive had to run competitions to make sure your keenest fans are there and then randomise almost all the rest of the distribution theres a good chance that nobody from the board will be able to make it to the event live unless some ingratiate gives up their seat the transmit audience over the whole o could be ten billion or more i personally have exactly three tickets at my disposal the allocation is so tight ill have to use one if i want one of my own avatars to attend so a perfect excuse for not inviting this quilan character you and he are the only two chelgrians here ziller you composed it and hes our honoured guest how can i not invite him because i wont go if he does thats why you mean you wont attend your own first night correct you wont conduct thats right but you always conduct the first nights performance not this time not if hes going to be there but you have to be there no i dont but wholl conduct it nobody these things dont really need conducting composers conduct to feed their own ego and to feel part of the performance rather than just the preparation thats not what you said before you said there were nuances that could not be programmed decisions that a conductor could make at the time on the night in response to the audiences ongoing reactions which required a single individual to collate analyse and react to functioning as a focal point for the distributed i was bullshitting you you seemed as sincere then as you do now its a gift the point is i wont conduct if this mercenary whoreboy is there i wont be anywhere near the place ill be at home or somewhere else that would be very embarrassing for all concerned so keep him away if you want me there how could i possibly do that you are a hub mind as youve recently explained in exhausting detail your resources are almost infinite why cant we just keep the two of you apart on the night because it wont happen an excuse will be found to bring us together an encounter will be manufactured what if i give you my word that i will make sure that quilan and you are never brought face to face he will be there but ill ensure that you are kept apart with one avatar have you put a sound field round us just round our heads yes this avatars lips will no longer move and its voice will alter slightly as a result dont be alarmed ill try to hold my terror in check go on if i really have to i can make sure there are several avatars there at the concert they dont always have to have silver skin you know and ill have drones present too big bulky drones better small mean ones no good no deal and knife missiles still no why not i do hope you are not going to say that you dont trust me my word is my word i never break it i do trust you the reason that its no deal is because of the people who would want this meeting to happen go on tersono contact grief special fucking circumstances for all i know hmm if they want the two of us to meeti mean really determinedly wantcould you definitely certainly stop it from happening hub your question could apply to any moment since quilans arrival yes but until now a seemingly chance meeting would have been too artificial too obviously contrived theyd have expected me to react badly and theyd have been absolutely right our meeting must look like fate like it was inevitable as though my music my talent my personality and very being have made it preordained you could always go and if youre forced to meet still react badly no i dont see why i should i dont want to meet him simple as that i give you my word i will do everything i can to make sure that you do not meet answer the question if sc were determined to force a meeting could you stop them no as i thought im not doing very well here am i no however there is one thing that might change my mind ah whats that look into the bastards mind i cant do that ziller why not it is one of the very few moreorless unbreakable rules of the culture nearly a law if we had laws it would be one of the first on the statute book only moreorless unbreakable it is done very very rarely and the result tends to be ostracism there was a ship called the grey area once it used to do that sort of thing it became known as the meatfucker as a result when you look up the catalogues thats the name its listed under with its original chosen name as a footnote to be denied your selfdesignated name is a unique insult in the culture ziller the vessel disappeared some time ago probably it killed itself arguably as a result of the shame attached to such behaviour and resulting disrespect all it is is looking inside an animal brain thats just it it is so easy and it would mean so little really that is why the notdoing of it is probably the most profound manner in which we honour our biological progenitors this prohibition is a mark of our respect and so i cannot do it you mean you wont do it they are almost the same thing you have the ability of course then do it why because i wont attend the concert otherwise i know that i mean what would i be looking for the real reason hes here you really imagine he might be here to harm you its a possibility what would stop me saying i would do this thing and then only pretending to do it i could tell you i had looked and found nothing id ask you to give your word you would really do it have you not heard of the idea that a promise made under duress does not count yes you know you could have said nothing there i wouldnt want to deceive you ziller that too would be dishonourable then it sounds like im not going to that concert i will still hope that you might and work towards it never mind you could always hold another competition the winner gets to conduct let me think about this ill release the sound field lets watch the dune riders the avatar and the chelgrian turned from facing each other to stand with the others by the parapet of the trundling feast halls viewing platform it was night and cloudy knowing the weather would be so people had come to the dune slides of efilziveizregneant to watch the biolume boarding the dunes were not normal dunes they were titanic spills of sand forming a threekilometrehigh slope from one plate to another marking where the sands from one of the great rivers sandbank spurnings were blown across towards the plates spinward edge to slip down to the desert regions of the sunken continent below people ran rolled boarded skid skiffed or boated down the dunes all the time but on a dark night there was something special to be seen tiny creatures lived in the sands arid cousins of the plankton that created bioluminescence at sea and when it was very dark you could see the tracks left by people as they tumbled twisted or carved their way down the vast slope it had become a tradition that on such nights the freeform chaos of individuals pleasing only themselves and the occasional watching admirer was turned into something more organised and soonce it was dark enough and sufficient numbers of spectators had turned up on the crawlermounted viewing platforms bars and restaurantsteams of boarders and skiers set off from the top of the dunes in choreographed waves triggering sandslip cascades in broad lines and vees of scintillating light descending like slow ghostly surf and weaving gently sparkling trails of soft blue green and crimson tracks across the sighing sands myriad necklaces of enchanted dust glowing like linear galaxies in the night ziller watched for a while then he sighed and said hes here isnt he a kilometre away the avatar replied higher up on the other side of the run im monitoring the situation another one of me is with him you are quite safe this is as close as i ever want to get to him unless you can do something i understand a defeat of echoes so unterritorial i suppose when you have this much territory you can afford to be do you think im oldfashioned to be disturbed by it no i think its quite natural they have too much of everything with the possible exception of suspicion we cant be sure of that i know still so far so good quilan closed the lockless door to his apartment he turned and looked out at the floor of the gallery thirty metres below groups of humans strolled amongst the plants and pools between the stalls and bars the restaurants andwell shops exhibitions it was hard to know what to call them the apartment they had given him was near the roof level of one of aquime citys central galleries one set of rooms looked out across the city to the inland sea the other side of the suite like this glazed lobby outside looked down into the gallery itself aquimes altitude and consequently cold winters meant that a lot of the life of the city took place indoors rather than out and as a result what would have been ordinary streets in a more temperate city open to the sky here were galleries roofedover streets vaulted with anything from antique glass to force fields it was possible to walk from one end of the city to the other under cover and wearing summer clothes even when as now there was a blizzard blowing free of the driving snow that was bringing visibility down to a few metres the view from the apartments exterior was delicately impressive the city had been built in a deliberately archaic style mostly from stone the buildings were red and blonde and grey and pink and the slates covering the steeply pitched roofs were various shades of green and blue long tapering fingers of forest penetrated the city almost to its heart bringing further greens and blues into play andwith the galleriesdicing the city into irregular blocks and shapes a few kilometres in the distance the docks and canals would glitter under a morning sun spinward of those on a gentle slope of ridge rising to the outskirts of the city quilan could when it was clear see the tall buttresses and towers of the ornately decorated apartment building which contained the home of mahrai ziller so could we just go and walk into his apartment no he got somebody to make him locks when he heard i was coming apparently this was mildly scandalous well we could have locks too i think it better not to thought you might we wouldnt want it to look like i have something to hide that would never do quilan swung open a window letting the sounds of the gallery into the apartment he heard tinkling water people talking and laughing birdsong and music he watched drones and people in float harnesses waft by beneath him but above the other humans saw people in an apartment on the other side of the gallery wavehe waved back almost without thinkingand smelled perfumes and the scent of cooking he looked up at the roof which was not glass but some other more perfectly transparent materialhe supposed he could have asked his little penterminal to find out exactly what it was but he had not botheredand he listened in vain for any sound of the storm swirling and blowing outside they do love their little insulated existence dont they yes they do he remembered a gallery not so dissimilar to this in shaunesta on chel it was before they had married about a year after they had met they had been walking handinhand and had stopped to look in a jewellers window he had gazed in casually enough at all the finery and wondered if he might buy something for her then hed heard her making this little noise a sort of appreciative but barely audible mmm mmm mmm mmm at first hed assumed she was making the noise for his amusement it had taken him a few moments to realise that not only was she not doing that but she was not aware that she was making the noise at all he realised this and suddenly felt as though his heart would burst with joy and love he turned swept her into his arms and hugged her laughing at the surprised confused blinkingly happy look on her face quil sorry yes somebody laughed on the gallery floor below a high throaty female laugh unrestrained and pure he heard it echo round the hard surfaces of the closedin street remembering a place where there were no echoes at all theyd got drunk the night before they left estodien visquile with his extended entourage including the bulky whitefurred eweirl and he he had to be helped from his bed the next morning by a laughing eweirl a drenching under a cold shower just about brought him round then he was taken straight to the vtol then to the field with the suborbital then to equator launch city where a commercial flight hoisted them to a small orbiter a demilled exnavy privateer was waiting theyd left the system headed for deep space before his hangover started to abate and he realised that he had been selected as the one to do whatever it was he had to do and remembered what had happened the night before they were in an old mess hall decorated in an antique style with the heads of various prey animals adorning three of the walls the fourth wall of glass doors opened onto a narrow terrace which looked out to sea there was a warm wind blowing and the doors were all opened bringing the smell of the ocean into the bar two blinded invisible servants dressed in white trousers and jackets attended them bringing the various strengths of fermented and distilled liquors a traditional drinking binge required the food was sparse and salty again as dictated by tradition toasts were proposed drinking games indulged in and eweirl and another of the party who seemed nearly as well built as the whitefurred male balanced their way along the wall of the terrace from one end to the other with the twohundredmetre drop to one side the other male went first eweirl went one better by stopping halfway along and downing a cup of spirit quilan drank the minimum required wondering quite what it was all in aid of and suspecting that even this apparent celebration was part of a test he tried not to be too much of a wet blanket and joined in several of the drinking games with a forced heartiness he thought must easily be seen through the night wore on gradually people went off to their curlpads after a while only visquile eweirl and he were left served by the larger of the two invisibles a male even bulkier than eweirl who manoeuvred his way amongst the tables with surprising adroitness his greenbanded head swinging this way and that and his white clothes making him look like a ghost in the dim light eweirl tripped him up a couple of times on the second occasion causing him to drop a tray of glasses when this happened eweirl put his head back and laughed loudly visquile looked on like the indulgent parent of a spoiled child the big servant apologised and felt his way to the bar to bring back a dustpan and broom eweirl sank another cup of spirit and watched the servant lift a table out of the way onehanded he challenged him to an armwrestling contest the invisible declined so eweirl ordered him to take part which eventually he did and won eweirl was left panting with exertion the big invisible put his jacket back on inclined his greenbanded head and resumed his duties quilan was slumped in his curlseat watching events with one eye closed eweirl did not look happy that the servant had won the contest he drank some more estodien visquile who did not seem very drunk at all asked quilan some questions about his wife his military career his family and his beliefs quilan remembered trying not to appear evasive eweirl watched the big invisible go about his duties his whitefurred body looking tensed and coiled they might find the ship yet quil the estodien told him there may still be wreckage the culture their consciences helping us look for the lost ships it might turn up yet not her of course she is quite lost the gonebefore say there is no sign no hint of her soulkeeper having worked but we might yet find the ship and know more of what happened it doesnt matter he said she is dead thats all that matters nothing else i dont care about anything else not even your own survival after death quilan the estodien asked that least of all i dont want to survive i want to die i want to be as she is no more nothing more ever again the estodien nodded silently his eyelids drooping a small smile playing across his face he glanced at eweirl quilan looked too the whitefurred male had quietly changed seats he waited until the big invisible was approaching then stood up suddenly in his path the servant collided with him spilling three cups of spirit over eweirls waistcoat you clumsy fuck cant you see where youre going im sorry sir i didnt know youd moved the servant offered eweirl a cloth from his waistband eweirl knocked it away i dont want your rag he screamed i said cant you see where youre going he picked at the lower edge of the green band covering the other males eyes the big invisible flinched instinctively pulling back eweirl had hooked a leg behind him he stumbled and fell and eweirl went down with him in a flurry of crashing glasses and tumbling chairs eweirl staggered to his feet and jerked the big male after him attack me would you attack me would you he yelled he had pulled the servants jacket down across his shoulders and over his arms so that he was half helpless though the servant anyway did not seem to be putting up any fight he stood impassively as eweirl screamed at him quilan didnt like this he looked at visquile but the estodien was looking on tolerantly quilan pushed himself up from the table they were curled at the estodien put a hand on his arm but he pulled it away traitor eweirl bellowed at the invisible spy he pulled the servant round and pushed him this way and that the big male crashed into tables and chairs staggering and nearly falling unable to save himself with his trapped arms each time using what leverage he had from his midlimb to fend off the unseen obstacles quilan started to make his way round the table he tripped over a chair and had to fall across the table to avoid hitting the floor eweirl was spinning and pushing the invisible trying to disorient him or make him dizzy as well as get him to fall over right he shouted in the servants ear im taking you to the cells quilan pushed himself away from the table eweirl held the servant before him and started marching not to the double doors which led from the bar but towards the terrace doors the servant went uncomplainingly at first then must have regained his sense of direction or maybe just smelled or heard the sea and felt the open air on his fur because he pushed back and started to say something in protest quilan was trying to get in front of eweirl and the invisible to intercept them he was a few metres to the side now feeling his way round the tables and chairs eweirl reached up with one hand pulled the green eyeband downso that for an instant quilan could see the invisibles two empty socketsand forced it over the servants mouth then he whipped the other males legs from under him and while he was still trying to stagger back to his feet ran him out across the terrace to the wall and upended the invisible over the top and into the night he stood there breathing heavily as quilan came stumbling up to his side they both looked over there was a dim white ruff of surf round the base of the seastack after a moment quilan could see the pale shape of the tiny falling figure outlined against the dark sea after a moment more the faint sound of a scream floated up to them the white figure joined the surf with no visible splash and the scream stopped a few moments later clumsy eweirl said he wiped some spittle from around his mouth he smiled at quilan then looked troubled and shook his head tragic he said high spirits he put one hand on quilans shoulder high jinks eh he reached out and brought quilan into a hug pressing him hard into his chest quilan tried to push away but the other male was too strong they swayed close to the wall and the drop the other males lips were at his ear do you think he wanted to die quil hmm quilan hmm do you think he wanted to die do you i dont know quilan mumbled finally being allowed to use his midlimb to push himself away he stood looking up at the whitefurred male he felt more sober now he was half terrified half careless i know you killed him he said and immediately thought that he might die too now he thought about taking up the classical defensive position but didnt eweirl smiled and looked back at visquile who still sat where he had been throughout tragic accident eweirl said the estodien spread his hands eweirl held onto the wall to stop himself swaying and waved at quilan tragic accident quilan felt suddenly dizzy and sat down the view started to disappear at the edges leaving us too he heard eweirl inquire then nothing till the morning you chose me then you chose yourself major he and visquile sat in the privateers lounge area along with eweirl they were the only people aboard the ship had its own ai albeit an uncommunicative one visquile claimed not to know the crafts orders or its destination quilan drank slowly a restorative laced with antihangover chemicals it was working though it might have worked more quickly and what eweirl did to the blinded invisible visquile shrugged what happened was unfortunate these accidents happen when people drink freely it was murder estodien that would be impossible to prove major personally i was like the unfortunate concerned unsighted at the time he smiled then the smile faded besides major i think youll find calledtoarms eweirl has a certain latitude in such matters he reached out and patted quilans hand you must not concern yourself with the unhappy incident any further quilan spent a lot of time in the ships gym eweirl did too though they exchanged few words quilan had little he wanted to say to the other male and eweirl didnt seem to care they worked and hauled and pulled and ran and sweated and panted and dustbathed and showered alongside each other but barely acknowledged the others presence eweirl wore earplugs and a visor and sometimes laughed as he exercised or made growling appreciative noises quilan ignored him he was brushing the dustbath off one day when a bead of sweat dropped from his face and spotted in the dust like a globule of dirty mercury rolling into the hollow by his feet they had mated once in a dustbath on their honeymoon a droplet of her sweet sweat had fallen into the grey fines just so rolling with a fluid silky grace down the soft indentation they had created he was suddenly aware he had made a keening moaning noise he looked out at eweirl in the main body of the gym hoping he would not have heard but the whitefurred male had taken his plugs and visor off and was looking at him grinning the privateer rendezvoused with something after five days travel the ship went very quiet and moved oddly as though it was on solid ground but being slid around from side to side there were thudding noises then hisses then most of the remaining noise of the craft died quilan sat in his little cabin and tried accessing the exterior views on his screens nothing he tried the navigation information but that had been closed off too he had never before lamented the fact that ships had no windows or portholes he found visquile on the ships small and elegantly spare bridge taking a data clip from the crafts manual controls and slipping it into his robes the few data screens still live on the bridge winked out estodien quilan asked major visquile said he patted quilan on the elbow were hitching a ride he held up a hand as quilan opened his mouth to ask where to its best if you dont ask with whom or to where major because im not able to tell you he smiled just pretend were still under way using our own power thats easiest you neednt worry were very secure in here very secure indeed he touched midlimb to midlimb see you at dinner another twenty days passed he became even fitter he studied ancient histories of the involveds then one day he woke and the ship was suddenly loud about him he turned on the cabin screen and saw space ahead the navigation screens were still unavailable but he looked all about the ships exterior views through the different sensors and viewing angles and didnt recognise anything until he saw a fuzzy y shape and knew they were somewhere on the outskirts of the galaxy near the clouds whatever had brought them here in only twenty days must be much faster than their own ships he wondered about that the privateer craft was held in a bubble of vacuum within a vast bluegreen space a wobbling limb of atmosphere three metres in diameter flowed slowly out to meet with their outer airlock on the far side of the tube floated something like a small airship the air was briefly cold as they walked through turning gradually warmer as they approached the airship the atmosphere felt thick underneath their feet the tunnel of air seemed as pliantly firm as wood he carried his own modest luggage eweirl toted two immense kit bags as though they were purses and visquile was followed by a civilian drone carrying his bags the airship was about forty metres long a single giant ellipsoid in dark purple its smoothlooking envelope of skin lined with long yellow strakes of frill which rippled slowly in the warm air like the mantle of a fish the tube led the three chelgrians to a small gondola slung underneath the vessel the gondola looked like something grown rather than constructed like the hollowedout husk of an immense fruit it appeared to have no windows until they climbed aboard making the ship tip gently but gauzy panels let in light and made the smooth interior glow with a pastelgreen light it held them comfortably the tube of air dissipated behind them as the gondolas door irised shut eweirl popped his earplugs in and put on his visor sitting back seemingly oblivious visquile sat with his silvery stave planted between his feet the round top under his chin gazing ahead through one of the gauzy windows quilan had only the vaguest idea where he was he had seen the gigantic slowly revolving elongated shaped object ahead of them for several hours before theyd rendezvoused the privateer ship had closed very slowly seemingly on emergency thrust alone and the thingthe world as he was now starting to think of it having come to a rough estimate of its sizehad just kept getting bigger and bigger and rilling more and more of the view ahead yet without betraying any detail finally one of the bodys lobes had blotted out the view of the other and it was as though they were approaching an immense planet of glowing bluegreen water what looked like five small suns were visible revolving with the vast shape though they seemed too small to be stars their positioning implied there would be another two hidden behind the world as they got very close matching rotational speed with the world and coming near enough to see the forming indentation they were heading for with the tiny purple dot immediately behind it quilan saw what looked like layers of clouds just hinted at inside what is this place quilan said not trying to keep the wonder and awe out of his voice they call them airspheres visquile said he looked warily pleased and not especially impressed this is a rotating twinlobe example its name is the oskendari airsphere the airship dipped diving still deeper into the thick air they passed through one level of thin clouds like islands floating on an invisible sea the airship wobbled as it went through the layer quilan craned his neck to see the clouds lit from underneath by a sun far beneath them he experienced a sudden sense of disorientation below something appearing out of the haze caught his eye a vast shape just one shade darker than the blueness all around as the airship approached he saw the immense shadow the shape cast stretching upwards into the haze again something like vertigo struck him hed been given a visor too he put it on and magnified the view the blue shape disappeared in a shimmer of heat he took the visor off and used his naked eyes a dirigible behemothaur visquile said eweirl suddenly back with them took off his visor and shifted over to quilans side of the gondola to look imbalancing the airship for a moment the shape below looked a little like a flattened and more complicated version of the craft they were in smaller shapes some like other airships some winged flew lazily about it quilan watched the smaller features of the creature emerge as they dropped down towards it the behemothaurs envelope skin was blue and purple and it too possessed long lines of pale yellowgreen frills which rippled along its length seemingly propelling it giant fins protruded vertically and laterally topped with long bulbous protrusions like the wingtip fuel tanks of ancient aircraft across its summit line and along its sides great scalloped darkred ridges ran like three enormous encasing spines other protrusions bulbs and hummocks covered its top and sides producing a generally symmetrical effect that only broke down at a more detailed level as they drew still closer quilan had to press himself against the frame of the little airships gondola window to see both ends of the giant below them the creature must be five kilometres long perhaps more this is one of their domains the estodien went on they have seven or eight others distributed round the outskirts of the galaxy no one is entirely sure quite how many there are the behemothaurs are as big as mountains and as old as the hills they are sentient allegedly the remnant of a species or civilisation which sublimed more than a billion years ago though again only by repute this one is called the sansemin it is in the power of those who are our allies in this matter quilan looked inquiringly at the older male visquile still hunched over holding his glittering stave made a shrugging motion youll meet them or their representatives major but you wont know who they are quilan nodded and went back to looking out the window he considered asking why they had come to this place but thought the better of it how long will we be here estodien he asked instead for a while visquile said smiling he watched quilans face for a moment then said perhaps two or three moons major we wont be alone there are already chelgrians here a group of about twenty monks of the abremile order they inhabit the temple ship soulhaven which is inside the creature well most of it is as i understand it only the fuselage and life support units of the temple ship are actually present the vessel had to leave its drive units behind somewhere outside in space he waved one hand the behemothaurs are sensitive to forcefield technologies were told the superior of the temple ship was tall and elegant and dressed in a graceful interpretation of the orders simple robes he met them on a broad landing platform at the rear of what looked like a giant gnarled hollowedout fruit stuck onto the behemothaurs skin they stepped from the airship estodien visquile estodien quetter visquile made the introductions quetter bowed fractionally to eweirl and quilan this way he said indicating a cleft in the behemothaurs skin eighty metres along a gently sloping tunnel floored with something like soft wood they came to a giant ribbed chamber whose atmosphere was oppressively humid and suffused with a vaguely charnel smell the temple ship soulhaven was a dark cylinder ninety metres in length and thirty across taking up about half of the damp warm chamber it appeared to be tethered by vines to the chambers walls and what looked like creepers had grown over much of its hull quilan had over the years of his soldiering become used to encountering makeshift camps temporary command posts recently requisitioned command hqs and so on some part of him took in the feel of the placethe extemporised organisation the mix of clutter and orderlinessand decided that the soulhaven had been here for about a month a pair of large drones each the shape of two fat cones set base to base floated up to them in the dimness humming gently visquile and quetter both bowed the two floating machines tipped briefly towards them you are quilan said one he could not tell which yes he said both machines floated very close to him he felt the fur around his face stand on end and smelled something he could not identify a breeze blew round his feet quilan mission great service here to prepare test later to die afraid he was aware that he had flinched backwards and had almost taken a step away there had been no sound just the words ringing in his head was he being spoken to by the gonebefore afraid the voice said in his head once more no he said not afraid not of death correct death nothing the two machines withdrew to where they had hovered before welcome all soon prepare quilan sensed both visquile and eweirl rock back as if caught in a sudden gust of wind though the other estodien quetter did not budge the two machines made the tipping motion again apparently they were dismissed they returned down the tunnel to the outside their own quarters were mercifully here on the exterior of the giant creature in the giant hollowedout bulb they had landed near the air was still cloyingly humid and thick but if it smelled of anything it smelled of vegetation and so seemed fresh in comparison to the chamber where the soulhaven rested their luggage had already been offloaded once they had settled they were taken on a tour of the behemothaurs exterior by the same small airship theyd arrived on anur a gangly awkwardlooking young male who was the soulhavens most junior monk escorted them explaining something of airspheres legendary history and hypothesised ecology we think there are thousands of the behemothaurs he said as they slid under the bulging belly of the creature beneath hanging jungles of skin foliage and almost a hundred megalithine and gigalithine globular entities theyre even bigger the biggest are the size of small continents people are even less sure whether theyre sentient or not we shouldnt see any of those or the other behemothaurs because were so low in the lobe they pretty well never descend this far buoyancy problems how does the sansemin manage to stay down here quilan asked the young monk looked at visquile before answering its been modified he said he pointed up at a dozen or so dangling pods large enough to contain two fullgrown chelgrians here you can see some of the subsidiary fauna being grown these will become raptor scouts when they bud and hatch quilan and the two estodiens sat with bowed heads in the innermost recessional space of the soulhaven a nearly spherical cavity only a few metres in diameter and surrounded by twometrethick walls made from substrates holding millions of departed chelgrian souls the three males were arranged in a triangle facing inwards furnaked it was the evening of the day they had arrived by the time the soulhaven kept to quilan it felt like the middle of the night outside it would be the same eternal but ever changing day as it had been for a billion and a half years or more the two estodiens had communicated with the chelgrianpuen and their onboard shades for a few moments without quilan being involved though even so he had experienced a sort of incoherent backwash from their conversations while theyd lasted it had been like standing in a great cavern and hearing people talking somewhere in the distance then it was his turn the voice was loud a shout in his head quilan we are chelgrianpuen they had told him to try to think his answers to subvocalise he thought i am honoured to speak to you you reason here i dont know i am being trained i think you might know more about my mission than i do correct given present knowledge willing i will do what is required means your death i realise that means heaven for many that is a trade i am willing to make not worosei quilan i know questions may i ask whatever i like yes all right why am i here to be trained but why particularly this place security prophylactic measure deniability danger insistence of allies in this who are our allies other questions what am i to do at the end of my training kill who many other questions where will i be sent distant not chelgrian sphere does my mission involve the composer mahrai ziller yes am i to kill him if so refuse i havent said that qualms if it was to be so i would like to know the reasoning if no reasons given refuse i dont know there are some decisions you just cant anticipate until you must really make them youre not going to tell me whether my mission involves killing him or not correct clarification in time before mission begins preparation and training first how long will i be here other questions what did you mean by danger earlier preparation and training other questions no thank you we would read you what do you mean look in your mind you want to look into my mind correct now yes very well do i have to do anything he was briefly dizzy and was aware of swaying in his seat done unharmed i think so clear you mean i am clear correct tomorrow preparation and training the two estodiens sat smiling at him he could only sleep fitfully and woke from another dream of drowning to blink into the strange thick darkness he fumbled for his visor and with the greyblue image of the small rooms curved walls before him rose from the curlpad and went to stand by the single window where a warm breeze trickled slowly in and then seemed to die as though exhausted by the effort the visor showed a ghostly image of the windows rough frame and outside the vaguest hint of clouds he took off the visor the darkness appeared utter and he stood there letting it soak into him until he thought he saw a flash somewhere high above and blue with distance he wondered if it was lightning anur had said it happened between cloud and air masses when they passed each other rising and falling along the thermal gradients of the spheres chaotic atmospheric circulation he saw a few more flashes one of them of an appreciable length although still seeming far far away he slipped the visor back on and held his hand up with claws extended bringing two tips almost together just a couple of millimetres apart there the flash had been that long another flash seen with the visors it was so bright the visors optics turned the centre of the tiny flash black to protect his night vision instead of just the minuscule spark itself he saw the whole of a cloud system light up as well the rolls and towers of the piled and distant vapour picked out in a remote blue wash of luminescence that vanished almost as soon as he became aware of it he took the visor off again and listened for the noise produced by those flashes all he heard was a faint enveloping noise like a strong wind heard from far away seeming to come from all around him and course up through his bones it appeared to contain within it frequencies deep enough to be distant rumbles of thunder but they were low and continuous and unwavering and try as he might he could not detect any change or peak in that long slow flow of halffelt sound there are no echoes here he thought no solid ground or cliffs anywhere for sound to reflect off the behemothaurs absorb sound like floating forests and inside them their living tissues soak up all noise acoustically dead the phrase came back to him worosei had done some work with the university music department and had shown him a strange room lined with foam pyramids acoustically dead shed told him it felt and sounded true their voices seemed to die as each word left their lips every sound exposed and alone without resonance your soulkeeper is more than a normal soulkeeper quilan visquile told him they were alone in the innermost recessional space of the soulhaven the following day this was his first briefing it performs the normal functions of such a device keeping a record of your mindstate however it also has the capacity to carry another mindstate within it you will in a sense have another person aboard when you undertake your mission there is still more to come but do you have anything you would like to say or ask about that who will this person be estodien we are not certain yet ideallyaccording to the missionprofiling people in intelligence or rather according to their machinesit would be a copy of sholan hadesh huyler the late admiralgeneral who was amongst those souls you were charged with recovering from the military institute on aorme however as the winter storm is lost presumed destroyed and the original substrate was aboard the vessel we will probably have to go with a second choice that choice is still being discussed why is this considered necessary estodien think of it as having a copilot aboard major you will have somebody to talk to somebody to advise you to talk things over with while you are on your mission this may not seem necessary now but there is a reason we believe it may be advisable do i take it that it will be a long mission yes it may take several months the minimum duration would be about thirty days we cant be any more precise because it depends partly on your mode of transport you may be taken to your destination aboard one of our own craft or on a faster vessel from one of the older involved civilisations possibly one belonging to the culture does the mission involve the culture estodien it does you are being sent to the culture world masaq an orbital that is where mahrai ziller lives correct am i to kill him that is not your mission your covering story is that you are going there to try to convince him to return to chel and my real mission we will come to that in due course and therein lies a precedent a precedent estodien your true mission will not be clear to you when you start it you will know the covering story and you will almost certainly have a feeling that there is more to your task than that but you will not know what it is so am i to be given something like sealed orders estodien something like that but those orders will be locked inside your own mind your memory of this timeprobably from some time just after the war to the end of your training herewill only gradually come back to you as you near the completion of your mission by the time you recall this conversationat the end of which you will know what your mission really is though not yet exactly how you will accomplish ityou should be quite close though not in exactly the correct position can memory be dripfed so accurately estodien it can though the experience may be a little disorienting and that is the most important reason for giving you your copilot the reason we are doing this is specifically because the mission involves the culture we are told that they never read peoples minds that the inside of your head is the one place they regard as sacrosanct you have heard this yes we believe that this is probably true but your mission is of sufficient importance for us to take precautions in case it is not we imagine that if they do read minds the most likely time this will happen will be when the subject concerned boards one of their ships especially one of their warships if we are able to arrange that you are taken to masaq on such a vessel and it does look inside your head all it will find even at quite a deep level is your innocent covering story we believe and have verified through experiments that such a scanning process could be carried out without your knowledge to go any deeper to discover the memories we will initially hide even from you this scanning process will have to reveal itself you will be aware that it is taking place or at the very least you will know that it has taken place if that should happen major your mission will end early you will die quilan nodded thinking estodien has any sort of experiment been carried out on me yet i mean have i already lost any memories whether i agreed to such a thing or not no the experiments i mentioned were carried out on others we are very confident that we know what we are doing major so the deeper i go into my mission the more ill know about it correct and the personality the copilot will it know everything from the start it will and it cannot be read by a culture scan it can but it would require a deeper and more detailed reading than that required for a biological brain your soulkeeper will be like your citadel quilan your own brain is the curtain wall if the citadel has fallen the walls are either long since stormed or irrelevant now as i said there is more to tell about your soulkeeper it contains or will contain a small payload and what is commonly known as a matter transmitter apparently it does not really transmit matter but it has the same effect i freely confess the importance of the distinction escapes me and this is in something the size of a soulkeeper yes is this our own technology estodien that is not something that you need to know major all that matters is whether it works or not visquile hesitated then said our own scientists and technologists make and apply astonishing new discoveries all the time as im sure you are aware of course estodien what would the payload you mentioned be you may never know that major at the moment i myself do not know exactly what it is either though i will be told in due course before your mission properly begins at the moment all i know is something of the effect it will have and that would be what estodien as you might imagine a degree of damage of destruction quilan was silent for a few moments he was aware of the presence of the millions of gonebefore personalities stored in the substrates around him am i to understand that the payload will be transmitted into my soulkeeper no it was put in place along with the soulkeeper device so it will be transmitted from the device yes you will control the transmission of the payload i will that is what you are here to be trained for major you will be instructed in the use of the device so that when the time comes you are able to transmit the payload into the desired location quilan blinked a few times i may have fallen a little behind with recent advances in technology but i would forget about that major previously existing technologies are of little importance in this matter this is new there is no precedent that we know of for this sort of process no book to refer to you will be helping to write that book i see let me tell you more about the culture world masaq the estodien gathered his robes about him and settled himself further into the cramped curlpad it is what they call an orbital a band of matter in the shape of a very thin bracelet orbiting round a sunin this case the star lacelerein the same zone one would expect to find an habitable planet orbitals are on a different scale from our own space habitats masaq like most culture orbitals has a diameter of approximately three million kilometres and therefore a circumference of nearly ten million kilometres its width at the foot of its containing walls is about six thousand kilometres those walls are about a thousand kilometres high and open at the top the atmosphere is held in by the apparent gravity created by the worlds spin the size of the structure is not arbitrary culture orbitals are built so that the same speed of revolution which produces one standard gravity also creates a daynight cycle of one of their standard days local night is produced when any given part of the orbitals interior is facing directly away from the sun they are made from exotic materials and held together principally by force fields floating in space in the centre of the orbital equidistant from all places on its rim is the hub this is where the ai substrate that the culture calls a mind exists the machine oversees all aspects of the orbitals running there are thousands of subsidiary systems tasked with overseeing all but the most critical procedures but the hub can assume direct control of any and all of them at the same time the hub has millions of humanform representative entities called avatars with which it deals on a onetoone basis with its inhabitants it is theoretically capable of running each of those and every other system on the orbital directly while communicating individually with every human and drone present on the world plus a number of other ships and minds each orbital is different and each hub has its own personality some orbitals have only a few components of land these are usually square parcels of ground and sea called plates on an orbital as broad as masaq these are normally synonymous with continents before an orbital is finished in the sense of forming a closed loop like masaq they can be as small as two plates still three million kilometres apart but joined only by force fields such an orbital might have a total population of just ten million humans masaq is towards the other end of the scale with over fifty billion people masaq is known for the high rate of backup of its inhabitants this is sometimes held to be because a lot of them take part in dangerous sports but really the practice dates from the worlds inception when it was realised that lacelere is not a perfectly stable star and that there is a chance that it could flare with sufficient violence to kill people exposed on the surface of the world mahrai ziller has lived there for the last seven years he appears to be content to remain on the world as i say you will seemingly be going there to attempt to persuade him to renounce his exile and return to chel i see whereas your real mission is to facilitate the destruction of masaq hub and so cause the deaths of a significant proportion of its inhabitants the avatar was going to show him round one of the manufactories beneath a bulkhead range they were in an underground car a comfortably fittedout capsule which sped beneath the underside of the orbitals surface in the vacuum of space they had swung half a million kilometres round the world with the stars shining through panels in the floor the underground car line spanned the gap beneath the gigantic ashape of the bulkhead range on a monofilsupported slingbridge two thousand kilometres long now the car was hurtling to a stop near the centre to ascend vertically into the factory space hundreds of kilometres above you all right major fine you the same mission target just come through yes how am i doing youre fine no obvious physical signs you sure youre all right perfectly and were still go status yes were still go the silverskinned avatar turned to look at him youre sure you wont be bored seeing a factory major not one producing starships not at all though you must be running out of places to distract me with he said well its a big orbital theres one place i would like to see wheres that your place the hub the avatar smiled why certainly flight are we nearly there yet uncertain that which the creature said it meant never mind that are we there yet this is hard to know with certitude to return to that which the creature said is its meaning yet known to you yes well sort of please can we go any faster not really we proceed as fast as is possible given the circumstances and therefore i thought our time might be employed by the telling of that which you understand from the creatures sayings what would you then say was the import of such it doesnt matter well it does but just oh hurry faster go faster they were inside the dirigible behemothaur sansemin uagen zlepe praf and three of the raptor scouts they were squeezing their way down a sinuous undulating tube whose warm slimeslick walls pulsed alarmingly every few moments the air moving past them from ahead stank of rotting meat uagen fought the urge to gag they could not go back to the outside the way they had come it had been blocked off by some sort of rupture which had trapped and suffocated two of the raptor scouts whod gone ahead of them instead they hadafter the creature had said what it had to uagen and after an agonisingly long and absurdly relaxed discussion amongst the raptor scouts and praftaken another route out of the interrogatory chamber this route initially led deeper and further into the quivering body of the dying behemothaur two of the three raptor scouts insisted on going ahead in case of trouble but they were squeezing their way through the convolutions of the twisting passage with some difficulty and uagen was convinced that he could have gone quicker by himself the passage was deeply ribbed underfoot making it hard to walk without supporting oneself on the wet and quivering walls uagen wished hed brought gloves his partial ir sense could make out little detail here because everything seemed to be the same temperature reducing all he could see to a nightmarish monochrome of shadows upon shadows it was uagen thought worse than being blind the raptor scout in the lead came to a fork in the passage and stopped apparently thinking there was a sudden concussive thud from all around them then a pulse of fetid air swirled over them from behind momentarily overcoming the flow of air from ahead and producing a still greater stench that very nearly made uagen throw up he heard himself yelp what was that this is unknown the interpreter praf told him the head wind resumed the leading raptor scout chose the lower lefthand passage and shouldered its wings down the narrow cleft that way praf said helpfully im going to die uagen thought quite clearly and almost calmly im going to die stuck inside this rotting bloating incinerating tenmillionyearold alien airship a thousand light years from another human being and with information that might save lives and make me a hero life is so unfair the creature on the wall in the interrogatory chamber had lived just long enough to tell him something which also might kill him of course if it was true and even if he did get out of here from what it had said the knowledge he now possessed made him a target for people who wouldnt think twice about killing him or anybody else youre culture he said to the long fivelimbed thing hanging on the wall in the chamber yes it said trying to keep its head up as it talked to him agent special circumstances uagen felt himself go gulp again hed heard of sc hed dreamt about being a special circumstances agent when hed been a child dammit hed dreamt about being one when hed been a young adult hed never really imagined hed meet a real one oh he said feeling infinitely foolish even as he said how do you do you the creature said what oh umm scholar uagen zlepe scholar pleased to well probably not umm i just well he was fingering the necklace again it must sound like he was twittering doesnt matter can we get you down from there this whole place well thing is ha no dont think so the creature said and might even have been trying to smile it made a gesture with its head like a backward nod then grimaced with pain hate to tell you only me holding this together such as it is through this link it shook its head listen uagen you have to get out yes at least that was good news the chamber floor wobbled underfoot as another rumbling detonation shook the puppetlike shapes of the dead and dying attached to the wall one of the raptor scouts jerked its wings out to steady itself and knocked praf over she made a clicking noise with her beak and glared at the offending beast you have communicator the creature asked him signal outside the airsphere no nothing the creature grimaced again fuck then have to get away from oskendari to ship habitat anywhere somewhere you can contact culture understand yes why to say what plot not a joke uagen not a drill plot serious fucking plot think its to destroy orbital what orbital full orbital called masaq heard of yes its famous they want to destroy it chelgrian faction chelgrian being sent dont know name doesnt matter on his way or will be soon dont know when attack happens you get out get away tell culture the creature suddenly stiffened and bowed out from the wall of the chamber its eyes closing a tremendous shudder whipped through the cavity tearing a couple of the dead bodies from the chambers walls to send them falling limply to the quaking floor uagen and two of the raptor scouts were thrown onto their backs uagen struggled back to his feet the creature on the wall was staring at him uagen tell sc or contact my name is gidin sumethyre sumethyre got that got it gidin sumethyre umm that all enough now get away masaq orbital chelgrian gidin sumethyre thats all out now ill try and hold this the creatures head dropped slowly to rest on its chest another titanic convulsion shook the chamber that which the creature has just said praf began sounding puzzled uagen stooped and picked the interpreter up by her dry leathery wings get out he screeched into her face now they had hit a slightly wider part of the now steeply descending passage when the wind soughing past them from ahead suddenly picked up and became a gale the two raptor scouts in front of uagen their folded wings acting like sails in the howling torrent of air tried to wedge themselves against the rippling buckling walls they began to slide back towards him while uagen also tried to brace himself against the damp tissues of the tube oh praf said matteroffactly from behind and below uagen this development is not an indication of good help uagen screamed watching the two raptor scouts both still desperately clutching at the passages walls slide closer towards him he tried to make an x of himself but the walls were now too far apart down here interpreter praf said uagen looked down between his feet praf was holding onto the ribbed floor flattened against it as best she could he looked up as the nearest raptor scout skidded to within touching distance good idea he gasped he dived his forehead bounced off the heel spur of the raptor scout he grabbed at the ribs on the floor as both the raptor scouts slid over him the wind howled and tugged at his suit then faded away he untangled himself from praf and looked back a painfullooking tangle of beaks wings and limbs the two raptor scouts were wedged further up in the passage with the one which had been bringing up the rear in the narrow part they had recently forced their way through one of the winged creatures clacked something praf clacked back then jerked to her feet and scuttled down the passage it is the case that the raptor scouts of the yoleus will try to remain wedged there and so block the conflagrationfeeding wind while we complete the journey which we make to the outside of the sansemin this way uagen zlepe scholar he stared after her retreating back then scrambled after her he was getting an odd feeling in his stomach he tried to place it then realised it was like being in an inertiasubject lift or craft are we sinking he said whimpering the sansemin would appear to be losing height rapidly praf said bouncing from rib to rib down the steeply pitched floor ahead of him oh shit uagen looked back they were round a bend and out of sight of the raptor scouts the passage dipped still further it was now like descending a steeply pitched flight of stairs ah ha the interpreter said as the wind tugged at them again uagen felt his eyes widen he stared ahead light he screamed light praf i can see his voice trailed away fire the interpreter said down on the floor uagen zlepe scholar uagen turned and flung himself to the steps a moment before the fireball hit he had time to take one deep breath and try to bury his face in his arms he felt praf on top of him wings extended covering him the blast of heat and light lasted a couple of seconds up again the interpreter said you first youre on fire he yelled as she pushed him with her wings and he stumbled down the steps of ribs this is the case the interpreter said smoke and flames curled behind her wings as she prodded and pushed uagen downwards the wind was growing stronger and stronger he had to fight against it to make any headway forcibly walking down the ribbed side of the now almost vertical shaft as though they were somehow back on the level looking ahead uagen could see light again he groaned then saw that it was bluewhite not yellow this time we approach the outside praf gasped they dropped from the belly of the dying behemothaur falling not much faster than what was left of the vast creature itself as it burned and disintegrated and collapsed and descended all at once uagen held praf to him smothering the flames eating at her wings then used his ankle motors and balloon cape to halt their fall and after an eternity of falling amongst flaming fluttering wreckage and injured animals brought the two of them round from underneath the massive vshaped ruin that was the dying behemothaur into clear air space where the remains of the yoleus expeditionary force of raptor scouts found them moments before an ogrine disseisor could swoop in to swallow them whole the dazed silent interpreter shivered in his arms the smell of her burned flesh filling his nose as they rose slowly with the raptor scout troupe back to the dirigible behemothaur yoleus go yes away go depart leave you wish to go away depart leave now as soon as possible whens the next ship of anybodys well not umm chelgrian yes not chelgrian uagen had never imagined that yoleus interrogatory chamber would seem remotely homely but it did now he felt bizarrely safe here it was just a pity he had to leave yoleus was talking to him via a connecting cable and an interpreter called zhun the bulkier body of the nominally male zhun was perched on a ledge beside praf who was stuck to the chamber wall looking singed and limp and dead but apparently beginning her reconstitution and recovery zhun closed his eyes uagen was left standing there on the soft warm floor of the chamber he could still smell the odour of burning coming off his clothes he shivered zhun opened his eyes again the next departing object is due to leave from the second tropic of inclination secessionary portal in the yonder lobe in five days the interpreter said ill take it wait is it chelgrian no it is a jhuvuonian trader ill take it there is not from now sufficient time for you to journey to and arrive at the said tropic of inclination secessionary portal what there is not from now sufficient time for you to well how long would it take the interpreter closed its eyes again for a few moments then opened them and said twentythree days would be the minimum time of requirement for a being such as you to journey to and arrive at the second tropic of inclination secessionary portal from this point uagen could feel a terrible gnawing in his guts it was a sensation he hadnt felt since he was a very young child he tried to remain calm when is the next ship after that that is not known the interpreter replied immediately uagen fought back the urge to cry is it possible to signal from oskendari he asked of course at beyondlight speed no could you signal for a ship is there any way for me to get off in the near future the definition of near future this would be what uagen suppressed a moan in the next hundred days there are no objects known to be arriving or departing within that time period uagen put his hands into his headhair and pulled at it he roared out of frustration then stopped blinking hed never done that never done either pulled at his hair or roared with frustration he stared up at the blackened crippledlooking body of praf then dropped his head and stared at the chamber floor beneath his feet his little ankle motors gleamed mockingly back up at him he raised his head what had he been thinking of he checked what he knew about jhuvuonian traders only semicontacted fairly peaceful quite trustworthy still in the age of scarcity ships capable of a few hundred lights slow by culture standards but sufficient yoleus he said calmly can you signal the second secessionary tropic of inclinatory portal or whatever its called yes how long would that take the creature closed its eyes and opened them one day plus one quarter of a day would be required for the outward signal and a similar amount of time would be required for a replying signal good where is the nearest portal to where we are now and how long would it take for me to get there another pause the nearest portal to where we are now is the ninth tropic of inclination secessionary portal present lobe it is two days plus one threefifths of a days flying time from here by raptor scout uagen took a deep breath im culture he thought to himself this is what youre meant to do in such a situation this is what its all supposed to be about please signal the jhuvuonian trader vessel he said and tell them they will be paid an amount of money equivalent to the worth of their vessel if they will pick me up at the ninth tropic of inclination secessionary portal present lobe in four days time and take me to a destination i will disclose to them when they meet me there also mention that their discretion would be appreciated he considered leaving it at that but this ship sounded like his only chance and he couldnt afford to risk its masters dismissing him as a crank and if they were committed to that departure date then there wasnt time to indulge in a conversation by signal to convince them either he took another deep breath and added you may inform them that i am a citizen of the culture he never did get a chance to say goodbye properly to praf the decider foliagegleaner turned interpreter was still unconscious and attached to the wall of the interrogatory chamber when he left a day later he packed his bags made sure that a record of his research notes glyphs and all that had happened in the last couple of days was left in safe keeping with yoleus and made a particular point of finally preparing and drinking a glass of jhagel tea it didnt taste very good a flight of raptor scouts escorted him to the ninth tropic of inclination secessionary portal his last glimpse of the dirigible behemothaur yoleus was looking back over his shoulder watching the giant creature fading away into the greenyblue distance above the shadow of a cloud complex still faithfully following below and beneath the bulk of its desired mate muetenive he wondered if they would yet make their dash for the predicted upwelling still building somewhere through the haze horizon ahead to claim their free ride upwards to the manifold splendours of the gigalithine globular entity buthulne he felt a sort of sweet sadness that he would not be there to share either that ride or arrival with them and experienced a pang of guilt at feeling even the hint of a wish that the jhuvuonian trader craft would reject his offer and not show up so leaving him no real choice but to attempt to return to yoleus the two behemothaurs disappeared in the airily cavernous shadows above the cloud system he turned back to face forward again his ankle motors whirred the cloak adjusted itself minutely to accommodate his altered orientation still tensed to make a wing the wings of the raptor scouts beat the air around him in a syncopated rhythm of stuttering sound creating a curiously restful effect he looked over at zhun clasped to the neck and back of the raptor scout troupe leader but the creature appeared to be asleep the ninth tropic of inclination secessionary portal proved a little short of facilities it was just a patch about ten metres in diameter on the side of the airspheres fabric where the layers of containment material met and fused to produce a clear window into space around this circular area was clustered a handful of what looked like the mega fruit husks which grew on the behemothaurs and in one of which until a day earlier he had made his home they provided a place for the raptor scouts to perch and get their strength back and for him to sit and wait there was some food some water but that was all he passed the time by looking out at the starsthe portal patches were the only truly clear areas on the airspheres surface the rest was only translucent in comparisonand composing a poeglyph trying to describe the sensation of terror hed felt just the day before trapped inside the dying body of the behemothaur sansemin it was a frustrating process he kept on putting down the stylothe same damn stylo that had led to him being here now waiting on an alien spaceship that might never comeand tried to work out what had happened to sansemin why the culture agentif that was truly what he or she had beenhad been here in the first place whether there really was a plot of the sort that had been described to him and what he ought to do if it transpired that the whole thing was some sort of joke hallucination or figment of a mad and tormented creatures mind he had napped twice scrubbed six attempts at the poeglyph and having come to the tentative conclusion that it was marginally more likely that he had gone mad than that the events of the last few days had been real was debating with himself the relative merits of suicide storage transcorporation into a group entity or a request to return to yoleus and resume his studiessuitably physically altered and with the elongated lifespan hed been considering earlierwhen the jhuvuonian trader ship an unlikely arrangement of tubes and spars hove to on the far side of the portal jhuvuonian traders were not at all what he imagined for some reason he had expected squat roughlooking hairy humanoids wearing skins and furs when in fact they resembled collections of very large red feathers one of them floated through the portal encased within a mostly transparent bubble itself held inside a fingerlike intrusion of air forming a tunnel reaching back to the portal and the tubular vessel outside he met it on a terrace of the mega fruit husk zhun grasped the parapet at his side watching the encased alien approach with the air of a creature sizing up potential nestbuilding material you are the culture person the creature in the bubble said once it was hovering level with him the voice was faint the marain accent tolerable yes how do you do you will pay the worth of our ship to be taken to your destination yes it is a very fine ship so i see we would have another identical you shall the alien made a series of clacking noises talking to the interpreter at uagens side zhun clacked back what is your destination the alien said i need to send a signal to the culture just get me in range to do that initially then take me to wherever i might meet with a culture ship it had crossed uagens mind that the ship might be able to do this from here without having to take him anywhere though he doubted he would be so lucky still in the next few moments he experienced a frisson of hope and nervousness until the creature said we could travel next to the beidite entity critoletli where such communication and congregation might both be accomplished how long would that take seventyseven standard culture days there is nowhere closer there is not could we signal ahead to the entity on our approach we could how soon would we be in range to do that in about fifty standard culture days very well id like to set off immediately satisfactory payment to us from the culture upon my safe delivery oh i should have mentioned what the alien said its assemblage of red filaments fluttering inside the bubble there may be an additional reward involved beyond the payment we have already agreed the creatures feathery body rearranged itself again satisfactory it repeated the bubble floated up to the parapet there was a second bubble forming beside the one enclosing the alien it was uagen reflected just like watching a cell divide atmosphere and temperature are adjusted for culture standard the alien told him gravity within ship will be less this is acceptable to you yes you can provide your own sustenance ill manage he said then thought you do have water we do then ill survive you will come aboard please the twinned bubble bumped against the parapet uagen stooped picked up his bags and looked at zhun well goodbye thank you for your help wish yoleus all the best the yoleus wishes me to wish you a safe journey and a subsequent life which is pleasing to you uagen smiled tell it thank you from me i hope to see it again this will be done some ways of dying the ship lift sat underneath the falls when it was needed its counterweighted cradle swung slowly up and out from the swirling pool at the foot of the torrent trailing veils and mists of its own behind the plunging curtain of water the giant counterweight moved slowly down through its subterranean pool balancing the docksized cradle as it rose until it slotted into a wide groove carved into the lip of the falls once home its gates gradually forced themselves open against the current so that the cradle presented a sort of balcony of water jutting out beyond the rivers kilometrewide dropoff point two bulletshaped vessels powered upstream from either side like giant fish they trailed long booms which stretched out to form a wide v that funnelled the oncoming barge towards the cradle once the gates had closed again and the barge was safely enclosed the booms retracted the cradle opened its side caissons to the onrushing force of the water and the extra weight slowly overcame the balancing mass of the counterweight now deep under the pool beneath cradle and barge tipped slowly outwards and down descending amongst the thunder and mist towards the turmoil of waters below ziller dressed in a waistcoat and leggings that were thoroughly saturated stood with the hub avatar on a forwardfacing promenade deck just below the bridge of the barge ucalegon on the river jhree toluf plate the chelgrian shook himself unleashing spray as the cradles downstream gates opened and the barge made its way thudding and bumping against the inflatable sides of the cradle into the maelstrom of clashing waves and surging hummocks of water beyond he leant over to the avatar and pointed up through the churning clouds of vapour towards the falls lip two hundred metres above what would happen if the barge missed the cradle up there he yelled over the sound of the waterfall the avatar looking drenched but uncaring in a thin dark suit which clung to its silvery frame shrugged then it said loudly there would be a disaster and if the downstream gates opened while the cradle was still at the top of the falls the creature nodded again disaster and if the cradles supporting arms gave way disaster or if the cradle started to descend too soon ditto or either set of gates gave way before the cradle reached the pool guess what so this thing does have an antigravity keel or something doesnt it ziller shouted as backup redundancy yes the avatar shook its head no droplets fell from its nose and ears ziller sighed and shook his head too no i didnt really think so the avatar smiled and leant towards him i take it as an encouraging sign that youre beginning to ask that sort of question after the experience concerned is past the dangerous stage so im becoming as thoughtlessly blasé about risk and death as your inhabitants the avatar nodded enthusiastically yes encouraging isnt it no depressing the avatar laughed it looked up at the sides of the gorge as the river funnelled its way onwards to join masaq great river via ossuliera city wed better get back the silverskinned creature said ilom dolince will be dying soon and nisil tchasole coming back oh of course wouldnt want to miss either of your grotesque little ceremonies would we they turned and walked round the corner of the deck the barge powered its way through the chaos of waves its bows smacking into surging piles of white and green water and throwing great curtains of spray into the air to land like torrential squalls of rain across the decks the buffeted vessel tipped and heaved behind it the cradle was slowly and steadily submerging itself again in the raging currents a lump of water crashed onto the deck behind them turning the promenade into a surging river half a metre deep ziller had to drop to all threes and use one hand on the deck rail to steady himself as they made their way through the torrent to the nearest doors the avatar walked sloshing through the stream surging round its knees as though indifferent it held the doors open and helped ziller through in the foyer ziller shook himself again spattering the gleaming wooden walls and embroidered hangings the avatar just stood and the water fell off it leaving its silvery skin and its matte clothes completely dry while the water drained away from its feet across the decking ziller dragged a hand through his face fur and patted his ears he looked at the immaculate figure standing smiling opposite him while he dripped he wrung some water out of his waistcoat as he inspected the avatars skin and clothing for any remaining sign of moisture it appeared to be perfectly dry that is a very annoying trait he told it i did offer earlier to shelter both of us from the spray the avatar reminded him the chelgrian pulled one of his waistcoat pockets inside out and watched the resulting stream of water hit the deck but you said you wanted fully to appreciate the experience with all your senses including that of touch the avatar continued which i have to say i did think was a little casual at the time ziller looked ruefully at his sodden pipe and then at the silverskinned creature and that he said is another one a small drone carrying a very large neatly folded white towel of extreme fluffiness banked round a corner and sped along the passage towards them coming to a sudden stop at their side the avatar took the towel and nodded to the other machine which dipped and raced away again here the avatar said handing the chelgrian the towel thank you they turned to walk down the passageway passing saloons where small groups of people were watching the tumbling waters and roiling mists of spray outside wheres our major quilan today ziller asked rubbing his face in the towel visiting neremety with kabe to see some sworl islands its the first day of the local schools tempt season ziller had seen this spectacle himself on another plate six or seven years earlier tempt season was when the adult islands released the algal blooms theyd been storing to paint fabulous swirling patterns across the craterine bays of their shallow sea allegedly the display persuaded the seafloordwelling calves of the year before to surface and blossom into new versions of themselves neremety he asked wheres that half a million klicks away if its a stride youre safe for now how very reassuring arent you running out of places to distract our little messageboy with last i heard you were showing him round a factory ziller pronounced the last word through a snorting laugh the avatar looked hurt a starship factory if you please it said but yes a factory nevertheless only because he asked i might add and ive no shortage of places to show him ziller there are places on masaq you havent even heard of youd love to visit if only you knew about them there are ziller stopped and stared at the avatar it halted too grinning of course it spread its arms i wouldnt want you to know all my secrets at once would i ziller walked on drying his fur and looking askance at the silverskinned creature stepping lightly at his side you are more female than male you know that dont you he said the avatar raised its brows you really think so definitely the avatar looked amused he wants to see hub next it told him ziller frowned come to think of it ive never been there myself is there much to see theres a viewing gallery good outlook on the whole surface obviously but no better than most people get when they arrive unless theyre in a terrible hurry and fly straight up to the undersurface it shrugged apart from that not much to see i take it all your fabulous machinery is just as boring to look at as i imagine it to be if not more so well that ought to distract him for a good couple of minutes ziller towelled under his arms andrising to walk stooped on his hind legs alonearound his midlimb have you mentioned to the wretch that i may well not appear at the first performance of my own symphony not yet i believe kabe might be raising the subject today think hell do the honourable thing and stay away i really have no idea if the suspicions we share are correct e h tersono will probably try and talk him into going the avatar flashed ziller a wide smile it will employ some sort of argument based on the idea of not giving in to what it will probably characterise as your childish blackmail i imagine yes something as shallow as that how fares expiring light the avatar asked are the primer pieces ready yet were only five days away and thats close to the minimum time people are used to yes theyre ready i just want to sleep on a couple of them one more night but ill release them tomorrow the chelgrian glanced at the avatar youre quite sure this is the way to do it what using primer pieces yes wont people lose out on the freshness of the first performance whether i conduct it or not not at all theyll have heard the rough tunes the outlines of the themes thats all so theyll find the basic ideas recognisable although not familiar thatll let them appreciate the full work all the more the avatar slapped the chelgrian across the shoulders raising a fine spray from his waistcoat ziller winced the slightlooking creature was stronger than it appeared ziller trust us this way works oh and having listened to the draft youve sent it is quite magnificent my congratulations thank you ziller continued drying his flanks with the towel then looked at the avatar yes it said i was wondering what something ive wondered about ever since i came here something ive never asked you first of all because i was worried what the answer would be later because i suspected i already knew the answer goodness what can it be the avatar asked blinking if you tried if any mind tried could you impersonate my style the chelgrian asked could you write a piecea symphony saythat would appear to the critical appraiser to be by me and which when i heard it id imagine being proud to have written the avatar frowned as it walked it clasped its hands behind its back it took a few more steps yes i imagine that would be possible would it be easy no no more easy than any complicated task but you could do it much more quickly than i could id have to suppose so hmm ziller paused the avatar turned to face him behind ziller the rocks and veil trees of the deepening gorge moved swiftly past the barge rocked gently beneath their feet so what the chelgrian asked is the point of me or anybody else writing a symphony or anything else the avatar raised its brows in surprise well for one thing if you do it its you who gets the feeling of achievement ignoring the subjective what would be the point for those listening to it theyd know it was one of their own species not a mind who created it ignoring that too suppose they werent told it was by an ai or didnt care if they hadnt been told then the comparison isnt complete information is being concealed if they dont care then theyre unlike any group of humans ive ever encountered but if you can ziller are you concerned that mindsais if you likecan create or even just appear to create original works of art frankly when theyre the sort of original works of art that i create yes ziller it doesnt matter you have to think like a mountain climber oh do i yes some people take days sweat buckets endure pain and cold and risk injury andin some casespermanent death to achieve the summit of a mountain only to discover there a party of their peers freshly arrived by aircraft and enjoying a light picnic if i was one of those climbers id be pretty damned annoyed well it is considered rather impolite to land an aircraft on a summit which people are at that moment struggling up to the hard way but it can and does happen good manners indicate that the picnic ought to be shared and that those who arrived by aircraft express awe and respect for the accomplishment of the climbers the point of course is that the people who spent days and sweated buckets could also have taken an aircraft to the summit if all theyd wanted was to absorb the view it is the struggle that they crave the sense of achievement is produced by the route to and from the peak not by the peak itself it is just the fold between the pages the avatar hesitated it put its head a little to one side and narrowed its eyes how far do i have to take this analogy cr ziller youve made your point but this mountain climber still wonders if he ought to reeducate his soul to the joys of flight and stepping out onto someone elses summit better to create your own come on ive a dying man to see on his way ilom dolince lay on his death bed surrounded by friends and family the awnings which had covered the aft upper deck of the barge while it had descended the falls had been withdrawn leaving the bed open to the air ilom dolince sat up half submerged in floating pillows and lying on a puff mattress that looked ziller thought appropriately like a cumulus cloud the chelgrian hung back at the rear of the crescent of sixty or so people arranged standing or sitting round the bed the avatar went to stand near the old man and took his hand bending to talk to him it nodded then beckoned over to ziller who pretended not to see and made a show of being distracted by a gaudy bird flying low over the milky white waters of the river ziller the avatars voice said from the chelgrians pen terminal please come over ilom dolince would like to meet you eh oh yes of course he said he felt quite acutely awkward cr ziller i am privileged to meet you the old man shook the chelgrians hand in fact he did not look that old though his voice sounded weak his skin was less lined and spotted than that of some humans ziller had seen and his head hair had not fallen out though it had lost its pigment and so appeared white his handshake was not strong but ziller had certainly felt limper ones ah thank you im flattered you wanted to ah take up some of your ah time with meeting an alien note dabbler the whitehaired man in the bed looked regretful even pained oh cr ziller he said im sorry youre a little uncomfortable with this arent you im being very selfish it didnt occur to me my dying might no no i i well yes ziller felt his nose colour he glanced round the other people nearest the bed they looked sympathetic understanding he hated them it just seems strange thats all may i composer the man said he stretched out one hand and ziller allowed one of his to be grasped again the grip was lighter this time our ways must seem odd to you no odder than ours to you im sure i am very ready to die cr ziller ilom dolince smiled ive lived four hundred and fifteen years sir ive seen the chebalyths of eyske in their skydark migration watched field liners sculpt solar flares in the high nudrun ive held my own newborn in my hands flown the caverns of sart and dived the tubearches of lirouthale ive seen so much done so much that even with my neural lace trying to tie my elsewhere memories as seamlessly as it can into whats in my head i can tell ive lost a lot from in here he tapped one temple not from my memory but from my personality and so its time to change or move on or just stop ive put a version of me into a group mind in case anybody wants to ask me anything at any time but really i cant be bothered living any more at least not once ive seen ossuliera city which ive been saving for this moment he smiled at the avatar maybe ill come back when the end of the universe happens you also said you wanted to be revived into an especially nubile cheerleader if notromg town ever won the orbital cup the avatar said solemnly it nodded and took a breath in through its teeth id go with the universeending thing if i were you so you see sir ilom dolince said his eyes glittering im stopping one thin hand patted zillers im only sorry i wont be here to listen to your new work maestro i was very tempted to stay but well there is always something to keep us if we are not determined isnt there i dare say i hope youre not offended sir little else would have made me even think of delaying youre not offended are you would it make any difference if i was mr dolince ziller asked it would sir if i thought you were especially hurt i could still delay though i might be straining the patience of these good people dolince said looking round those gathered by his bedside there was a low chorus of friendlysounding dissent you see cr ziller i have made my peace i dont think i have ever been so well thought of then id be honoured to be included in that regard he patted the humans hand is it a great work cr ziller i hope it is i cant say mr dolince ziller told him im pleased with it he sighed experience would indicate that provides no guide whatsoever either to its initial reception or eventual reputation the man in the bed smiled widely i hope it goes wonderfully well cr ziller so do i sir ilom dolince closed his eyes for a moment or two when they flickered open his grip gradually loosened an honour cr ziller he whispered ziller let the humans hand go and stepped gratefully away as others flowed in around him ossuliera city emerged from the shadows round a corner of the gorge it was partly carved from the fawncoloured cliffs of the chasm itself and partly from stones brought in from other areas of the world and beyond the river jhree was tamed here running straight and deep and calm in a single great channel from which smaller canals and docks diverged arched over by delicate bridges of foametal and wood both living and dead the quaysides on either bank were great flat platforms of golden sandstone running into the bluehazed distance speckled with people and animals shadeplant and pavilions leaping fountains and tall twisted columns of extravagantly latticed metals and glittering minerals tall and stately barges sat moored by steps where troupes of chaurgresiles sat grooming each other with solemn intensity the mirror sails of smaller craft caught fitful swirling breezes to slide angled shadows along the quiet waters behind and cast flitting shimmering reflections along the bustling quays to either side above the stepped city rose in setback terrace after setback terrace from these vast and busy shelves of stone awnings and umbreltrees dotted the galleries and piazzas canals disappeared into vaulted tunnels cut into the chiselled cliffs perfume fires sent thin coils of violet and orange smoke rolling up towards the pale blue sky where flocks of pure white lucent ploughtails wheeled on outstretched wings inscribing silent spirals in the air and arcing overhead a layered succession of higher and longer and more tenuously poised bridges bowed like rainbows made solid in the misty air their intricately carved and dazzlingly inlaid surfaces brimming with flowers and strung with leafchain storeycreep and veilmoss music played echoing amongst the canyons decks and bridges of the city the barges sudden appearance caused a volley of excited trumpeting from a shambling pack of cumbrosaurs arranged on a flight of steps descending to the river ziller at the deck rail turned from the tumult of the view to look back to the bed where ilom dolince lay a few people seemed to be crying the avatar was holding a hand over the mans forehead it smoothed its silver fingers down over his eyes the chelgrian watched the beautiful city glide past for a while when he looked back again a long grey displacement drone was hovering over the bed the people gathered round stood back a little forming a rough circle a silvery field shimmered in the air where the mans body was then shrank to a point and vanished the bedclothes settled back softly over the place where the body had been people always look up to the sun at such moments he remembered kabe pointing out once what he was witnessing was the conventional method of disposing of the dead both here and throughout most of the rest of the culture the body had been displaced into the core of the local star and as kabe had pointed out if they could see it the people present always looked up to that sun even though it would usually be a million years or more before the photons formed from the dispatched corpse would shine down upon wherever it was they stood a million years would this artificial carefully maintained world still be here after all that time he doubted it the culture itself would probably be gone by then chel certainly would perhaps people looked up now because they knew there would be nobody around to look up then there was another ceremony to be carried out on the barge before it left ossuliera city a woman called nisil tchasole was to be reborn stored in mindstate only eight hundred years earlier she had been a combatant in the idiran war shed wanted to be reawakened in time to see the light from the second of the twin novae shine down upon masaq a clone of her original body had been grown for her and her personality was to be quickened inside it within the hour so she would have the next five or so days to reacclimatise herself to life before the second nova burst upon the local skies the pairing of this rebirth with ilom dolinces death was supposed to take some of the sadness out of the mans departure but ziller found the very neatness of the pairing trite and contrived he didnt wait to see this overly neat revival he jumped ship when it docked walked around for a while and then took the underground back to aquime yes i was a twin once the story is well known i think and very much on record there are any number of tellings and interpretations of it there are even some fictive and musical pieces based on it some more accurate than others i can recommend yes i know all that but id like you to tell the story are you sure of course im sure oh all right then the avatar and the chelgrian stood in a little eightperson module underneath the outerfacing surface of the orbital the craft was an allmedia general runabout capable of travelling under water flying in atmosphere or as now voyaging in space albeit at purely relativistic speeds the two of them stood facing forward the screen started at their feet and swept above their heads it was like standing in the front of a glassnosed spaceship except that no glass ever made could have transmitted such a faithful representation of the view ahead and around it was two days after the death of ilom dolince three before the concert in the stullien bowl ziller his symphony completed and rehearsals under way felt consumed by a familiar restlessness trying to think of sights on masaq he hadnt yet seen hed asked to be shown what the orbital looked like from underneath as it sped by and so he and the avatar had descended by subplate access to the small space port deep under aquime the plateau aquime sat on was mostly hollow the space inside taken up by old ship stores and mostly mothballed generalproduct factories subplate access over the majority of the orbitals area was a matter of descending a hundred metres or less from aquime there was a good kilometre straight down to open space the eightperson module was slowing now relative to the world above them it was facing spinwards so the effect was of the orbital fifty metres above their heads starting to move past overhead slowly at first but gradually more and more quickly while the stars beneath their feet and to either side which had been slowly wheeling appeared now to be slowing down to a stop the undersurface of the world was a greyly shining expanse of what looked like metal lit dimly by the starlight and the sunlight reflected from some of the systems nearer planets there was something intimidatingly flat and perfect about the vast plain hanging above their heads ziller thought for all that it was dotted with masts and access points and woven by the underground car tracks the tracks rose slowly in places to cross other routes which sank halfway into the fabric of the undersurface before returning to the vast and level plain in other places the tracks swung round in vast loops that were tens or even hundreds of kilometres across creating a vastly complicated lacework of grooves and lines etched into the undersurface of the world like a fabulously intricate inscription upon a bracelet ziller watched some of the cars zip across the undersurface in ones or twos or longer trains the tracks provided the best gauge of their relative speed they had moved above them languidly at first seeming to slide gradually away or come curving smoothly back now as the module slowed using its engines to brake and the orbital appeared to speed up the lines started to flow and then race by above they went under a bulkhead range still seeming to gather speed the ceiling of greyness above them raced away disappearing into a darkness hundreds of kilometres in height strung with microscopic lights way above the car tracks here rested on impossibly slender slingbridges they flashed past perfectly straight thin lines of dim light their supporting monofils invisible at the relative speed the module had built up then the far slope of the bulkhead range came swooping down to meet them flashing towards the modules nose ziller tried not to duck he failed the avatar said nothing but the module moved further out so that they were half a kilometre away from the undersurface this had the temporary effect of seeming to slow the orbital down the avatar started to tell ziller its story once the mind that had become masaq hubreplacing the original incumbent who had chosen to sublime not long after the end of the idiran warhad been the mind in the body of a ship called the lasting damage it was a culture general systems vehicle built towards the end of the three uneasy decades when it gradually became clear that a war between the idirans and the culture was more likely to occur than not it had been constructed to fulfil the role of a civilian ship if that conflict somehow didnt happen but it had also been designed to play a full part in the war if it did come ready to continually construct smaller warships transport personnel and materiel andpacked with its own weaponrybecome directly involved in battle during the first phase of the conflict when the idirans were pressing the culture on every front and the culture was doing little more than falling further and further back and mounting only very occasional holding actions where time had to be bought to carry out an evacuation the number of genuine warships ready to fight was still small the slack was mostly taken up by general contacts vehicles but the few warprepped gsvs took their share of the burden as well there were frequent occasions and battles when military prudence would have dictated the dispatch of a fleet of smaller war craft the nonreturn of someeven mostof which would be deplorable but not a disaster but which while the culture was still completing its preparations for fullscale war production could only be dealt with by the commitment of a combatready gsv a tooledup general systems vehicle was a supremely powerful fighting machine easily outgunning any single unit on the idiran side but it was not just inherently less flexible as an instrument of war compared to a fleet of smaller craft it was also unique in the binary nature of its survivability if a fleet ran into serious trouble usually some of its ships could run away to fight another day but a similarly beset gsv either triumphed or suffered total destructionat its own behest if not because of the actions of the enemy just the contemplation of a loss on such a magnitude was sufficient to give the strategic planning minds of the cultures war command the equivalent of ulcers sleepless nights and general conniptions in one of the more desperate of those engagements buying time while a group of culture orbitals was readied for flight and slowly accelerated to a velocity sufficient to ensure the worlds escape from the volume of space under threat the lasting damage had thrown itself into a particularly wild and dangerous environment deep inside the blossoming sphere of idiran hegemony before it had departed on what most concerned including itself thought would be its last mission it had as a matter of course transmitted its mindstateeffectively its soulto another gsv which then sent the recording onwards to another culture mind on the far side of the galaxy where it might be held dormant and safe then along with a few subsidiary unitsbarely meriting the name warships more like semidevolved powered weapon podsit set off on its raid climbing up and out above the lens of the galaxy on a high curving course hooked above the swell of stars like a claw the lasting damage plunged into the web of idiran supply logistic support and reinforcement routes like a berserk raptor thrown into a nest of hibernating kittens devastating and disrupting all it could find in an erratic series of pulverisingly murderous fullspeed attacks spread throughout centuries of space the idirans had thought long since swept free of culture ships it had been agreed that there would be no communication from the gsv unless by some miracle it made it back into the rapidly withdrawing sphere of culture influence the only sign that reached its comrade craft that it had escaped immediate detection and destruction was that the pressure on the units remaining behind to resist the direct thrust of the idiran battle fleets lessened appreciably as enemy vessels were either intercepted before they reached the front or diverted from it to deal with the emerging threat then there came rumours through some of the refugee craft of neutrals fleeing the hostilities of a knot of idiran fleets swarming round a volume of space near a recent raid location on the very outskirts of the galaxy followed by a furious battle culminating in a gigantic annihilatory explosion whose signature when it was finally picked up and analysed was exactly that produced when a beleaguered military gsv of the culture had had time to orchestrate a maximally extraneously damaging destruct sequence news of the battle and the gsvs martial success and final sacrifice was headlining mainmenu stuff for less than a day the war like the idiran battle fleets swept onwards burgeoning with distraction and ruse incident and havoc horror and spectacle gradually the culture implemented its shift to fullscale war production the idiransalready slowed by the commitments theyd had to make to control the colossal volumes of their newly conquered territoriesfound the pace of their advance faltering in places initially through their own inability to bring the requisite combat apparatus to bear but increasingly due to the growing ability of the culture to push back as whole fleets of new warships were produced and dispatched by the cultures orbital manufacturies far away from the war new evidence of the destruction of the gsv lasting damageand the idiran war vessels it had taken with itcame in from a neutral ship of another involved species which had passed near the battle site the stored personality of the lasting damage was duly resurrected from the mind it had been stored with and emplaced into another craft of the same class it joinedrejoinedthe encompassing struggle thrown into battle after battle never knowing which might be its last and holding within itself all the memories of its earlier incarnation intact right up until the instant it had cast off its fields and set its looping trajectorial course for idiran space a full year earlier there was just one complication the lasting damage the original ship mind had not been destroyed as a gsv it had struggled to the end and fought to the last dutifully determinedly and without thought for its own safety but finally as an individual mind it had escaped in one of its slaved weapon pods having suffered its due portion of the profoundly focused attentions of not one but several idiran war fleets the notquitewarship was by then little more than a wreck a notquitenotquitewarship thrown from the erupting energies of the selfdestructing gsv flung out of the main body of the galaxy with barely sufficient energy to maintain its own fabric it flew above and away from the plane of the galaxy more like a gigantic piece of shrapnel than any sort of ship largely disarmed mostly blind entirely dumb and not daring to use its alltoorough and barely ready engines for fear of detection until at length it had no choice even then it turned them on for only the minimum amount of time necessary to stop itself colliding with the energy grid between the universes if the idirans had had more time they would have searched for any surviving fragments of the gsv and probably they would have found the castaway as it was there had been more pressing matters to attend to by the time anybody thought to doublecheck that the gsvs destruction had been as complete as it had first appeared the halfruined vessel now millennia distant from the upper limit of the great disc of stars that was the galaxy was just about far enough away to escape detection gradually it had started to repair itself hundreds of days passed eventually it risked using its much workedupon engines to start tugging it towards the regions of space where it hoped the culture still held sway uncertain who was where it abstained from signalling until at last it arrived back in the galaxy proper in a region which it was reasonably confident must still be outside idiran control the signal announcing its arrival caused some confusion at first but a gsv rendezvoused with it and took it aboard it was informed it had a twin it was the first but not the last time something like this would happen during the war despite all the care the culture took to confirm the deaths of its minds the original mind was reemplaced in another newly built gsv and took the name lasting damage i the successor ship renamed itself lasting damage ii they became part of the same battle fleet following their mutual request and fought together through another four decades of war near the end they were both present when the battle of the twin novae took place in the region of space known as arm onesix one survived the other perished they had swapped mindstates before the battle began the survivor incorporated the soul of the destroyed ship into its own personality as they had agreed it too was almost annihilated in the fighting and again had to take to a smaller craft to save both itself and the salvaged soul of its twin which one died ziller asked i or ii the avatar gave a small diffident smile we were close together at the time when it happened and it was all very confused i was able to conceal who died and who survived for a good many years until somebody did the relevant detective work it was ii who was killed i who lived the creature shrugged it didnt matter it was only the fabric of the craft housing the substrate which was destroyed and the body of the surviving ship met the same fate the result was the same as it would have been the other way round both minds became the one mind became me the avatar seemed to hesitate then gave a dainty little bow ziller watched the orbital race by overhead car lines whipped past almost too fast to follow only the vaguest impressions of actual cars even in long trains were visible unless they were moving in the same direction as the module appeared to be then they seemed to move more slowly for a while before drawing away pulling ahead falling behind or curving away to either side i imagine the situation must have been confused indeed if you were able to hide whod died ziller said it was pretty bad the avatar agreed lightly it was watching the orbital undersurface whiz by with a vague smile on its face the way war tends to be what was it made you want to become a hub mind you mean beyond the urge to settle down and do something constructive after all those decades spent hurtling across the galaxy destroying things yes the avatar turned to face him id have to assume youve done your research here cr ziller i do know a little of what happened just think of me as oldfashioned enough or primitive enough to like hearing things straight from the person who was there i had to destroy an orbital ziller in fact i had to blitz three in a single day well war is hell the avatar looked at him as though trying to decide whether the chelgrian was trying too hard to make light of the situation as i said the events are all entirely a matter of public record i take it there was no real choice indeed that was the judgement i had to act upon your own partially i was part of the decisionmaking process though even if id disagreed i might still have acted as i did thats what strategic planning is there for it must be a burden not even being able to say you were just obeying orders well that is always a lie or a sign you are fighting for an unworthy cause or still have a very long way to develop civilisationally a terrible waste three orbitals a responsibility the avatar shrugged an orbital is just unconscious matter even if it does represent a lot of effort and expended energy their minds were already safe long gone the human deaths were what i found affecting did many people die three thousand four hundred and ninetytwo out of how many three hundred and ten million a small proportion its always one hundred per cent for the individual concerned still no no still the avatar said shaking its head light slid across its silver skin how did the few hundred million survive shipped out mostly about twenty per cent were evacuated in underground cars they work as lifeboats there are lots of ways to survive you can move whole orbitals if you have the time or you can ship people out orshorttermuse underground cars or other transport systems or just suits on a very few occasions entire orbitals have been evacuated by storagetransmission the human bodies were left inert after their mindstates were zapped away though that doesnt always save you if the storing substrates slagged too before it can transmit onwards and the ones who didnt get away all knew the choice they were making some had lost loved ones some were i suppose mad but nobody was sure enough to deny them their choice some were old andor tired of life and some left it too late to escape either corporeally or by zapping after watching the fun or something went wrong with their transport or mindstate record or transmission some held beliefs that caused them to stay the avatar fixed its gaze on zillers save for the ones who experienced equipment malfunctions i recorded every one of those deaths ziller i didnt want them to be faceless i didnt want to be able to forget that was ghoulish wasnt it call it what you want it was something i felt i had to do war can alter your perceptions change your sense of values i didnt want to feel that what i was doing was anything other than momentous and horrific even in some first principles sense barbaric i sent drones micromissiles camera platforms and bugs down to those three orbitals i watched each of those people die some went in less than the blink of an eye obliterated by my own energy weapons or annihilated by the warheads id displaced some took only a little longer incinerated by the radiation or torn to pieces by the blast fronts some died quite slowly thrown tumbling into space to cough blood which turned to pink ice in front of their freezing eyes or found themselves suddenly weightless as the ground fell away beneath their feet and the atmosphere around them lifted off into the vacuum like a tent caught in a gale so that they gasped their way to death most of them i could have rescued the same displacers i was using to bombard the place could have sucked them off it and as a last resort my effectors might have plucked their mindstates from their heads even as their bodies froze or burned around them there was ample time but you left them yes and watched them yes still it was their choice to stay indeed and did you ask their permission to record their death throes no if they would hand me the responsibility for killing them they could at least indulge me in that i did tell all concerned what i would be doing beforehand that information saved a few it did attract criticism though some people felt it was insensitive and what did you feel appalled compassion despair detached elated godlike guilty horrified miserable pleased powerful responsible soiled sorrowful elated pleased those are the closest words there is an undeniable elation in causing mayhem in bringing about such massive destruction as for feeling pleased i felt pleasure that some of those who died did so because they were stupid enough to believe in gods or afterlives that do not exist even though i felt a terrible sorrow for them as they died in their ignorance and thanks to their folly i felt pleasure that my weapon and sensory systems were working as they were supposed to i felt pleasure that despite my misgivings i was able to do my duty and act as i had determined a fully morally responsible agent ought to in the circumstances and all this makes you suitable to command a world of fifty billion souls perfectly the avatar said smoothly i have tasted death ziller when my twin and i merged we were close enough to the ship being destroyed to maintain a realtime link to the substrate of the mind within as it was torn apart by the tidal forces produced by a line gun it was over in a microsecond but we felt it die bit by bit area by distorted area memory by disappearing memory all kept going until the absolute bitter end by the ingenuity of mind design falling back stepping down closing off and retreating and regrouping and compressing and abandoning and abstracting and finessing always trying by whatever means possible to keep its personality its soul intact until there was nothing remaining to sacrifice nowhere else to go and no survival strategies left to apply it leaked away to nothingness in the end pulled to pieces until it just dissolved into a mist of subatomic particles and the energy of chaos the last two coherent things it held onto were its name and the need to maintain the link that communicated all that was happening to it from it to us we experienced everything it experienced all its bewilderment and terror each iota of anger and pride every last nuance of grief and anguish we died with it it was us and we were it and so you see i have already died and i can remember and replay the experience in perfect detail any time i wish the avatar smiled silkily as it leant closer to him as though imparting a confidence never forget i am not this silver body mahrai i am not an animal brain i am not even some attempt to produce an ai through software running on a computer i am a culture mind we are close to gods and on the far side we are quicker we live faster and more completely than you do with so many more senses such a greater store of memories and at such a fine level of detail we die more slowly and we die more completely too never forget i have had the chance to compare and contrast the ways of dying it looked away for a moment the orbital streamed past above their heads nothing stayed in sight for longer than the blink of an eye the underground car tracks were blurs the impression of speed was colossal ziller looked down the stars appeared now to be stationary hed done the maths in his head before they entered the module their speed relative to the orbital was now about a hundred and ten kilometres per second longrange express cartrains would still be overtaking them the module would take an entire day to circle the world hovering here while hubs traveltime guarantee was no more than two hours from any express port to any other and a threehour journey from any given subplate access point to another i have watched people die in exhaustive and penetrative detail the avatar continued i have felt for them did you know that true subjective time is measured in the minimum duration of demonstrably separate thoughts per second a humanor a chelgrianmight have twenty or thirty even in the heightened state of extreme distress associated with the process of dying in pain the avatars eyes seemed to shine it came forward closer to his face by the breadth of a hand whereas i it whispered have billions it smiled and something in its expression made ziller clench his teeth i watched those poor wretches die in the slowest of slow motion and i knew even as i watched that it was i whod killed them who was at that moment engaged in the process of killing them for a thing like me to kill one of them or one of you is a very very easy thing to do and as i discovered absolutely disgusting just as i need never wonder what it is like to die so i need never wonder what it is like to kill ziller because i have done it and it is a wasteful graceless worthless and hateful thing to have to do and as you might imagine i consider that i have an obligation to discharge i fully intend to spend the rest of my existence here as masaq hub for as long as im needed or until im no longer welcome forever keeping an eye to windward for approaching storms and just generally protecting this quaint circle of fragile little bodies and the vulnerable little brains they house from whatever harm a big dumb mechanical universe or any consciously malevolent force might happen or wish to visit upon them specifically because i know how appallingly easy they are to destroy i will give my life to save theirs if it should ever come to that and give it gladly happily too knowing that the trade was entirely worth the debt i incurred eight hundred years ago back in arm onesix the avatar stepped back smiled broadly and tipped its head to one side it suddenly looked ziller thought as though it might as well have been discussing a banquet menu or the positioning of a new underground access tube any other questions cr ziller he looked at it for a moment or two yes he said he held up his pipe may i smoke in here the avatar stepped forward put one arm round his shoulders and with its other hand clicked its fingers a blueyellow flame sprang from its index finger be my guest above their heads in a matter of seconds the orbital slowed to a stop while beneath their feet the stars started to revolve once again returning to leave recalling forgetting how many will die perhaps ten per cent that is the calculation so that would be five billion hmm yes that is about what we lost that is the approximate number of souls barred from the beyond by the catastrophe visited upon us by the culture that is a great responsibility estodien it is mass murder major visquile said with a humourless smile is that what you are thinking it is revenge a balancing and it is still mass murder major let us not mince our words let us not hide behind euphemisms it is mass murder of noncombatants and as such illegal according to the galactic agreements we are signatory to nevertheless we believe it is a necessary act we are not barbarians we are not insane we would not dream of doing something so awful even to aliens if it had not become obvious that it had becomethrough the actions of those same alienssomething which had to be done to rescue our own people from limbo there can be no doubt that the culture owes us those lives but it is still an appalling act even to be contemplating the estodien sat forward and grasped one of quilans hand in his major quilan if you have changed your mind if you are beginning to reconsider tell us now do you still have the taste for this quilan looked into the old males eyes one death is an appalling thing to contemplate estodien of course and five billion lives seems an unreal number does it not yes unreal and do not forget the gonebefore have read you quilan they have looked inside your head and know what you are capable of better than you do yourself they pronounced you clear therefore they must be certain that you will do what must be done even if you feel doubts about that yourself quilan lowered his gaze that is comforting estodien it is disturbing i would have thought perhaps that a little too perhaps a person who might be called a confirmed civilian would be more disturbed than comforted i am still a soldier estodien knowing that i will do my duty is no bad thing good visquile said letting go quilans hand and sitting back now we begin again he stood up come with me it was four days after theyd arrived in the airsphere quilan had spent most of that time within the chamber containing the temple ship soulhaven with visquile he sat or lay in the spherical cavity that was the innermost recessional space of the soulhaven while the estodien attempted to teach him how to use the soulkeepers displacer function the range of the device is only fourteen metres visquile told him on the first day they sat in the darkness surrounded by a substrate holding millions of the dead the shorter the leap and of course the smaller the size of the object being displaced the less power is required and the less likelihood there is of the action being detected fourteen metres should be quite sufficient for what is required what is it im trying to send to displace initially one of a stock of twenty dummy warheads which were loaded into your soulkeeper before it was emplaced within you when the time comes for you to fire in anger you will be manipulating the transference of one end of a microscopic wormhole though without the wormhole attached that sounds bizarre to say the least nevertheless so its not a bomb no though the eventual effect will be somewhat similar ah quilan said so once the displacement has taken place i just walk away initially yes quilan could just make out the estodien looking at him why major were you expecting that to be the moment of your death yes i was that would be too obvious major this was described to me as being a suicide mission estodien i would hate to think i might survive it and feel cheated how annoying that it is so dark in here i cant see the expression on your face as you say that major i am quite serious estodien hmm probably just as well well let me put your mind at rest major you will assuredly die when the wormhole activates instantaneously i hope that doesnt conflict with any desire you might have harboured for a lingering demise the fact will be enough estodien the manner is not something i can bring myself to be concerned with though i would prefer it to be quick rather than slow quick it will be major you have my word on that so estodien where do i carry out this displacement inside the hub of masaq orbital the space station which sits in the middle of the world is that normally accessible of course quilan they run school trips there so their young can see the place where the machine squats that oversees their pampered lives quilan heard the older male gather his robes about him you simply ask to be shown round it will not seem in the least suspicious you carry out the displacement and return to the surface of the orbital at the appointed time the wormhole mouth will be connected with the wormhole itself the hub will be destroyed the orbital will continue to run using other automatic systems situated on the perimeter but there will be some loss of life as particularly critical processes are left to run out of control transport systems largely those souls stored in the hubs own substrates will be lost too at any given moment those stored souls can number over four billion these will account for the majority of the lives the chelgrianpuen require to release our own people into heaven quilan thoughts the words rang suddenly in his head making him flinch he sensed visquile go quiet beside him gonebefore he thought and bowed his head just one thought really the obvious one why not let our dead into the beyond without this terrible action heroes heaven honouring killed by enemies without reply disgraces all come before many more disgrace assumed when war believed our fault own responsibility accept disgraceaccept disgraced know now war caused by others fault theirs disgrace theirs responsibility theirs debt theirs rejoice now disgraced become heroes too once balance of loss achieved it is hard for me to rejoice knowing that i will have so much blood on my hands you go to oblivion quilan your wish blood not on you but on memory of you that restricted to few if mission wholly succeeds think actions leading to mission not results results your not concern other questions no no other questions thank you think of the cup think of the interior of the cup think of the space of air that is the shape of the inside of the cup then think of the cup then think of the table then of the space around the table then of the route you would take from here to the table to sit down at the table and take up the cup think of the act of moving from here to there think of the time it would take to move from this place to that place think of walking from where you are now to where the cup was when you saw it a few moments ago are you thinking of that quilan yes send there was a pause have you sent no estodien i dont think so nothing has happened we will wait anur is sitting by the table watching the cup you might have sent the object without knowing it they sat a few moments longer then visquile sighed and said think of the cup think of the interior of the cup think of the space of air that is the shape of the inside of the cup i will never do this estodien i cant send the damn thing anywhere maybe the soulkeeper is broken i do not think so think of the cup dont be disheartened major come now eat my people come from sysa originally theres an old sysan saying that the soup of life is salty enough without adding tears to it they were in the soulhavens small refectory at a table apart from the handful of other monks whose watch schedule meant it was their lunchtime too they had water bread and meat soup quilan was drinking his water from the plain white ceramic cup he had been using as a displacement target all morning he stared into it morosely i do worry estodien perhaps something has gone wrong perhaps i dont have the right sort of imagination or something i dont know quilan we are attempting to do something no chelgrian has ever done before youre trying to turn yourself into a chelgrian displacement machine you cant expect to get it right first time on the first morning you try it visquile looked up as anur the gangly monk who had shown them round the behemothaurs exterior the day they had arrived passed their table with his tray he bowed clumsily nearly tipping the contents of his tray onto the floor only just saving it he gave a foolish smile visquile nodded anur had been sitting watching the cup all morning waiting for a tiny black speckpossibly preceded by a tiny silver sphereto appear in its white scoop visquile must have read quilans expression i asked anur not to sit with us i dont want you to think of him sitting looking at the cup i want you to think only of the cup quilan smiled do you think i might displace the test object into anur by mistake i doubt that would happen though you never know but in any event if you start to see anur sitting there tell me and well replace him with one of the other monks if i did displace the object into a person what would happen as i understand it almost certainly nothing the object is too small to cause any damage i suppose if it materialised inside the persons eye they might see a speck or if it appeared right alongside a pain receptor they might feel a tiny pinprick anywhere else in the body it would go unnoticed if you could displace this cup the estodien said lifting his own ceramic cup identical to quilans into somebodys brain then i dare say their head might explode just from the pressure produced by the sudden extra volume but the dummy warheads you are working with are too small to be noticed it might block a small blood vessel a capillary perhaps nothing large enough to cause any tissue damage quilan drank from his own cup then held it up looking at it i shall see this damn thing in my dreams visquile smiled that might be no bad thing quilan supped his soup whats happened to eweirl i havent seen him since we arrived oh he is about visquile said he is making preparations to do with my training no for when we leave when we leave visquile smiled all in due time major and the two drones our allies as i said all in good time major and send yes yes no no i hoped well it doesnt matter lets try again think of the cup think of a place you know or knew well a small place perhaps a room or a small apartment or house perhaps the interior of a cabin a car a ship anything it must be a place you knew well enough to be able to find your way around at night so that you knew where everything was in the darkness and would not trip over things or break them imagine being there imagine going to a particular place and dropping say a crumb or a small bead or seed into a cup or other container that night he again found it difficult to sleep he lay looking into the darkness curled on the broad sleeping platform breathing in the sweet spicy air of the giant bulbous fruitlike thing where he visquile and most of the others were billeted he tried thinking about that damn cup but gave up he was tired of it instead he tried to work out exactly what was going on here it was obvious he thought that the technology inside the specially adapted soulkeeper he had been fitted with was not chelgrian some other involved was taking a part in this an involved species whose technology was on a par with the cultures two of their representatives were probably housed inside the pair of doubleconeshaped drones hed seen earlier the ones who had spoken to him inside his head before the gonebefore had they had not reappeared he supposed the drones might be remotely operated perhaps from somewhere outside the airsphere though the oskendaris notorious antipathy towards such technology meant that the drones probably did physically contain the aliens equally that made it all the more puzzling that the airsphere had been chosen as the place to train him in the use of a technology as advanced as that contained within his soulkeeper unless the idea was that if the use of such devices escaped attention here it would also go unnoticed in the culture quilan went through what he knew of the relatively small number of involved species sufficiently advanced to take the culture on in this way there were between seven and twelve other species on that sort of level depending which set of criteria you used none were supposed to be particularly hostile to the culture several were allies nothing he knew of would have provided an obvious motive for what he was being trained to do but then what he knew was only what the involveds allowed to be known about some of the more profound relationships between them and that most certainly did not include everything that was really going on especially given the time scales some of the involveds had become used to thinking on he knew that the oskendari airspheres were fabulously old even by the standards of those who called themselves the elder races and had succeeded in remaining mysterious throughout the scientific ages of hundreds of comeandgone or beenandsublimed species the rumours had it that there was some sort of link left between whoever it was who had created the airspheres and subsequently quit the matterbased life of the universe and the mega and giga fauna which still inhabited the environments this link with the gonebefore of the airspheres builders was reputedly the reason that all the hegemonising and invasive speciesnot to mention the unashamedly nosy species such as the culturewho had encountered the airspheres had thought the better of trying to take them over or study them too closely these same rumours backed up by ambiguous records held by the elders hinted that long ago a few species had imagined that they could make the big wandering worlds part of their empire or had taken it upon themselves to send in survey devices against the expressed wishes of the behemothaurs and the megalithine and gigalithine globular entities such species tended to disappear quickly or gradually from the records concerned thereafter and there was firm statistical evidence that they disappeared more rapidly and more completely than species which had no record of antagonising the inhabitantsand by implication the guardiansof the airspheres quilan wondered if the gonebefore of the airspheres had been in contact with the gonebefore of chel was there some link between the sublimed of the two or more of course species who knew how the sublimed thought how they interacted who knew how alien minds worked for that matter who was entirely satisfied that they knew how the minds of one of their own species worked the sublimed he supposed was the answer to all those questions but any understanding seemed to be resolutely oneway he was being asked to perform a sort of miracle he was being asked to commit mass murder he tried to look into himselfand wondered if even at that moment the chelgrianpuen were listening in to his thoughts watching the images that flitted through his mind measuring the fixity of his commitment and weighing the worth of his souland was faintly but only faintly appalled to realise that while he doubted his ability ever to perform the miracle he was at the very least quite resigned to the commission of that genocide and that night not quite gone over to sleep he remembered her room at the university where they discovered each other where he came to know her body better than his own better than he had known any thing or subject certainly better than anything he was supposed to be studying and knew it in darkness and light and indeed placed a seed in a container over and over again he could not use that but he remembered the room could see the shape of darkness that was her body as she moved about it sometimes late at night switching something off dousing an incense coil closing the window when it rained once she brought out some antique scriptstrings erotic tales told in knots and let him bind her later she bound him and he who had always thought himself the plainest of young males bluffly proud of his normalcy discovered that such sexplay was not the preserve of those hed considered weak and degenerate he saw the pattern of shadow her body made across the telltale lights and reflections in the room here now in this strange world so many years of time and millennia of light away from that blessed time and place he imagined himself getting up and crossing from the curlpad to the far side of the room there wasthere had beena little silver cuplet on a shelf there sometimes when she wanted to be absolutely naked she would take off the ring her mother had given her it would be his duty his mission to take the ring from her hand and place the gold band in the silver cuplet all right are we there yes were there so send yes no hmm well we begin again think of yes the cup we are quite certain the device is working estodien we are then its me i just cant its just not in me he dropped some bread into his soup he laughed bitterly or it is in me and i cant get it out patience major patience there are we there yes yes were there and send iwait i think i felt yes estodien major quilan it worked anur came running through from the refectory estodien what do you think our allies will gain from my mission im sure i dont know major it is not really a subject it would benefit either of us to worry ourselves with they sat in a small runabout a sleek little twoperson craft of the soulhaven in space outside the airsphere the same small airship that had carried them from the airsphere portal the day theyd arrived had taken quilan and visquile on the return trip they had walked through the solidseeming tube of air again this time to the runabout it had drifted away from the portal then picked up speed it seemed to be heading towards one of the sunmoons which provided the airsphere with light the moon drifted closer sunlight poured from what looked like a gigantic nearflat crater covering half of one face it looked like the incandescent eyeball of some infernal deity all that matters major visquile said is that the technology appears to work they had conducted ten successful trials with the supply of dummy warheads loaded inside the soulkeeper there had been an hour or so of failed attempts to repeat his initial success then hed managed to perform two displacements in succession after that the cup had been moved to different parts of the soulhaven quilan had only two unsuccessful attempts before he became able to displace the specks wherever he was asked on the third day he attempted and conducted only two displacements to either end of the ship this the fourth day was the first time quilan would attempt a displacement outside the soulhaven are we going to that moon estodien he asked as the giant satellite grew to fill the view ahead nearby visquile said he pointed you see that a tiny fleck of grey floated away to one side of the sunmoon just visible in the wash of light pouring from the crater that is where we are going it was something between a ship and a station it looked like it could have been either and as though it might have been designed by any one of thousands of earlystage involved civilisations it was a collection of greyblack ovoids spheres and cylinders linked by thick struts revolving slowly in an orbit round the sunmoon configured so that it would never fly over the vast light beam issuing from the side facing the airsphere we have no idea who built it visquile said it has been here for the last few tens of thousands of years and has been much modified by successive species who have thought to use it to study the airsphere and the moons parts of it are currently equipped to provide reasonable conditions for ourselves the little runabout slid inside a hangar pod stuck to the side of the largest of the spherical units it settled to the floor and they waited while the pods exterior doors revolved shut and air rushed in the canopy unsucked itself from the little crafts fuselage they stepped out into cold air that smelled of something acrid the two big doubleconeshaped drones whirred from another airlock coming to hover on either side of them there was no voice inside his head this time just a deep humming from one of them which modulated to say estodien major follow and they followed down a passageway and through a couple of thick mirrorfinish doors to what appeared to be a sort of broad gallery with a single long window facing them and curving back behind where they had come in it might have been the viewing cupola of an ocean liner or a stellar cruise ship they walked forward and quilan realised that the windowor screenwas taller and deeper than he had at first assumed the impression of a band of glass or screen fell away as he understood that he was looking at the single great ribbon that was the slowly revolving surface of an immense world stars shone faintly above and below it a couple of brighter bodies which were just more than mere points of light must be planets in the same system the star providing the sunlight had to be almost directly behind the place he was looking from the world looked flat spread out like the peel from some colossal fruit and thrown across the background stars edged top and bottom in the glinting greyblue translucency of enormous containing walls the surface was separated into long strips by numerous regularly positioned verticals of greybrown white andin the centrestark greyblack these enormous mountain ranges stretched from wall to wall across the world parcelling it up into what must have been a few dozen separate divisions between them there lay about equal amounts of land and ocean the land partly in the form of island continents partly in smaller but appreciably large islandsset in seas of various hues of blue and greenand partly in great swathes of green fawn brown and red which extended from one retaining wall to the other sometimes dotted with seas sometimes not but always traversed by a single darkly winding thread or a collection of barely visible filaments green and blue tendrils laid across on the ochres tans and tawns of the land clouds swirled speckled waved dotted arced and hazed in a chaos of patterns nearpatterns and patches brush strokes strewn across the canvas of terrain and water below this is what you will see one of the drones hummed the estodien visquile patted quilan on the shoulder welcome to masaq orbital he said five billion of them huyler males females their young this is a terrible thing were being asked to do it is but we wouldnt be doing it if these people hadnt done something just as terrible to us these people huyler these people right here on masaq yes these people quil youve seen them youve talked to them when they discover where youre from they tone it down for fear of insulting you but theyre so obviously proud of the extent and depth of their democracy theyre so damned smug that theyre so fully involved theyre so proud of their ability to have a say and of their right to optout and leave if they disagree profoundly enough with a course of action so yes these people they share collective responsibility for the actions of their minds including the minds of contact and special circumstances thats the way theyve set it up thats the way they want it to be there are no ignorants here quil no exploited no invisibles or troddenupon working class condemned forever to do the bidding of their masters they are all masters every one they can all have a say on everything so by their own precious rules yes it was these people who let what happened to chel happen even if few actually knew anything about the details at the time do only i think that this is harsh quil have you heard even one of them suggest that they might disband contact or reignin sc have we heard any of them even suggesting thinking about that well have we no no not one oh they tell us of their regret in such pretty language quilan they say theyre so fucking sorry in so many beautifully expressed and elegantly couched and delivered ways its like its a game for them its like theyre competing to see who can be most convincingly contrite but are they prepared to really do anything apart from tell us how sorry they are they have their own blindnesses it is the machines we have our real argument with it is a machine you are going to destroy and with it five billion people they brought it upon themselves major they could vote to disband contact today and any one or any group of them could leave tomorrow for their ulterior or for anywhere else if they decided they no longer agreed with their damned policy of interference it is still a terrible thing were asked to do huyler i agree but we must do it quit ive avoided putting it in these terms because it sounds so portentous and im sure its something youve thought about yourself anyway but i do have to remind you four and a half billion chelgrian souls depend on you major you really are their only hope so im told and if the culture retaliates why should they retaliate against us because one of their machines goes mad and destroys itself because they will not be fooled because they are not so stupid as we would like them to be just careless sometimes even if they do suspect anything they will still not be certain it was our doing if everything goes according to plan it will look like the hub did it itself and even if they were certain we were responsible our planners think that they will accept that we brought about an honest revenge you know what they say huyler dont fuck with the culture we are about to i dont buy the idea that this is some piece of wisdom the other involveds have arrived at thoughtfully after millennia of contact with these people i think its something the culture came up with itself its propaganda quil even so a lot of the involveds seem to think its true be even slightly nice to the culture and it will fall over itself to be still nicer back treat them badly and they and they act all hurt its contrived you have to come on really evil to get them to drop the ultracivilised performance slaughtering five billion of them at least will not constitute what theyd regard as an act of evil they cost us that we cost them that they recognise that sort of revenge that sort of trade like any other civilisation a life for a life they wont retaliate quil better minds than ours have thought this through the way the culture will see it theyll confirm their own moral superiority over us by not retaliating theyll accept what were going to do to them as the due payment for what they did to us without provocation theyll draw a line under it there itll be treated as a tragedy the other half of a debacle that began when they tried to interfere with our development a tragedy not an outrage they might wish to make an example of us we are too far down the involved pecking order to be worthy opponents quilan there would be no honour for them in punishing us further we have already been punished as innocents all you and i are trying to do is even up that earlier damage i worry that we may be being as blind to their real psychology as they were to ours when they tried to interfere with all their experience they were wrong about us we have so little training in secondguessing the reactions of alien species how can we be so certain that we will get it right where they failed so dismally because this matters so much to us thats why we have thought long and hard about what were going to do all this began exactly because they failed to do the same thing they have become so blasé about such matters that they try to interfere with as few ships as possible with as few resources as possible in search of a sort of mathematical elegance they have made the fates of entire civilisations part of a game they play amongst themselves to see who can produce the biggest cultural change from the smallest investment of time and energy and when it blows up in their faces it is not they who suffer and die but us four and a half billion souls barred from bliss because some of their inhuman minds thought theyd found a nice neat elegant way to alter a society which had evolved to stability over six millennia they had no right to try to interfere with us in the first place but if they were determined to do it they might at least have had the decency to make sure they did it properly with some thought for the numbers of innocent lives they were dealing with we still may be committing a second mistake upon a first and they may be less tolerant than we imagine if nothing else quilan even if there is some retaliation by the culture however unlikely that might be it doesnt matter if we succeed in our mission here then those four and a half billion chelgrian souls will be saved theyll be admitted to heaven no matter what happens after that theyll be safe because the chelgrianpuen will have allowed them in the puen could allow the dead in now huyler they could just change the rules accept them into heaven i know quilan but there is honour to be considered here and the future when it was first revealed that each of our own deaths had to be balanced by that of an enemy it wasnt revealed huyler it was made up it was a tale we told ourselves not something the gods graced us with either way when we decided that was the way we wanted to lead our lives with honour dont you think that people realised then that it might lead to what looked like unnecessary deaths this instruction to take a life for a life of course they knew that but it was worth doing because in the long run we benefited as long as we maintained that principle our enemies knew we would not rest while we had deaths unavenged and that still applies major this is not some dry bit of dogma consigned to the history books or the stringframes in monastic libraries this is a lesson that we have to keep reinforcing life will go on after this and chel will prevail but its rules its doctrines must be understood by each new generation and each new species we encounter when this is all over and we are all dead when this is just another piece of history the line will have been held and well be the ones who held it no matter what happens as long as you and i do our duty people in the future will know that to attack chel is to invite a terrible revenge for their goodand i mean this quil for their good as well as chels its worth doing now whatever has to be done im glad you seem so certain huyler a copy of you will have to live with the knowledge of what we are about to do at least ill be safely dead with no backup or at least not one that i know about i doubt theyd have made one without your consent i doubt everything huyler quil yes are you still on board do you still intend to carry out your mission i do good fellow let me tell you i admire you major quilan its been an honour and a pleasure to share your head just sorry its coming to an end so soon i havent carried it out yet i havent made the displace youll do it they suspect nothing the beast is taking you to its bosom to the very centre of its lair youll be fine ill be dead huyler in oblivion thats all i care about im sorry quil but what youre doing theres no better way to go i wish i could believe that but soon it wont matter nothing will tersono made a throatclearing noise yes it is a remarkable sight isnt it ambassador quite stunning some people have been known to stand here or sit here and drink it in for hours kabe you stood here for what seemed like half a day didnt you im sure i must have the homomdan said his deep voice echoed round the viewing gallery producing echoes i do beg your pardon how long half a day must seem for a machine that thinks at the pace you do tersono please forgive me oh there is nothing to forgive we drones are perfectly used to being patient while human thoughts and meaningful actions take place we possess an entire suite of procedures specifically evolved over the millennia to cope with such moments we are actually considerably less boreable if i may create a neologism than the average human how comforting kabe said and thank you i always find such a level of detail rewarding you okay quilan the avatar said he turned to the silverskinned creature im fine he gestured towards the sight of the orbital surface sliding slowly past gloriously bright one and a half million kilometres away but apparently much closer the view from the gallery was normally magnified not shown as it would have been if there was nothing between viewer and view but glass the effect was to bring the interior perimeter closer so that one could see more detail the rate it was sliding past at also gave a false impression the hubs viewing gallery section revolved very slowly in the opposite direction to the worlds surface so that instead of the entire orbital taking a day to pass in front of the viewer the experience commonly occupied less than an hour quilan huyler are you ready i know the real reason they put you aboard huyler do you i believe i do and what would that be quil youre not my backup at all are you youre theirs theirs of visquile our allieswhoever they areand the military highups and politicians who sanctioned this youll have to explain major is it supposed to be too devious for a bluff old soldier to have thought of what youre not here to give me somebody to moan to are you huyler youre not here to provide me with company or to be some sort of expert on the culture have i been wrong about anything oh no no they must have loaded you with a complete culture database but its all stuff anybody could get from the standard public reservoirs your insights are all secondhand huyler ive checked im shocked quilan do we think this counts as slander or libel you are my copilot though arent you thats what you were told i was to be thats what i am in one of those oldfashioned manualonly aeroplanes the copilot is there at least partly to take over from the pilot if hes unable to perform his duties is that not true perfectly so if i changed my mind now if i was determined not to make the displacement if i decided that i didnt want to kill all these people what what would happen tell me please be honest we owe each other honesty youre sure you want to know quite perfectly youre right if you wont make the displace i make it for you i know exactly the bits of your brain you used to make it happen i know the precise procedures better than you in a way so the displace takes place regardless so the displace takes place regardless and what happens to me that depends on what you try to do if you try to warn them you drop down dead or become paralysed or undergo a fit or start babbling nonsense or become catatonic the choice is mine whatever might arouse the least suspicion in the circumstances my can you do all that im afraid so son all just part of the instruction set i know what youre going to say before you say it quil literally its only just before but thats enough i think pretty quickly in here but quil i wouldnt take pleasure in doing any of that and i dont think im going to have to youre not telling me you just thought of all this no no i thought of it a long time ago i just wanted to wait until now to ask you in case it spoiled our close relationship huyler you are going to do it arent you i wont have to take over will i i havent really had those hours of grace at the beginning and end of each day at all have i youve been watching all the time to make sure i didnt give any sign to them just in case i had already changed my mind would you believe me if i told you that you did have that time without me watching no well it doesnt really matter anyway but as you might imagine i will be listening in from now on until the end quilan again you are going to do it arent you i wont have to take over will i yes im going to do it no you wont have to take over well done son it is truly hateful but it does have to be done and it will all be over soon for both of us and many more besides all right then here we go he had made six successful displacements in a row within the mockup of the hub which had been constructed within the station orbiting the sunmoon of the airsphere six successes out of six attempts he could do it he would do it they stood within the mockup of the observation gallery faces lit by the image of an image visquile explained the thinking behind his mission we understand that in a few months time the hub mind of masaq orbital will mark the passing of the light from the two exploding stars that gave the twin novae battle of the idiran war its name visquile stood very close to quilan the broad band of lighta simulation of the image that he would see when he really stood in the viewing gallery of masaq orbital hubseemed to pass in one of the estodiens ears and out the other quilan fought the urge to laugh and concentrated on listening intently to what the older male was saying the mind that is now that of masaq hub was once embodied within a warship which played a major part in the idiran war it had to destroy three culture orbitals during the same battle to prevent them falling into enemy hands it will commemorate the battle and the two stellar explosions in particular when the light of first one and then the other passes through the system masaq lies within you must gain access to the hub and make the displacement before the second nova do you understand major quilan i do estodien the destruction of the hub will be timed to coincide with the realspace light from the second nova arriving at masaq it will therefore appear that the hub mind destroyed itself in a fit of contrition due to its guilty conscience over the actions it was responsible for during the idiran war the death of the hub mind and the humans will look like a tragedy not an outrage the souls of those chelgrians held in limbo by the dictates of honour and piety will be released into heaven the culture will suffer a blow that will affect every hub every mind every human we will have our numerical revenge and no more but we will have that extra satisfaction that costs no more lives only the additional discomfiture of our enemies the people who in effect carried out an unprovoked surprise attack on us do you see quilan i see estodien watch major quilan im watching estodien they had quit the orbiting space station he and visquile were in the twoperson runabout the two alien drones were in a slightly larger coneshaped blackbody craft alongside one of the ancient space stations pressurised containment vessels had suffered a carefully contrived blowout which looked exactly like a chance catastrophe due to longterm neglect it started to fall away on an altered orbit its new heading taking it quickly towards the vast outpouring of energies erupting from the airspherefacing side of the sunmoon they watched for a while the station curved closer and closer to the edge of the invisible light column the little runabouts headup display printed a line across the canopy for each of them showing where that edge was just before the station encountered the columns perimeter visquile said that last warhead was not a dummy major it was the real thing the other end of the wormhole is located possibly inside the sunmoon itself or possibly inside something very like it a long way away the energies involved will be very similar to what will happen to masaq hub that is why we are here rather than anywhere else the station never quite hit the edge of the light column an instant before it would have its slowly spinning erratically configured shape was replaced with a shockingly blindingly bright blast of light which caused the runabouts canopy to black out over half its area quilans eyes closed instinctively the afterimage burned behind his eyelids yellow and orange he heard visquile grunt around them the small runabout hummed and clicked and whined when he opened his eyes only the afterimage was still there glowing orange against the anonymous black of space and jumping ahead of his gaze every time he shifted it about trying in vain to see what might be left of the stricken tumbling space station there that looked good to me i think youve done it well done quil there tersono said placing a ring of red light onto the screen over a group of lakes in one continent that is where the stullien bowl is the venue for tomorrows concert the drone turned to the avatar is everything ready for the concert hub the avatar shrugged everything except the composer oh im sure he is just teasing us tersono said quickly its aura field positively shone with ruby light of course cr ziller will be there how could he not be hell be there im quite certain i wouldnt be too sure about that kabe rumbled no he will im quite positive kabe turned to the chelgrian you will be taking up your invitation wont you major quilan major what oh yes yes im looking forward to it of course well kabe said nodding massively theyll find somebody else to conduct i dare say the major seemed distracted kabe thought then he seemed to pull himself together well no he said looking to each of them in turn if my presence is really going to prevent mahrai ziller from attending his own first night then of course ill stay away oh no tersono said aura flushing briefly blue theres no need for that no not at all im sure that cr ziller has every intention of being there he may leave it until the last moment before he sets off but set off he will im quite positive please major quilan you must be there for the concert zillers first symphony in eleven years the first ever premiere outside chel you coming all this way you two the only chelgrians for millennia you must be there it will be the experience of a lifetime quilan looked steadily at the drone for a moment i think mahrai zillers presence at the concert is of more importance than mine to go knowing that i would be keeping him away would be a selfish impolite and even dishonourable act dont you think but please lets talk no more of it he left the airsphere the next day visquile saw him off from the little landing stage behind the giant hollowedout husk which had provided their quarters quilan thought the older male seemed distracted is everything all right estodien he asked visquile looked at him no he said after what looked like a little thought no we had an intelligence update this morning and our wizards of counterespionage have come up with two pieces of worrying news rather than the more common single bombshell it appears that not only do we have a spy amongst our number but also there may be a culture citizen here somewhere in the airsphere the estodien rubbed the top of his silver stave frowning at his distorted reflection there one might have hoped they could have told us these things earlier but i suppose later is better than never visquile smiled dont look so worried major im sure everything is still under control or soon will be the airship touched down eweirl stepped out the whitefurred male smiled broadly and bowed minutely when he saw quilan he bowed more deeply when he faced the estodien who patted him on the shoulder you see quilan eweirl is here to take care of things go back major prepare for your mission you will have your copilot before too long good luck thank you estodien quilan glanced at the grinning eweirl then bowed to the older male i hope everything goes well here visquile let his hand rest on eweirls shoulder im sure it will goodbye major its been a pleasure again good luck and do your duty im sure you will make us all proud quilan stepped aboard the little airship he looked out through one of the gauzy windows as the craft lifted away from the platform visquile and eweirl were already deep in conversation the rest of the journey was a mirrorimage of the route he had taken on the way out except that when he got to chel he was taken from equator launch city in a sealed shuttle straight to ubrent and then by car at night directly to the gates of the monastery at cadracet he stood on the ancient path the night air smelled fragrant with sigh tree resin and seemed thin like water after the soupthick atmosphere of the airsphere he had returned only to be called away as far as the official records were concerned he had never left never been taken away by the strange lady in her dark cloak all those months ago never descended with her to the road that led back to the world and was spotted with fresh blood tomorrow he would be summoned to chelise itself to be asked to undertake a mission to the culture world called masaq to attempt to persuade the renegade and dissident mahrai ziller composer to return to his homeplace and be the very symbol of the renaissance of chel and the chelgrian domain tonight while he sleptif all went according to plan and the temporary microstructures chemicals and nanoglandular processes which had been imparted into his brain had the desired effecthe would forget all that had happened since colonel ghej aline had appeared out of the snow in the courtyard of the monastery those hundred and more days ago he would remember what he needed to remember no more bit by bit his most available memories would be kept safe from intrusion and comprehension by all but the most obvious and damaging procedures he thought he could feel the process of forgetting starting to happen even as he recalled the fact that it would take place summer rain fell gently around him the engine sound and the lights of the car that had brought him here had disappeared into the clouds below he raised his hand to the little door set within the gates the postern opened quickly and silently and he was beckoned to come in yes well done it had crossed his mind that now he had done what he was supposed to do now that the mission was over he might startor try to starttelling the drone tersono or the hub avatar itself or the homomdan kabe or all three what he had just done so that huyler would have no choice but to disable him hopefully kill him but he did not huyler might not kill him after all just disable him and besides he would be partially jeopardising the mission it was better for chel better for the mission to make everything appear as normal until the light from the second nova poured through the system and across the orbital well that completes the tour the avatar said so my friends shall we go the drone e h tersono said chirpily its ceramic casing was surrounded by a healthy pink glow yes quilan heard himself say lets go a certain loss of control he woke slowly a little fuzzyheaded it was very dark he i i stretched lazily and could feel worosei at his side she moved sleepily towards him curling into his body to fit he put one arm around her and she snuggled closer just as he was waking more completely and deciding that he wanted her she turned her head to his smiling her lips opening she slid on top of him and it was one of those times when the sex is so strong and balanced and exalted that it is almost beyond separate genders it is as though it doesnt matter who is male and who is female and which part belongs to which person when the genitalia seem somehow at once shared and separate both belonging to each and to neither his sex was a magical entity that penetrated both of them equally as she moved over him while hers became like some fabulous enchanted cloak that had spread and flowed to cover both their bodies turning every part of them into a single sexually sensual surface it brightened very gradually as they made love and then after they had each finished and their pelts were matted with saliva and sweat and they were both panting heavily they lay side by side staring into each others eyes he was grinning he couldnt help it he looked around he still wasnt entirely sure where he was the room looked anonymous and yet extremely highceilinged and very bright he had the odd feeling it ought to be making his eyes hurt and yet it wasnt he looked at her again she had her head propped up on one fist and was looking at him when he saw that face took in that expression he felt a strange shock and then an exquisite perfectly intense terror worosei had never looked at him like this not just at him but around him through him there was an utter coldness and a ferocious infinite intelligence in those dark eyes something without mercy or illusion was staring straight into his soul and finding it not so much wanting as absent woroseis fur turned perfectly silver and smoothed into her skin she was a naked silver mirror and he could see himself in her long lithe frame perversely distorted like something being melted and pulled apart he opened his mouth and tried to speak his tongue was too big and his throat had gone quite dry it was she who spoke not him dont think ive been fooled for a moment quilan it was not woroseis voice she pushed down on her elbow and rose from the bed with a powerful fluid grace he watched her go and then became aware that behind him on the other side of the curlpad there was an old male also naked and staring at him blinking the old fellow didnt say a thing he looked confused he was at once utterly familiar and a complete stranger quilan woke panting he stared wildly around he was in the broad curlpad in the apartment in aquime city it looked to be about dawn and there was a swirl of snow beyond the dome of the skylight he gasped lights and looked around the huge room as it brightened nothing appeared to be out of place he was alone it was the day that would end with the concert in the stullien bowl which would climax with the first performance of mahrai zillers new symphony expiring light which itself would end when the light from the nova induced upon the star junce eight hundred years ago finally arrived at the lacelere system and masaq orbital with an ignoble and tearing feeling of nausea he remembered that he had done his duty and the matter was out of his hands out of his head now what would happen would happen he could do no more about it than anybody else here less in fact nobody else here had another mind aboard listening to their every thought of course since last night if not before he no longer had his hour of grace at the end and beginning of each day huyler here have you had dreams like that before you experienced it too im watching and listening for any sign you might give which would warn them whats going to happen this evening im not invading your dreams but i do have to monitor your body so i know that was one hell of a hot dream that seemed to suddenly turn pretty frightening want to tell me about it quilan hesitated he waved the lights off and lay back in the darkness no he said he became aware that he had spoken rather than thought the word at the same time as he realised that he couldnt say the next word hed thought he was going to say it would have been no again but it just never made it to his lips he found that he could not move at all another moment of terror at his paralysis and the fact he was at the mercy of somebody else sorry you were speaking there not communicating there youre ah back in charge quilan moved on the curlpad and cleared his throat checking that he controlled his own body again all i was going to say was no no need no need to talk about it you sure you havent been that distressed until now not in the whole time weve been together im telling you im fine all right okay all right even if i wasnt it wouldnt matter anyway would it not after tonight im going to try and get more sleep now we can talk later whatever you say sleep well i doubt it he lay back and watched the drylooking dark flurries of snow fling themselves whirling at the domed skylight in a soundless fury that seemed poised in meaning exactly halfway between comic and threatening he wondered if the snow looked the same way to the other intelligence watching through his eyes he didnt think any more sleep would come and it did not the dozen or so civilisations which would eventually go on to form the culture had during their separate ages of scarcity spent vast fortunes to make virtual reality as palpably real and as dismissibly virtual as possible even once the culture as an entity had been established and the use of conventional currency had come to be seen as an archaic hindrance to development rather than its moderating enabler appreciable amounts of energy and timeboth biological and machinehad been spent perfecting the various methods by which the human sensory apparatus could be convinced that it was experiencing something that was not really happening thanks largely to all this preexisting effort the level of accuracy and believability exhibited as a matter of course by the virtual environments available on demand to any culture citizen had been raised to such a pitch of perfection that it had long been necessaryat the most profoundly saturative level of manufacturedenvironment manipulationto introduce synthetic cues into the experience just to remind the subject that what appeared to be real really wasnt even at far less excessive states of illusory permeation the immediacy and vividness of the standard virtual adventure was sufficient to make all but the most determinedly and committedly corporeal of humans quite forget that the experience they were having wasnt authentic and the very ubiquity of this commonplace conviction was a ringing tribute to the tenacity intelligence imagination and determination of all those individuals and organisations down the ages who had contributed to the fact that in the culture anybody anytime could experience anything anywhere for nothing and never need worry themselves with the thought that actually it was all pretend naturally then there was for almost everybody occasionally and for some people pretty well perpetually an almost inestimable cachet in having seen heard smelled tasted felt or generally experienced something absolutely and definitely for real with none of this contemptible virtuality stuff getting in the way the avatar gave a snort theyre really doing it it laughed with surprising heartiness kabe thought it was not the sort of thing you expected a machine or even the humanform representative of a machine to do at all doing what he asked reinventing money the avatar said grinning and shaking its head kabe frowned would that be entirely possible no but its partially possible the avatar glanced at kabe its an old saying yes i know theyd reinvent money for this kabe quoted or something similar quite the avatar nodded well for tickets to zillers concert they practically are people who cant stand other people are inviting them to dinner booking deepspace cruises togethergood griefeven agreeing to go camping with them camping the avatar giggled people have traded sexual favours theyve agreed to pregnancies theyve altered their appearance to accommodate a partners desires theyve begun to change gender to please lovers all just to get tickets it spread its arms how wonderfully bizarrely romantically barbaric of them dont you think absolutely kabe said are you sure about romantically and they have indeed the avatar continued come to agreements that go beyond barter to a form of liquidity regarding future considerations that sounds remarkably like money at least as i understand it how extraordinary it is isnt it the silverskinned creature said just one of those weird flashfashions that jumps out of the chaos for an instant every now and again suddenly everybodys a live symphonic music fan it looked puzzled ive made it clear theres no real room to dance it shrugged then swept an arm round to indicate the view so what do you think most impressive the stullien bowl was practically empty the preparations for that evenings concert were on schedule and under way the avatar and the homomdan stood on the lip of the amphitheatre near a battery of lights lasers and effects mortars each of which quite dwarfed kabe and he thought looked a lot like weapons the crisp blue day was a couple of hours old the sun rising at their back kabe could just make out the tiny shadows he and the avatar were casting across a pattern of seats four hundred metres away the bowl was over a kilometre across a steeply raked coliseum of spun carbon fibres and transparent diamond sheeting whose seats and platforms focused around a generously circular field which could adapt itself to accommodate various sports and a variety of concert and other entertainment configurations it did have an emergency roof but that had never been used the whole point of the bowl was that it was open to the sky and if the weather had to be of a certain type well then hub would do something it almost never did and interfere meteorologically using its prodigious energy projection and fieldmanagement capabilities to manipulate the elements until the desired effect was arrived at such meddling was inelegant untidy and blunderingly coercive but it was accepted that it had to be done to keep people happy and that was ultimately hubs whole reason for being technically the bowl was a giant specialised barge it floated within a network of broad canals slowly flowing rivers broad lakes and small seas which stretched across one of masaqs more varied continentplates and along through and across which it couldalbeit rather slowlynavigate itself so providing a wide choice of external backgrounds visible through the supporting structure and above the stadiums lip including jagged snowstrewn mountains giant cliffs vast deserts carpeting jungles towering crystal cities vast waterfalls and gently swaying blimp tree forests for a particularly wild event there was a rapids course a giant quickly flowing river the bowl could descend like a monstrous inflatable riding the worlds biggest flume monumentally spinning tipping and bobbing until it encountered the vast cliffencircled whirlpool at the bottom where it simply revolved atop a swirling column of spiralling water being sucked plunging into a set of colossal pumps capable of emptying a sea until one of hubs superlifters came to hoist it bodily back up to its normal elevation among the waterways above for tonights performance the bowl would be staying where it was at the point of a small peninsula on the shores of bandel lake guerno plate a dozen continents to spinward from xarawe the peninsulas point housed a collection of underground access points various elegantly disguised storage and support buildings a broad concourse lined with bars cafes restaurants and other entertainment venues and a giant bracketshaped dock where the bowl underwent any necessary maintenance and repair the bowls inbuilt strategic tactile sound and light systems even without any inperson participatory enhancement were as good as they could possibly be hub took responsibility for the remaining external conditions the bowl was one of six all specifically constructed to provide venues for events which needed to be held outside they were distributed across the world so that there ought always to be one in the right place at the right time no matter what the required conditions though of course kabe felt bound to point out you could have just one and then slow down or speed up the whole orbital to synchronise been done the avatar said sniffily i rather thought it might the avatar looked up ah ha directly overhead just visible through the morning haze above a tiny roughly rectangular shape was glowing with reflected sunlight what is that that is the equator class general systems vehicle experiencing a significant gravitas shortfall the avatar said kabe saw its eyes narrow fractionally and a small smile formed about its lips and eyes it changed its course schedule to come and see the concert too the avatar watched the shape grow bigger and frowned itll have to move from there though thats where my airburst meteorites are coming through air burst kabe said he was watching the glowing rectangle of the gsv enlarge slowly that sounds ah dramatic dangerous might seem a more suitable word he thought the avatar shook its head it too was watching the giant craft as it lowered itself into the atmosphere above them na its not that dangerous the avatar said apparently but presumably not actually reading his mind the shower choreography is pretty much all set up there might be a few bits of soft stuff that could still outgas and need retrajectoring but they all have their own escort engines anyway the avatar grinned at him i used a whole bunch of old knife missiles reactivated war stock which seemed appropriate reckoned they needed the practice they looked back up into the sky the gsv was now about the same size as a hand held out at full arms stretch features were starting to appear on its goldenwhite surfaces all the rocks are fully set up fired up and forgotten long ago the avatar continued sliding in simple as rings on an orrery no danger there either it nodded at the gsv which was close and bright enough now to be casting its own light over the surrounding landscape like a strangely rectangular golden moon floating over the world that is the sort of thing hub minds cant help get worried about the avatar said hoisting one silvery eyebrow a trillion tonnes of ship capable of accelerating like an arrow out of a bow coming close enough to the surface for me to feel the curve of the fuckers gravity well if it wasnt fielded out it shook its head gsvs it said tutting as though over a mischievous but cute child do you think they take advantage of you because you used to be one kabe asked the giant craft seemed to have come to a halt at last filling about a quarter of the sky some wispy clouds had formed underneath its lower surface concentric shells of field showed up as barely visible lines around it like a set of cavernous nested bubbles floating in the sky damn right the avatar said any nativetohub mind would be baking its fuses at the very thought of letting something that big come inside perimeter they like ships on the outside where if anything ever did go wrong theyd just fall away the avatar laughed suddenly im telling it to get the hell out of my jet stream now it is of course being rude the clouds forming underneath the giant ship started to flow in and flute upwards the experiencing a significant gravitas shortfall was starting to draw away clouds boiled up around it like a million contrails forming at once and lightning flickered between the blossoming towers of vapour look at that ruining the whole morning the avatar shook its head again typical gsv that little display had better not stop my nacreous clouds forming this evening or therell be big trouble it looked at kabe come on lets ignore this showoff and go below i want to show you the engines on this thing but cr ziller your public is back on chel and would probably pay good money to see me hung drawn and burned my dear ziller that is exactly my point im sure what you say is a gross if understandable exaggeration but even if it were remotely true quite the opposite applies here on masaq there are huge numbers of people who would gladly give their own lives to save yours it is them i was referring to as im sure you well know many of them will be at the concert tonight the rest will all be watching immersed they have waited patiently for years hoping that one day you might feel inspired to complete another long work now that it has finally happened they cannot wait to experience it as fully as possible and pay you the homage they know you deserve they are desperate to be there and hear your music and see you with their own eyes they crave to see you conduct expiring light this evening they can crave all they like but theyre going to be disappointed i have no intention of going not if that suppurating piece of deskfodder is going to be present but you wont meet well keep you separate ziller stuck his big black nose up towards tersonos pinkblushed ceramic casing causing the drone to shrink back from him i do not believe you he told it what because im from contact but thats ridiculous i bet kabe told you that it doesnt matter how i found out i have no intention of trying to force you to meet major quilan but youd like it if i did wouldnt you well the drones aura field suddenly rainbowed with confusion would you or wouldnt you well of course i would the machine said wobbling in the air with what looked like anger frustration or both its aura field looked confused ha ziller exclaimed you admit it naturally i would like you to meet it is absurd that you havent but i would only want it to happen if it occurred naturally not if it was contrived against your expressed wishes shh here comes one now but shh pfesine forest on ustranhuan platewhich was about as far away from the stullien bowl as it was possible to get without leaving masaq altogetherwas famous for its hunting ziller had journeyed there from aquime late the night before stayed in a very jolly hunting lodge woken late found a local guide and gone to neckjump kussels janmandresiles he thought he could hear one of them coming now shouldering its way through the dense bush bordering the narrow path directly beneath the tree he was hiding in he looked over at his guide a stocky little guy in antique camouflage gear who was squatting on another bough five metres away he was nodding and pointing in the direction of the noise ziller held onto a branch above him and peeked down trying to see the animal ziller please the drones voice said sounding very odd in his ear the chelgrian turned sharply to the machine floating at his side and glared at it he held one finger to his lips and shook it the drone went muddy cream with embarrassment i am talking to you by directly vibrating the inner membrane of your ear there is no possibility that the animal you and i ziller whispered through clenched teeth leaning very close to tersono am trying to concentrate now will you fucking shut up the drones aura blanched briefly with anger then settled to grey frustration mixed with spots of purple contrition it quickly rippled into yellowgreen indicating mellowness and friendliness hatched with bands of red to show it was taking this as a bit of a joke and will you stop that fucking rainbow shit ziller hissed youre distracting me and the animal can probably see you too he ducked away as something very large and mottled blue passed underneath the branch it had a head as long as zillers whole body and a back broad enough to have accommodated half a dozen chelgrians he stared down god he breathed those things are big he looked over at his guide who was nodding down at the animal ziller gulped and dropped the fall was only about two metres he landed on all fives and was at the beasts neck in one bound swinging his feet over its neck on either side of its fanlike ears and grabbing a handful of its dark brown crest mane before it had time to react tersono floated down to accompany him the kussels janmandresile realised it had something stuck to the nape of its neck and let out a deafening shriek it shook its head and body as vigorously as it could and charged off along the path through the jungle ha ha ha ha ha ha ziller yelled clinging on while the huge animal bucked and shook beneath him the wind whipped past leaves fronds creepers and branches went zinging by making him duck and dodge and gasp the fur round his eyes pushed back in the breeze the trees to either side of the path passed in a bluegreen blur the animal shook its head again still trying to dislodge him ziller the drone e h tersono shouted riding the air just behind him i cant help noticing you arent wearing any safety equipment this is very dangerous tersono ziller said teeth rattling as the beast beneath him went thudding along the winding trail what will you bugger off there was some sort of break in the canopy ahead and the animals pace increased as it went downhill pitched forward ziller had to lean way back towards the things pounding shoulders to stop himself from being pitched over the animals head and trampled underfoot suddenly through the trailing fronds of moss and pendulous leaves there was a glint of sunlight from the forest floor a broad river appeared the kussels janmandresile thundered down the path and through the shallows in great kicking lines of spray then threw itself into the deep water in the centre ducking down and buckling its front knees as it went to throw ziller off head first into the water he woke up spluttering in the shallows being dragged on his back towards the river bank he looked up and behind and saw tersono pulling him with a maniple field coloured grey with frustration he coughed and spat was i out for a bit there he asked the machine a few seconds composer tersono said hauling him with what looked like enormous ease up onto a sandy bank and sitting him up it was probably just as well you went under it told him the kussels janmandresile was looking for you before it crossed to the far side it probably wanted to hold you under or drag you to shore and stamp on you tersono went behind ziller and thumped his back while he coughed some more thank you ziller said bent over and spitting up some of the river water the drone kept thumping away but dont the chelgrian continued think this means im going to go back to conduct the symphony in some fit of gratitude as if i would expect such graciousness composer the drone said in a defeated voice ziller looked round surprised he waved away the machines field doing the thumping he blew his nose and smoothed his facefur down you really are upset arent you he said the drone flashed grey again of course im upset cr ziller you nearly killed yourself there youve always been so dismissive even contemptuous of such dangerous pastimes what is the matter with you ziller looked down at the sand hed torn his waistcoat he noticed damn hed left his pipe at home he looked around the river flowed on past giant insects and birds flitted over it dipping diving and zooming on the far bank something sizeable was making the deep fractaleaf sway and quiver some sort of longlimbed bigeared furry thing was watching curiously from a branch high in the canopy ziller shook his head what am i doing here he breathed he stood up wincing the drone put out thick maniple fields in case he wanted to lean on them but did not insist on helping him up what now composer oh im going home really yes really ziller squeezed some water from his pelt he touched his ear where his terminal earring ought to be he glanced out at the river sighed and looked at tersono wheres the nearest underground access ah i do have an aircraft standing by in case you dont want to bother with the an aircraft wont that take forever well its more of a little space craft really ziller took a breath and drew himself up brows furling the drone floated back a little then the chelgrian relaxed again all right he breathed moments later a shape that looked like little more than an ovoid shimmer in the air swooped down between the trees overhanging the river rushed towards the sandbank and came to an instant stop a metre away its camouflage field blinked off its sleek hull was plain black a side door sighed open ziller looked narroweyed at the drone no tricks he growled as if he stepped aboard the snow flew up against the windows in swirls and eddies that seemed sometimes to take on patterns and shapes he was looking out at the view at the mountains on the far side of the city but every now and again the snow forced him to focus on it just half a metre in front of his eyes distracting him with its brief immediacy and taking his mind off the longer perspective so are you going to go i dont know the polite thing would be not to go so that ziller will true but what is the point of politeness when some of these people will be dead at the end of the evening and when i certainly will be its how people behave when theyre faced with death that shows you what theyre really like quil you discover whether they really are as polite and even as brave as i can do without the lecture huyler sorry i could stay here in the apartment and watch the concert or just do something else or i can go to hear zillers symphony with a quarter of a million other people i can die alone or i can die surrounded by others you wont be dying alone quil no but you will be coming back huyler no only the me i was before all this will be coming back even so i hope you wont think im being too sorry for myself if i regard the experience as being rather more profound for me than for you of course not at least zillers music might take my mind off it for a couple of hours dying at the climax to a unique concert knowing you produced the final and most spectacular part of the light show seems a more desirable context for quitting this life than collapsing over a cafe table or being found slumped on the floor here next morning i cant argue with that and theres another thing the hub mind is going to be directing all the inatmosphere effects isnt it yes theres talk of aurorae and meteorite showers and the like so if the hubs destroyed theres a good chance something could go badly wrong at the bowl if zillers not there hell probably live you want him to yes i want him to hes little better than a traitor quil youre giving your life for chel and all hes done is spit on all of us youre making the greatest sacrifice a soldier can make and all hes ever done is whine run away soak up adulation and please himself you really think its right that you go and he survives yes i do that sonofapreybitch deserves well no im sorry quil i still think youre wrong about that but youre right about what happens to us tonight it does mean more to you than me i guess the least i can do is not try to argue the condemned male out of his last request you go to the concert quil ill take my satisfaction from the fact itll annoy the hell out of that scumbag kabe said a distinctive voice from the homomdans terminal yes tersono i have succeeded in persuading ziller to return to his apartment i think theres just the hint of a chance he might be wavering on the other hand i have just heard that quilan is definitely going would you do meall of usthe possibly incalculably enormous favour of coming here to help try and persuade ziller to attend the concert nevertheless are you sure id make any difference of course not hmm just a moment kabe and the avatar stood just in front of the main stage a few technician drones were floating about and the orchestra were filing off stage after their final rehearsal kabe had watched but hadnt wanted to hear a trio of earplugs had fed him the sounds of a waterfall instead the musiciansnot all human and some of them human but very unusual lookingwent back to their rest suite doing a lot of muttering they were troubled that one of hubs avatars had conducted the rehearsal it had done a creditable impression of ziller though without the short temper bad language and colourful curses one might kabe thought have imagined that the musicians would have preferred such an eventempered conductor but they seemed genuinely concerned that the composer might not be there for the real performance to conduct the work himself hub kabe said the silverskinned creature turned to him it was dressed very formally in a severe grey suit yes kabe could i get to aquime and back in time to catch the start of the concert easily the machine said is tersono looking for reinforcements on the ziller front you guessed it appears to believe i may be of assistance in persuading him to attend the concert it might even be right ill come too shall we underground it or take a plane a plane would be quicker yes it would displacing would be quickest i have never been displaced lets do that i have to draw your attention to the fact that a displace incurs an approximately one in sixtyone million chance of utter failure resulting in death for the subject the avatar smiled wickedly still willing certainly there was a pop preceded by the briefest impression of a silver field disappearing alongside them and another avatar stood beside the one hed been talking to dressed similarly but not identically kabe tapped his nosering terminal tersono yes said the drones voice the silverskinned twins bowed fractionally to each other were on our way kabe experienced something he would later characterise as like having somebody else perform a blink for you and as the avatars head rose back up after its brief bow suddenly they were both standing in the main reception room of zillers apartment in aquime city where the drone e h tersono was waiting expiring light the late afternoon sun shone through a kilometrehigh gap between the mountains and the cloud ziller came out of the bathroom puffing his fur dry with a powerful little handheld blower he frowned at tersono and looked mildly surprised to see kabe and the avatar hello all still not going anything else he threw himself down onto a big couch and stretched out rubbing the fluffedup fur over his belly i took the liberty of asking ar ischloear and hub here to attempt to reason with you one last time tersono said there would still be ample time to get to the stullien bowl in a seemly manner and drone i dont know what you dont understand ziller said smiling its perfectly simple if he goes i dont screen please stullien bowl a screen outholod burst into life across the whole of the wall on the other side of the room protruding just beyond the furniture the projection filled with a couple of dozen views of the bowl its surroundings and various groups of people and talking heads there was no sound with the rehearsal finished some enthusiasts could be seen already making their way into the giant amphitheatre the drone swivelled its body quickly jerking once to indicate it was looking at first the avatar and then kabe when neither said anything it said ziller please tersono youre in the way kabe will you talk to him certainly kabe said nodding massively ziller how are you im well thank you kabe i thought you were moving a little awkwardly i confess i am a little stiff i was neckjumping a kussels janmandresile earlier this morning and it threw me you are otherwise uninjured some bruises i thought you disapproved of such activities all the more so now you wouldnt recommend it then certainly not for you kabe if you neckjumped a kussels janmandresile youd probably break its back you are probably correct kabe chuckled he put one hand to cup his chin hmm kussels janmandresiles theyre only found on will you stop it screeched the drone its aura field burned white with anger kabe turned blinking to the machine he spread his arms wide setting a chandelier tinkling you said talk to him he rumbled not about him making an exhibit of himself indulging in some ridiculous socalled sport i meant about going to the bowl about conducting his own symphony i did not make an exhibit of myself i rode that giant beast for a good hundred metres it was sixty at the most and it was a hopeless neckjump the drone said doing a good vocal impression of a human spitting with fury it wasnt even a neckjump it was a back jump followed by an undignified scramble do that in a competition and youd get negative style marks i still didnt you did make an exhibit of yourself the machine shouted that simian in the trees by the river was marel pomiheker newsfeeder guerrilla journalist mediaraptor and allround datahound look the drone swept away from the screen and pointed a strobing grey field at one of the twentyfour rectangular projections protruding from the screen it showed ziller squatting on a branch hiding up a tree in a jungle shit ziller said looking aghast the view cut to a large purple animal coming down a jungle path screen off ziller said the holos disappeared ziller looked at the three others brows furled well i certainly cant go out in public now can i he said sarcastically to tersono ziller of course you can tersono yelped nobody cares you got thrown off some stupid animal ziller looked at the avatar and the homomdan and briefly crossed his eyes tersono would like me to try and argue you into attending the concert kabe told ziller i doubt that anything i might say would change your mind ziller nodded if he goes i stay here he said he looked at the timepiece standing on top of the antique mosaikey on a platform near the windows still over an hour he stretched out more fully and clasped his hands behind his head he grimaced and brought his arms down again massaging one shoulder actually i doubt i could conduct anyway pulled a muscle i think he lay back again so i imagine our major quilan is dressing now yes hes dressed the avatar said in fact hes gone gone ziller asked left for the bowl the avatar said hes in a car right now already ordered his interval drinks ziller looked briefly troubled then brightened and said ha the car was a large one half full crowded by local standards at the far end through a few embroidered hangings and a screen of plants he could hear a group of young all shouting and laughing one calm adult voice sounded like its owner was trying to keep them in order a child burst through the screen of plants looking back the way it had come almost tripping it glanced round at the adults in this end of the car it looked to be about to throw itself back through the plants again until it saw quilan its eyes widened and it walked over to sit beside him its pale face looked flushed and it was breathing hard its dark straight hair was plastered to its forehead with sweat hello it said are you ziller no quilan said my name is quilan geldri tchuese the child said putting out its hand how do you do how do you do are you going to the festival no im going to a concert oh the one at the stullien bowl yes and you are you going to the concert the child snorted derisively no theres a whole bunch of us were going round the orbital by car until we get bored quern wants to go round at least three times in a row because xiddys been round twice with his cousin but i think twice is enough why do you want to go round the orbital geldri tchuese looked oddly at quilan just for a laugh it said as though it ought to be obvious a gale of laughter burst through the screen of plants from the far end of the car sounds very noisy quilan said were wrestling the child explained before that we had a farting competition well im not sorry i missed that another peal of highpitched laughter rang down the car id better get back geldri tchuese said it patted his shoulder nice to meet you hope you enjoy the concert thank you goodbye the child took a run at the screen of plants and jumped through between two of the clumps there were more screams and laughs i know you know what i can guess what youre thinking can you that they will probably still be in the underground car system when the hub is destroyed is that really what i was thinking its what id be thinking it is tough well thank you for that im sorry were all sorry the journey took a little longer than it would normally there were a lot of people and cars stacking up to unload at the bowls subsurface access points in the lift quilan nodded to a few people who recognised him from the newsservice pieces hed done he saw one or two frowning at him and guessed they knew that by coming he was probably going to prevent ziller from attending he shifted on his seat and inspected an abstract painting hanging nearby the lift arrived on the surface and people walked out into a broad open concourse beneath a colonnade of tall straighttrunked trees soft lights shone against the dark blue of the evening sky smells of food filled the air and people thronged cafes bars and restaurants at the sides of the concourse the bowl filled the sky at the end of the broad way studded with lights major quilan a tall handsome man in a bright coat shouted rushing up to him he offered his hand and quilan shook it chongon lisser lisser news usual affiliations forty per cent takeup and rising how do you do quilan kept on walking the tall male walked to one side and a little in front keeping his head turned towards quilan to maintain eye contact im very well major and i hope you are too major is it true that mahrai ziller the composer of tonights symphony here at the stullien bowl guerno plate masaq has told you that if you attend the concert tonight then he wont no its not true he hasnt told me anything directly but would it be correct to say that you must have heard that he wouldnt attend if you did that is correct and yet you have chosen to attend yes major quilan what is the nature of the dispute between you and mahrai ziller you would have to ask him that i have no dispute with him you dont resent the fact that hes put you in this invidious position i dont think it is an invidious position would you say that mahrai ziller is being petty or vindictive in any way no so would you say hes behaving perfectly reasonably i am not an expert on mahrai zillers behaviour do you understand people who say youre behaving very selfishly by coming here tonight as that means mahrai ziller wont be here to conduct the first performance of his new work so reducing the experience for everybody concerned yes i do by now they were near the end of the wide concourse where what looked like a tall broad wall of glowing glass extending over the breadth of the pavement was slowly alternately brightening and dimming the crowds thinned out a little beyond here the barrier was a field wall set up to admit only those whod won out in the ticket lottery so you dont feel that quilan had brought his ticket with him though hed been told it was really just a souvenir and not required for entry chongon lisser obviously didnt have a ticket he bumped softly into the glowing wall and quilan stepped around him and passed on through with a nod and a smile good evening he said there were more news service people inside he continued to answer politely but minimally and just kept on walking following his terminals instructions to his seat ziller watched the news feeds following quilan with an open mouth that sonofabitch hes really going hes not bluffing hes actually going to take his seat and keep me away from my own fucking concert the stubcocked sonofapreybitch ziller kabe and the avatar watched as several remotes followed quilan to his seat a specially prepared chelgrian curlpad there was a homomdan seat next to it a space for tersono and a few other seats and couches the camera platform showed quilan sitting looking around at the slowly filling bowl and calling up a function on his terminal which created a flat screen in front of him holding the concert programme notes i think i see my seat kabe said thoughtfully and i mine tersono said its aura field looked agitated it turned to face ziller seemed about to say something then did not the avatar did not move but kabe had the impression that there had been some communication between hub mind and the contact section drone the avatar folded its arms and walked across the room to look out at the city a cold clear cobalt sky arched over the jagged surround of mountains the machine could see the bubble that was aquimes dome square there was a giant screen there relaying the scenes at the stullien bowl to a swelling crowd i confess i didnt think hed go the avatar said well he fucking has ziller said spitting the pusseyed bollockdragger i was under the impression he was going to spare you this too kabe said squatting on the floor near ziller ziller im most terribly sorry if i misled you in any way even if it was inadvertently i am still convinced that quilan strongly implied he would not be going i can only assume that something has changed his mind again tersono seemed to be on the brink of saying something its aura field altering and its casing rising a little in the air and again it appeared to subside again at the last moment its field was grey with frustration the avatar turned from the window arms still folded well if you dont need me ziller ill be getting back to the bowl cant have too many ushers and general helpers at something like this always some cretin whos forgotten how to operate an automatic drinks dispenser kabe tersono can i offer you a displace back displace tersono said certainly not ill take a car hmm the avatar said you should still make it i wouldnt hang around though well tersono said hesitantly fields flickering unless cr ziller wants me to stay of course they looked at ziller who was still watching the wall of screens no he said faintly waving one hand go go by all means no i think i ought to stay the drone said floating closer to the chelgrian and i think you ought to go ziller said sharply the drone stopped as though it had hit a wall it flushed creamily rainbow with surprise and embarrassment then bowed in the air and said just so well see you there ah yes goodbye it thrummed through the air to the doors whisked them open and closed them quickly but silently behind it the avatar looked quizzically at the homomdan kabe instantaneous travel appears to agree with me i will be happy to accept he paused and looked at ziller i too would be perfectly happy to stay here ziller we dont have to watch the concert we could ziller leapt to his feet fuck it he said through his teeth im going that piece of wriggling vomit isnt going to keep me from my own fucking symphony ill go ill go and ill conduct and ill even hang around and schmooze and be schmoozed at afterwards but if that little turd tersono or anybody else tries to introduce that selfish litterfucker quilan to me i swear ill bite the shitheads throat out the avatar suppressed most of a grin its eyes twinkled as it looked at kabe well that sounds eminently reasonable dont you think kabe absolutely ill get dressed ziller said bounding towards the internal doors wont take a moment well have to displace to give us enough time the avatar yelled fine ziller called out theres a one in sixty yes yes i know lets just risk it eh kabe looked at the broadly smiling avatar he nodded the avatar held out its arms and gave a little bow kabe mimed applause you guessed wrong what about about how ziller would jump hes coming after all is he even as he thought the question quilan became aware of people around him starting to mutter and heard the word ziller mentioned a few times as the news spread the bowl was mostly full now a gigantic buzzing container of sound and light and people and machines the brightly lit centre the empty stage where the various instruments glittered looked still and silent and waiting like the eye of a storm quilan tried not to think anything very much he spent some time fiddling with the magnifying field built into his seat adjusting it so that the stage area seemed to swell in front of him when he was happy thatlike everybody else apart from the real nomagnification puristshe had what appeared to be a ringside seat he sat back he is definitely on his way hes here they displaced well i tried youre probably worrying needlessly i doubt anything will go so far wrong here that anybodys going to be in any real danger quilan looked at the sky above the bowl it was probably dark blue or violet but it looked pitch black beyond the vague haze of the bowls rim lights there are several hundred thousand lumps of rock and ice heading straight this way converging on the sky above this place i wouldnt be too sure this is safe oh come on you know what theyre like theyll have backups on the backups octuple redundancy safety to the point of paranoia well see another thing occurred to me what supposing our allies whoever they might be have made their own plans for whats really going to happen when they trigger their surprise go on as i understand it theres no limit to what you could squeeze through the wormholes mouth supposing instead of just enough energy to destroy the hub they put through enough to annihilate it suppose they shoot an equivalent mass of antimatter through the hole how much does the hub unit weigh about a million tonnes a twomilliontonne matterantimatter explosion would kill everybody on the orbital wouldnt it i suppose it would but why would our allieslike you say whoever they might bewant to kill everybody i dont know the point is that it would be possible you and i have no idea what our masters have agreed to and from what weve been told they too might have been deceived we are at the mercy of these alien allies you are worrying too much quil quilan watched the orchestra begin to take to the stage the air filled with applause it was not the full orchestra and ziller would not appear yet because the first piece was not one of his but even so the reception was tumultuous maybe i suppose it doesnt matter much anyway not any more he saw the homomdan kabe ischloear and the drone e h tersono appearing from the nearest access way as the lights began to dim kabe waved quilan waved back tersono were going to blow up the hub the words formed in his mind he would stand up and shout them but he did not i didnt intervene you never meant to really do it really really fascinating every philosopher should experience this dont you think huyler easy son easy kabe and tersono joined the chelgrian both noticed he was weeping quietly but thought it polite not to say anything the music rang round the auditorium a vast invisible clapper in the inverted bell of the bowl the stadiums lights had sunk to darkness the light show in the skies above flickered flowed and flashed quilan had missed the nacreous clouds he saw the aurorae the lasers the induced layers and levels of clouds the flashes of the first few meteorites the strobing lines that hatched the sky as more and more streaked in the distant skies all around the bowl way out over the plains bordering the lake coruscated with silent horizontal lightning darting from cloud to cloud in streaks and bars and sheets of bluewhite light the music accumulated each piece he realised was slowly contributing to the whole whether it was hubs idea or zillers he didnt know but the whole evening the entire concert programme had been designed around the final symphony the earlier shorter pieces were half by ziller half by other composers they alternated and it became clear that the styles were quite different too while the musical philosophies behind the two competing strands were dissimilar to the point of antipathy the short pauses between each piece during which the orchestra enlarged and decreased according to the requirements of each work allowed just sufficient time for the strategic structure of the evening to filter through to people you could actually hear the coin drop as people worked it out the evening was the war the two strands of music represented the protagonists culture and idirans each pair of antagonistic pieces stood for one of the many small but increasingly bitter and widescale skirmishes which had taken place usually between proxy forces for both sides during the decades before the war itself had finally broken out the works increased in length and in the sensation of mutual hostility quilan found himself checking the history of the idiran war to confirm that what felt like they ought to be the final pair of preparatory pieces really were so the music died away the applause was barely audible as though everybody was simply waiting the complete orchestra filled the central stage dancers most in float harnesses distributed themselves about the space around the stage in a semisphere ziller took his place at the very focus of the circular stage surrounded by a shimmer of projection field the applause zoomed suddenly then dropped as quickly away the orchestra and ziller shared a mutual moment of silence and stillness a blanking field somewhere in the heavens above blinked off andup near one edge of the bowls lipit was as though the first nova portisia had just appeared from behind a cloud the symphony expiring light began with a susurration that built and engorged until it burst into a single dashingly discordant blast of music a mixture of chords and sheer noise that was echoed in the sky by a single shockingly bright air burst as a huge meteorite plunged into the atmosphere directly above the bowl and exploded its stunning frightening bonerattlingly loud sound arrived suddenly in a hypnotic lull in the music making everybodycertainly everybody that quilan was aware of including himselfjump thunder rippled round the greater amphitheatre of sky around the lake and bowl at its centre the bolts struck earth now lancing to the distant ground the sky hatched with squadrons and fleets of darting meteorite trails while the folds of aurorae and skywide effects whose origin it was hard to guess at filled the mind and beat at the eye even as the music pounded at the ear visuals of the war and more abstract images filled the air directly above the stage and the whirling tumbling interlacing bodies of the dancers somewhere near the furious centre of the work while the thunder played bass and the music rolled over it and around the auditorium like something wild and caged and desperate to escape eight trails in the sky did not end in air bursts and did not fade away but slammed down into the lake all around the bowl creating eight tall and sudden geysers of lit white water that burst out of the still dark waters as though eight vast undersurface fingers had made a sudden grab at the sky itself quilan thought he heard people shriek the entire bowl the whole kilometrediameter of it shook and quivered as the waves created by the lakestrikes smashed into the giant vessel the music seemed to take the fear and terror and violence of the moment and run screaming away with it pulling the audience behind like an unseated rider caught in the stirrup of their panicstricken mount a terrible calmness settled over quilan as he sat there half cowering battered by the music assailed by the washes and spikes of light it was as though his eyes formed a sort of twin tunnel in his skull and his soul was gradually falling away from that shared window to the universe falling on his back forever down a deep dark corridor while the world shrank to a little circle of light and dark somewhere in the shadows above like falling into a black hole he thought to himself or maybe it was huyler he really did seem to be falling he really did seem to be unable to stop the universe the world the bowl really did seem to be unreachably distant he felt vaguely upset that he was missing the rest of the concert the conclusion of the symphony what price clarity and proximity though and where lay the relevance of being there and using or not using a magnification screen or amplification when everything hed seen so far had been distorted by the tears in his eyes and all hed heard had been drowned out by the clamour of his guilt at what he had done what he had made possible and what was surely going to happen he wondered as he fell into that encompassing darkness and the world was reduced to a single not especially bright point of light aboveno more luminous than a nova distant by most of a thousand yearsif hed somehow been fed a drug he supposed the culture people would all be enhancing the experience with their glanded secretions making the reality of the experience both more and less real he landed with a bump he sat up and looked around he saw a distant light to one side again not particularly bright he got to his feet the floor was warm and with just a hint of pliancy there was no smell no sound except his own breathing and heartbeat he looked up nothing huyler he waited for a moment then a moment longer huyler huyler nothing he stood and gloried in the silence for a while then walked towards the distant glow the light came from the band of the orbital he walked into what looked like the hubs viewing gallery the place seemed to be deserted the orbital spun around him with a vast implicit unhurriedness he walked on a little past couches and seats until he came to the one that was occupied the avatar lit by the reflected light of the orbitals surface looked up as he approached and patted the curlseat next to it the creature was dressed in a dark grey suit quilan it said thank you for coming please sit down the reflections slid off its perfect silver skin like liquid light he sat down the curlseat fitted perfectly what am i doing here he asked his voice sounded strange there were no echoes he realised i thought we should talk the avatar said what about what were going to do i dont understand the avatar held up a tiny thing like a jewel grasping it in a pincer of silver fingers it glittered like a diamond at its heart was a tiny flaw of darkness look what i found major he did not know what to say after what seemed like a long time he thought huyler the moment went on time seemed to have stopped the avatar could sit perfectly utterly inhumanly still there were three he told it the avatar smiled thinly reached into the top pocket of the suit and produced another two of the jewels yes i know thank you for that i had a partner the guy in your head so we thought i have failed then havent i yes but there is a consolation prize what is that tell you later what happens now we listen to the end of the symphony it held out one slim silver hand take my hand he took its hand he was back in the stullien bowl but this time everywhere he looked straight down he watched from a thousand other angles he was the stadium itself its lights and sounds and very structure at the same time he could see everywhere around the bowl into the sky out to the horizon all around he experienced a long moment of terrifying vertigo vertigo which seemed to be pulling him not down but in every direction at once he would fly apart he would simply dissolve stick with it the avatars hollow voice said im trying to the music and the sights swamped him overwhelmed him ran him through with light the symphony rolled onwards approaching a sequence of resolutions and cadenzas that were a small yet still titanic reflection of the whole work the rest of the earlier concert the war itself those things i displaced they are i know what they are theyve been taken care of im sorry i know that the music rose like the bulging bruise of water from an undersea explosion an instant before the smooth swell ruptures and the spout of white spray bursts forth the dancers rose and fell swirled and flocked and spread and shrank images of war strobed above the stage the skies filled with light flickering staggeringly brief shadows that were obliterated almost instantly by the next detonation in the vast bombardment of fire then all fell away and quilan sensed time itself slow down the music faded to a single hanging line of keening ache the dancers lay like fallen leaves scattered about the stage the holo above the stage vanished and the light seemed to evaporate from the sky leaving a darkness that pulled at the senses as though the vacuum was calling to his soul time slowed still further in the sky near the tiny remaining light that was the nova portisia there was just the merest hint of something flickering then that stopped held frozen too the moment that was now that for all his life had been a point became that line that long note of music and that drawing sough of black from the line extended a plane which folded and folded until there was space for the viewing gallery again and there he sat still holding the hand of the silverskinned avatar he looked into himself and realised that he felt no fear no despair and no regret when it spoke it was as though it used his own voice you must have loved her very much quilan please if you can if you will look into my soul the avatar looked levelly at him are you sure im sure that long look went on then the creature slowly smiled very well it nodded after a few more moments she was a remarkable person i see what you saw in her the avatar made a noise like a sigh we surely did do a terrible thing to you didnt we we did it to ourselves in the end but yes you brought it upon us this was a terrible revenge to contemplate quilan we believed we had no choice our dead well i imagine you know it nodded i know it is over isnt it a lot is my dream this morning ah yes the avatar smiled again well that could have been me messing with your mind or just your guilty conscience dont you think he guessed he would never be told how long have you known he asked i have known since a day before you arrived i cant speak for special circumstances you let me make the displacements wasnt that dangerous only a little i had my backup by then a couple of gsvs have been here or hereabouts for a while as well as the experiencing a significant gravitas shortfall once we knew what you were up to they could protect me even from an attack like the one you envisaged we let it happen because wed like to know where the other ends of those wormholes are might tell us something about who your mysterious allies were id like to know myself he thought about this well i used to the avatar frowned ive discussed this with some of my peers want to know one ugly thought are there not enough in the world already assuredly but sometimes ugly thoughts can be prevented from becoming ugly deeds by exposing them if you say so one should always ask who has most to gain with respect chel does not in this measure count there are many involveds who might like to see you suffer a reverse one may come on its own they tend to things have been going very well with the culture over the last eight hundred years or so blinkofaneye stuff for the elders but a long time for an involved to stay quite as determinedly inplay as we have but our power may have peaked we may be becoming complacent even decadent this seems to be a pause i am meant to fill by the way how long do we have before the second nova ignites back in reality about half a second the avatar smiled here many lifetimes it looked away to the image of the orbital hanging in space before them slowly rotating it is not impossible that the allies who made all this possible are or represent some rogue group of culture minds he stared at the creature culture minds he asked now isnt that a terrible thing to have to think that our own might turn against us but why because we might be becoming too soft because of that complacency that decadence because some of our minds might just think that we need a bit of timely blood and fire to remind us the universe is a perfectly uncaring place and that we have no more right to enjoy our agreeable ascendancy than any other empire long fallen and forgotten the avatar shrugged dont be so shocked quilan we could be wrong it looked away for a moment then it said no luck with the wormholes it sounded sad we may never know now it turned to look at him again there was an expression of terrible sorrow on its face youve wanted to die since you realised youd lost her since you recovered from your wounds havent you quilan yes it nodded me too he knew the story of its twin and the worlds it had destroyed he wondered assuming it was telling the truth how many lifetimes of regret and loss you could fit into eight hundred years when you could think experience and remember with the speed and facility of a mind what will happen to chel a handful of individualscertainly no moremay pay with their lives other than that nothing it shook its head slowly we cannot let you have your balancing souls quilan we will try to reason with the chelgrianpuen its tricky territory for us the sublimed but we have contacts it smiled at him he could see his broad furred face reflected in the images delicate features we still owe you for our mistake we will do all we can to make amends this attempt does not absolve us nothing has been balanced it squeezed his hand he had forgotten they were still holding each other i am sorry sorrow seems a common commodity doesnt it i believe the raw material is life but happily there are other byproducts you are not really going to kill yourself are you both of us quilan do you really i am tired quilan i have waited for these memories to lose their force over the years and decades and centuries but they have not there are places to go but either i would not be me when i went there or i would remain myself and so still have my memories by waiting for them to drop away all this time i have grown into them and they into me we have become each other there is no way back i consider worth taking it smiled regretfully and squeezed his hand again ill be leaving everything in good working order and in good hands itll be a moreorless seamless transition and nobody will suffer or die wont people miss you theyll have another hub before too long im sure theyll take to it too but i hope they do miss me a little i hope they do think well of me and youll be happy i wont be happy or unhappy i wont be neither will you it turned more towards him and held out its other hand are you ready quilan will you be my twin in this he took its other hand if you will be my mate the avatar closed its eyes time seemed to expand exploding all around him his last thought was that hed forgotten to ask what had happened to huyler light shone in the sky above the bowl kabe lost in the silence and the darkness watched the light of the star called junce as it flickered and then blazed close enough to the earlier fading nova of portisia to all but drown it out at his side quilan who had been very quiet and still for some time suddenly slumped forward in his curlpad and collapsed to the floor before kabe could catch him what he heard tersono screech the applause was starting breath flowed out of the chelgrians mouth then he went quite still noises of shock and consternation built up around kabe andas he hunkered down and tried to revive the dead alien creatureanother bright bright light shone above exactly precisely overhead he called hub for help but there was no answer space time fear and the sudden tearing pain the huge whitefurred face suddenly filling his vision the despair and terror and the anger at having been betrayed as he woke and triedtoo late far too lateto bring his hands up in what would have been a futile gesture anyway then the ferocious thud as the creatures huge jaws slammed into his neck and the agony of the steellike hold and the instant constriction the cuttingoff from air and the shaking neck snapping brain rattling dislodging him from sense and life something rasped against his neck there went aunt sliders necklace the shaking went on something thin and broken whipped tinily against his neck as the blood sprayed out and the breath was worried out of him you bastard he thought slipping away again from the savage sidetoside thrashing the pain went on fading as he was dragged now held by the neck through the alien ship his limbs hung limp cut off from his brain he was a rag a broken puppet the corridors still smelled of rotting fruit eyes gummed with his own blood nothing to be done nothing to hope for mechanical noises then the feeling of being dropped a surface beneath him released his head felt barely joined to his body rolling onto its side sounds of growling and tearing and slashing sounds he felt ought to connect to pain to some sensation at least but which meant nothing then silence and darkness and the inability to do anything but witness this slow fadingaway of sensation itself and another small pain near the nape of his neck a final tiny jab like an afterthought almost comical failed failed to get back failed to warn failed to be the hero it was not supposed to end this way dying a lonely painful death conscious only of betrayal fear and hopelessness hissing fading cold movement being scraped along inside a sudden chill breeze then utter silence utter cold and no weight whatsoever uagen zlepe scholar felt cheated that his bloodgummed eyes prevented him from seeing the distant stars in their vacuumnaked state as he died great yoleusenive this is that which was found in the without by the servants of the hiarankebine six thousand and three hundred beats to

of the creatures cellular instruction set indicates that the form in which it appears here is not that with which it was first birthed a representation of the form it would have according to the original cellular instruction set is shown here that form was once known to us we are sure just as this one might have been once known to us the representation that you have shown here corresponds to the form which is or was known as human appended to the deep search of our memory archives which was mentioned earlier will be the image that you are showing here this search has not discovered anything of note thus far it will take a little longer to complete because of the appendment of the visual image of the human form to it human this is interesting to us though the nature of the interest is historical the creature concerned would appear to have accrued injuries that are not those one would associate with exposure to the conditions which prevail in the without that is primarily the lack of medium which absence is commonly termed vacuum and the associated lack of any temperature save the most negligible yes the creatures neck is not supposed to be of the appearance that one may see here either in the form shown physically before us or in the form which has been recreated in visual form from the biological assignment array similarly its torso appears to have been forcefully and injuriously opened while these surfaces seem to have been lacerated the creature has been bitten gouged and slashed such are the actions one would most naturally associate with the alterations to the creatures physiology what is known of these injuries and in particular what is known of their timing relative to the apprehension of the object from the without it is believed that this damage was incurred very shortly before the creature was expelled from whatever mediumcontainment artifact it inhabited prior to said expulsion the various injuries indicate that the creature was in a state not compatible with the continuance of its lifesave for immediate and most highly enabled medical assistancebefore its expulsion into the without where it would naturally die the circulatory fluid has sprayed out here here and here and then frozen subsequently as a result of the low temperatures encountered in the without the frozen nature of the creature as we see it here is as it was when it was found originally then that is the case the mediumrepelling bubble in which it can be seen to reside was emplaced before its induction from the without only very small particles of its body have been brought to ambient conditions to allow the analyses concerning which we have already communicated these small and widespread tissue damages would indicate that the creature was at least still of a temperature approximate to its normal and healthy operating state and possibly still in an alive condition when it was expelled into the without would it be the case that the hiarankebine might agree it is the case this level of mostsmall damage would indicate that the creatures remains have been exposed in the without for a long time an interval which might be of the order of a significant proportion of a grand cycle though not in the order of many such intervals the hiarankebine is of a similar belief is it the case that the direction and velocity of the creatures remains at the time of its discovery have been recorded it is the creatures remains were static in the without according to accepted definition number three to within approximately the speed of slow breath at standard temperature and pressure such vectoriality was of an orientation similar to the worlds to within a quarterparing the deep search which it was intimated was begun remains under way but has still failed to discover anything of interest what other results from the particles that have been brought to ambient conditions have been added to the store of knowledge some of the frozen liquid taken from the edges of the wound which the creature suffered upon its neck region has provided biological instruction set information which tends to indicate that the woundinflicting agent may have been an individual of the species known as the lesser reviled that is interesting their name was earlier the chelgrians or the chel before the outrage that befell the sansemin occurred to what level of completeness was the analysis of the human form which was found to be implicit in the creature that we see before us taken sufficient to provide the image which is seen here it is the case that a more complete image of the creature even to the order of recreated biological corporeality might further refine and focus the knowledge of the creatures species place in the greater world of all life this might be accomplished with equal honour and ability by the hiarankebine or by that to which these remarks are respectfully addressed the task is one we are happy to assume it is noted that the creature is still clothed and has about its neck a piece or the remains of a piece of jewellery is it the case that an analysis of any depth regarding these extraneous objects has been carried out it is not mighty yoleusenive the deep search of our stored and nonvolatile and offsystem recall functions which it was intimated was earlier begun has now concluded the creature that is before us was of the name uagen zlepe a scholar who came to study the embodiment of the self to which you speak from the civilisation which was once known as the culture these names are not known to us no matter the body of this creature must have drifted in the without for a little over the period accounted for by one complete worldcycle waiting here with that closetoimperceptible foredirected drift which was earlier mentioned until the world fulfilled another revolution about the galaxy and sailed again into this region of space this is good to know this piece of information ramifies and completes it adds considerably to the sum of knowledge as will be explained in a report to be prepared for the hiarankebine is it possible for that to whom these remarks are addressed to attend the finalisation of said report the more expeditiously to convey it to the hiarankebine it is good it may then be worthwhile carrying out further investigations which that to whom you have addressed your remarks would be glad to undertake it is to be hoped that the hiarankebine will share the pleasure that is both experienced and anticipated by the yoleusenive a series of events which before had no conclusion now may have this is satisfying to ourselves his eyes flicked open he stared straight ahead where there should have been the awful whitefurred face above him jaws hinging open or the cold stars spinning slowly as he tumbled there was instead a familiar figure hanging upside down from a branch inside a large brightly lit circular space he was sitting up in a sort of cross between a bed and a giant nest he blinked ungumming his eyes it did not feel as though it had been blood keeping them shut he squinted at the creature hanging a few metres in front of him it blinked and turned its head a little praf he said coughing his throat felt sore but at least it was properly connected to his head again the small dark creature shook its leathery wings uagen zlepe it said i am charged with welcoming you i am praf female i share the bulk of the memories associated with the fifthorder decider of the foliage gleaner troupe of the dirigible behemothaur yoleus which was known to you as praf including it is believed all those regarding yourself uagen coughed up some fluid he nodded and looked around this looked like the interior of yoleus invited guests quarters with the subdivisions removed am i back on yoleus he asked you are aboard the dirigible behemothaur yoleusenive uagen stared at the hanging creature in front of him it took him a moment or two to work out the implications of what hed just heard he felt his mouth go dry he swallowed the yoleus has evolved he croaked that is the case he put his hand up to his throat feeling the tender but whole flesh he looked slowly up and around how was i he began then had to stop and swallow and start again how was i brought back how was i rescued you were found in the without you wore apiece of equipment which stored your personality the yoleusenive has repaired and reconstructed your body and quickened your mindlife within said body but i wasnt wearing any uagen began then his voice trailed off as he looked down to where his fingers were stroking the skin around his neck where once there had been a necklace the piece of equipment that stored your personality was where your fingers are now praf confirmed and clacked her beak once aunt silders necklace he remembered the tiny sting at the back of his neck uagen felt tears well in his eyes how much time has passed he whispered prafs head tipped to one side again and her eyelids flickered uagen cleared his throat and said since i left the yoleus how much time has passed nearly one grand cycle uagen found he could not speak for a little while eventually he said one one ah galactic umm grand cycle prafs beak clacked a couple of times she shook herself adjusting her dark wings as though they were a cloak that is what a grand cycle is she said as though explaining something obvious to someone just hatched galactic uagen swallowed on a dry dry throat it was as though it was still ripped out and open to the vacuum i see he said closure she went bounding across the grass towards the cliff nostrils flared to the wind and the tang of ozone her facefur flattened in the breeze she came to the great double bowl where the land had long ago been vaporised and blown away the grass fell curving beneath her beyond lay the ocean in front the seastacks rose like the trunks of immense fossilised trees their bases awash with creamy foam she leapt a small drone had been sent to investigate the running figure its weapons were armed and ready to fire just as it was about to intercept the female and shout a challenge she came to the grassy edge of the crater and jumped what happened next was unexpected the drones camera showed the leaping figure disintegrate and turn into a flock of birds they flew past the drone flowing around its casing like water about a stone the machine twitched this way and that then turned and followed the order came to attack the flock of birds the drone instigated a preyrichenvironment targeting regime but then another order countermanded the first and told it to attack a group of three more defence drones which had just risen from the nearest seastack it curved away zooming to gain height lasers flickered from cupolas high on two of the seastacks but the flock of birds had become a swarm of insects the weapon light found few of them and those it did simply reflected it then the two laser towers began to fire at each other and both exploded in balls of flame the first drone attacked the other three as they spread out and accelerated towards the swarm of insects it shot down one before it was itself destroyed then the other two drones attacked each other swooping in and ramming at high speed in a flash and a single sharp detonation of sound much of the resulting wreckage was composed of pieces small enough to drift in the wind several small and mediumsized explosions shook each of the seastacks and smoke began to drift across the blue sky the insect swarm collected on a broad balcony and resumed the form of a chelgrian female she knocked the balcony doors down and stepped into the room alarms warbled she frowned and they fell silent the only sensory or command system not fully under her control was a tiny passive camera in one corner of the room she was to leave the complexs security monitoring system uncorrupted so that what was done was seen to be done and recorded she listened carefully she strode into the bathroom and found him in the emergency oneperson lift which had been disguised as a shower cabinet the lift had jammed in the shaft she flowed over the hole formed a partial vacuum and sucked the capsule back up she pulled open the door and reached in for the naked cowering male estodien visquile opened his mouth to scream for mercy she became insectsthey represented something of a phobia for the estodienand poured into his throat choking him and forcing open the route to his lungs and to his stomach the insects packed each tiny airsac in his lungs tight others bulked out the estodiens stomach to the point of bursting and beyond then invaded his body cavity while others rammed down into the rest of his digestive system forcing an explosion of faecal matter from his anus the estodien crashed and battered about the shower cabinet lift capsule smashing the ceramic fittings and denting the plastics more insects streamed into his ears and forced their way around his horrified staring eyes burning their way into his skull while his skin crawled and writhed with the insects which had invaded his body cavity and gone on to slide their way under his flesh the insects infested his entire body eventually as he lay thrashing on the floor on a film of his own blood they continued to insinuate their way into every bodily part of him until about three minutes after the attack had begun visquiles movements gradually ceased the insects the birds and the chelgrian female were made of edust everything dust was composed of tiny machines of varying sizes and capabilities with the exception of one type none was larger than a tenth of a millimetre in any direction interestingly the dust had originally been designed as the ultimate building material the one class of exception to the tenthofamillimetre rule was that of am nanomissiles which were only a tenth of a millimetre in diameter but an entire millimetre in length one of those lodged in the centre of the estodiens brain beside his soulkeeper while all the other components withdrew and reformed into the chelgrian female she padded away from the deflated body lying in its bloody pool the nanomissiles were she thought a giveaway to the identity of her makers an integral part of the message she was delivering she went out of the bathroom and the apartment down some stairs and across a terrace somebody shot at her with an ancient hunting rifle it was the only projectile weapon left working for several kilometres around she let the bullet pass through a hole in her chest and out the other side while a set of components in one of her eyes briefly lased and blinded the male who had shot at her in the accommodation block behind her the nanomissile embedded in visquiles brain sensed his soulkeeper about to read and save his mind the explosion of the missiles warhead destroyed the whole building debris rained down around and through her as she walked calmly away she found her second target trapped in a small twoperson flyer trying to smash his way out of the cockpit canopy with an oxygen cylinder she pulled the canopy open the whitefurred male lashed out with an antique knife it penetrated her chest and she let it hang there while she took him by the throat and lifted him bodily out of the machine he kicked and spat and gurgled the knife in her chest was swallowed inside her as she walked to the edge of the terrace he hung easily in her grip as though he weighed nothing his kicks seemed to have no appreciable effect on her whatsoever at the terrace edge she held him over the balustrade the drop to the sea was about two hundred metres the knife he had tried to harm her with appeared smoothly out of the palm of her hand like magic she used it to skin him she was ferociously quick it took a minute or so his screams wheezed out through his partially crushed windpipe she let his bloody white pelt drop away towards the waves like a heavy sodden rug she threw the knife away and used her own claws to rip him open from midlimb to groin then reached inside pulling and twisting at the same time as she let go of his neck he tumbled away finally screaming in a high hoarse voice she was still holding his stomach in her hand his intestines unravelled whipping out of his body in a long quivering line as he fell skinned and disembowelled he was light enoughand his entrails sufficiently elastic as well as firmly anchoredfor him to bounce up and down on the end of his own guts for a while jerking and quivering and shrieking before she let him fall into the salty waves she watched the splashes with chelgrian eyes for a while then became a cloud of dust in which the biggest single components were the nanomissiles by the time the warhead in eweirls brain exploded a few minutes later she had become an attenuated column of greyness sucking itself up into the sky high above epilogue it is good to have a body again i enjoy sitting here in this little cafe in this quaint hill village smoking a pipe and drinking a glass of wine and looking out over distant chelise the air is clear and the view is sharp and autumn is just beginning it is definitely good to be alive i am sholan hadesh huyler an admiralgeneral of the chelgrian combined forces retired i did not suffer the same fate as that shared by the hub mind of masaq orbital and my onetime colleague and charge major tibilo quilan the hub pulled me out of quilans soulkeeper device saved me transmitted me to one of its guardian gsvs andmuch lateri was united with my old self the one which quilan rescued twice oncewith his wife woroseifrom the military institute in cravinyr city on aorme and oncewith the navy dronefrom the wreck of the winter storm now i am a free citizen on chel again with a reasonable pension in fact two and the respect of my superiors actually two sets of them though only one lot know of the existence of the other bunch and they would resist being called my superiors i hope that i may never be needed again but if i am i will do my duty not for my old masters but for my new equals for i am by the definition i would have used up to a few years ago a traitor the chelgrian high command thought that i might have been got at in some wayeven turnedbefore the wreck of the ship was found however i seemed to check out and i certainly made all the right responses they were both right and wrong i was turned by the culture while i was still in the substrate in the institute on aorme they hadnt thought of that long before the caste war the best way to turn an individualperson or machineis not to invade them and implant some sort of mimetic virus or any such nonsense but to make them change their mind themselves and that is what they did to me or rather what they persuaded me to do to myself they showed me all there was to be shown about my society and theirs and in the end i preferred theirs essentially i became a culture citizen and at the same time an agent of special circumstances which is the uncharacteristically coy name they employ for their combined intelligence espionage and counterespionage organisation i went along with everything else to keep masaq and its people safe not to ensure its destruction i was scs insurance policy their getout clause their parachute i heard many colourful analogies if i had been told to do so i would have prevented quilan from making his displacements not taken over and done them for him had he demurred in the end it was decided that sufficient other safeguards had been put in place for the displacements to go ahead with the aim of backtracking along the attempted wormhole link to discover and even attack the involveds behind the attack this failed and to the best of my knowledge it is still not known who those mysterious allies were though im sure sc has its suspicions i spend most of my time on masaq these days often in the company of kabe ischloear we have similar roles i come back here to chel on occasion but i prefer my new home only recently kabe pointed out that he had lived in the culture for nearly a decade before he realised that when the culture calls somebody from an alien society who lives amongst them ambassador what they mean is that that person represents the culture to their original civilisation the assumption being that the alien concerned will naturally consider the culture better than their home and so worthy of promotion within it such hubris nevertheless i have met mahrai ziller he was wary at first but eventually warmed to me lately we have been talking about him accompanying me back here to chel for an informal visit perhaps early next year so i may yet accomplish the task that was only ever quilans covering story they tell me that the hub and quilan went together into total oblivion with no backups no copies no mindstates no souls left behind i suppose it must have been what they both wanted in the case of the major i believe i can understand and i still feel deeply sorry for him and the effects of a loss he could neither mourn away nor stand thoughlike a lot of people i thinki find it hard to understand how something as fabulously complicated and comprehensively able intellectually as a mind might also want to destroy itself life never ceases to surprise
