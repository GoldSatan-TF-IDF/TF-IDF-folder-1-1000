jonathan kellerman bones book in the alex delaware serie to lila special thanks to larry malmberg and bill hodgman chapter everyone does it is not a defense wrong if everyone did it that made it normal right and after chance did the research he knew he did nothing wrong googling high school cheating because writing an essay was part of the punishment finding out four out of five high school studentsthats eighty frickin percentdid it majority rules just like that thing on his social action study sheet social norms social norms are the cement that holds societies together there you go he was being a big help to society when he tried to joke about that with the parental units they didnt laugh same as when he told them it was civil rights no way could the school force him to do community service outside the school property that was against the constitution time to call the aclu that got dads eyes all squinty chance turned to mom but she made sure not to give him any eye contact the aclu big wet dad throat clear like after too many cigars because we make a significant monetary contribution to the aclu starting to breathe hard every goddamn year thats what youre saying chance didnt answer cute extremely cute thats your point well let me tell you something you cheated period that is not the kind of thing the aclu gives half a shit about language steve mom broke in dont start susan weve got a goddamn fucking serious problem here and i seem to be the only one who fucking gets it mom got all tightmouthed started plucking at her nails turned her back on both of them and did something with dishes on the kitchen counter its his problem susan not ours and unless he owns up to it we can kiss occidentalor any other halfway decent collegefucking goodbye chance said ill own up to it dad working on what sarabeth called his mr sincere look laughing as she undid her bra everyone buys mr sincere but me chancy i know its mr bogus dad stared at him hey said chance at least give me credit for handeye coordination dad let out a stream of curses and stomped out of the kitchen mom said hell get over it but she left too chance waited to make sure neither of them was coming back before he smiled feeling good because his handeye had been cool setting his razr on vibrate and positioning it perfectly in a side pocket of his loosest cargo pants the phone resting on a bunch of shit hed stuffed in there to make kind of a little table sarabeth three rows up texting him the answers to the test chance being cool about it knowing hed never get caught because shapiro was a nearsighted loser who stayed at his desk and missed everything whod figure barclay would come in to tell shapiro something look clear to the back of the room and spot chance peeking into his pocket the whole class doing the same exact thing everyones pockets vibing everyone cracking up the moment the test started because shapiro was such a clueless loser the whole semester had been like this the asshole wouldve missed paris hilton walking in nude and spreading everyone does it is not a defense rumley looking down his big nose and talking all sad like at a funeral what chance wanted to say was then it frickin should be dude instead he sat in rumleys office squeezed between his parents his head all down trying to look all sorry and thinking about the shape of sarabeths ass in her thong while rumley went on forever about honor and ethics and the history of windward prep and how if the school so chose they had the option of informing the occidental admissions office and causing dire consequences for his college career that made mom burst into tears dad just sat there looking angry at the world didnt make a move to even give her a tissue from the box on rumleys desk so rumley had to do it standing up and handing it to mom and looking pissed at dad for making him stretch rumley sat back down and moved his mouth some more chance pretended to listen mom sniffled dad looked ready to hit someone when rumley finally finished dad started talking about the familys contributions to windward mentioning chances performance on the basketball team bringing up his own time on the football team in the end the adults reached an agreement and wore small satisfied smiles chance felt like a puppet but he made sure he looked all serious being happy would be a baad move punishment hed have to take another version of the testshapiro would make one up punishment no more cell phone at school maybe this unfortunate event will have positive ramifications young man said rumley weve been thinking about a schoolwide ban there you go thought chance i did you guys a favor not only shouldnt you punish me you should be payin me like some sort of consulting deal so far so good for a second chance thought hed got off real easy then punishment the essay chance hated to write usually sarabeth did his essays but she couldnt do this one because he had to do it at school in rumleys office still no big deal then came punishment because substantive accountability has to be part of the package master brandt mom and dad agreeing the three of them going all alqaida on him chance pretended to agree yes sir i need to pay my debt and i will do so with industrious alacrity throwing in some sat vocab words dad staring at him like who are you kidding dude but mom and rumley looked really impressed rumley moved his mouth community service oh shit and here the frick he was sitting in the save the marsh office on night eleven of his thirtynight sentence shitty little pukecolored room with pictures of ducks and bugs whatever on the wall one dirty window looking out to a parking lot where no one but him and duboff parked stacks of bumper stickers in the corner he was supposed to hand out to anyone who walked in no one walked in and duboff left him by himself so he could run off to investigate how global warming got up a ducks butt what made birds hurl did bugs have big dicks whatever thirty frickin nights of this nuking his summer vacation five to ten pm instead of hanging after school with sarabeth and his friends all because of a social norm four out of five people did when the phone did ring he mostly ignored it when he did answer it was always some loser wanting directions to the marsh go on the frickin website or use mapquest rainman he wasnt allowed to make outgoing calls but since yesterday hed started to hook up with sarabeth for cell phone sex she was loving him even more for not ratting her to rumley he sat there drank from his can of jolt now warm felt the baggie in his pants pocket and thought later nineteen more nights of supermax confinement he was starting to feel like one of those aryan brotherhood dudes two and a half more frickin weeks until he was free at last doing his luther king thing he checked his tag heuer nine twentyfour thirtysix minutes and hed be good to go the phone rang he ignored it it kept going ten times he let it die a natural death a minute later it rang again and he figured maybe he should answer it what if it was rumley testing him clearing his throat and getting mr sincere ready he picked up save the marsh silence on the other end made him smile one of his friends pranking him probably ethan or ben or jared dude he said whats up a weird kind of hissy voice said up weird laughter somethings down as in buried in your marsh okay dude shut up and listen being talked to like that made chances face go all hot like when he was ready to sneak a flagrant in on some loser on the opposing team then get all innocent when the dude wailed about being nutjammed he said fuck off dude the hissy voice said east side of the marsh look and youll find it like i give a dead said hissy something real real dead laughter dude hanging up before chance could tell him to shove dead up his a voice from the door said hey man hows it shaking chances face was still hot but he put on mr sincere and looked over there in the doorway was duboff wearing his save the marsh tshirt geek shorts showing too much skinny white thigh plastic sandals that stupid gray beard hey mr duboff said chance hey man duboff gave a clenchedfist salute did you have a chance to check out the herons before you got here not yet sir theyre incredible animals man magnificent wingspread like this unfolding scrawny arms to the max youve obviously mistaken me for someone who gives half a shit duboff came closer smelling gross that organic deodorant hed tried to convince chance to use like pterodactyls man master fishers chance had thought a heron was a fish until duboff told him different duboff edged near the desk showed those gross teeth of his rich folk in beverly hills dont like when the herons swoop in during hatching season and eat their richfolk koi koi are aberrations mutations people messing with brown carp screwing up the dna to get those colors herons are nature brilliant predators they feed their young and restore nature to true balance screw those beverly hillbillies huh chance smiled maybe it wasnt a big enough smile because duboff suddenly looked nervous you dont live there do i recall correctly no sir you live in brentwood brentwood said duboff as if trying to figure out what that meant your parents dont keep koi do they nope we dont even have a dog good for you guys said duboff patting chances shoulder its all servitude pets i mean the whole concept is like slavery keeping his hand on the shoulder was the guy a fag yeah said chance inching away duboff scratched his knee frowned and rubbed a pink bump stopped by the marsh to check for trash musta got bit by something providing food for the little guys said chance thats a good thing sir duboff stared at him trying to figure out if chance was messing with his head chance brought out mr sincere and duboff decided chance was being righteous and smiled guess youre right anyway i just thought id stop in see how youre doing before your shift ends im fine sir okay check you out later man chance said uh sir its kinda close to the end duboff smiled so it is at ten you can lock up ill be by later walking to the door he stopped looked back its a noble thing youre doing chance whatever the circumstances absolutely sir call me sil you got it sil duboff said anything i should know about like what sir calls messages chance grinned flashing perfect white chompers courtesy five years of dr wasserman nothing sil he said with utter confidence chapter bob hernandez needed the money nothing but money would get him out here this early at five am pacific public storage was a fogshrouded dumplike one of those gloomy places they used for serial killer and drug shootout movies twentyfourhour facility but most of the bulbs supposed to light up the passageways between the units were out and the auctioneer had to use a flashlight at this hour no one was fully awake except for the asian guy lousy turnout compared with the other auctions bob had attended just him and four other people and the auctioneer a whitehaired guy named pete in a suit and tie the suit was cheap and brown and the tie needed viagra guy reminded bob of those shabby lawyers hanging around the downtown court building waiting to be assigned to a case la law but nothing like la law or boston legal for that matter bob wouldve loved to get hooked up with a goodlooking girl attorney like on those shows real passionate about defending him passionate about other stuff too after she saves his butt the two of them instead he got mason soto from the pds office guy went to berkeley let that fact slip into the conversation three separate times trying to bond with bob like they were homeboys talking about immigration la raza mason soto had grown up in san francisco and thought the country should open its borders to everyone bob had been raised in west covina by a thirdgeneration mexican american exmarine firefighter dad and a fourthgeneration swedish american police dispatcher mom and both his brothers were cops and the whole family including bob thought people should play by the rules and anyone who didnt should get their ass kicked out he told soto i hear you hoping that would get soto to put out some extra effort get him totally clear of the traffic warrants as well as the failure to appear soto yawned through the trial and bob ended up with a massive fine and ten days at county jail cut to five then reduced to an overnight stay because of overcrowding but man one day in that hellhole was enough the fine was a more enduring problem thirtyfive hundred bucks that he needed to come up with in sixty days and none of his landscaping jobs had come through and he was already behind on his rent not to mention the child support if kathy decided to make trouble for him he was screwed he missed the kids living in houston with kathys folks truth be told he missed kathy his own damn fault screwing around with women he didnt even care about he still didnt understand why he kept doing it hed borrowed five hundred dollars from his mom telling her it would go toward the fine but the city wouldnt take partial payment and he needed something to generate income so he could square up his rent as well as the fine yesterday the treemoving company out in saugus had called back told him to come in fill out forms maybe that would pan out meanwhile he was doing what he could up at four am making sure hed sail on the drive from alhambra to playa del rey be at the storage facility when it opened hed read about abandoned property auctions on the internet a few months ago forgot about it until being slapped with the fine not stupid enough to think he was going to come up with one of those treasures that made the papersa honus wagner baseball card or a rare paintinghis hopes were pinned on ebay because people bought anything on ebay you could sell a stool sample on ebay so far hed attended four auctions driving as far as goletawhich turned out to be a total bust but striking goldsilver actuallyright close to home pasadena facility sevenbyseven room piled high with neatly sealed boxes most of it turned out to be old moldy clothes that he ended up tossing in a goodwill box but there were also some jeans full of holes and a wad of rockconcert tshirts from the eighties that ebayed pretty good plus the bag little blue velvet crown royal drawstring full of coins including buffalohead nickels and a few silver dollars bob took all that to a coin dealer in santa monica walked away with two hundred twenty bucks which was a fantastic profit considering his bid on the entire contents had been sixtyfive he thought of paying his mom back but decided to wait until everything was squared up a yawn overtook him and his eye blurred pete the auctioneer coughed then said okay next unit fourteen fiftyfive and everyone dragged themselves up the murky tunnellike hallway to one of the padlocked doors that lined the cementblock walls flimsy doors flimsy locks bob couldve kicked any of them in the storage facility got two hundred a month per talk about a good scam fourteen fiftyfive pete repeated unnecessarily rubbing a rummy nose he fiddled with a ring of keys the other bidders worked hard at looking disinterested two were chunky old women with braided hair looked like sisters maybe even twins theyd gotten a sealed steamer trunk for fortyeight bucks behind them was a tall skinny heavymetal type wearing an ac dc tee fake leather pants and motorcycle boots veiny arms more tattooblue than white skin hed just won the last two lots a room full of dirtylooking mostly creased paperback books for a hundred and fifty and what looked to be rusty junk for thirty the last participant was the asian guy midthirties athleticlooking wearing a spotless royal blue polo shirt pressed black slacks and black loafers without socks so far hed bid on nothing freshly shaved and aftershaved the guy looked sharp in the beemer convertible he drove up in bob wondered if he was some kind of art dealer had the nose worth keeping his eye on pete found his key to released the lock opened the door stand back folks private property he said saying the same darn thing every time due to some weird state law abandoned goods belonged to the owner until the moment they sold meaning you couldnt approach them or touch them until youd bought them then poof the owners rights disappeared like a minor fart bob had never understood the legal system when lawyers talked at him it might as well have been in martian pete ran his flashlight over the contents of the celllike space bob had heard of people jerryrigging electricity and bunking down in storage units but he didnt believe it youd go nuts okay said pete lets start the bidding the asian guy said could you please illuminate it one more time pete frowned but obliged the space was mostly empty except for half a bicycle frame and two black garbage bags pete coughed again see what you need to the asian guy nodded turned his back on the unit maybe a fakeout planning to jump in at the last moment or maybe he really didnt want it bob didnt see any point in bidding on this one so far hed found that garbage bags held mostly garbage though he needed something to ebay so if no one bid and it went cheap enough lets hear a bid said pete not waiting before adding fifty do i hear fifty fifty dollars fifty fifty dollars silence forty forty dollars bargain at forty dollars metal on the bike is forty dollars running the spiel but without enthusiasm so far his commission hadnt even added up to chump change forty nothing at forty do i hear thirtyfive without turning around the asian guy said twenty and bob sensed something in his voice not shifty more like calculated figuring the metal on the bike was worth somethingjust the pedals might be valuable to someone who needed pedalsbob said twentyfive silence pete said twentyfive do i hear thirty lets hear thirty thirty dollars sure said the asian guy shrugging like he couldnt care less bob waited until pete spieled a bit more then came in for thirtyfive asian half turned forty bob said fortyfive the old ladies started looking interested uhoh but they just stood there heavy metal edged closer to the open unit fifty he whispered sixty said asian the mood in the passageway got alert and tight like strong coffee kicking in for everyone asian pulled out a blackberry read the screen turned it off maybe the bike was superrare and even half of it would bring serious bucks bob had heard of old schwinnslike the one hed ditched when he turned sixteen and got his licensegoing for crazy money sixtyfive said heavy metal asian hesitated bob said seventy asian said seventyfive eighty a voice awfully like bobs nearly shouted everyone stared at him asian shrugged pete looked at heavy metal whod already walked away and was massaging a tattoo eighty dollars for this trove said pete do i hear eightyfive eightyfive dollars still a bargain at eightyfive going through the motions not pushing it going once going twice eighty it is banging that little plastic palmgavel against his clipboard scrawling on his sheet and telling bob youre the lucky winner of the trove eighty bucks cash on the barrel holding out a mottled palm for payment everyone smiling like there was some private joke and bob was the butt a cold soupy feeling filled his stomach cash sir said pete bob dug into his pocket later out in the parking lot loading the bags and the half bike into his truck he caught the asian guy before he got in his beemer you do this a lot me guy smiled pleasantly first time actually im an anesthesiologist have to be at marina mercy by six thought it might help wake me up and it kind of did what got you bidding on fourteen fiftyfive guy looked surprised by the question i was going to ask you the same thing back home by seven flies buzzing around the yucca plants that fronted his apartment building a cruel sun fizzing through his dusty windows bob unloaded the garbage bags onto the floor of his grubby little living room figuring hed catch some sleep before the first bloody mary of the day then go through his haul then call the tree farm in saugus he collapsed in his bed still wearing dusty auction clothes closed his eyes thought about kathy his fine what his brothers said behind his back got up and fetched a kitchen knife and sliced through the first garbage bag inside were game boxesmonopoly scrabble risk but cracked and messed up missing everything except the boards great the second bagthe heavier oneheld crumpledup newspapers period why would someone pay to store shit like this with a real bad stomachache coming on bob got down on the floor and pawed through weeks of la times nothing antique no historic headlines just newsprint and those stupid ad inserts that fell all over the place oh man he shouldve stayed in bed he said idiot out loud and examined the half bike cheap flimsy junk made in china sticker pasted to what remained of a crossbar that bob could bend with his hands disgusted he mixed a mary in the kitchenette sat down on the floor and drank thinking about eighty wasted bucks made him more tired than ever but leaving the bags around reminded him he was an idiot time to haul the whole damn load out back to the dumpsters finishing his mary he labored to his feet tossed the papers back in the second bag lifted something rattled bottom of the bag probably his imagination he shook the bag hard rattle rattle rattlelike one of those maracas they sold on olvera street kathy had bought him a pair of those when they were dating figuring what he was half mexican so hed half like it he pawed through the papers reached bottom found the source of the noise wooden box dark shiny long as a shoe box but wider with curly brass inlay nice lacquer finish little brass latch holding it shut ebay here we come the box alone hed call it exotic imported whatever maybe make up a story about it coming from malaysia no something more mysterious where was mount everesttibet nepal exotic boxexotic jewel casefrom the nepal alps made of solid choice mountain looked like mahogany he could play that upsolid choice rare asian mahogany maybe stick on a buy it now for a hundred hundred thirty now lets see whats inside and if it was dry beans who cared the box alone meant he was no longer an idiot he freed the brass latch raised the lid inside was a gold velvet tray empty the noise was coming from below he lifted the tray exposed a bottom compartment inside were little white knobby things he picked one up smooth and white with a pointy tip and all of a sudden bob knew what it was without being told even though biology had never been his strong point hed flunked it once in high school repeated managed a d a bone like from a hand or a foot or a paw lots of little bones so many they nearly filled the compartment didnt make that much noise had to be what three four dozen bob counted fortytwo he examined his own hand three bones on each of the four fingers two for the thumb making fourteen per hand three hands worth or three paws worth no reason to think these werent from an animal then he thought of somethingmaybe these came from one of those skeletons they used in medical schools people willing their bodies to science getting cut up and examined and reconstructed into skeletons using wires to hold it all together nope none of these bones had holes for wires weird bob picked up another of the smallest ones held it alongside the top joint of his own index finger not as big as his maybe a small dog or a woman or a kid no that was too had to be a dog or a cat how many bones in a paw or a claw too small for a cat a mediumsized dog like alf yeah this might fit alf he missed alf living in dallas with kathy was thinking about all that when he shut the latch the box rattled bones hed do a little research on the internet maybe sell the collection as antiqueslike from an indian archaeology dig out in utah or colorado colorado sounded more exotic antique collection of exotic bones stuff like that ebayed great chapter milo had a fancy job title courtesy the new police chief special case investigator lieutenant grade or as he put it hoohah poobah bigass sitting mallard what it came down to was he avoided most of the paperpushing that came with his rank kept his closetsized office at west la division continued to work his own homicides until downtown called and pointed him elsewhere two calls had come in over the last fourteen months both rampart division gangrevenge shootings not even close to whodunits but the chief still feeling his way in la had heard rumors of fresh rampart corruption and wanted liability insurance the rumors proved false and milo had concentrated on not being a nuisance when the cases closed the chief insisted his assignees name be on the reports even though i was as useful as a stoneblind trapshooter made me real popular easy metaphor the morning he came up with it the two of us were blasting away at clay pigeons on a simi valley firing range late june dry heat blue skies khaki hills milo lumbered through all five positions of the voiceactivated trap setup hitting percent without much effort last year hed been the target of a shotgunwielding psychopath still carried pellets in his left shoulder id emptied an entire box of shells before accidentally nailing one of the bright green disks as i racked the browning and drank a warm soda he said when you shoot you close your left eye so so maybe youre righthanded but lefteyed and its throwing you off balance he had me form a triangle with both hands positioned my fingers so the space between them was filled by a dead tree off to the east shut the left one now the right which one makes it jump more i knew the eye dominance test had run it years ago as a psych intern researching brain laterality in learning disabled children never tried it on myself the results were a surprise milo laughed sinistereyed now you know what to do also stop rejecting the damn thing i said what do you mean but i knew exactly what he was talking about youre holding it like you cant wait to ditch it hefting the gun and handing it over embrace itlean forwardyeah yeah like that ive fired pistols and rifles in ugly situations dont enjoy firearms any more than going through dental work but i appreciate the value of both shotguns with their elegant lethal simplicity were another story up till today id avoided them twelvegauge remingtons had been my fathers playthings of choice an pumpaction wingmaster purchased at a police auction stood in a corner of dads closet almost always loaded like dad summerslate junehed make me tag along on squirrel and smallbird hunts stalking flimsy little animals with absurd firepower because all he wanted to do was obliterate using me to search the bloody dust bring back a bone fragment or a claw or a beak because i was more obedient than a dog scared of his mood swings in a way no dog could ever be my other assignments were keeping my mouth shut and toting his camouflagepattern gear bag inside along with his cleaning kit and boxes of ammo and the odd dogeared playboy were the silverplated whiskey flask the plaid thermos of coffee the sweating cans of blue ribbon the reek of alcohol on his breath growing stronger as the day wore on ready deadeye said milo shut the right open the left and leanmoreeven more make yourself part of the gun there you go hold that and dont aim just point eyeing the bunker pull half an hour later you hit more than i did pal ive created a monster at ten thirty we were loading the trunk of my seville when milos cell phone beeped the first six notes of my way he listened while following the ascent of a redtailed hawk his big pale face tightened when okay an hour click time to head back to anticivilization drive por favor as we got on the east he said body dumped in the bird marsh in playa some volunteer found it last night pacific divisions on it but i said pacifics shorthanded cause of gang suppression issues the only free guy is a rookie his holiness wants augmented problem child who knows anyway thats the official story yet you wonder he pushed a lick of black hair off a pocked brow stretched his legs ran his hand over his face like washing without water the marsh is political right and the chiefs a politician as i drove back toward the city he phoned for details got a sketch recent kill white female twenties evidence of ligature strangulation removal of the entire right hand by way of a surgically clean cut one of those he said time to keep both your eyes open doctor the bird marsh is a twoacre triangle of uneasy compromise half a mile east of the ocean where culver and jefferson and lincoln boulevards intersect three sides of the triangle face multilane thoroughfares condominiumcrammed bluffs loom over the southern edge the lax flight plan brings in mechanical thunder the bulk of the wetlands occupies a bowllike depression well below the view of passing motorists and as i parked across the street all i could see was summerbrown grass and the crowns of distant willows and cottonwoods in la anything that cant be appreciated from a speeding car doesnt count and federal protection for the flora and fauna sandwiched between all that progress has remained elusive five years ago a film studio run by a klatch of selfproclaimed progressive billionaires had tried to buy the land for an environmentally friendly movie lot funded by taxpayer money shielded from public exposure the plan progressed smoothly the usual soul kiss between big money and small minds then a talkradio dyspeptic found out and latched on to the conspiracy like a rabid wolverine leaving spokespeople tripping over each other in the rush to deny the savethemarsh volunteer group that formed soon after disavowed the shock jocks tactics and accepted two priuses donated by the billionaires so far no sign of earthmovers i turned off the engine and milo and i took a few minutes to soak in the long view cute little woodburned signs fashioned to resemble summer camp projects were too distant to read id visited last year with robin knew the signs granted street parkinga generosity now rendered irrelevant by yellow tape and orange cones a larger white sign directed pedestrians to remain on the footpath and leave the animals alone robin and i had figured on a hike but the path covered less than a fifth of the marshs perimeter that day id spotted a scrawny bearded man wearing a save the marsh badge and asked about the lack of access because humans are the enemy milo said onward and we crossed the street a uniform stationed in front of the tape swelled his chest like a mating pigeon and blocked us with a palm when milos gold shield flashed the cop said sirs and stepped aside looking cheated two vehicles were parked in a gap between the coneswhite coroners van unmarked gray ford explorer i said the body was removed last night but the crypt crews back fancy that a hundred feet north two other uniforms walked out of some foliage and climbed up to the sidewalk then a broadshouldered stocky man in blue blazer and khakis appeared brushing off his lapels blazer seemed to be studying us but milo ignored him and peered up at the mountain of condos gotta be a hundred units minimum alex all those people with a clear view and someone chooses this place to bodydump all those people with a clear view of nothing i said why nothing no streetlights around the marsh after sunset the place is ink youve been here at night theres a guitar shop in playa del rey that runs concerts from time to time a few months ago i came to hear flamenco im talking nine nine thirty the place was deserted ink he said almost like a genuine bucolic nature preserve i told him about my daytime visit the limited access while you were here you didnt happen to see a slavering bad guy skulking around wearing a largeprint name tag and offering a dna sample sorry never met oj he laughed checked out the bluff again turned and scanned the expanse of the marsh the cops were still there but the man in the blazer was gone birds and froggies and whatever sleeping through the whole damn thing we slipped under the tape walked toward a white flag waving from a high metal stake the stake was planted five or so feet off the path set in dirt solid enough to hold it still but a few yards in the soil melted to algaeglazed muck the path continued for a few yards then took a sharp turn voices behind the bend led us to three figures in white plastic coveralls squatting in shallow water partially hidden by saw grass tule and bulrushes submersion in water could slow decomposition but moisture combined with air exposure could speed it up as would heat and this year june was starting to feel like july i wondered what state the body was in not ready to think about who the body had once been the stocky man materialized around a second curve walked toward us while removing a pair of mirrored shades young ruddy dirtyblond crew cut lieutenant moe reed pacific detective reed moes fine this is dr alex delaware our psychological consultant psychological said reed because of the hand because you never know said milo reed gave me a long look before nodding his unshielded eyes were clear round baby blue the blazer was squarecut made him look boxier than he was pleats and cuffs on the khakis bright white wash n wear shirt greenandblue rep tie crepesoled brown oxfords dressed like a middleaged preppie but late twenties tops with the shortlimbed barrelchested build of a wrestler the barleycolored buzz cut topped a round smooth face the sun would ravage he smelled like a day at the beach fresh application of sunscreen hed missed a spot on his left cheek and the flesh was heading toward mediumrare a car door slamming caught our attention two attendants got out of the coroners van one lit a cigarette and the other watched his partner smoke milo eyed the whiteclad women in the water detective moe reed said forensic anthropologists lieutenant the body was buried no sir left out on the bank no attempt to conceal had id left on it too selena bass address in venice i went over there at seven am its a converted garage no one was home anyway in terms of the anthropologists visibility was poor so i thought it would be a good idea to bring in a k unit make sure we hadnt missed the hand we hadnt but the dog got all excited reed rubbed his left nostril turns out there were complications the belgian malinois named edith a search dog not a cadaver dog lieutenant but apparently it doesnt always matter had arrived with her handler at one thirty am sniffed around the dump site then proceeded to race into the marsh stopping at a spot thirty feet south of the body she dove into the outer lip of a pocket of brackish silt no more than six feet from the bank freezing in place barking when the handler didnt get there fast enough howling ordered back on land the dog just sat there the handler asked for hip waders those took another half hour to arrive and the dog stayed in place for ten minutes suddenly bolted setting in another spot farther up the marsh panting like she was proud of herself said moe reed guess she should be by five am three additional bodies had been confirmed moe reed said the others seem to be mostly bones lieutenant could be one of those indian burial rights situations one of the crypt drivers had come over he said sure dont smell like ancient history maybe its natural gas the driver grinned or the chili someone had for dinner or frijoles growing in the marsh moe reed said ill let you know when you can go and led us toward the trio of anthropologists groinhigh in browngreen soup the women conferred earnestly around another staked white pennant that drooped in the warm static air if they saw us they gave no notice we kept going around the next bend were the other two flags like a weird golf course we retraced two of the scientists were young one black one white both had crammed ample coiffures into disposable caps an older woman with shortchopped gray hair noticed reed and waved hey dr hargrove any news normally wed be setting up the angles for trenching but this is protected land and were not sure what the parameters are i can try to find out weve already got a call in to the volunteer office someone should be here soon more important the earth gets so soft in spotsinconsistently sothat were afraid well do more damage than good in terms of finding everything there is to find she smiled at least its not quicksand im pretty sure the young women laughed small metal tools gleamed in their hands moe reed said whats the plan then dr hargrove were going to need time to poke around the best technique may be to eventually slide something under whatevers in here raise it up very gradually and hope nothing falls off one thing i can tell you were not talking paleontology theres soft tissue present under the mandible of this one and possibly behind the knees the skin weve been able to observe appears dark but that could be decomp fresh said reed not nearly as fresh as the one left out in the open but i cant give you a fix water can rot or preserve depending on so many factors were getting moderate ph for samples in the immediate area despite all the detritus but there could still be some kind of buffering effect due to specific vegetation that mediates the effects of acid rain plant decay all that good stuff i really cant tell you more until i get everything out of here soft tissue said reed thats pretty recent right probably but not necessarily said hargrove a few years ago they pulled a civil war vet out of a mass grave in pennsylvania poor fellow just happened to end up in a lowoxygen lowhumidity pocket near a series of subterranean caves and still had skin and muscle adhering to his cheeks most of it was mummified but some wasnt his beard looked freshly trimmed unbelievable said reed catching the eye of the young black anthropologist and turning away no way you can guesstimate for me doctor off the record off the record ill go out on a limb and say probably not decades there is one thing the right hands gone from all of them but we havent started examining closely there could be other parts missing animal scatter said reed dont imagine coyotes or raccoons diving into this but you never know some of the bigger birdsherons egrets even a pelican or a gullmightve picked out a tidbit or two or a human predatorsomeone taking a trophy well backtrack weather reports try to find out if wind on water couldve been a factor in terms of drift and alteration of surface temperature complicated said milo hargrove grinned its what we live for but im sorry for you guys the young black anthropologist pretty with a heartshaped face and a bow mouth said something to hargrove hargrove said thank you liz to us dr wilkinson wants you to know that all three bodies seem to be facing east was that true of the one left out in the open reed thought as a matter of fact it was interesting dr wilkinson spoke up on the other hand were talking about an n ofa small sample from which to draw a significant conclusion reed said four out of four sounds significant to me doc wilkinson shrugged the other young anthropologist freckled and rosycheeked said east as in facing the dawn some sort of ritual facing mecca said hargrove she grimaced we wont even go there reed had kept his eyes on dr liz wilkinson thanks for being so observant wilkinson tugged at her hair cap just thought you should know chapter reed milo and i returned to the entrance of the marsh the coroners van was gone two uniforms remained on guard looking bored one said the ghouls went to catch a bite reed said any ideas lieutenant sounds like youve got everything covered the young detective fiddled with his sunglasses tell you one thing im happy for the help whys that its shaping up like a team case right milo didnt answer and reeds sunburned spot turned crimson to be honest im not exactly sherlock lieutenant how long on the job joined the department after college made detective two years ago started at central gta i just got transferred to homicide last february congratulations reed frowned picked up two cases since then besides this one i mean one closed in a week but anyone couldve done it total nobrainer the second ones an icycold missing person im not sure will ever be solved pacific sends mp cases to homicide not generally said reed rich connections the kind you definitely want to make happy but cases have their own rhythm said milo takes time to get your footing id seen him lose sleep gain weight and experience soaring blood pressure over unsolveds reed studied the soft brown dirt of the marsh a brown pelican soared aimed its massive beak downward changed its mind and flew back toward the pacific milo said lets talk about selena bass reed pulled out his pad female caucasian twentysix years old five five one ten brown and brown one registered vehicle a nissan sentra it was at her apartment didnt look disturbed so were not talking a jacking no signs of obvious forced entry maybe she went off with someone she knew and things got nasty where in venice reed read off an address on indiana south of rose west of lincoln milo said gang stuff going on there right some banger snatches her it wouldnt be much of a drive from there to here so sure we could be talking about a convenient dump site but those other bodies they could also be vics from basss neighborhood a ganghit thing or said milo a creepo thing he watches them stalks them grabs them reed frowned strangeronstranger a bellowed hey made the three of us turn a scrawny bowlegged bearded man in a white tshirt high green cargo shorts and flipflops strode toward us pumping his arms same fellow whod snarled the surly remark about humans three months ago hey he repeated no one answered whats going on moe reed said you are silford duboff save the marsh this is my place im here to keep an eye on all proceedings your place said reed no one else cares reed extended a hand duboff took it reluctantly as if fearing contamination whats going on whats going on sir is early this morning we removed the body of a young woman who was murdered and left on the banks of the marsh while processing the scene we found at least three other bodies silford duboff blanched processing youre digging nothing extensive out of the question duboff noticed the flag marking selena basss dump site whats that doing here thats where we found the first victim sir and as i said three other women all dead duboff rubbed his beard this is a disaster reed removed his sunglasses babyblue eyes had narrowed id call four dead bodies a disaster you said at least three more are you implying there could be more threes what weve got so far mr duboff oh crapwhere are the others i need to look duboff started to head for the flag milos big arm held him back what duboff demanded no access yet sir thats absolutely unacceptable milo showed teeth sir its eminently acceptable duboff said whats the reason police personnel are working the scene what do you mean working examining particulars duboff yanked on his beard this is a protected site you just cant have cops parking their grubby forensic anthropologists sir anthrotheyre excavating i absolutely must talk to them right now we appreciate your concern mr duboff but these people are specialists and they respect every site this isnt just a site its a beautiful place said milo the only thing that will be removed is evidence thats outrageous so is homicide sir this is worse said duboff worse than four bodies said reed im not i appreciate the fact that people have died but when push comes to shove all humans do is alter the balanceyour murders are perfect proof of what we keep murdering the earth then we wonder why lifes so brutal i said sounds like you dont have much use for people duboff stared at me not a hint of recognition as a matter of fact im a cardcarrying misanthrope but i dont kill anything that breathes oxygen pointing to his flipflops organic rubber he eyed the white flag what im saying is we need to ensure that this rare pocket of tranquility remains that way seems to me said reed that its already been disturbed then lets not make matters worse i must have a talk with those ditchdiggers reed looked at milo milo said after you answer a few questions he loomed over duboff began peppering the increasingly flustered man with a mix of relevant and seemingly random questions eventually zeroing in on duboffs whereabouts during the past twentyfour hours duboff said you suspect me sir these are the questions we need to who cares where i was last night but fine ive got nothing to hide nothing i was home reading jutting his chin enjoying utne reader if you must know you live alone said milo duboff smiled yes but often a friend stays over a bright altruistic sensuous woman who just happens to be in sebastopol at the green fiber music festival when did your murder take place were still determining that sir duboff said it had to be after eight oclock because i stopped by the marsh at eight and trust me there were no bodies how long were you here briefly to check for trash after that i bought a sandwich at the allnight market on culver greens and tempeh if you must know then i dropped over at my office to see how our volunteer was doing he huffed rich brat got assigned to us for a community service punishment he was doing fine so i left him and drove to santa monica and ate my sandwich on ocean front then i returned to the office at ten oh five to make sure the brat had locked up which was fortunate because he hadnt by ten thirty i was with my utne find any trash at the marsh said milo not this time oh yes alma my companionwas due to call me from sebastopol at eleven fifteen and she did your volunteer said moe reed whats he being punished for something to do with school said duboff i didnt ask couldnt care less hes no asset but he doesnt cause problems alma said reed taking out his pad last name please duboffs eyes bugged why would you want to talk to her routine unbelievable im here to safeguard the marsh and you stormtroop me reed said thats a little harsh sir is it i think not milo said alma what good godfine fine reynolds alma reynolds he recited a phone number satisfied now you must let me through we followed duboffs racewalk to the anthropologists work site moe reed caught up asked duboff if the name selena bass was familiar the only bass i know and care about are the striped ones grievously overfished because of american fleshlust i said people wondering if hed finally remember me he said that song is absolute nonsense barbra had it completely wrong dr hargroves team had removed a few small brown fragments and placed them on a blue tarp laid out on the bank all three women were back in the water heads close to the surface sifting peering duboff said what is that reed said human bones duboff cupped his hand and called to the scientists be careful you the women looked up milo said this gentleman safeguards the marsh duboff said dont make it sound trivial this gentleman safeguards the marsh importantly dr hargrove said sir were being extremely careful making sure not to upset anything your very presence means the marsh has been upset hargrove liz wilkinson and the freckled scientist stared duboff took another look at the bones milo said sir we need to clear out let them do their job speaking of which do you have one mr duboff what are you implying milo didnt answer i most definitely did worked at the midnight run bookstore they closed down last year ergo did said duboff over the years i made some investments can afford to take my time looking and no wisecracks about oil and gas stocks okay i dont own any boy said milo must be hard on the shoulders what is carrying around a chip the size of a redwood duboffs mouth dropped open taking hold of his arm milo said nice meeting you sir and guided him back to the street reed and i watched the two of them walk to duboffs dusty jetta duboff shook a finger at milo milo remained impassive duboff got in the car still ranting drove off milo returned scissoring his hand to mimic moving jaws reed said weird and hostile but i guess if he was guilty hed have tried to be friendly one part of his story is definitely truestopping by the office after nine and talking to the volunteer the kids name is chance brandt and hes part of how we found out about selena in the first placewhat i was about to tell you before numb nuts interrupted us tell away reed looked at his watch better yet how about we meet the kid facetoface i can fill you in along the way all ive had is phone contact with his father want to make sure i get the facts right ive got an appointment at their house in thirty going to be tight unless we start out now you drive well ride along detective reed milo sat shotgun in reeds blueblack crown victoria i got in back moe short for moses yes sir ah youre thinking about a baby floating in the reeds the whole marsh thing it did occur to me reed laughed back when i was born my mother was kinda biblical a beat later moses never got to see the promised land milo said tell me about the brandt kid chapter goodlooking kid insolent eyes chance brandt sprawled on an oversized brocade sofa in the oversized great room of an oversized mediterranean mansion on old oak road in brentwood the house smelled of takeout pizza and expensive perfume chance wore tennis clothes so did his mother a stunning longlegged blonde with seagreen eyes and obviously dominant chromosomes some of her frosted lipstick had caked and her mouth was pale she wanted to hold her sons hand but didnt dare sitting on the boys other side was dad dark beefy hugechinned bald still in blue dress shirt and gold hermès tie enraged attorney always a joy to behold unbelievable now this steve brandt glared at his son as if oedipus had materialized the boy said nothing brandt said i do wills and estates cant help you here chance susan brandt said im sure theres nothing to help her husband aimed venomous eyes her way she gnawed her lower lip rosy folded her arms moe reed said chance tell us what happened steve brandt snorted without benefit of counsel i think not sir if all he did was take a phone call theres no need for counsel chance smiled his father flushed somethings funny genius susan brandts breath caught as if snagged on barbed wire green eyes moistened milo said as detective reed explained were investigating a homicide if chance is involved he absolutely does need legal advice and we want him to have it as soon as possible but we have no indication of that certainly its your prerogative to request a lawyer in any circumstance and if thats the route you take well have this conversation at the police station in an interview room with videotaping paperwork et cetera youre threatening me said steve brandt his smile was unpleasant absolutely not sir its simply what wed need to do at this point chance isnt being looked at as anything other than a witness to a phone call at that so i really dont see why you wouldnt want to cooperate fully chances eyes shifted to us no more smugness just confusion steve brandt folded his arms across his chest milo said okay sir please make sure chance is here tomorrow at seven am when we send a squad car for him or if the paper clears sooner it could be tonight he started to rise steve brandt said hold on let me talk to my son in private then ill inform you which way were going with this mess fair enough milo sat back down we work hard to be fair one hundred fiftyeight seconds later father and son returned to the room walking four feet apart father said hell tell you everything but could you please let me know how things got to this point so ill know hes being straight with me son stared at a window with a view of a blackbottomed pool moe reed looked at milo milo nodded reed said at eleventhirty pm we received a call about a dead person in the bird marsh the caller heard about it from someone who heard about it from chance how do you know that said steve brandt our caller said someone had phoned the marsh volunteer office earlier that evening talked to chance told him to look for a body chance thought it was a joke our caller took it seriously whos the caller were checking that out the boys posture remained slack but sweat had popped on his forehead thirdhand gossip said susan brandt that doesnt sound like much her husband glared she began fooling with a frenchtipped thumbnail steve brandt said kids blabbing and fantasizing thats the sum total mightve been said reed except we did find a body and mode of death was homicide swiveling toward chance we need to know exactly what happened the boy didnt speak his father placed a hand on his shoulder thick fingers digging into white pique nothing tender about the gesture chance squirmed out of his grip tell them what you know and lets finish with this like you said someone called said the boy reed said who some asshole with a weird voice language chance said susan brandt in a defeated voice moe reed said weird how um like hissy hissy whispery like one of those grinder movies some deathbot whatever someone disguising their voice by hissing yeah can you imitate this person let us know what it sounded like chance laughed do it said his father im not in drama dad youve caused plenty of drama in this family shrug whatever do it the boys lips formed an f steve brandts knuckles whitened milo said someone hissed at you chance what did they say like uh theres something down in the marsh something dead what else thats it male or female male probably you cant be sure it was like hissy bogus faking said reed yeah i thought i was being pranked by who whatever friends milo said prince albert in a can chances stare was uncomprehending milo said something dead in the marsh uhhuh what else did this hissing person say nothing said chance it sounded stupid thats why i didnt tell it to the guy who came in right after what guy said reed guy who runs the place real tool always checking on me whats the tools name said reed duboff hes like a hippie you read about in history mr duboff came into the office right after you took the call i didnt take it i just listened and hung up how soon after did duboff come in like right checking up on you yeah and you told him everythings cool you made no mention whatsoever of the hissing call i thought it was bogus said chance ethan or ben sean whatever peering at us as he dropped the names trying to figure out whod given him away reed said what time did this hissy call come in um um umlike um nine thirty like articulate said steve brandt his wife looked ready to cry reed said can you give a more precise estimate chance said it was like oh yeah before i looked at my watch and it was like nine twenty something so it was after that nine thirty or so uh yeah i guess jesus said steve brandt its not rocket science chances shoulders bunched his mother had gnawed her lip scarlet his father said i think its obvious math isnt his strong suit thats how we ended up in this mess in the first place the indignity of an algebra test that required minimum effort to pass chance chewed his lip more genetics or would living with steve brandt drive anyone to it brandt loosened his tie were still trying to figure out if he has a strong suit his wife gasped get real suze if he hadnt cheated in the first place wed never be talking to the cops to us maybe as long as youre here we should set up some tough love for my son one of those programs you put youthful offenders into working at the morgue getting in touch with reality susan brandt got up and hurried out on elegant bronze legs chances eyes were fixed on his fathers florid face brandt said you bet im pissed kiddo works piling up and i have to come home in the middle of the day for this and youre playing tennis mom said i should get some exer brandt waved the boy silent to milo do you still run those morgue tours im not sure sir from what i recall they were for juvenile drunk drivers and such so once again he skates completely chances lips moved what did you just say his father demanded silence milo said mr brandt we understand that youre frustrated with whatever actingout chance has done in the past but from our perspective hes being cooperative if all he did was talk about what he perceived to be a gag call theres nothing to skate on if hes somehow involved in this homicide a tour of the morgue wont cut it some of the color left steve brandts face of course hes not involved im just trying to prevent any more complications chance said im complications his father smirked oh you dont want me to answer that the boys turn to flush do your thing dudehook me up to one of those fucking lie detectors shut your stupid foul mouth and dont use that snotty stupid tone chance shot to his feet fists balled dont call me that dont fucking call me that steve brandts hands slapped brocade he panted chances respiration rate raced ahead of his fathers milo stepped between them everyone calm down right now chance sit downover there where your mom was mr brandt let us do our job i wasnt aware i was doing anything but this is a homicide case sirlots of long days for us we need to make sure that after we leave we wont be called back on a domestic violence complaint ridiculoushave i ever hit you chance ever no answer have i chance smiled shrugged his father cursed serpents tooth chance was still on his feet milo said sit the boy obeyed son i want a quick answer to this how soon after the call did mr duboff appear right after seconds that fit duboffs story either hed dumped selena bass himself or the killer had watched duboff clear out before venturing forward or the killer had gotten lucky and just missed duboff either way the murder had been called in soon after the dump someone wanting selena bass found and identified quickly burying three other bodies that hed concealed but growing confident and progressing to boasting claiming the marsh as his turf duboff or someone like him moe reed said whod you tell about the hissing call just sarabethwhod she rat me out to whats sarabeths last name steve brandt said oster as in malls and shopping centers when none of us responded theyre bigtime live in brentwood park sarabeths their only child she comes across sweet and innocent but shes the one gave him the answers to that goddamn algebra test so id take anything she says with a pillar of salt chance growled his father said ooh im shaking chapter steve brandt walked us out to a fauxcobblestone motor court used a clicker to hold his front gate open so hes clear so far sir trust me officers hes too dumb to kill anyone smiling with sour satisfaction he walked back to the heat and light of his home moe reeds call to tom l rumley headmaster of the windward academy achieved a promise to ascertain all the relevant information about the call to chance brandt at an expedited rate the tradeoff no police visit to the school at the present time because its hiatus time and were entertaining visitors from dubai reed put rumley on hold lieutenant milo said most likely it will boil down to a blab chain so give him a chance to make good either of you hungry we returned to the marsh and picked up the seville as reed followed us to west la milo said what do you think about the case or reed both he seems thoughtful eager to learn plenty to learn about this case four bodies that kind of appetite i said no reason to stop at four i can always count on you for good cheer café moghul on santa monica boulevard blocks from the station serves as milo s second office the bespectacled saried woman who runs the place beamed the way she always does when milo steps through her door besides the gargantuan tips she regards him as a human rottweiler reeds obvious cop presence following close behind brought her to the verge of ecstasy lobster she announced seating us at milo s rear table humming and smiling and filling glasses with cloved iced tea ill bring fresh platters everything milo said everythings a good concept as he removed his jacket and tossed it on a nearby chair reed took off his blazer draped it neatly his white shirt was shortsleeved his biceps filled most of the sleeves the food parade began reed said you must tip great milo said boy why does everything in this world have to be about money sometimes milo talks shop over food other times he views eating as a sacrament not to be disrupted by worldly matters this afternoon was a holy day moe reed watched him bolt and chew and swallow and wipe his face caught on quickly and bent over his own plate like a convict heaps of lobster rice lentils spiced eggplant spinach with paneer cheese vanished quickly as the young detective outate milo his frame was thick but hard as teak just as the bespectacled woman brought rice pudding his cell beeped reed eyebrows so pale they fought for recognition arched steeply yes sir hold on while i get something to write on reaching behind he retrieved his pad printed neatly thank you sir no not at this time sir click headmaster rumley says he traced the gossip stream completely the brandt kid told sarabeth oster who also thought it was hilarious she told a girl named ali light and ali told her boyfriend justin coopersmith and he thought it was so darn funny he passed it along to his older brother a duke sophomore named lance home for the summer lance coopersmith seems to be more moral than the others hes the one who called us said he felt it was his duty should be easy enough to verify reed nodded i asked for a trace this morning came in on the nonemergency so it takes longer than a and theres no audio want me to check now go for it moments later verizon cell phone registered to lance allan coopersmith address in pacific palisades any sense following up not for the time being said milo gonna be a long day have some lobster pulling out his own phone he requested a warrant on selena basss apartment i left the seville in the westside lot returned to the back of reeds unmarked for the twentyminute drive to indiana avenue milo used the time to follow up on the warrant request granted telephonically with paper to follow you run her beyond dmv he asked reed yup nothing on the badguy sites i was planning to google her today milo logged on to reeds mobile dispatch terminal and got on the internet nice talking straight to god here we gotwo hits ones an exact copy of the other looks like shes a piano teacherintroducing a student at a recital named kelvin vander an image search pulled up nothing reed said piano teacher isnt exactly high risk milo said nothing like a sad song to kick off the week what about all those other bodies lieutenant lets see what the bone pickers come up with meanwhile we work with what weve got i tossed in my thoughts about someone with a thing for the marsh milo said could be reed said nothing selena basss converted garage was a double set behind a white stucco onestory duplex the front unit blanketed by banana plants and mock orange was occupied by the ownerlandlady an ancient eminence in a wheelchair named anuta rosenfield a cheerful filipina caretaker ushered us into a diminutive front room muffled by pink velvet drapes and crowded with houseplants and porcelain figurines on precarious stands she will be a hundred this january the old woman didnt stir her eyes were open but clouded her lap too flimsy to support one of her bisque dolls milo said thats wonderful and stooped close to the wheelchair maam could we have a key to ms basss apartment the caretaker said shes deaf cant see either ask me all the questions pointing to her chest luz luz could we of course guys out of her uniform pocket came the key appreciate it is she okayselena you know her i dont really know her but sometimes i see her mostly when i leave sometimes shes leaving too whens the last time you saw her hmm now that you mention it not for a while and you know what i havent seen lights on in her place for the last few days at least deep breath and now you guys are here oh boy a few days said reed maybe four said luz could be five i dont keep count whats she like never talked to her we just smile and say hi she seemed nice pretty girl skinnyno hips the way they are now milo said what time do you usually leave work seven pm someone else takes over the night shift mrs rosenfields daughter comes home at seven elizabeth shes a nurse at saint johns whispering conspiratorially seventyone but she still likes to work the neonatal iculittle babies thats how i met her im an lvn also did the nicu i like the babies but i like this better she patted her charges shoulder mrs r is a very nice person a sweet smile tangoed across the old womans lips someone had powdered her face blued her eyelids manicured her nails the air in the room was close and heavy roses and wintergreen milo said what else can you tell us about selena bass hmm said luz like i said nice maybe a little shy like maybe she doesnt want to have a long conversation i never heard elizabeth complain about her and elizabeth complains whats elizabeth s full name elizabeth mayer shes a widow just like her mommy downturn of eyes we all three have that in common ah said milo sorry for your loss it was a long time ago mrs rosenfield smiled again hard to know what that meant reed said who lives in the other unit a man from france whos almost never here a professor french i think mostly hes in france hes in france now name head shake sorry youd have to ask elizabeth i dont see him five times in two years nicelooking man long hairlike that actor the skinny one johnny depp milo said sounds like things are pretty quiet around here very quiet ever see selena with a friend a friend no once i saw a guy said luz waiting out by the curb for selena and she got into his car what kind of car sorry i didnt see could you describe him he had his back to me and it was dark tall short said reed mediumoh one thingim pretty sure he had no hairshaved like those basketball players do light bounced off his head was he a white man said reed well said luz not black thats for sure although i guess he couldve been a light black guy im sorry it was just his back i guess he couldve been anything did he do something to selena maam at this point were not even close to a suspect thats why anything you did see is important a suspect so shes afraid so said reed oh no her eyes watered thats very sad such a young one oh my i wish i could tell you more milo said youre doing great could i please have your full name for the records as well as a contact number luz elena ramosis it dangerous to stay here theres no reason to think that wow said luz this is a little scary id better be careful im sure youre fine ms ramos but carefuls always good when you showed up i guess i knew something happened i work in a hospital for eight years know what bad news looks like selena basss four hundred square feet of space couldnt shrug off its automotive origins cracked cement floors had been painted bronze and lacquered but oil blotches peeked through the gloss and a faint petroreek lingered a dropped ceiling of whitewashed drywall panels compressed the room the same material was used for the walls tacked haphazardly to the underlying lath tape seams were visible nailheads erupted like promnight acne highend construction said milo reed said maybe the piano wasnt bringing in the bucks we gloved up stood in the doorway took in the entire space no obvious signs of violence or disorder milo said well call in the techies but im not seeing this as the operating room he stepped in and we followed a right angle of black masonite cabinets sectioned off a tiny corner kitchenette spacesaver refrigerator microwave twoburner electric cooktop in the fridge bottled water condiments a rotten nectarine limp celery a single carton of takeout chinese in a generic carton moe reed checked his gloved hands inspected the box sweetandsour chicken tinted caltrans orange he tilted the box gelled stiff got to be at least a week old a queen mattress sat on the floor sheathed by a brown batik throw and piled with too many overstuffed madras pillows milo peeled back a corner of the throw lavender sheets clean unruffled he sniffed shook his head what sir said reed no smellsno detergent body odor perfume zilch like it was changed but not slept in he moved on to an almostbirch nightstand containing lightweight sweats a white flannel nightgown a cheap digital alarm clock a comb milo peered at the comb no hair i can see but maybe the tweezer squadll find something speaking of which detective reed reed phoned the criminalists and milo continued his circuit of the room he checked out a tall yellow plastic garbage can empty additional pillows strewn randomly supplied extra seating plumped and firm as if theyd never borne weight storage came by way of a threedrawer plywood dresser and a sixfoot steel closet painted olive drab to the left of the closet was a lav barely wide enough for one person to stand in nylon curtain instead of a door fiberglass shower home depot sink and commode a flimsy medicine cabinet sat on the floor everything spotless and dry the cabinet was empty the exception to all the barebones aesthetic was a wall devoted to a pair of electric keyboards an amp a mixing board a twentyinch flatscreen monitor on a black stand two black folding chairs and several waisthigh stacks of sheet music reed examined the music classical more classical some indie rock more classical milo said no stereo no cds reed said theres probably an ipod somewhere then wheres the computer that makes all the other gizmos operative reed frowned someone cleaned up the two of them went through the dresser and the metal closet jeans tshirts jackets underwear in small sizes tennis shoes boots black highheeled sandals red pumps white pumps one end of the hanging rack in the closet bore half a dozen dresses in optimistic colors no discs laptops anything related to computers reed kneeled in front of the dresser slid open the bottom drawer whoa inside was a leather bustier two sets of fishnets three pairs of orangetrimmed black crotchless panties a trio of cheap black wigs three enormous purple dildos each of the hairpieces was shoulderlength with short bangs a blue vinyl sewing box held bottles of white face makeup black eyeliner tubes of lipstick the color of an old bruise when reed pulled it out a small black leather riding crop rolled forward milo said dominatrix in her spare time maybe her real pads someplace else and she used this dump for partying reed seemed transfixed by the garments maybe she also gave her music lessons here lieutenant doubtful no real piano no instruction books milo shut the drawer took in the room if this was her main crib she led a pretty bare life even accounting for a cleanup five minutes inside and im ready to gulp some prozac he returned to the metal closet ran his hand over the top shelf well looky here down came a cardboard macys box stuffed with papers on top was selena basss tax return from last year income of fortyeight thousand from freelance musical consulting ten grand worth of equipment and supplies deductions beneath that he found thirteen monthly checks clipped together in a precise stack four thousand dollars each written on the global investment co account of the simon m vander family trust address on fifth street in seattle same memo for every payment in block printing lessons for kelvin reed said the kid on the web milo said nearly fifty k a year to teach junior how to tickle the ivories one student paying all the bills maybe hes got serious talent some kind of prodigy or someone thinks he does how about going out to the car and running simon vanders name the kid too you bet milo resumed examining the papers in the macys box a california id depicted a thinfaced bigeyed girl with a pointy cleft chin and dirtyblond hair short bangs just like the wigs easy fit for dressup time i said why would she need that if she had a license he said maybe she moved here without a license got this in the interim beneath the card were receipts from a betsey johnson outlet in cabazon near palm springs and a sixmonthold credit card bill for five hundred dollars recently paid off after six months of mounting interest at the typical usurious rate at the bottom sat a single email four months old from engrbass at a hotmail account i read over his shoulder sel so glad you finally found a job and a satisfying one to boot be well dear dont take so long next time love mom milo sighed notification time your favorite thing i said that and drowning puppies reed charged back into the apartment brighteyed and waving his pad looks like simon vanders a bigtime money guy the investment account might be in seattle but he lives here the palisades he owned a chain of supermarkets in mexican neighborhoods sold out two and a half years ago for a hundred and eleven million after that he drops off the screen except for three more hits for kelvin all recitals kids ten years old found one photo of him he flashed a grainy blackandwhite shot of a goodlooking asian boy milo showed him the email from selena basss mother reed said going to try her by computer if shes local well do it in person engrbass said reed maybe shes an engineer meanwhile should we start with the vanders see if they know anything about selenas personal life using the murdered womans first name beginning of the bond milo said thats what id do reed frowned like im inventing the wheel chapter five vehicles at two addresses were registered to simon mitchell vander at calle maritimo in pacific palisades a threemonthold lexus gx a oneyearold mercedes slk a threeyearold aston martin db and a fiveyearold lincoln town car at a malibu listing on pacific coast highway a sevenyearold volvo station wagon moe reed ran map traces la costa beach and the north end of the palisades pretty darn close maybe he likes sand between his toes said milo middle of the week im betting on the main house if that doesnt pan out we get a day at the beach the drive from venice to pacific palisades was a slow drip along lincoln not much better on ocean front followed by a quick drop onto channel road and a blue zip up the coast a charitable breeze whipped the ocean into cobalt meringue surfers and kite runners and people who liked clear lungs were out in force calle maritimo was a snaky climb above the old getty estate as the altitude climbed properties enlarged soil growing pricier by the yard reed drove fast clipping past bougainvillea hedges rock walls charitable glimpses of ocean a sign warned dead end no through traffic seconds later that promise was fulfilled by tenfoot iron gates handfashioned gates with stout posts resembling oversized stalks of coral and curving iron rods tangled like octopus tentacles on the other side of all that foundry work was an oval motor court paved with precise slate squares recently hosed slate still beaded in spots and ringed by razorcut date palms behind the trees a surprisingly modest house single story dun stucco red tile roof enclosed courtyard hiding the front door off to the side were the four cars listed on vanders reg forms reed punched the call box five rings on the intercom then silence he tried again four more rings a boyishsounding male voice said yes la police here to talk to mr simon vander police yes sir we need to talk to mr vander a beat hes not here where can we find him two beats his last stop was hong kong business trip hes traveling i can give him a message who am i speaking with sir more hesitation mr vanders estate manager name please travis could you please come out to the gate for a second mr travis can i ask what this is why dont you come out and well tell you uh hold on moments later the courtyard door opened a man in a navyblue shirt pale jeans and a large gray knit cap squinted in our direction the shirt was baggy and untucked tails flapping like breakers the jeans puddled over white sneakers the cap was pulled down over the tops of his ears he walked toward us in an unsteady gaituneven shoulders a foot that turned outward every other step on the verge of stumble when he reached the gate he studied us through iron tentacles offered an ironstreaked view of long gaunt face hollow cheeks deepset brown eyes a threeday stubble mostly black some gray coated his face same for whatever cranium the cap revealed his mouth was skewed to the left as if set in perpetual regret that and the rocky walk suggested some kind of neurological insult i put him at thirtyfive to forty young for a minor stroke but life could be cruel milo pushed his badge through the tentacles afternoon mr travis huck travis huck may we come in mr huck a longfingered hand pushed a button on a remote the gates swung inward we parked in front of the nearest date palm and got out the property was set well above its neighbors at least five acres worth of kingofthemountain rolling lawns and beds of creeping geranium maintained a low profile the punch line was a deaddrop bluff rimmed by an infinity pool that kissed the pacific up close the house lost any claims to modesty one story provided maximum ocean view but horizontal sprawl chewed up land travis huck poked a finger under his cap flicked moisture from behind his ear his face was glossy warm day for wool or maybe he just perspired easily if theres a message i can give to mr the message said milo is that a woman named selena bass was found murdered and were talking to everyone who knew her huck blinked his sad crooked mouth straightened into a position of neutrality at odds with the tension around his eyes he said selena yes sir oh no you knew her she teaches music to kelvin mr and mrs vanders son whens the last time you saw her mr huck the last time i dontlike i said she gives lessons when he needs them to kelvin huck blinked again yes same question sir pardon last time you saw her let me think said huck as if genuinely requesting permission sweat rolled down his chin dropped to the slate i want to say two weeks ago tugging at the cap no fifteen days exactly fifteen you know that because mrs vander and kelvin left the day after kelvins lesson which was fifteen days ago kelvin played bartók left for where vacation said huck its the summer reed said the whole familys traveling huck nodded can i ask what happened to selena milo said what we can tell you at this point is it wasnt pretty no response so the last time she was here was fifteen days ago exactly yes what was her state of mind she seemed fine hucks eyes fixed on wet slate i let her in saw her out she was fine reed said do you know anyone whod want to hurt her hurt her she came here to teach like the others what others kelvin is homeschooled specialists come in art gymnastics karate a curator from the gettys been tutoring him in art history kelvin doesnt like regular school said milo kelvins too bright for regular school one of hucks legs buckled and he braced himself on the hood of the unmarked his forehead was soaked moe reed said bright and a good piano player he plays classical said huck as if that settled it how long has selena bass been teaching him she i want to say a year give or take where did the lessons take place said milo where right here never at selenas house no of course not why of course not kelvin has a busy schedule said huck wasting time driving would be out of the question the piano lessons werent on a set schedule correct it depended said huck it could be once a week or every day depended on kelvins needs if he had a recital selena would be here more kelvin give a lot of recitals not too many i still cant believe she was a nice person what else can you tell us about her sir nice huck repeated quiet pleasant she always showed up on time moe reed said she got paid well to teach kelvin i wouldnt know about that you dont sign checks i just take care of the house who signs the checks mr vanders accountants whos that theyre in seattle milo said you take care of the houses plural pardon theres also a place on the beach hooking a thumb toward the ocean oh that said huck that was mr vanders house before he got married he doesnt use it much he keeps a car there the old station wagon battery s probably dead a pad right on the sand said milo pity not to use it mr vander travels extensively said huck part of kelvins homeschooling pardon enrichmentseeing the world learning about other cultures sometimes hucks brow gleamed as if brushed with egg yolk this is really upsetting you liked selena yes but its a matter of someone you knowand then theyre huck threw up his hands mr vander needs to know about this kelvin and mrs vander too theyre going to bewhere can i reach you reed handed over a card huck mouthed reeds name silently milo said were trying to locate selenas next of kin any idea where we can find them no im sorry said huck poor kelvin hell need another teacher we drove back down to pch traveled a few minutes to la costa beach where reed hung a uturn and parked in front of a cedar plank wall fortyfoot lot a few paces from the highway to the right of the wall was a cedar garage a pedestrian door was deadbolted milo rang the bell no answer he left his card wedged under the handle as we returned to the city moe reed said whatd you think of huck different kind of fellow he sure sweated a lot and something else cant put my finger on it but like he was too guarded am i off here lieutenant guy was definitely antsy kiddo but that could just be employee nervousnessafraid to upset the boss wanna weigh in alex i voiced the nerve damage theory reed said wearing a hat on a hot day is what caught my eye there didnt seem to be much hair under it mediumbuild white guy he could be the shavedhead dude luz ramos saw with selena milo thought about that reached for the mdt no criminal record on travis huck and his dmv photo showed him with a full head of curly black hair the license had been renewed three years ago hed listed his address as the house on calle maritimo milo kept typing the internet had never met the man shaving his head and being a little off aint exactly grounds for a warrant but lets keep him in mind reed said what about that loudmouth from the marsh duboff hes got a thing for the place like you said doctor obsessive even what if it has some kind of sexual significance for him so he dumps his bodies there milo said serial conservationist i said id keep him in mind too but like you said moe he didnt try to avoid attention just the opposite he got right in our faces admitted to being at the marsh right around the time selena was dumped couldnt that be reverse psychology said reed or just plain arrogancethinking hes smarter than us like those idiots who mail messages or return to the scene to gloat its possible milo s fingers were already dancing along the keyboard well look at this mr duboff has a record silford duboff had been arrested seven times in ten years every instance a confrontation at a protest march antiglobalization ruckus at the century plaza pay raises for hotel housekeepers in san francisco sitin opposing the expansion of the nuclear power plant at san onofre resisting coastal development in oxnard and ventura the seventh bust was fighting the billionaires grab for the bird marsh six of the arrests were for resisting but at the antiglobalization fracas hed been charged with assaulting a police officer pled to misdemeanor battery paid a fine conviction reversed two years later when an appeals judge hearing a classaction suit ruled lapd at fault for the nearriot i remember that one said milo big mess so the guy likes to sit in the middle of the street and chant but theres no serious violence on his sheet doesnt even merit being called a sheet more like a pillowcase reed said antiglobalization attracts anarchists and those types right which brings me back to hucks cap those guys wear stuff like that what if huck and duboff were protest buds and found out they had a common interest in nastier stuff they attend the same marches duboff gets busted but huck doesnt duboffs an inyourface guy no subtlety hucks more the sneaky type maybe thats what i was smelling about him an unholy duo said milo by day they agitate for liberation when the sun goes down they kill women and chop off the hands and toss the bodies in the muck reed drove faster i guess it is farfetched kiddo at this point farfetched is better than nothing sure look into both of them you find señor hucks name on the membership rolls of any group señor duboff marched withany link between the two of them whatsoeverand well go the killteam route i said a pair of killers would make the dump easier one guy parks the other hauls the body or they both haul are able to do it quickly and get out of there moe reed said think i should also talk to vanders accountant find out about the other teachers making house calls someone selena met on the job did her in said milo more like someone on the job could tell us more than huck did maybe we didnt find any evidence of an outside social life in her apartment because being on call for kelvin vander stopped her developing outside interests shaking his head fifty grand to teach one kid what if selenas involvement with this family is what got her dead selena and three other women with no right hands reed didnt answer moments later no outside social life but there was that bustier et cetera like you said loo maybe she partied somewhere else and so far the only place we know she spent time was the vander house drilling the kid on bartók said milo then sneaking off to the pool house for a quickie with the karate coach or huck or mr vander himself for that matter milo said the plumber the pool boy the florist the gardener reed kept silent sure call the accountants and get anything you can about the staff until we get ids on the other victims were freezedried anyway fifty grand said reed couldve led to expectations by the boss huck says vanders out of the country but the rich dont do their own dirty work they hire out milo said rich ergo evil i just think those people can get entitled to you and me moe fifty k is serious money guy like vander pays more to insure his pots and pans but sure go for it see what you dig up also check in with the anthropologists will do said reed thanks lieutenant for what the training first of all weve shared enough frustration for you to call me milo second ill send you a bill for the training stretching and laughing fifty k sound reasonable chapter back in his closetsized office milo reread the email from engrbass booting up his desktop he plugged in engineer and bass pulled up lots of hits but nothing that fit time to backtrack her email address bingo website of emily nicole greenbasslooks like she owns a vintage jewelry store in great neck new york heres a picture of her with shiny stuff family resemblance no thinfaced woman in her fifties behind a display of bracelets big eyes pointy cleft chin short white hair brushed forward in uneven bangs selena bass at the middle age shed never reach genetics i said this is gonna be fun taking a deep breath he picked up the phone he hung up ten minutes later yawning nothing casual about the intake of air exhausted emily greenbass had screamed sobbed hung up redialing a minute later shed apologized cried some more milo stayed with her chewing on an unlit panatela when she grew silent he began pressing for facts selena was the only child from her second marriage the first had produced two sons one of whom lived in oakland which is where she was now visiting her brandnew granddaughter i thought this was the happiest moment of my life she said she hadnt seen selena in five years the email was one of a handful exchanged recently selena getting in touch finally milo asked why it had taken so long and she broke into fresh sobs ill fly down tomorrow at four pm a deputy chief named henry weinberg called to find out how the marsh murder investigation was progressing milo put him on speaker so far nothing plus nothing sir then it might be time to go to the media lieutenant id rather hold off until the anthropologists have a bone to throw us silence on the other end milo said that way weinberg said i heard you lieutenant nice pun we put you in front of the cameras are you going to do standup god forbid sir god and the boss lieutenant and dont ask me which is which call those bone pickers now make sure theyre hustling dr hargrove was still at the marsh dr liz wilkinson answered the phone oh hi lieutenant weve made some progress on jane number one from the nasal bridge most probably a black female age estimate between twenty and thirtyfive she couldve been describing herself but there was nothing but science in her voice milo jotted anything else shes probably had at least one baby and she suffered a fracture of her right femur severe enough to warrant a metal implant we didnt find the titanium but we did find the screw holes i wouldnt be surprised if she limped recent fracture theres been substantial bone growth around it years not months and it happened when she was an adult the only other interesting finding is a broken hyoid and of course the missing hand strangled most likely our guess is shes been submerged for several months but thats all it is a guess eleanordr hargrove is still there working with lisadr chaplinon the other two sites but its going to take time too much disarticulation and we dont want to miss anything im here because eleanor asked me to write up what weve got so far ill email you what i just told you thanks one more thing lieutenant just as i left the marsh that volunteerthe guy with the beardshowed up again the officer on guard kept him out and there were some words id like to begin early tomorrowsoon as the suns upand ill be alone because eleanor and lisa cant make it until nine it would be nice to avoid distraction ill make sure someones posted before you arrive thanks its a beautiful place but it can get a little ominous he logged on to the departments missing persons list searched for black females in the age range wilkinson had given him found five disappearances the most recent half a year ago no mention of limps or broken legs but he printed the data anyway time to start looking at other counties hopefully shes not a throwaway no one gave a damn about lighting up he clouded the tiny room with illicit smoke coughed and loosened his tie spit a shred of tobacco at his wastebasket and missed and grabbed for his keyboard typing silently and furiously i left without a word commuter traffic and lane closures for no apparent reason turned the drive home into an ordeal and by the time i reached beverly glen it was nearly six the old bridle path that leads to my house was a sudden infusion of peace my house framed by pines and sycamores was welcome white simplicity i called out robins name got no answer tossed my jacket grabbed a grolsch headed down the kitchen stairs and walked through the garden past the pond my footsteps caused the koi to storm the edges twelve adults and five juveniles half of the babies had died before reaching an inch but the survivors were nearly a foot long and perpetually hungry i tossed pellets watched placid water churn into a maelstrom as the fish gorged enjoying the illusion of omnipotence for a couple of minutes i continued along the rock pathway to robins studio sometimes she stays at her workbench until i distract her this evening the bench was clear and she was sitting on the couch curling and uncurling her hair with a lazy finger while reading a book about renaissance lutes blanche nestled in her lap bunnyears drooping flat face compressed to wrinkled velvet the other female in my life is a twentypound vanillacolored french bulldog with tidy table manners rarely seen in the breed and a saintly disposition some of my patients request her presence during sessions im still trying to figure out what her cut should be she and robin looked up simultaneously new olympic event synchronized smiling i kissed robins cheek pecked the top of blanches knobby head robin said pooch and girlfriend are on an equal footing she pants in appreciation she also pees in the bushes and the problem is oh dont tempt me we kissed i sat down next to her her skin and hair were fragrant with cedar and gio cool fingers rested on the back of my neck have a good day better now during the next clinch blanche observed head tilted to one side ears erect robin said getting an eyeful girlfriend blanche smiled we cooked up a mushroomandcheese omelet and i asked her what shed been up to didnt do much but loaf around i might get used to it a week ago shed completed a major commission replicas of four vintage gibson instruments for a dotcom gazillionaire whod donated them to charity shed been talking about starting a new project but had limited herself to repairs i thought of a stillfragrant sixtyyearold flamenco guitar brought in for a neckset finished the barbero yup it was simpler than i figured paco picked it up a couple of hours ago you mustve been really tied up service just called said you hadnt checked in some lawyer wants you for a consult she told me the name i said if he ever pays his bills he might actually get someone to work for him i finished my beer stretched you look weighed down she said milo s burden i hung around and watched watched what i hesitated the instinct to protect rearing its paternalistic little head back in the old days id avoided talking about police cases a couple of breakups and makeups later i had a new appreciation for sharing i gave her the basics she said the marsh where we tried to take a walk none other you know the place was kind of creepy same thing liz wilkinson had said how so its nothing i can really pinpoint unfriendly i guess where were the bodies left the most recent one was right near the eastern entrance the others were submerged farther up the path drive up and dump she said a car wouldve been conspicuous alex and all that development looking down on it nighttime dump turn off the headlights youd fade into the darkness including the view from above she pushed her plate away mixed herself a cranberry juice with a splash of grey goose three sunken bodies and one left right out in the open what does that mean maybe a new level of confidence bragging she said like its something to be proud of the dotcom guy had sent robin a box of audrey hepburn movies wed made our way through most of the dvds had saved charade for a long quiet night ten minutes into the film the phone rang i ignored it drew robin closer seconds later the clanging resumed i put cary grant on pause milo said you free tomorrow at ten right selenas mom is due sure everything okay absolutely i interrupt something high intrigue featuring gorgeous people a movie he said ace detective sure aint real life go back to cinema dreams ill tell you about the bones tomorrow what about the bones hey far be it from me to take you away from robin and doggie and fictitious gorgeous people what dr hargrove got a quicker fix than she thought all three of the submerged victims are complete skeletons minus the right hand jane doe number two is also a black female same age range as jane one with the broken leg also probable strangulation from the length of her femurs at least five seven and strain marks indicate she was probably significantly overweight hargrove is guessing burial for maybe half a year but she wont commit number threes a white female older than the otherscloser to fifty average size another broken hyoid nothing much in the way of distinguishing marks could be the same tod as jane two or longer hard to say the other tidbit is san diego pd has a missing black female named sheralyn dawkins twentynine years old arrests for solicitation and dope and she broke her leg in a car crash five years ago and limped hundred and twenty miles away i said our boys a traveler just what i need i told reed to find family drive down and notify give him a sense of accomplishment boys got low selfesteem no he have any luck with the vanders accountants not a lick global investments referred him to vanders lawyer where he got shunted to a secretary who sent him to her secretary who put him on hold then informed him shed get back to him no nasty stuff on travis huck or silford duboff either and no links show up between the two of them i said the thrilling world of sleuthing lets see what reed learns from sheralyn dawkinss family maybe she moved to la and we can establish some kind of connection to someone if she did move heres something to consider the marsh isnt that far from the airport and the area around lax is full of streetwalkers hmm i like that okay go back to your movie he said which one charade cavorting in paris and snappy dialogue if only crime were that much fun want to borrow it when were through nah he said right now i cant afford fantasy chapter i arrived on time for the meeting with selena basss mother the civilian clerk told me they already started room d upstairs the door was unlocked the ac blasted milo sat opposite emily greenbass his tie was knotted neatly and his face was soft ive seen him practice in front of a mirror before meeting with griefstricken relatives loosening his muscles keeping the wolfglare out of his eyes emily greenbasss white hair was now long and frenchbraided she wore a black mock turtle over a long gray skirt and black suede flats jewelry dealer but no baubles her features were lasercut too sharp for beautiful a handsome woman during good times now she was icy statuary two bulky men in their thirties sat at the side of the table the older one wore a yellow golf shirt brown slacks deck shoes reddish blond hair was sideparted executivestyle closeshaved bullnecked threemartini nose the younger one was darker just as husky but with a bonier face he wore a faded gray david lynch rules sweatshirt wrinkled cargo pants high laceup boots wavy brown hair hung to his shoulders a triangular soul patch was whiteblond a chromium chain drooped from a rear pocket and when he turned to me it jangled milo introduced me these are selenas mom and brothers dr delaware emily greenbass held out a long white hand that felt as if it had just left the freezer i encased it briefly with both of mine and her gray eyes got wet polo shirt said chris green soul patch muttered marc we were just going over selenas life in la marc had some contact with selena after she moved here she visited me in oakland said marc said she was doing fine she emailed the same thing to mom emily greenbass hadnt taken her eyes off me im glad a psychologist is here what happened has got to be psychotic there hasnt been anything extreme in selenas life not for a long time marc green said there never was it was basic adolescent crap if you say so marcus wan smile it sure didnt seem that way when i had to contend with it marcs shoulders rose and fell his chain jangled and he reached behind to quiet it i did the same crap and so did chris only difference is we were better at covering up looking to his brother for confirmation chris said uhhuh unfortunately for selena marc went on she had a compulsion to confess everything right chris smiled sadly like a catholic thing except were not catholic first shed try out the script on us said marc i smoked a joint i watched an x movie on cable i lied about where i was to mom were like dont tell us stupid and for sure dont tell mom so of course she did emily greenbass began crying milo said typical teenage stuff marc green said this is a waste of time chris said she was into the whole music thing so what chill marc i want them to have all the facts the facts are she was in the wrong place wrong time ran into ted bundys reincarnation no one spoke marc green said this may be news to all concerned but being into the whole music thing doesnt make her a freak her basic mindset was conventional when she met some of the people i have to hang with she thought they were weird milo said which people are those marc said from work which is where that relevant his mother said marcus hes trying to help good for him to milo i work wherever they pay me emily greenbass said marc has a degree in acoustical engineering i do sound recording and amplification mostly concerts and indie films and as long as were doing the official family bio thing big bro chris works for starbucks thats an obscure coffee company in seattle chris said marketing and distribution i said when did selena visit you marc a year ago and maybe six months after that the first time i was working on a picture and she trailed along thats when she told me the people i hung with were bizarre which was true of that particular crew i guess half the dialogue was in italian the rest was pantomimesome sort of tribute to pasolini but nobody actually knew italian his brother said and the oscar goes to hey we cant all ride the caffeine train milo said selenas second visit was when i asked her up for the weekend so i could introduce her to cleothen my lover now my wife we just had our first baby which is why i should be home can we move this along milo sat back and crossed his legs if youve got nothing more to tell us feel free to go marc rubbed his soul patch shoved hair behind his left ear blue and green ink washed across his neck cleo amid a wreath of vines i hoped the marriage lasted what the hell he said im booked on a nine pm no sense changing it chris said selena saw you twice huh thats two more times than she bothered to call me back guess she was too busy for corporate chitchat chris turned away from his brother milo said you called her just to see how she was doing when was the last time you spoke to her i dunno two years ago marc said obviously were a closeknit family emily greenbass said chris and marcs father and i broke up when the boys were one and three and he hasnt been heard from since frowning at her sons as if the fault was theirs i met selenas dad a year later dan was good to you guys no argument dan passed away when selena was six i raised her alone and im sure there are some people would say i screwed it up chris said you did fine mom marc said can we stay focused on selena silence why get distracted he said selena was talented but as essentially straight as they come im not saying she never puffed a doobie but even when she and mom were doing their hostility thing she never did anything spiteful like hooking up with someone iffy just the opposite we used to call her sister cee as in celibate shed call herself that said chris milo said what about boyfriends marc said nope mrs greenbass no i never saw anyone she covered her face marc reached out to pat his mothers shoulders she drew away oh god she said through her fingers this is so horrible marcs lip trembled all im saying mom is that selena didnt bring it upon herself shit happens life sucks like stepping off a curb and some asshole comes barreling down that just happened to me right after cleo gave birth to phaedra i left the hospital to get some champagne was floating on air i step off the curb and this fucking san francisco examiner truck comes out of nowhere misses me by a millimeter marcus dont tell me those things i dont want to hear them milo said so no boyfriend anyones aware of what about friends people she hung with here in la no answer emily said she did seem to be happy about her work thats what she finally emailed me about teaching that rich kid said marc she said it was a dream gig she called to tell me because im into music too used to play bass not that i was ever close to selenas level im competent shes brilliant sat down at the piano when she was three and just played the fucking thing by five she was doing gershwin by ear give her anything she could play it i watched her pick up a clarinet cold and run off a scale she got the breathing right away sounds like a prodigy said milo no one used that word we just thought she was amazing emily greenbass said i was so busy supporting us i was happy she had something to occupy her marc said one day i come inim talking years ago when selena was eight or nine shes in the living room strumming my guitar the guitar was new a birthday present i got pissed that she took it without my permission then i realize shes actually making music on it never had a lesson and shes taught herself a bunch of chords and her tones better than mine emily said when she was eleven i could see piano was something she wanted to stick with so i got her a teacher this was back when we lived in ames iowa ames band equipment had a program for the schools selena outgrew the first teacher they gave her then two others they said i needed to find someone with serious classical training when we moved to long island i found an old woman in the city whod been a professor in the soviet union mrs nemerovmadame nemerov she was ancient wore ball gowns selena studied with her until she was fifteen then one day she just quit said she hated classical music i told her she was wasting her godgiven talent shed never play again she said i was wrong it got prettythat was one of our biggest disagreements it was a tough time selena had totally abandoned her schoolwork was getting ds and fs she claimed she was learning more from life than any stupid school could teach her marc muttered no shit i said did she stop playing no i was wrong she actually played more just not a lot of classical pieces though every so often shed do a little liszt or chopin whatever sad smile the chopin études she liked the ones in minor keys or at least thats what she said i dont know a thing about music selena got her talent from her father he played guitar banjo you name it did that bluegrass stuff he was originally from arkansas madame nemerov said selena was one of the quickest sight readers shed ever taught had perfect pitch in her view selena couldve been one of the great concert pianists if shed wanted to marc said she thought touring around and playing beethoven for stuffed shirts would rob her life of normalcy so this was better said emily doing absolutely nothing until she was twentyone then packing up and moving to la without telling me without any job prospects milo said she ran away when youre not a minor they dont call it that i came home and shed packed her bags and left a note that she was moving to the coast and not to try to stop her i was frantic she phoned a few days later but wouldnt tell me where she was i finally pried out the fact that she was in la but she refused to say where she claimed she was supporting herself with gigs whatever that meant marc said she got some club dates playing backup keyboard his mother stared at him well thats news to me marcus then its good that im here to inform you emily greenbasss hand rose and arced toward his face she checked herself shuddered lieutenant the fact that selena and i werent in regular contact was her choice not mine she shut me out completely i have no idea what shes been doing all these years its been hellish not knowing if i didnt have a business to run id have come out here and tracked her down i called the police but couldnt provide an address so they couldnt tell me which station to contact and since selena wasnt a minor and she had left voluntarily there was nothing anyone could do their big suggestion was i contact a private detective besides being expensive i knew that kind of snooping would irritate selena so i minded my own business kept telling myself she was all right milo said when did you call the department right at the beginning mustve been four five years ago i kept hoping shed ask for money at least id have an inkling what she was up to swiveling toward marc now youre telling me you knew all along what she was up to marc green squirmed it wasnt a big deal to me it was she didnt want you to know what she was doing figured youd try to stop her why would i stop her silence i wouldnt stop her said emily greenbass now you tell us everything you know marcus everything marc tortured his hair now marcus its nothing im sure shut up and talk marcus fine she didnt want you to know because the scene she was in really wasnt her thing she was just playing music what are you talking about mom she swore me to secrecy i had no reason to violate now you do said milo okay but it really boils down to nothing like i said she was playing in clubs and that led to parties turning to his mother some were situations she didnt want you to find out about because she knew youd freak out what kind of situations no answer emily greenbass grabbed her sons wrist and put her face close to his like im some kind of fossil marc like im out of touch with reality i like rock music your sisters dead these people need to know marc licked his lips im not talking about the music mom these were specialty parties swinger parties okay freaks wanting background emily greenbass let go of his sleeve my god you wanted to know mom now you know selena was broke totally busted so she checked out the classifieds in the freebie papers found an ad for a keyboardist to play a private party she had her korg her pro tools all that stuff you got her for her eighteenth milo said all that stuff comes with a computer right and a cord and plug said marc of course it comes with a computer there was no computer in her apartment everything else was there appeared to be thats bizarre chris green said someone did this for a mac marc green said or they wanted her data milo said what kind of data would that be marc i dont know im just saying saying what those parties maybe she took notes or something about what she saw and someone wanted to maintain their privacy freaks said emily greenbass oh lord milo said tell us about the parties marc all selena said was freak parties at private homes we didnt get into details tell the truth i didnt want to know emily said the whole truth marcus that is the whole truth you keep saying that dammit then you drop in new tidbits you were always a tease marcus marc gritted his teeth what i know is selena played music for people having open sex in private houses what i know is she said they wanted live music while they were fucking because they were fucking exhibitionists and fucking in front of a live fucking musician was a fucking part of the fucking high dont be vulgar my god lieutenant what if someone got her to do more than music she never came close to implying that mom never she was playing music thats all got paid well was real happy milo said she quote you a figure no and i didnt ask marc swung his chain fingered keys now that weve microanalyzed selena and violated her privacy can you guys go and do some detecting chris said chill bro marc slumped milo said when exactly did she tell you about these parties when i saw her the second time six months ago she knew i was the only one in the family who wouldnt judge her basically she was laughing at it naked old people fucking and sucking and shes playing air supply then she got the teaching job and that was even better howd she find that she didnt say emily said maybe one of those perverts went crazy well definitely check it out maam said milo she did tell you about her job with the vander boy she said she had a fulltime job teaching a musical genius she emailed me and i answered right away i asked her to call and she did but only once we had one conversation she sounded happy sniffling i thought shed call again i told her i was proud of her asked her to come home at least for a visit she said shed think about it but she never followed through milo said she saved a hard copy of your email maam it obviously meant a lot to her thank you he turned to the brothers you guys have no idea how she met the vanders chris shook his head marc said in music generally its word of mouthoh youre thinking they were freaks heard her play at one of those screwathons and hired her makes sense whys that the filthy rich do what they want emily said oh my god milo said jumping to conclusions is a real bad idea all we know about the vanders is that they hired selena to teach piano but this is exactly what we needany possible links to people in selenas life so if anyone has any other ideas please express them marc said the whole richasshole thing makes total sense selena meets them at a freak show and they decide to coopt her for didnt you hear him said his brother its way premature to marc wheeled on him like youve had something to offer fuck off chriss complexion deepened to sugarbeet fuck you stop it said emily greenbass i cant stand this its like everythings rotting chapter we watched mother and sons drive away in three separate rental cars milo said nothing like togetherness sounds like selena was alienated from all of em i said people come to la to lose themselves you referring to me or you or everyone if the shoe fits back in his office i said private gigs at swinger parties could explain the sex toys selena started off supplying the soundtrack evolved into a different type of entertainment nicelooking girl the whole little miss chaste thing could appeal to a libertine smiling last time i heard that word was from sister mary patrick the cruel he fished a panatela from a desk drawer unwrapped it twirled what do you think of angry brother hes the only one who had any kind of relationship with selena but a hot temper can lead all sorts of places he ran a records check on marc clean so maybe we should trust his instincts and the vanders were shelling fifty grand a year for more than piano lessons with a kid whos a prodigy youd think the family would hire a famous teacher not a starving musician whod dropped out of formal training on the other hand what better cover for selena being on call tickle the ivories tickle daddy and mommy that would account for travis hucks overactive sweat glands same for the stone wall reed bumped up against when he tried to talk to the vanders accountants and the vanders just happen to be traveling when selena shows up dead lifestyles of the rich and lustful he said marc green might be one of those peevish classwarfare guys but that doesnt make him wrong he rubbed his face that house end of the road gated no neighbors in sight ideal setup for interesting soirees selena told marc she dug the money what if she got bonuses for nonmusical gigs then she saw something that made her want out or she threatened someone literally blackmail big secrets big money yeah thats the recipe on the other hand i said the truth could turn out to be much more of a downer what she reached her expiration date and got discarded which could be the link to sheralyn dawkins maybe the other jane does if they also sold sex for a living used and tossed the swinger scene thrives on novelty i said the big downer is getting jaded hiring pros worked for a while then selena came along outwardly innocent that would kick things up a notch maybe inwardly and outwardly chaste he said twentysix and never been nothinged until she ran into the wrong crowd those years of playing clubs think its possible anythings possible i said makes both our jobs interesting a call to the crypt revealed that selena basss autopsy was scheduled in three days milo s wheedling to jump the queue produced vague maybes just as he hung up deputy chief henry weinberg rang in wanting to know when he was planning to go public on the marsh murders milo said soon sat for a long time listened impassively when he hung up i said wild guess immediatelys a whole lot better than soon brass has the script written and proofread ready to be recited with wooden earnestness goddamn pencilpushers love press conferences because it lets them pretend theyre doing a real job i said at the risk of being contentious two victims with no ids the media could be helpful the medias like a penicillin shot alex pain in the ass sometimes helpful in small doses its always a doubleedged sword too much exposure people rabbit lemme see if the bone ladies have pulled up anything eleanor hargrove was at the marsh all the bones had been extracted and tagged were being prepped for transport to her lab her guess was very little additional data would be forthcoming though jane doe three did have some interesting dentition milo said interesting how two baby canines still in place and she was born without wisdom teeth if you ever get dental records matching would be a snap he thanked her called moe reed confirmed the young detectives trip to san diego tomorrow set up a second lunch meet at café moghul in an hour i said he likes indian food like that matters reed was drinking tea when we got there same blazer and khakis similar shirt and tie hours in the sun had grilled him mediumrare he looked worn the woman in the sari brought us everything she was serving that day milo snarfed reed didnt touch a thing milo said dont like indian had a late breakfast where ihop german pancakes the applesauce just eggs kid you gotta carboload for the long trek ahead patting the swell of his gut got anything for showandtell talked to alma reynolds duboffs girlfriend she sounds as whack as him kept going on and on about the marsh being sacred even though shes an atheist that made me wonder about the missing hands being some kind of religious ritual but i looked up all the major religions and not ones got anything like that even wiccans and voodoos reynolds confirmed she was out of town when duboff said she was and i still cant find anything psycho in his past his old boss at that leftwing bookstore says he was nonviolent carried spiders and bugs outside and let them go milo said hitler was a vegetarian the young detectives blue eyes studied him that so der führer und der tofu reed smiled in terms of travis huck i also got a bunch of nothing but something about him still bugs me loo nervous and evasive maybe because hes protecting the vanders milo summarized what wed learned from marc green reed said weirdo parties we need to learn more about these people an open door brought in a rush of traffic noise a goodlooking black man had entered the restaurant early thirties six feet tall closely cropped hair athletic frame packaged neatly in a bodyconscious charcoal suit a peacockblue silk shirt gleamed so did black alligator loafers the woman in the sari approached him a few seconds of conversation got her to smile the man headed for our table gliding more than walking milo said blast from the past moe reed shifted in his chair his face had changed lips folding inward eyes tight pale irises barely visible between halfclosed lids one hand gripped his tea glass a cloud of light grassy cologne preceded the mans arrival he had the clean features and poreless skin of a young belafonte grinning he held out a hand to milo congratulations recently promoted lieutenant sturgis the suit was handstitched with peaked lapels and working buttonholes on the sleeves adf monogram on the blue shirt the reptilian shoes looked brand new milo said long time former detective fox this is dr alex delaware our consulting psychologist and this is moe reed said i know him and turned away the man stared at him for a moment tightened his jaw smiled at me aaron fox doctor the world can use more psychologists i shook a warm dry hand pulling up a chair from a neighboring table fox positioned it backward and straddled pouring himself tea he sipped ahh nice and refreshing tastes like theres some white tea in there maybe a nuance of jasmine reed gazed out the window both his hands were curled into fists milo said so theres no need to introduce you two aaron fox laughed not unless one of us has alzheimers he placed a palm on reeds beefy shoulder your brain working okay moses from what i can tell mines still functional reed sat there fox said brain like yours moses probably stay good in the foreseeable future reed stared past him fox said hes always been modest back when we were kids id take every bit of exaggerated credit i could for the most trivial picayune accomplishments marketing and promotion right its not enough to have the product youve got to sell it little brother doesnt believe in that hes smarter than me but hes never been one to toot his own horn reed removed foxs hand and set it down with exquisite care aaron fox said im always doing that embarrassing him older brothers prerogative milo said you guys are sibs you didnt know said fox oh yeah two dips into the same gene pool but x chromosome onlysame mommy different daddies ive always suspected she liked him better hed probably claim the opposite that right moses reed pushed away from the table and headed to the bathroom fox said didnt know i still had that effect on him he drank more tea milo indicated the food you like indian nothing against it milo but i prefer fusion cuisine chinois medicalifornia southwest sushi artistic mélange of cultures brings out the best in human creativity been to that new place on montana wagyu beef from japan they massage the beasts before cutting their throats kind of like the department huh milo smiled how long you been out of the job aaron centuries said fox to be precise three years this september maybe i should throw a party looks like private enterprise agrees with you i dont argue with it so its got no reason to disagree with me touching a silk sleeve yeah its great milo rewards for initiative and achievement lots of freedom the only bosses are the people who write the checks and theyre entitled to make demands nice said milo long as you produce so far so good said fox moe reed returned edged his chair away from foxs and sat down milo said whym i thinking youre not here by accident aaron or for the food definitely not the food said fox had a late breakfast hotel belair with a prospective client apricot crêpes that sauce they have nice but too messy for a first date milo just eggsshirred with chives reed muttered call the food network fox said youre right bro no more small talk nothing small about my intentions im here about selena bass what about her said milo got a suspect for you and asking nothing in return reed snorted milo said who guy named travis huck reed said weve already run him through no history fox grinned no history under that name hes got an alias said milo been known to happen said fox aka edward travis huckstadter taking his time spelling the last name no ones going to write that down whats he running from aaron what else his past chapter aaron fox put down his tea and reached into an inner suit pocket a wad of newspaper clippings dropped on the table in front of milo great tailoring had hidden the bulge milo said why dont you summarize for us civil servants pleasure edward travis huckstadter grew up in ferris ravine one of those scrubby ranch towns inland from san diego daddy unknown mommy a crazy drunk when young eddie was fourteen he got into a shoving match with a classmate and the other kid died eddie got convicted of murder spent some time in juvey lockup then got shunted around the foster care system thats some psychological history doc fourteen said moe reed hes thirtyseven were talking clean record for twentythree years no arrests doesnt mean no bad behavior moses the relevant point is he killed one human being and now hes associated with a homicide victim on top of that his whereabouts since he turned eighteen are a big blank no social security card or tax returns until three years ago when he started working for a megabucks fellow named simon vander under the alias obviously he lied to get the gig because i dont see megabucks hiring some mope with a felony record you guys met him youre telling me he didnt set off any alarm bells milo said how do you know we met him i pick up things you meet huck yourself aaron havent had the pleasure yet but ive been watching him for the last twentyfour hours why after your case hit the news someone hired me to do so selena hasnt been in the news not on tv said fox or the times but the evening outlook ran a paragraph want me to get you a copy no thanks you pick up anything watching him so far all hes done is shop for groceries but hes got a mopey walk and a weird crooked smile reed said you dont like his looks theres evidence for you huck had been his choice for prime suspect but something else was at work here fox patted the newspaper clippings he killed someone at a tender age twentythree years ago you have anyone better reed didnt answer thats what i thought im serving up a serious lead what you do with it is your own business milo said juvey records are sealed howd you find all this out fox smiled reed said thats real helpful foxs goldbrown eyes flashed shooting a cuff he glanced at a bluefaced patek philippe milo said sounds like youre pretty invested in huck being our bad guy aaron fox took a nanosecond to decide upon an emotion settled for placid not invested just aware of the facts who hired you to research the guy i wish i could tell you reed said were supposed to ask for a warrant based on twentythreeyearold information obtained illegally from an informant too chickenshit to come forward both brothers bodies tilted like lances regressed for an instant to feuding children fox broke the stare first smiling and shrugging moses however detective sturgis deigns to utilize the data with which i am gifting him is not my concern he stood ive done my civic duty have a nice restoftheday gents reed said your brains so functional youll recall the statutes on obstruction fox smoothed a silk shirt collar little bro you get like that and i know youre blowing more smoke than one of those clunkers you insist on driving to milo word has it there are other victims in the marsh and that a press conference is on the horizon it was me at the podium id like a few factoids when those pesky questions start flying milo flicked the clippings with a big square thumbnail well be sure to pore over every word aaron you tell us who hired you to scope out huck and why we might give them some credibility their credibility isnt in question said fox only issue is whether you decide to follow through peeling a twenty from an alligator billfold he let it float to the table milo said not necessary thanks but no thanks said fox i always pay my own way snapping a quick salute he left the restaurant moe reed remained canted forward milo said your brother huh reed nodded vice has nothing on sheralyn dawkins but id better run over to the lax stroll see if i can learn something before i drive to san diego erupting from his chair he charged out before milo could answer milo said ah the joys of family life i said hucks also from the san diego area funny thing about that but why give fox the satisfaction we examined the clippings in milo s office three articles from the ferris ravine clarion spaced a month apart written by cora a brown the papers publisher and editor in chief one piece covered the tragedy two followups added nothing the facts were as aaron fox had summarized on a hot may afternoon eighthgrader eddie huckstadter considered a shy child and loner by his teachers had finally responded to months of bullying by an outsized ninthgrader named jeffrey chenure during the schoolyard confrontation the much smaller eddie had shoved his quarterback antagonist in the chest jeff chenure stumbled backward caught his balance charged at eddie fists flailing before a blow could land he cried out fell flat on his back lifeless milo said sounds like an accident or at the worst selfdefense im surprised huck served any juvey time i ruffled the clippings this is what fox wanted you to see maybe theres more the internet brought up nothing on eddie huckstadter nor did the name appear in any criminal data banks milo said no surprise there if fox had found any more dirt hed have gifted me with it he stood all that tea gotta take a detour during his absence i phoned the ferris ravine clarion expecting a disconnected number a female voice answered clarion i gave her a capsule id asked for her name cora brown im the editor publisher opinioneditorial columnist classified ad clerk and i take out the trash la police why its about a story you wrote several years ago a boy named eddie huckstadt eddie has the poor boy done somethingi guess hed be a man by now is he in trouble his name came up as a witness in an investigation when we backtracked we came across your articles investigation into what a homicide a homicide youre not saying because no maam hes just a witness oh she said okay but has he become a criminal because that would be tragic how so the mistreatment he got turning him bad juvenile detention and the foster system yes but even before that said cora brown that mother of his so much of life is pure damn luck isnt it poor eddie never had much if you want to know my opinion he got railroaded from the getgo that boy he pushed was the son of a rich rancher the whole family were bullies used to having their way no questions asked they were rough on their migrants treated them like slaves raise a child in that environment what do you think youre going to get are the chenures still around oklahoma last i heard sold out years ago to an agribusiness firm and went into raising black angus how many years ago right after what happened to jeff sandy the motherwas never the same rich family i said eddie on the other hand lived in a trailer with a lunatic lush of a mother what happened that day was one of those schoolyard things happens all the time pause not that children die from schoolyard things that was tragic jeff was a mean boy but he was still a child he mustve had something wrong with his heart to pass out like that eddie didnt shove him that hard nope that didnt stop him from going into juvenile lockup and being forgotten until he got liberated by who you said you read the articles i figured you meant all of them i read off the dates of the three pieces no theres more i did a followup piece a year later followup on what eddies redemption a public defender from la got interested in the case what was her name deborah something hold on let me get on the computer my grandsons one of those technical geniuses his science project was scanning and cataloging fifty years worth of our issues for an online base going back to when my dad was the publish okay here it is debora with no h wallenburg she spelled the surname give me your email and ill send it to you thanks pleasure i do hope eddie hasnt turned bad when milo returned i waved the attachment id printed heres the part fox left out a pd was handling the appeal of another ward at the youth camp and one of the counselors told her about a kid who was being brutalized had received several concussions hucks neurological symptoms quite likely the guard said eddie didnt belong there in the first place the lawyerdebora wallenburglooked into eddies conviction agreed and filed an emergency writ a month later eddie was released and the charges were expunged he got sent to foster care because his mother was unfit i looked wallenburg up on the bar association website and shes private now practices in santa monica dogooder lawyer actually does some good he said maybe fox never found the followup or he did and chose to withhold what kind of guy is he dont know him that well he worked wilshire division for a while had a rep as a hotshot smart ambitious he transferred to west la maybe four or so years ago but quit soon after quit or asked to leave i heard quit not much family resemblance to reed i said and im not talking about race tortoise and hare he said no business like sib business fox sure loved goading ol moe and reed responded exactly like he was supposed to showing up reed was a side benefit for fox now he can go back to his client and say mission accomplished someones paying to get us focused on huck i said paying well fox wears custommade duds and a tenthousanddollar watch maybe someone in the vander household knows we were sniffing around the manse and wants to make sure we look in a certain direction huck comes across odd so hed be a natural on the other hand he really could be your guy the first thing cora brown asked was whether poor little eddie had become a criminal because of what he went through shoving black hair off his brow he read the articles railroaded and vindicated but he got stuck in the same place as serious delinquents and had his brains scrambled toss in maternal deprivation and drifting around the foster system and all kinds of things can happen he stays under the radar until three years ago yeah that adds up to what you guys call high risk for deviant behavior what do you call it a lead chapter the press conference aired on the eleven oclock news milo stood by woodenly as dc weinberg made love to the cameras during a steelyeyed request for public participation the public facts were thin selena bass and three unidentified bodies in the bird marsh no mention of amputated hands all four network affiliates topped off fifteen seconds of publicinterest sop with rehashed coverage of the progressive billionaires attempt to buy the land followed by stock footage of egrets herons and ducks milo knew what was going to happen and he pulled moe reed back from the trip to san diego the two of them split the phone chores by one am sixtythree tips had come in the next half hour earned five more by three am every call but one naming sheralyn dawkinss main man had been classified as worthless reeds request for surveillance on travis huck had been sent to pacific patrol no answer so far he said guess we should start with this guy duchesne pimp in the morning said milo something to wake up for joe otto duchesne rejected the job description think of me as a human resources manager duchesnes stats put him at fortythree as of march emaciated grayskinned whitehaired and gaptoothed he looked old enough to be his own father vice said he worked four or five women along the lax stroll had high turnover duchesne sat comfortably in the interview chair surprisingly articulate surprisingly shabby clothes his record was a mundane twentyyear paean to heroin addiction though he claimed seven months of utter sobriety despite a hot morning his shirt cuffs were buttoned at the wrist hed come in voluntarily and milo gave him plenty of space pushing the table into a corner keeping the whole thing lowkey moe reed and i watched on closed circuit from an adjoining room the young detective followed every word like a paid attendee at a getrich seminar it was reed whod found duchesne after six hours of grunt work questioning local patrol hookers working the periphery of the airport other lowgrade pimps loitering near hourly rate motels it was one of the women who remembered sheralyn dawkins and confirmed that the missing woman had worked for that skinny white boy joe otto you gonna find him on centinela reed showed her a san diego mug shot yeah sheri the limp she said good for business the limp theres guys be liking it said the hooker maybe i should get myself a deefect duchesne was open about his new business plan lately ive been using craigslist to set up appointments milo said being businesslike im sure you keep all the emails and phone numbers duchesne flashed ragged canines and black gaps like i said lately just a few weeks how do you fill vacant slots hesitation i supplement the oldfashioned way milo said sidewalk displays duchesne fingered an empty tooth socket i like to think of it as realtime marketing on top of his drug arrests hed been busted five times for procuring considered jail time and fines corporate overhead milo said joys of the business world got a degree in business administration lieutenant university of utah graduated twentyone years ago and worked for ibm and thats the truth call them to verify i believe you joe otto tell me about sheralyn you really think its her cant be sure but she fits the body we found duchesne nodded the leg i met her last winterfebruary i think maybe januaryno february she just got into town was hanging around cold lonely i took her in cause no one else did why not the leg situation poor thing had trouble being on her feet for stretches of time cut down on her productivity i got her all kinds of different shoes insoles inserts gel pads you name it nothing really helped but she wouldnt give up hard worker nice girl you liked her nice girl duchesne repeated not the sharpest scimitar in the scabbard but she had personal warmth i took her in to be kind but the leg ended up working out okay how so a certain consumer segment was attracted to it guys who like limps said milo guys who like vulnerability anyone ever take advantage of her vulnerability joe otto no sir said duchesne thats what im here for puffing a sunken chest and curling a scrawny fist the embodiment of pretentiousness watching the screen moe reed shook his head milo said no one ever got rough with her joe otto never youre sure of that lieutenant she only worked for me a month and it was a smooth month what did she tell you about herself just up from oceanside military maneuvers heh heh military police decided to crack down on fun made her situation tense doesnt seem fair right we send those young boys over to fight for our liberties and they cant even enjoy a few moments of shore leave so she came up to la greener pastures said duchesne she talk much about her life in oceanside she said she had a kid and her mother was taking care of it in oceanside she didnt specify didnt say if it was a boy or a girl and i didnt pry duchesnes runny eyes tightened keeping it businesslike you know milo nodded give me something to work with joe otto thats itoh yeah she said shed been married to a navy man but he abandoned her early on cant tell you if any of its true but i dont see the point of lying about details like that duchesne wiggled a loose canine lieutenant if its her you found im feeling wistful here i was thinking she abandoned me i shouldve known she wouldnt she just up and left here one day gone the next said duchesne last time i saw her she was happy i come back and shes gone her stuffs gone no note no forwarding frown truth be told i was baffled why wouldnt she abandon you because i treated her better than anyone shed ever known still what said milo with girls you can never tell could i trouble you for a coke sure moe reed got up moments later he was back in the side room and duchesne was guzzling from a twelveounce can joe otto what do you think drew sheralyn away from you thats what i kept asking lieutenant maybe something to do with her kid her mother but i didnt have any numbers to follow up on could be a better gig came along duchesnes mouth shut tight that possible joe otto better like what you tell me im a fair man and she was happy milo watched him drink soda duchesne put the can down belched i took her in when no one else did do you have any idea whod want to hurt her im sure theres plenty of people whod want to hurt her the world being what it is can i specify unfortunately not when she worked for me there were no problems she have any regulars slow head shake those take time to cultivate truth be told she worked for me maybe twenty nights during that time whered she live with me wheres that various places said duchesne i prefer not to be tied down motels and such milo pressed him for names duchesne hesitated ran off a few asked for another coke after hed drained it milo slid a sixpack photo display across the table half a dozen shavedhead white men arranged in two rows travis huck in the bottom righthand position one of these guys did it said duchesne recognize any of them duchesne studied the images one by one spending the same glassyeyed ten seconds on each shaking his head sorry do you recall any other cueballs on sheralyns customer list cueballs duchesne was amused nope sorry again joe otto said milo you liked her you were the one took her in now someones done her up really badly i know i know truth be told sheralyns professional activity was always after dark and i had other employees operating simultaneously you never saw her johns not always said duchesne there was a problem id get beeped he pushed out his thorax again and there was none his left leg began bouncing stopped milo said joe otto somethings at the back of your mind right now maybe something to do with a bald guy duchesnes eyes sparked with alarm youre a psychic friend i know when someones troubled why would i be troubled because you cared about sheralyn know she wouldnt just leave you meaning someone snatched her and maybe that same person left her lying around like trash duchesnes spider fingers squeezed the empty can tried to crush it ended up inflicting a minor dent he placed it to the side worked the tooth socket some more joe otto there was a guy but not with sheralyn before sheralyn another girl nod i got beeped because he got freaky like you said cueball shes all breathing hard and telling me to look out for a skinhead time i got to the room he was gone this girl get hurt minor bruise she was a big girl could take care of herself what was the guys freak joe otto wanted to tie her up we get that all the time say no when she said no this one pulled a knife not a normal knife looked like a medical thing thats what she called it a scalpel he tried to shake her up by showing how it could slice paper miming an upward thrust she got bruised but not cut said milo thank god said duchesne she got that weird feeling went to run out of the room he went after her made a reach for her hit her with the hand thank god times ten not the knife caught her here rubbing his temple got her with his knuckles you could see the marks the next day she was all swollen dark big dark bruise even on her skin you could see it dark girl said milo big beautiful sister name we called her big laura dmv called her dont know said duchesne big laura was all we needed tall and big two tons of fun where can i find her long pause dont know lieutenant another flybynight joe otto duchesne pressed his palms together piously these people have unstable lives milo questioned him through a third coke and two hershey bars inquired about white prostitutes of advanced age duchesne said not on my payroll im all about soul can i go sure thanks stay in touch if you learn something believe it lieutenant this kind of thing isnt good for business moe reed and i entered the vacated interview room big girl named laura said milo reed said fits jane number two interesting that two victims were in duchesnes stable you smell something on him reed thought hard to say he didnt have to come in let alone tell us anything unless you think hes cagey enough to be playing us i said maybe someone smelled his weakness figured out whose girls could be exploited beta dog said milo makes sense my guess is duchesne told us what he knows you did good finding him moses time to get back to the stroll and dig some more ill take on finding sheralyns next of kin in a perfect world one of us will learn something that turned her into a victim at the least we can get a cheek scrape from her mom or her kid match it to the bones not that im expecting jane one to be anyone other than her what about big laura ill see what the moniker pulls up in terms of jane three shes probably been dead the longest and memories on the street are short but maybe an older white woman will stand out in someones mind if shes from the area we could have a bad guy concentrating geographically for a while said reed then he wants a new level of thrill and shifts from pros to selena her apartments not that far from the airport or the marsh for that matter i said psychosocially selenas a big leap from the others there could be transitional victims such as said milo nonprostitutes perceived as lower class working his way up the social ladder reed said the dog didnt find anything else in the marsh but the k search was limited to the east bank cheerful thought said milo with a normal dump we could get warrants no problem bring in the backhoe instead were stuck with hallowed ground i said maybe the killer sees it that way too as milo extracted a cigarillo from his pocket reeds pale eyebrows rose dont worry kiddo ill keep your air clean in terms of going through the hassle of getting permission to dig up other areas of the marsh lets clear up the bodies we already have first time to hit the streets as we headed for the door moe reed said too bad duchesne didnt recognize huck idiot claims he never sees the johns unless theres a problem and i believe him said milo he wasnt much use to big laura when she did get into trouble with that skinhead some business model bald man with a scalpel said reed youd need more than that to cut off a hand right doctor i said wrong kind of doctor but yes a limb saw would work fine any kind of saw sharp enough said milo goddamn chinese cleaver would do it if hes strong and coordinated reed said maybe were talking about someone with medical training twenty years ago said milo id be looking that way nowadays the internet anyone can get anything anytime freedom said reed nothing else worth living for kiddo but its a tricky concept unwrapping the cigar he jammed it into the side of his mouth gonna light up kid fair warning we walked reed outside crossed the street to the staff lot his drive was a shiny black camaro milo said thats no clunker pardon what your brother said he thinks he knows everything said reed he got in revved loud drove off tires squealing chapter milo and i walked south on butler avenue the cold glare of government architecture gave way to postwar bungalows and apartment buildings and the sky grew bluer as if in sympathy he said any new thoughts about huck or anything else now weve got two baldguy sightingsthe date luz ramos saw with selena along with mr scalpelso i like him a whole lot better but at this point short of watching him i dont see what you can do too early to invite him for a chat he said with crimes this calculated hes likely to lawyer up id want ammunition before i shoot half a block later he said that camaro that reed just peeled out in was either borrowed or a rental autotrack says his drive of record is indeed a clunker seventynine dodge colt hatchback bought used ten years ago before that he sported around in a datsun wagon doing deep background on the staff i said perish the thought since the arrest of a corrupt private eye and several cops for trafficking in official data the rules forbade traces on anyone but suspects i said what got you curious about reeds wheels it seemed to be an issue between him and fox one of many exactly last thing i need is personal drama impinging on the investigation small smile such as it is what does fox drive brandnew porsche cs tortoise and hare i said he lit up blew smoke rings at the heavens aiming for casual but cherries in his jaw said he was faking i said fox and reed bother you i asked around foxs dad was a southwest patrolman named darius fox murdered on the job thirty years ago before my time but i know the case everyone knows it because its used during training as in what can go wrong i said domestic call or traffic stop he removed the cigar you read tea leaves too just playing the odds routine earlymorning stop caddy with a broken taillight thirtyseventh just west of hoover car came up stolen but not before darius and his partner made a bonehead goof instead of running the tags first the partner did it while darius went over to check out the driver were talking way before mdts everything was called in over the radio records werent computerized it could take time all the more reason to be careful rookies i said on the contrary darius had eight years the partner six nearly all of it worked with fox maybe that was part of itcomfortable marriage taking too much for granted it was close to shifts end maybe they were eager to sign out got sloppy whatever the reason darius walks up to the caddy raps the window down it comes a gun sticks out and cupping his hands he clapped three times the noise assaulted the afternoon an old woman tending her flowers looked over milo s grin caused her to grip her pruning shears as we walked on direct hit pointblank he said darius left a widow and a tyke aaron was three the partner called in the officer down got behind his door started shooting he managed to score a hit on the caddys rear but couldnt prevent it from driving off he ran over to help darius but darius was gone before he hit the ground big citywide sweep for the car everyone checking out hospitals doctors on the off chance the partner wounded someone nada and two weeks later the caddy shows up in a junkyard near the wilmington docks windows busted out seats ripped bumpers removed no prints no nothing darius got a bagpipe funeral and the partner got investigated reprimanded and demoted soon after he quit the force what i hear is he worked construction for a while got injured lived off disability for five more years then died of liver disease driven to drink or maybe he had a problem before dont know alex inhaling deeply he burned through half an inch of cigar seven months after darius foxs funeral partner marries the widow in vegas two months after that she gives birth to a kid he dropped the cigar ground it into the sidewalk picked it up and carried it at his side figure out the punch line dr wizard partner was moe reeds daddy guy named john jack reed people do say he tried hard to be a good father to both boys i said few years later hes gone too and momma marries twice again she just buried number four talk about baggage a planeload amigo lets hope it doesnt ground us back in his office he found half a dozen new tip messages began the callbacks sat up straight when he connected to the fifth he said thats great maam really appreciate your taking the time now if youd be so kind as to give me your dial tone he held the phone at arms length must be my breath pressing redial he got no ring tried again same result i said someone worth listening to someone refusing to identify herself wanting me to know that one of the jane does in the marsh might be someone named lurlene chenoweth aka big laura he traced the callers number deadended at a prepaid cell i said a female tipster with a prepaid might mean a pro from the area word travels fast the girls know duchesne visited theyre making associations typing in lurlene chenoweths name brought up a scowling ebony moonface crowned by a cumulus of orange hair thirtythree years old five nine two seventy no scars or tattoos four solicitation arrests one cocaine possession two drunk and disorderlies three misdemeanor batteries all bar fights pled down he said big and scrappy she managed to avoid skinheads knife because she moved to the door quickly maybe something about him tipped her off early in the encounter and she was careful an obvious weirdo too bad he found her later swinging his feet onto the desk he loosed the laces of his desert boots flexed his toes two of duchesnes girls die what if that boils down to some stupid turf war between pimps and skinhead was just hired help if that was it i said whys duchesne still operating hes not exactly an imposing figure and how would selena fit in three street girls and a piano teacher youre making a point a piano teacher who played swinger parties like you said rich folk moving from stale to fresh rich folk with secrets could explain hiring travis huck hes also into the scene or just a guy with a past tormented soul finally finds a legit jobwith an ocean view yeah that could inspire loyalty estate manager is richfolk talk for gopher right hucks basically a procurer gets sent out to bring back the goodies i said flowers catering victim of the evening his laughter was metallic joe otto has no idea how smalltime he is big lauras mother lived in a beautifully kept house in the crenshaw district tall like her daughter beatrix chenoweth was as skinny as a walking stick she wore a mintgreen blouse widelegged black trousers and ballet slippers her living room was delft blue trimmed in white set up with floral couches and nononsense chairs and hung with prints of impressionist masterpieces her reaction to our presence was dryeyed resignation i knew it maam we cant be sure im sure lieutenant how many girls are that size and have taken that path milo didnt answer beatrix chenoweth said ive got four daughters two are schoolteachers like myself and the babys a flight attendant for southwest lurlene was the third she took every bit of fight out of me maam said milo im not here to tell you something definitely happened to lurlene and i really hope it didnt but if you dont mind giving me a cheek scraping we can find out oh something happened all right lieutenant ive been dreading this moment for an entire year because thats how long its been since i heard from lurlene and no matter what happened she always called always it would start off like a genuine conversation howre you doing mommy but by the end it was always the same she needed money money was the reason she went that way in the first place more accurately something that cost a lot of money her voice had climbed but her face was impassive it started in high school lieutenant someone gave her amphetamines to lose weight it didnt work she never lost a pound but that didnt stop her from getting addicted and that was the beginning of the end im sorry maam lurlene was my only heavy one took after her father the rest of us girls never had problems in that area in fact my second did some fashion modeling i said mustve been hard for lurlene her head dropped as if suddenly too heavy everything was hard for lurlene she was the smartest of the four but the weight ruined her life being ridiculed she began crying silently milo found his stash of tissues and gave her one thank you i didnt realize until later what a burden it was for her all those arguments over too much butter on the bread she was an elevenpound baby none of my others topped eight milo said she started with amphetamines started yes said beatrix chenoweth in terms of what else she got into i dont know you can probably tell me more than i can tell you milo didnt answer i want to know lieutenant from what i can tell from her arrests cocaine and alcohol were issues maam alcohol yes i knew that lurlene got arrested once for being drunk twice milo didnt correct her did she get in contact with you after she got arrested you mean to help her with bail no she told me afterward someone else paid her bail she said shed paid it herself lieutenant that was the point of the call bragging i asked her how she got the money and she laughed and we got into a discussion i suppose i knew how she was supporting herself i suppose i chose to pretend i didnt she cleared her throat milo said can i get you some water maam no thank you touching her neck its not thirst thats caught in here maam what can you tell us about lurlenes friends not a thing said beatrix chenoweth she didnt expose me to her personal life and as i said i didnt want to know does that sound uncaring lieutenant of course not it wasnt it was an adaptation ive got three other daughters and five grandchildren who need my attention i cant couldnt her head bowed again every single counselor we spoke to said lurlene would have to bear the consequences of her own actions i said were there a lot of counselors oh yes first from the schools then we went to a clinic our hmo recommended nice indian man dr singh he said the exact same thing lurlene had to want to change he suggested horace and i have a few sessions to learn how to cope we did it was helpful then he died horace i mean a stroke a month later when i tried to contact dr singh hed moved back to india frowning apparently he was some sort of intern milo said is there anything you can tell us about who lurlene associated with not since she took that path how old was she when she sixteen she dropped out of school ran away called when she needed money she was a fighter lieutenant youd think she couldve fought the damn drugs it can be really hard maam i know i know beatrix chenoweths long bony fingers gathered black trouser fabric when i say fighter i mean it literally lieutenant lurlene bucked authority for the sake of it it got so her father had to leave the house to cool off one time she hit her baby sister so hard charmaynes head just about spun around and she had pain for days it got to the point wheregod help me for saying thiswe were thankful lurlene stopped coming by i can understand that maam now someone hurt her she stood smoothed her pants im going to go off by myself for a while and then ill call lurlenes sisters and theyll have to figure out what to say to their children thats their responsibility all i want to do is have fun with my grandkids would you please see yourselves out chapter so much for duchesne as a factor said moe reed as we waited for the woman to return from the bathroom he and milo and i sat in an orange plastic booth in a chickenandpancakes joint on aviation near century the restaurant smelled of burnt feathers and hot fat jumbojet thunder shook the room at random intervals thrumming cloudy glass and zbrick and threatening to shake asbestos loose from the goosebump ceiling three coffee cups in front of us untouched brown surfaces skimmed with rainbow oil slick the woman had ordered extrasweet extracrisp thighs and wings a double plate of cinnamon waffles and a jumbo orange soda shed finished one plate of chicken asked for another made her way through most of the breading before needing a woman break her name was sondra cindy jackson and she called herself sin twentythreeyearold black female pretty face wounded eyes huge blue talonnails half of them inlaid with rhinestones her teeth were straight but her left incisor was a gold cap a complex cornrow tested the boundaries of string theory she was the eighteenth prostitute moe reed had talked to in two days of canvassing the airport hot zone and the first who was sure she knew the identity of jane doe three built like a dancer her appetite was astonishing so far shed flirted shoveled food down her gullet played coy reed was antsy milo emitted an odd buddhic calm over the same fortyeight hours hed contended with a continuing trickle of worthless tips learned nothing more about big laura chenoweth failed to locate sheralyn dawkinss family anywhere in san diego orange or la county that kind of fun often erodes his patience but sometimes it works the other way reed eyed the ladies room our booth was positioned so sin couldnt leave without passing directly in front of us when she gets back ill press her milo said sure or you can let it play out a bit longer the young detective had switched from jacket and tie to a gray polo shirt bisected by a wide red stripe fresh blue jeans snowy white nikes his eyes were clear his ruddy face shaved glossy sideofbeef pectorals and massive shoulders strained the shirt aiming to blend in but he might as well have worn the uniform sondra cindy jackson had known what he was right away sixty dollars and the promise of dinner had induced her to get into the camaro milo said be sure to put in for reimbursement reed said eventually im back came the cheery announcement sins pink velvet bra and white lace hot pants showed off her skin tone slender girl except for breasts enhanced to cartoon proportions somehow shed found the money welcome back said milo bon appétit she flashed a gold smile slid into the booth got to work on the second plate of chicken four swallows later she said yall are so quiet waiting for you said reed to do what batting her lashes reed blinked milo said to take the lead about oh yeah mantooth reed said mantooth thats her name tective reed mantooth yup reed opened his pad that a first name last name said sin dolores mantooth but we jes called her mantooth because it was a good one for her wink wink reed stared at her tooth chew like that song said sin we chewin on it what yall dont listen to the blues milo said musta missed that one we chewin on it all day long i said bonnie raitt yeah said sin nice dirty song that was mantooth she had a mouth reed said mouth as in sin said huh milo said who was her pimp jerome jerome who jerome jerome said sin im not kidding same first name and last name im not claiming thats what his momma called him but thats what he was called jerome jerome dont go asking for him dead howd he get dead od lifting a wing she held it daintily between two fingers nibbled voraciously to the bone when said reed shrug i just heard he was dead from an od what else you assumed he odd sins look was full of pity tective reed tective reed jerome was bagging all day then he got dead that sound to you like old age milo said dolores never worked for joe otto duchesne no way joe otto works black never looks back tell us about dolores sin waved a chicken bone old white ugly whens the last time you saw her hmm a year ago how old is old a hundred said sin laughing maybe a hundred fifty she looked real used peachflavored ice cream disappeared between her lips no new information made the reverse trip reed gave her his card and she looked at it as if it were an exotic insect after she left the restaurant we walked to the parking lot and watched her sway south on aviation reeds camaro had no computer so milo had brought a newer chevy sedan from the staff lot that was fully equipped no dolores or delores mantooth in the system a bit of lapd scrabble finally pulled up her id demaura jean montouthe blond and green five five one forty dob fiftyone years ago thirty years of lowlevel arrests no mention of tooth anomalies but lapd wasnt interested in the finer points of dentition milo called vice and had the name of her pimp within seconds jerome lamar mcreynolds the crypt confirmed his death fourteen months ago heroincocaine overdose cod determination based on track marks and blood work no autopsy guy speedballs said milo demauras freelancing vulnerable bad guy senses it moves in perfect for some rich predators said reed massaging a swelling biceps the key said milo is to turn women into prey chapter three days of notsohappy hunting milo and reeds canvass of the airport stroll revealed no other prostitutes whod encountered a knifewielding baldheaded john a vice detective named diane salazar had arrested demaura montouthe several times and thought her family was from alabama but wasnt sure no one with the surname had come up in that states tax rolls you wouldnt happen to know her dentist diane you bet milo her hairdresser and her personal trainer too what was she like nice girl not too bright never fussed when we snagged her on decoy runs years ago she was actually kind of pretty only mug shot ive seen is two years old you know said salazar the usual no one had heard anything about demaura sheralyn dawkins or big laura chenoweth working private parties theyda done it theyda bragged said one pimp big l especially she like to challenge you give you the eye you not agreeing with her she got herself a reason to go off on you that happened to you said reed what confrontation with big laura hell no that happened to me sheda hurt she did get hurt whatever got to go a hooker named charvay young still lithe and unscarred and thinking she had a lifetime ahead of her caressed her breasts and laughed and voiced the prevalent sentiment them with rich folk what kind of westside paparatz partey would be wanting that old skin during the ride back to the office milo was sullen maybe sensing it moe reed drove fast could be the vanders have nothing to do with it and its all about huck being a solo psycho surveillance on the estate manager had stalled the topofthehill deadend placement of the vander estate limited vantage points on calle maritimo the watch from two blocks down had produced nothing huck never left the house milo decided to hold observation to after dark told reed theyd split the shift reed said no prob doing all of it loo i really want to check this guy out we go that way kiddo ill be partnering with the living dead trust me said reed with all due respect you dont believe in sleep dont need much ill move around no onell spot me im good at fading into the background whys that said milo second kid most of hucks adult life was a blank space and one person who might be able to fill in the details was debora wallenburg the lawyer whod sprung him out of juvey jail no sense suggesting that attorneyclient privilege meant a stone wall at best at worst shed alert huck and if he was dirty hed split with no need for my services i took on a custody consult that didnt look too fierce had time for leisurely walks with blanche pleasant dinners with robin in the midst of that emily greenbass phoned me from long island i got your number from the state psychology board doctor hope you dont mind not at all what can i do for you the reason im calling you and not lieutenant sturgis isits not really about selenas case her voice broke cant believe im using that word i waited she said ive already spoken with lieutenant sturgis i know theres been no progress the reason im calling you actually i dont know why im calling you i guess i feel sorry for wasting your time doctor youre not she said youre just saying that because sorry i dont know what im doing youve gone through something most people cant come close to comprehending dead air when she finally spoke her voice was low and hoarse i guess iguess what im after dr delaware i keep thinking about that meeting at the station my boys we mustve seemed like one big crazy dysfunctional family thats not how it really is i said what happened was one hundred percent normal was it yes youve seen other people in my situation lots of people theres no road map long pause thank you i guess what i want you to see was that were really pretty normaltypical peoplenow that im out with that it sounds ludicrous why would i need to impress you youre trying to get some control which is impossible still i said sometimes its good to try what i saw in your sons was attachment and love for you and selena sobs broke like thunder rattling the phones tinny speaker i waited as the sound diminished she said i really dont know what i couldve done differently with selena i mean maybe if dan wouldve lived he was such a good father he got a brain tumor nothing he did caused it he didnt smoke he didnt drink he didntit just happened the doctors said its just one of those things that just happens i guess i shouldve explained it to selena she was so young i thought sucking inhalation she lost her father and i lost the love of my life after that everything kind of fell apart im so sorry youve had to go through that silence ms greenbass what happened to selena wasnt connected to losing her father maybe a lie but who cared what was it then another of those things you cant explain but if she hadnt moved to la harsh laughter if this if that if only shouldve couldve wouldveshe cut me off totally i said one way or the other children move away if not geographically psychologically images of my own crosscountry ride at sixteen flashed in my head long hyphens of desert and railyard and hamburger stands the shakeawake of city skyline prospects of a new life thrilling and terrifying they do said emily greenbass i suppose its necessary it is people who stay in one place are often stunted yes yesselena was doing exactly what she wanted she always did such a strongwilled child she knew her mind and pursued it thats why its so hard to think of her as overpowered she was a little person with such a big personality doctor a hundred ten pounds it was easy to forget she was just small tears she was my baby doctor im so sorry i know you areyou sound like a kind man if you learn anything anything at all youll call me of course stupid question she said i seem to have a lot of those id finished the consult was writing my report when milo called up for fine dining three pm kind of an off hour call it a snack im meeting with reed in thirty his request whats up he left the message on my machine didnt specify lad does sound a bit excited ill be there i said curry and tandooried whatever nope pizza the kid needs variety also a place where his brother cant find him variety was a barnlike pizza palazzo on venice near sawtelle seating was picnic tables and benches offhour gourmandizing meant a nearly vacant room ripe with memories of stale cheese the exception was a pair of longdistance truckers whose big rig took up half the parking lot extralarge pies for extralarge men blinks and burps voiced by a bank of video games against the far wall broke the silence unused machines crying out for attention milo and i arrived at the same time no sign of the black camaro in the lot but moe reed was inside back to blazer and tie looking ill at ease as he nursed a mug of root beer new wheels kiddo said milo pardon nothing black shiny or chevy out there oh said reed that was a rental i exchanged it clunker in the shop reed colored milo said heres a guess youve been renting cars so you can tail your brother did you at least fill out the forms so you can get reimbursed reed shook his head got a trust fund kiddo i just dont care about stuff like that tsk tsk uncle milo is crestfallenokay how long you been following him um since that day he dropped in on us it didnt get in the way of work loo i promise i used my own time he expects me to drive garbage so it wasnt any big challenge he never noticed the camaro but i wanted to make sure so i exchanged it yesterday upgrade to ferrari said milo charcoal caddy said reed smoked windows just in case i figured with huck never going anywhere maybe i should try to figure out who paid to cast suspicion not that i dont think hes our best bet i just wanted to know who wanted us to think that maybe they could tell us something else he stopped and examined the tables plank top fidgeted like a kid whod just rattled off excuses to an irritated parent makes sense said milo learn anything actually yeah reed had watched fox take numerous business meetings at the ivy grill on the alley jeanpaul thats his thing running the tags of foxs dining companionsa sketchy move at besthad produced the answer new bmw registered to simone vander address on breakthorne wood thats up in the hills beverly hills po the name tracks to a thirtyoneyearold white female no wants warrants or priors and the physical stats match the woman i saw him with at geoffreys in malibu yup lives in bh but dines at the beach said milo who is she another exwife daughter said reed i found her birth certificate born locally cedarssinai fathers simon vander mothers kelly i looked kelly up too fiveyearold volvo sherman oaks address with a unit number daddy and second wife live the high life first wife gets an apartment reed said but the daughtersimonehas a pretty nice place gated secluded real woodsy you drove by this morning simon and simone said milo cute whats that alex bonding emotional identification i said couple more like that you score your own couch he turned back to reed what kind of pizza do you want im visualizing the xxxl deepdish grotesquely stuffedcrust halfsausage halfanchovy halfmeatballs halfmoosehead special reed looked dismayed i was wasting my time not at all but first we dine name your pie detective reed um plain cheese couple of slices go crazy kid ill have a medium sausage for myself extra garlic and chili flakes go put the order in then head over to the gum machine get us some sugarless spearmint dont want to risk undue offense to ms simone chapter reed left his cadillac at the pizza joint and we piled into milo s unmarked breakthorne wood was a steep carelessly paved road above benedict canyon the curves width and flavor of an old bridle path i felt right at home one thing simone vander shared with her father was a taste for dead ends her property was marked by a simple iron gate flanked by usedbrick posts the same masonry faced the shakeroof cottage visible through the slats darkstained pine planks graced the façade where brick hadnt been applied diamondpane windows a handcarved oak door and a witchonabroomstick weather vane added up to neorustic adorable a tomatocolored i convertible was parked in the flagstone motor court pine needles littered the car and the ground huge aleppos shadowing the property darkening most of the roof beyond the branches was a patchwork of brighter green and beige ivycolored hills reed had been antsy during the ride over justifying the surveillance of his brother repeatedly though milo never challenged him maybe itll be nothing but at least we can find out what she knows about huck maybe she once lived at the house or she visitseven if she doesnt come out and tell us anything about huck or parties or whatever maybe we can still get a feel for whether or not weird stuff went on there at the very least well find out theres nothing to find out and wont have to spin any more wheels not that im saying there isnt something hinky about huck i still think there is otherwise why would she pay to dig up dirt on him now facing simone vanders gatecall button the young detective jammed his hands in his pockets and chewed his cheek go ahead this is your time to shine said milo jabbing air with his finger anything you want me to concentrate on said reed follow your gut said milo reed frowned thats a reward not a punishment moses reed pushed the button milo said you get good grades ill let you spin the steering wheel but only when the cars in the driveway a youngsounding female voice said yes another female voice sang sweetly in the background ms vander detective reed la police is something wrong wed like a few minutes of your time maam regarding travis huck oh the music receded okay one sec several minutes passed before the carved door opened the woman in the opening was medium height pale stickthin and leggy with a gamin face under a layered mass of long black hair she wore a whiteandpinkstriped boatneck top white kneelength cargo pants fastened with bows at the patella backless pink sandals with stilt heels gold hoop earrings large enough to be visible across the motor court caught sunlight she studied us waved moe reed waved back she clicked the gate open im simone whats going on soft melodic voice a vibrato that made each word sound tentative she was one of those people who look better upon close inspection porcelain skin grayblue capillary mesh at the temples fine features graceful posture her eyes were brown and round with enormous irises dilated pupils implied curiosity her brows had been artfully plucked an ivory hand cradled the remote module she smiled and looked younger moe reed reintroduced himself identified milo then me leaving out my title no sense complicating matters simone vander said so many people i guess its pretty important before reed could respond an engine growled behind us a silver porsche cabriolet idled behind the gate the top was down revealing terracotta leather behind the wheel sat aaron fox wearing mirrored sunshades a beige linen jacket a black shirt oh good said simone vander as she clicked him in fox got out of his car buttoning his jacket perfectly cut linen pants made the outfit a suit black snakeskin loafers were cut low revealing mocha shins pi fox said milo lieutenant sturgis in the neighborhood so i thought id drop by he headed for simone vander moe reed blocked his way fox said excuse me not a good time simone said i called aaron right after you rang in boy you got here fast milo said whyd you call him maam i dont knowi guess i thought he should be here hes the one who knows all about travis reed half turned to face her next to his lifters bulk she looked like dry twigs you paid him to learn simone vander didnt reply aaron fox said ms vander has a perfect right to hire me to do anything legal and as she just said whatever she knows about mr huck i told her so why dont we just well do what we need to do said reed shoulders spreading as he tried to enlarge himself he was wider than fox but shorter by a couple of inches fox stood straight aiming to widen the disparity simone vander stared at both of them dominance duel tossup milo said aaron we appreciate your loyalty to your client reed said not to mention billing by the hour but right now we need to talk to her alone foxs smooth brown face betrayed no emotion reed said alone mr fox foxs grin was too sudden and wide to imply anything close to cheer tugging linen lapels he shrugged ill stay close simone call me when youre through okaythanks still smiling fox clapped his brother on the shoulder hard enough to echo reeds meaty hands rolled tight always great seeing you bro climbing back in the porsche fox revved shifted into gear twisted his head clear of the windshield gave the thumbsup focused on reed nice touch the caddy simone vanders living room was cheerful and cozy and overfurnished with chintz chairs oak pieces that mightve been old floral prints in white distressed frames a collection of japanese dolls filled a hutch that bordered a bright red tile kitchen warming our feet was a lavenderandcream aubusson rug the music wafting from a bang olufsen entertainment center was tori amos singing about a black dove a chinese camphorwood trunk served as a coffee table three giltframed photos stood on the top along with flowers and candles two shots were of simone vander straddling a beautiful brown horse and a closeup that had her holding a coffee cup backed by the ocean the largest photo positioned dead center was a formal portrait a tall stooped sixtyish bearded man with thin gray hair brushed forward in an awkward combover a tiny pretty asian woman at least twenty years his junior and an almondeyed boy around eight holding both their hands the boy and the man wore tuxedos the woman a long red gown both adults smiled the childs mouth was tiny and tight simone vander touched the frame with a frenchtipped nail and smiled thats my brother kelvin hes a genius she switched off the music as milo and reed and i settled on the longest sofa our combined weight compressed fluffy down cushions a foot or so simone vander asked us if we wanted something to drink and when we demurred she took a hardbacked chair and crossed her legs the chair was high and we had to look up to make eye contact with her she fussed with a sleeve one pink sandal dangled sorry she said for calling aaron its just that hes been really helpful to me investigating travis huck said reed uhhuh she pushed thick black hair behind a flat delicate ear another network of blue veins marked the juncture of jaw and lobe suggesting translucence she hugged herself i guess youd like to know why i hired him in the first place reed said yes maam aaron came highly recommended she said searching our faces for confirmation or debate who referred you to him maam a man whos worked with my fatherdoing real estate dealshad used aaron before said he was the best it wasnt something i was sure about the whole thing felt kind of strange hiring a private eye i mean but i just felt i had to when i heard about selena you knew selena said reed she was my brothers piano teacher sometimes shed show up at the house when i was there and wed talk she seemed like a really nice person i was so upset when i heard what happened to her reed said talk about what simone smiled you know casual stuff she seemed sweet kelvinmy brotherreally liked her hes been through other teachersstrict really stuffyprofessors from conservatories they leaned hard on him and kelvin had enough hes been playing since hes three got tired of practicing six hours a day just because youre a genius doesnt mean youre a slave right he also had his fill of classical music wanted to write his own songs dad and nadinekelvins momwere fine with it theyre not like other parents in that situation what situation is that having a genius a prodigy said simone vander from what i saw selena was a great fit for kelvin she told me shed gone through the same thing being real talented expected to practice all the time frown this is horrible kelvins going to freak out reed glanced at milo milo said so you liked selena there was nothing not to like a hand pressed the side of her face left a faint rosy print the way i found out just horrible i was getting ready to go out and caught it on the news half listening you know i heard selenas name but thought no youre making a mistake so i looked up one of the tv station websites but the story wasnt posted and i forgot about it but the next morning there it was i couldnt believe it moe reed said what made you suspect mr huck i cant say i suspected him its nothing that definite i just the first thing i didwhen i learned what had happened to selenawas call my father his regular cell phone wasnt working so i got transferred to an international cell because he was in hong kong he was in a meeting but i told him he was stunned said hed let nadine and kelvin know when he called them theyre not with him no theyre in taiwan visiting nadines family there dads looking at some real estate in hong kong moe reed said about huck yes im not saying i suspected him but he always gave me a weird feeling pause and i know for a fact that he was interested in selena interested how maam you dont need to call me that said simone vander maam mr huck was interested in selena physically not that i ever saw him do or say anything overt but a girl can tell half smile at least i think im pretty perceptive what did he do looked at her said simone you know that way with a capital l she toyed with her hair i dont want to get anyone in trouble to be truthful sometimes i felt he looked at me that way no big deal he never stepped out of line and normally id never say anything but when i found out what happenedyou wont tell him will you that i hired aaron of course not said reed guy acted creepy you had every right she exhaled thats a strong word i dont want to make accusations but travis has a way of making everything seem not sneaky i guess the best word would be covert like a spy she frowned not satisfied with the choice of vocabulary furtive said milo perfect yes furtive like everythings in code like hes looking over his shoulder all the time and that makes you want to do it too im a really direct person so but my dad likes him and dads brilliant so who am i to say what does your father like about huck he never said but you could just tell which is why i never made a fuss dad has a good feel for people thats part of what made him so successful she chuckled who do you think bought me this house my job sure couldnt pay for it and im the first to admit it what do you do work with kids nanny preschool teacher ive done some remedial tutoring and i probably shouldnt admit it but yes like everyone else i wanted to act but wants a long way from do right now im taking some downtime maybe ill transition to something totally different anyway dads not like youd imagine for a man in his position hes a people person and his instinct is to trust he always says hed prefer to trust and end up disappointed rather than live his life as a cynic a cynic understands the price of everything and the value of nothing thats his favorite saying reed said travis huck hasnt disappointed him yet apparently said simone vander maybe because travis doesnt have a life of his own is always there to run some errand whatever i know thats helpful for dad and nadine but maybe thats what bothers me maybe travis is too involved she sat forward folding like origami being an assistant is more than a job he lives in that house exhaling thats why i hired aaron to find out if there is some reason to be worried and you guys know what he found travis killed someone she hugged herself moe reed said did mr fox give you the details i know it was kids pushing and shoving but still someone died and he went to prison thinking about it last night i didnt sleep very well brown eyes drifted to milo aaron said youd follow through lieutenant that you never let go of a lead chapter we left simone vander standing just inside her gate milo drove down benedict canyon slowly moe reed said shes someone who knows huck guess this puts more focus on him as a solo psycho loo grunt at lexington road reed tried again it wont be a problem loo what wont be aaron and me never assumed it would be one thing she gave us doesnt sound like the vanders are running from anything what are we thinking about those sex parties selena played at good question so theyre still potential suspects no reason to eliminate them or anyone else milo smiled with an alternative lifestyle whether or not thats what got herand the other womenkilled who the hell knows i said selenas missing computer says there are secrets the killer wants to stay hidden reed said or its just the bad guy getting rid of any link between him and selena meaning someone she knew and she knew huck and now we know he had the hots for her toss in the baldie ramos saw and hes looking better and better creepy guy said milo but not to the vanders simons a sharpeyed businessman trusting according to his daughter but she never said he was an outright sucker why would he give huck a job that had him living in the weirdthe alternative lifestyle milo didnt answer until wed traveled a mile on sunset all right well invite mr huck for an interview keep it mellow maybe he wont lawyer up immediately but not today give it a few more nights of surveillance gods smiling at us guyll finally leave the house head straight to century boulevard solicit a working girl under your watchful eye detective reed royalflush scenario he tries something nasty and you nab him heroically that happens you get to be at the press conference and ill do the paperwork reed said you think hed be that stupid with all those bodies turning up he goes back there youre the one been itching to watch him kiddo silence milo said yeah it would be stupid but without stupid criminals the job would be as cheerful as cancer and from hucks perspective there really isnt much heat we had a twominute chat with him havent been back the press conference emphasized no leads hes got to feel we know diddly which aint far from the truth reed said feeling confident so he strikes out i said the pattern of the murders implies a sequence of confidencebuilding start with women who could be considered throwaway victims and bury them out of sight no one catches on kick it up to someone bound to be missed display her call it in just to make sure mr hissy said reed and everything goes down at the marsh whats that staying in his geographic comfort zone i said the marsh could be part of the thrill the place turns him on how dr hargrove called it hallowed ground lust murders are often about control through defilement what better place to showcase your handiwork there couldve also been a practical reason theres limited public access to the marsh if hed stuck to stashing bodies in the muck his crimes couldve stayed undetected for years instead he decides to advertise reed gave a low whistle life do get twisted milo said first step toward being an ace detective kid what is figuring out youre living in a different world pigeons had partied atop reeds rented cadillac he grumbled story of my life sounding uncannily like milo his cell phone went off reed im so sorry maam yes absolutely maam pulling his pad out he scrawled hung up that was mary lewis sheralyn dawkinss mom she lives in fallbrook whats more important watching huck or talking to her her said milo bring a scrape kit at the very least well get a firm id on sheralyn ill watch huck depending on what she has to say loo i can start out now do a turnaround and be back at the vander house in eight nine hours you start out now you hit the crush forget it get the dna kit pack yourself an overnight bag leave when its clearer take the coastal route find yourself a bed in capistrano whatever eat a nice seafood dinner watch cable be ready for ms lewis in the morning any suggestions where to stay departments not gonna pay for the ritzcarlton youll be lucky to get a mattress and cheez whiz from a vending machine and for gods sake fill out the formsno forget it ill do it for you ill do it said reed promise yadda yadda yadda the two of them drove off the pizza palazzo lot and i headed home i phoned robin asked if she wanted me to pick up dinner she said beat you to it prime rib whats the occasion prime rib i was thinking we could invite milo and rick on the off chance ricks free feeling hospitable got my hostess gown and my martini shaker and i bought enough cow for eight which should accommodate milo it dawned on me after he called you this morning i havent talked to him in agesand we havent seen the two of them socially for even longer nice thought i said but milos doing surveillance tonight oh starting when after dark lets eat early you feeling okay what acute attack of sociability ive been too isolated darling you get to go out meet people i talk to blanche and pieces of wood ill call milo ill call he has trouble refusing me pleasant surprise for both invitees dr rick silverman was off shift at the er milo said red meat public safety will just have to cool its goddamn heels rick arrived first wearing a maroon silk shirt pressed jeans and mesh loafers bearing an enormous orchid arrangement for robin his silver hair was longer than usual his mustache boasted of surgical skills robin took the flowers and kissed him blanche rubbed her head against his cuffs he kneeled petted gorgeous can i take her home as a party favor love you richard said robin but not that much he played with the dog some more eyed the roast sizzling as it rested smells fantastic glad i took an extra dose of lipitor can i help with anything nothing to help with manhattan on the rocks makers mark capful of red vermouth dash of orange bitters no cherry impressive said rick not that i ever stray from the familiar he sat blanche settled at his feet a long arm dangled adroit fingers kneaded her flews big guy should be here any minute robin said he phoned half an hour ago said he got beeped by downtown would let me know if he couldnt make it i havent heard from him since downtown that again what again new chiefs a handson administrator milo s never had to deal with anything like it its probably better than the old days siberia but the personal attention cuts both ways right alex i said pressure to perform exactly rick tried milos cell got voice mail didnt bother to leave a message robin brought his drink turned to me chivas baby thanks as she poured rick carried his manhattan to the kitchen window looked out at trees and sky i forget how pretty it is he sipped sounds like this marsh mess wont resolve soon alex i nodded terrible he said those poor women though im thinking selfishly disgustingly narcissistic in fact i got invited to give a speech at an alumni meeting thought we both might make it do a new england thing afterward milos never been robin said undergrad at brown or med school at yale yale he laughed no big whup those things are always mindnumbing the front door shut a voice roared i smell carcass milo stomped into the kitchen hugged everyone sucked up all the oxygen in the room the look on ricks face was pure relief within three minutes milo had guzzled juice from the fridge downed a beer inspected the roast as if it were evidence dipped a finger into a gravy spot on the counter and tasted oh this is going to be good where we going in terms of wine the four of us ate lustily and polished off a bottle of new zealand pinot when robin asked how milo was doing he took the question literally and reviewed the basics of the marsh murders rick said appetizing milo ran a finger over his lips robin said no im interested milo said you might be but dr rick is repelled and dr alex is bored out of his skull whoever has custody of the potatoes please pass small talk commenced milo didnt contribute much continued to shovel food like a combine rick worked hard at ignoring the rate of ingestion hes still trying to get milo in for a checkup blanche toddled in from her nap shes the only dog milo s ever admitted liking but when she brushed against his leg he ignored her rick lifted blanche onto his lap worked her ears milo said arf and stared into space robin said dessert im full thanks said rick congrats said milo for what speaking for yourself we moved outside to the pond ate fruit drank coffee watched the fish tried to identify constellations in the moonless sky milo said twinkle twinkle and lit up a cigar rick said at least its outside you wont be poisoning the hosts milo tousled his hair how thoughtful of me what youre doing to your own lungs we wont talk about milo cupped a hand near his ear ey whats that sonny rick sighed milo said i am beyond mere chemistry ah the theory call the nobel committee what theory said robin hes been so long on the job that his internal organs are petrified and immune to toxins man of granite said milo smoking hungrily holding his timex to a lowvoltage spot bulb he said oops its that time got up stubbed the cigar on stone hugged everyone and left rick picked up the butt held it between thumb and index finger where should i toss this by midnight robin and i were in bed under crisp clean covers she fell asleep quickly i dragged myself through the usual brainsweep working to quiet my mind was back in missouri mastering my fathers remington feeling bigger than dadbigger than a bearwhen the phone rang dad said hey al you really caught on ring ring ring ring ring stupid no phones in the forest i pulled the covers over my head stayed gigantic chapter robin was up by six working in her studio soon after i found her sliding a razorsharp miniplane over a pristine rectangle of spruce from the size and thickness of the wood the future soundboard of an archtop guitar stromberg copy going to try the diagonal brace see if i can tweak it for some interesting nuances brought you coffee i said thanksyouve got crust in your eyethere we go gone feel rested i tossed a bit get the message from your service havent checked yet i yawned when did it come in two calls actually twelve forty and then at five both from milo i reached him at his desk huck did something huck did the usual nothing but theres another body in the marsh oh no poor woman not exactly from seven thirty to nine pm the previous night silford duboff and his girlfriend alma reynolds had enjoyed a vegan dinner at real food daily on la cienega more accurately i enjoyed it said reynolds on the other side of the oneway glass sil was grumpy the entire time preoccupied with what i couldnt pry out i found the evening frustrating but held my peace sil ordered his favorite item on their menu the tv dinner normally thats palliative this time it wasnt he closed up completely so after a while i stopped trying and we both simply consumed telling the story to milo with authority but curious detachment as if teaching a class a tall solid woman in her fifties reynolds had an eagle nose a heavy jaw piercing blue eyes and waistlength gray hair plaited tightly the lecturers tone came honestly for fifteen years shed worked as a junior college instructor in oregon teaching political science and economic history before retiring due to budget cuts and apathetic students and fascist bureaucracy now she sat across from milo straightbacked dryeyed wearing last nights blue work shirt tucked into gray flannel trousers hemp sandals tortoiseshell reading glasses hung from a chain turquoiseandsilver earrings livened her ears milo said no idea what was on his mind not a clue he gets like that uncommunicative like most men milo didnt argue alma reynolds wouldnt have cared if he had she said we had our dessert and left after the way sil had behaved i decided to cut my losses with a good book i asked him to drive me to my apartment made it clear he was to proceed to his both of you live in santa monica two blocks apart but any space can be a universe if one wants it to this was one of the times i wanted it to were there lots of those times in your relationship not lots said alma reynolds but not a rarity sil could be difficult like most men i put up with it because he was a fine man if theres anything that emerges from this conversation lieutenant that should be it she took a deep breath through her mouth oh well she said no sense fighting it fighting what maam this tears streamed down her cheeks embedding her hands in her thick gray hair she wailed milo took his time got her to repeat the story rather than drive alma home duboff had veered south to the bird marsh shed protested hed ignored her a dispute ensued during which she told him to stop obsessing about the marsh he said the place was his responsibility she said the damn place was fine he said dont refer to it like that she said youre being irrational nothing the police did caused any serious disturbance time to move on sil he ignored her last straw she blew raising her voice in a way she hadnt done since her divorce letting him know her green credentials were every bit as good as his he was confusing ecological consciousness with obsessivecompulsive neurosis he ignored her she ordered him to stop the car he kept driving if shed had a cell phone she wouldve used it but she didnt neither did he those towers no matter what they wanted you to believe were carcinogenic and disastrous for birds and insects and shed rather be stranded in timbuktu than capitulate to a toxic lifestyle she insisted he stop he drove faster whats gotten into you pretending she wasnt there damn you sil talk to theres something i need to see what something thats no answer it wont take long baby dont baby me you know i despise tha afterward well go home and brew some tea youll go to your home and ill go to my home and any tea i drink will be my own damn tea suit yourself you dont care what i want do you cool the drama alma theres something i need to see youre imprisoning methats psychologically toxic behav it wont take long what wont not important then why do you need to see it not important to you what the hell are you talki someone called me told me the answer was there the answer to what what happened to who those women the women in the yes who who called silence who sil they didnt say youre lying i can always tell silence someone calls you out of the clear blue and you comply like a droid silence this is absurd sil i insist silence blind obedience kills the soul the marsh is what matters the damn marsh is fine cant you get that through your thick skull apparently not unbelievable someone calls you pant like a lapdog maybe thats what it takes alma what a dog thats how they found the women oh so now youre a detective is that what you want to be sil a uniformed droid it wont take long what am i supposed to do while you nose around just sit for a moment it wont take long but it did sitting parked on jefferson near the eastside entrance she grew nervous then scared wasnt ashamed to admit it because to be truthful the place always spooked her especially at night and it was spooky on this night a moonless night the sky thick and tarry and black no one around no one those stupid condos abominations of humancentric narcissism looming down some of their lights on but little good did they do so distant could well have been on another planet waiting for sil five minutes six seven ten fifteen eighteen where the hell was he fighting her nervousness with anger shed learned the technique from a faculty buddy in oregon who taught cognitive psych substitute an empowering emotion for a helpless one it worked she grew hotter and hotter under the collar thinking about sil so rude arrogant compulsive goddamn thoughtless leaving her stuck in the damn car when he got back thered be hell to pay twentyfive minutes and still no sign of him and the anger began morphing back to nervousness worse than nervousness fear she wasnt ashamed to admit it time for another strategy confront the helplessness with action she got out of the car walked toward the marsh encountered pure darkness and stopped calling his name no answer calling louder nothing she took a step forward encountered way too much darkness and stoppedwhere was sils penlightsaid you get your ass over here and take me the hell home and dont call me until i call you the impact sent her flying hard vicious fist in her belly so much force it felt as if the hand were penetrating her innards electric pain sparked through her body captured her breath the second blow caught her on the side of the head and she went down a foot kicked the small of her back she curled herself tiny prayed no more punishment would come just as quickly as the attack had begun it ended footsteps fading into the night no sound of a car engine so she lay there thinking hes watching waited for a long time before being able to entertain the big question was that sil if not where was sil duboff had been knifed on the pathway bloodstains splotched the dirt twelve feet past selena basss dump site care had been taken to brush the surrounding soil all the way to the sidewalk obscuring footprints no errant hairs or body fluids that werent duboffs no tire tracks along either side of the street a deep back wound had pierced duboffs left lung the blow driven with enough force to crack a rib the followup was an eartoear throat slash with duboff lying facedown bad guy probably lifted him by the head said milo reached around and bam sneak attack in the dark it neednt have taken more than seconds alma reynolds had sat in the car for nearly half an hour ample time to clean the scene by calling out duboffs name shed announced her presence to the killer subsequent speech had pinpointed her location and hed charged her assaulting a potential witness but making no effort to finish her off too intent on making his escape hed expected a oneonone meeting but duboff ever the contrarian had brought along alma reynolds put her in mortal danger milo said you still all right maam from your injuries the question offended her as i told you the first time there are no injuries except to my ego she pushed herself upright suppressed a wince bastard she said leaving the interview room stiffly im going to miss him incredibly milo and i moved to his office i said duboff was a misanthropic crank but he trusted someone enough to meet in the dark alma reynolds knew he was lying when he said he didnt know whod phoned the lure was solving the murders pretty flimsy he said why would he fall for that dedicated activist shows up the cops and keeps the sacred grounds pristine guess so being at the marsh after dark didnt scare him alma said he dropped in regularlyincluding the night selena was found when he missed the dump by a narrow margin maybe too narrow alex he was part of it like you said before two guys would make the job easier and talk about someone with an intense attachment to the marsh plus the guys weird we considered him in the beginning dropped him off the screen when we couldnt find any felony record or links to huck maybe that was a bigtime goof he showed up to talk to his confederate i said then why take reynolds along he thought it would be a brief chat like he told reynolds got surprised be interesting if hucks name shows up on any save the marsh mailing lists be interesting to know where the hell huck was last night which was the point of sitting on my commodious butt watching the shrubbery no sign of him leaving or entering the house but that means squat he coulda made his move before i arrived returned after i left to take the call on duboff when did the call come in right after midnight but that was well past duboffs murder ol alma wasnt wearing a watch but she knows they left the restaurant shortly after nine guesses she got blindsided at ten thirty or so which would put duboff getting gutted at ten or so she lay there out of it for another half hour finally got up and looked for duboff which was stupid but adrenaline can do all sorts of things to your judgment after she found him she ran back out to the street screaming no one around to hear like you said its a ghost town at night so she got back in duboffs car drove to pacific division and reported the murder pacific has her logged in at eleven thirtytwo they put her in a room took her statement dispatched a car to the marsh confirmed the body and phoned reed he was in solana beach called me i was taking a bladder break saw the message called back cowboyed to the marsh leaving huck plenty of time and opportunity to return home he rubbed his face im losing it alex shoulda driven up to the vander house leaned on the gate bell if huck wasnt there maybe someone else wasa maid whatever and id know you got called to a murder scene you went guy was dead what was the rush cursing yeah it was the logical response aka utter lack of creative thinking unseemly i said what is selfflagellation from the man of granite right he said im thinking sandstone chapter an expedited search warrant of silford duboffs apartment produced nothing of value the only surprise was philosophical dogeared copies of the complete works of ayn rand hidden under duboffs mattress like pornography no knives guns garottes sex toys weird body fluids incriminating notes said milo no computer either but reynolds says he never had one damn fridge had fruits veggies wholegrain everything rah rah for the healthy lifestyle moe reed returned from fallbrook with cheek scrapes of sheralyn dawkinss mother and the dead womans stunned fifteenyearold son the mother worked as a housekeeper on a rich mans avocado ranch devon dawkins was an honor student did farm chores during his spare time reed said nice lady the way she described sheralyns leg break matches jane one to a t she wouldnt talk in front of devon but after she sent him out she poured it out sheralyn was a problem since high school low selfesteem drugs alcohol bad men milo said same story big lauras mommy told us any bad men in particular she meant sheralyns teen years but even back then she didnt know any names that was the problem sheralyn kept her private life private wouldnt give an inch to mom the two of them hadnt been in contact for years i got the feeling mom had been happy with the arrangement wanted a shot at raising devon properly really nice kid it was tough giving him the bad news i said how long has the family been living down there they moved to san diego right after sheralyns father got out of the military his civilian job was school district custodial manager he died twelve years ago sheralyn was born in san diego did a couple years of high school dropped out her mom never heard of travis huck and the sixpack with hucks picture didnt jog her memory milo said why should life be easy she did tell me one thing that might be interesting when devon couldnt hear sheralyn had a thing for pain not causing it experiencing it mom said when she was a teenager shed cut herself on the arms pull her eyelashes out once in a while shed burn herself with cigarettes sometimes shed come home from being with boys and have bruises on her neck and arms mom threatened to take her to a psychiatrist sheralyn yelled at her to mind her own damn business ran out of the house stayed away for a few days what boiled things over was sheralyn getting pregnant when she was sixteen and refusing to say who the father was she was already into dope so the parents worried about a drug baby when devon was born healthy they tried to get sheralyn to let them adopt him sheralyn went ballistic took the baby and left no contact for three years then sheralyn shows up without warning stays for a couple days things seem to be going okay all of a sudden she sneaks out in the middle of the night leaves devon behind into pain said milo and being squeezed around the neck said reed that would make her an easy mark for a sadist right they start off playing the choking game for what she thinks is money and fun he turns on the pressure shes caught off guard make sense doc makes perfect sense i said it could also be our link to selena the parties she played at got extreme and she joined in reed said thinking she was in control but she got flipped milo said sheralyns story also reminds me of selenas bad feelings between daughter and mother leaving home reed said so what now got a call from the chief said milo caitlin frostig reed slumped am i in some sort of shit no youre fine he wanted to know how we were doing on the marsh murders i gave him the honest answer and he pretended to be understanding and patient then he brought up frostig checking up on me said reed his fierceness takes a personal interest in the troops did he make like im supposed to be doing something on caitlin because i did everything i could think of he wanted to make sure you ignore caitlin until we close the marsh murders that was before duboff im sure it goes double now okay any hint about a task force loo why you want one hell no said reed i was just wondering another body and all that im green havent exactly burned up the record books milo s hand clapped reeds shoulder its a whodunit kiddo meaning no one burns up anything we simmer slowly and hope something cooks no one with half a brainand the sun king has at least thatexpects resolution by the fourth commercial break okay said reed he actually mentioned caitlin by name first and last he probably got a call her father works for a bigtime tech guy i said caitlins your missing person reed nodded college girl left work thirteen months ago hasnt been seen since cold as frozen fish sticks and they hand it to me my second case if i pissed someone off and its punishment i cant figure out who or how milo said you solved your first one thats batting five hundred unfortunately this aint baseball reed tightened the knot of his tie so when can we talk to huck pools of water spread beneath simon vanders aston martin lincoln town car and mercedes moisture blackened the slate motor court reed said car wash day either they have a service or huck does it himself lexus is gone maybe hes out gassing it or the car wash dude is he pushed the callbox button no answer from the house same for two more attempts milo looked up the vanders landline and punched it got voice mail kept his voice even as he left a message for travis huck to get in touch cordial as an invitation to a poker game we loitered near the octopus gates twenty minutes in the mailman drove up and dropped ad circulars and bulk mail into a slot on one of the gateposts reed went up to him know these people the carrier shook his head never see anyone around his fingers brushed the gate i have packages i just leave em here no one signs private huh rich said the mailman these kind of people keep you at a distance what kind of packages wine fruit packages gourmet food the good life right hoisting his bag he trudged down the road milo waited descended calle maritimo himself far enough to disappear around a bend he returned a few minutes later nothing plus nothing time to boogie leave your bona fides moses reed dropped one card onto the mail pile wedged another between the gate and the post think huck mightve rabbited theres always that chance we drove to pch the sun was custard the ocean a melting jigsaw puzzle of green and blue no lexus in front of the vander beach house no more success with the bell push there moe reed tapped the high wooden fence that blocked off the beach whats next a moat thats what money buys said milo we cruised up and down the highway scoped every filling station until broad beach for a sign of the lexus gas in the palisades was nearing five bucks a gallon for highoctane that didnt stop motorists from lining up for a petrochemical iv huck wasnt one of them milo said lets get back call the crypt get a time line on duboffs autopsy see if theyve done a prelim anything useful on the visual then we need to work on confirming that jane three is demaura montouthe victim id isnt likely to be a big deal on this one but we cant afford to screw up and get it wrong that working girl said demaura was from alabama but it could be arkansas anywhere down south hell it could be arizona or albania if we can locate some next of kin maybe well get lucky and demaura talked to someone about an especially creepy john like the guy big laura escaped from like him said milo in a perfect world back at the station a civilian clerk id never seen before said ive been trying to call you lieutenant never got any message said milo well i did try which number did you use the clerk read off a number the final digit was off by two well thats what i was given said the clerk without remorse anyway someone came in to see you went upstairs is still there so no big deal james robert bob hernandez was a blueeyed muscular sixfooter with slickedback brasscolored hair and a fourinch vandyke of matching hue he wore jeans with rolledup cuffs weathered motorcycle boots and a plaid shirt with short sleeves folded up high tattoos the color of swimming pool water ran from thick wrists to corded biceps tweety bird popeye smooching cherubs on his right arm devotion to kathy was proclaimed calligraphically pro jobs not prison art hernandezs record was minor drunk driving traffic warrants failures to appear after running him through the databases milo returned to the interview room and sat back down during the brief break id waited with hernandez the two of us talking about sports moe reed was out processing the pretty wooden box hernandez had brought for showandtell phoning the crypt first and getting authorization to carry the box personally to dr hargroves lab human bones said milo thats what they look like to me said bob hernandez i mean im not a scientist but i looked them up on the internet and they match human fingers enough for three complete hands doing research huh didnt want to waste your time sir we appreciate that so go over again how you found them didnt find em bought em said hernandez i mean not them specifically a whole bunch of stuff unclaimed storage they have auctions people not paying their monthlies like you guys do with confiscated cars hernandez smiled lost an el camino that way what else was in the bin garbage bags full of crap bicycle i thought might be worth something turned out to be crap some old board games newspapers i tossed it all except the box because the box was nice wood later i found out what was inside im pretty sure theyre finger bones cause they dont look like anything else so i called pacific division and they sent me to detective reed and he said to come here so here i am was the box wrapped yeah in one of the garbage bags turned out to be brazilian rosewood which is rare endangered wouldve been better to find jewelry or coins how long ago was this mr hernandez two weeks i tried to find something else they couldve been some other animal but from what i can tell theyre human so i didnt put em up on ebay that would be wrong ebay accept that kind of thing i never got that far said hernandez didnt even try probably coulda sold em but then i heard about those murders on tv peering at milo four women and that marsh is pretty close to the storage unit i know this is three not four it probably doesnt mean anything but i just thought i should come forward you did the right thing mr hernandez wheres the facility pacific public storage culver boulevard just before it intersects with jefferson you live in alhambra sure do bit of a drive to the auction not compared with other places i been said hernandez did one in san luis obispo yellow smile heck id drive to lodi you tell me theres bargains auctions are your main job nope im trained as a landscaper looking for work been looking for a while too long hernandez sat back and laughed my brothers said it would be like this like what personal questions come forward be a good citizen bobby but youre gonna be looked at like a suspect because thats what the jobs like we dont trust nobody your brothers are on the job genes covina pd craigs south pasadena dads a retired firefighter even moms into it west covina dispatcher milo smiled youre the nonconformist no offense lieutenant but you couldnt pay me enough to be cooped up in a car or an office give me a backhoe and five acres and im sailing speaking of which id better get going job interview out in canoga park theyre moving big palms and i know how to do that milo took his information thanked him again shook his hand at the door hernandez said one more thing sir its not the main reason i came in but ive got a court date on my warrants so if youre of a mind to put in a good word your lawyer told you to come forward no it was my idea but he thought it might help so did my brothers you can call either of them theyll vouch for me if im outta line just tell me and it never came up whos your lawyer some freshoutofschool pd thats what bugs me said hernandez mason soto hes more into stopping the war in eyerack milo copied down sotos name and number ill tell him youve been a big help to lapd bob hernandez beamed thank you sir appreciate it deeplythose bones at first i thought they might be from one of those anatomical models you know what doctors learn from but theres no holes drilled through them like you would do if you were stringing them together so theyre just loose bones short hard tug at the vandyke cant see any reason for a mentally healthy person to want something like that chapter pacific public storage was a city block of beige bunkers hemmed by twentyfoot chain link flagrantly orange tenfoot signage promised special deals the companys logo was a stack of suitcases we drove past and clocked the drive to the marsh before circling back six minutes each way at moderate speed perched above the entry to the facilitys parking lot was a security camera a quonset hut served as the office one man worked the desk young chubby bored his orange polo shirt bore the logo his id badge said philip a biography of thomas jefferson was unfolded facedown on the counter passionate sports talk blared from a radio milo eyed the book history buff school can i help you police the badge made philip blink milo said some contraband was found in one of your units number fourteen fiftyfive contraband like dope lets just say something illegal what can you tell me about that bin philip leafed through a ledger one four five five that ones vacant we know that mr phil stillway the contraband in question was obtained when the contents were auctioned off two weeks ago mr stillway ive only been here a week milo tapped the ledger could you please check who rented the unit its not in here in here is just the occupied units occupied youve got tenants living here philip gaped no sir i meant material belongings no one lives here thats against regulations milo winked and grinned oh said philip you were joking who rented fourteen fiftyfive and when philip walked two steps to a computer sat down tapped keys says here its been in arrears for sixty days and that was two weeks ago um yeah there was an auction everything got cleaned out tap tap says here the rental agreement was fourteen months ago one year paid in advance sixty days in arrears paid how tap tap tap says here cash whos the renter says here sawyer comma initial t address pob malibu california malibu s zip code was milo scowled as he copied down the information what other information did sawyer t give philip read off an phone number malibu s but with everything cellular logic no longer pertains milo said okay lets have a look at your security tapes pardon the camera out front oh that said philip its for when the gates close after eight pm and renters want access you lock up after eight yeah but they can give a deposit and apply for a twentyfourhour card key when do the cameras get turned on when theres no one in the office which is at night said philip after eight did t sawyer apply for a card key philip swung back to his keyboard the box is checked yes looks like we never got the card back so the deposit was forfeited two hundred dollars okay said milo lets see those tapes anything before two weeks ago would be best it might be best said philip but its also impossible everythings recorded over after fortyeight hours two days and gone tight security system youve got here this contraband was it dangerous like toxic waste something hazardous my parents arent too cool with me working here worried about the stuff people store nothing toxic or radioactive said milo is there anyone in the company who can tell us something about mr sawyer i can ask but i dont think so everything we need to know is here tapping the computer lets look at the last fortyeight hours of tape sure philip reached to his left and switched on a vcr the feed went straight to the computer and the screen turned gray stayed that way hmm he said tickling the keyboard and changing nothing its not showing much i dont know stay with it phil a perusal of the help menu and several false starts later we were staring at a grainy blackandwhite closeup of the storage facility gate static shot but for a time register playing bingo the camera angle was tilted to give a truncated view of the lot maybe fifteen feet of asphalt well short of the parking slots i said all you wanted to know about the driveway but were afraid to ask phil started to smile saw the look on milo s face and changed his mind the screen reverted to gray error message philip said looks like its broken id better report it milo said fastforward to make sure its blank philip complied nothing on the rest of the tape give us a key to fourteen fiftyfive i guess its okay think of it this way said milo if there is something dangerous in there well be the ones who get zapped not you i need to stay up here anyway said philip scrounging in a drawer this one should work if it doesnt i dont know on the way to the bin i said t sawyer hucks buddy har dee har har the facility was laid out in a series of dim narrow hallways that rightangled and continued a broken snake of cement block tunnel door after plywood door a variety of padlocks some of them serious company keybolt on the hasp of milo gloved up unlocked pulled the door open on fifty square feet of unlit vacancy floors swept clean not a speck of dust the smell of bleach floated to the hallway he rubbed his eyes ran his penlight over every surface do i bother wasting the techies time depends on how much buttcovering you need to do ill tell em to luminol maybe well get lucky we returned to the front office philip was playing a game on the company computer some floridly colored thing featuring ninjas and space aliens and sloeeyed women whose chests defied gravity hi he said continuing to work the mouse milo said are vacant units generally cleaned by the company uhhuh with bleach its a special solution we get from the home office said philip kills anything so the next person doesnt have to worry how considerate said milo yup philip encountering a lancewielding demon materializing out of a massive mauve cloudburst squinted hunched forward and braced himself for battle milo gunned the unmarked and played nascar on side streets all the way to the station itching to get back to see if a warrant on travis hucks quarters at the vander house was feasible the assistant das hed talked to so far werent encouraging but he had a couple more to go john nguyens sometimes helpful lawyersurfing i said talk about toxic waste i left him to the legal system and drove home thinking about molars and incisors demaura montouthe the leading candidate for jane doe three was fiftyone a fossil by street standards the tenyear mug shot moe reed had unearthed showed a droopyeyed wrinkled lanternjawed visage crowned by a platinum birds nest the life shed led was a road map to mental and physical breakdown and she looked well into her sixties yet shed held on to her teeth lucky genetics or was full dentition her last shred of vanity the result of special care i looked up free facilities offering dental services in la county found eight began calling using my title success at number four a neighborhood walkin clinic run by the dental school at the u rose avenue south of lincoln walking distance to selena basss garage digs another brief car ride to the bird marsh i asked the receptionist when ms montouthe had last visited doctor only went so far shes on our files thats all i can tell you whos her dentist dr martin shes with a patient when will she be free shes busy all afternooncan i put you on hold no need western district community adjunct dental health center was a converted storefront wedged between a designer ice cream parlor and a vintageclothing shop pretty people flocked to both of the neighbors a couple of homeless men hung out near the clinics wideopen door smoking and laughing one guys worldly belongings were piled on the sidewalk the other held up a set of dentures and guffawed through a black maw they did me good mr lemon shopping bag said lemme try em gimme a can of soup yeah the exchange was aborted when they saw me coming two cracked palms blocked my way as they panhandled me simultaneously breakfast money perfesser its afternoon mr lemon pancakes for the people powder to the people highfives and raucous phlegmy laughter i gave them each a five and they whooped stepped aside when they tried the same routine with a woman in dance tights leaving the ice cream joint clutching a double cone studded with candy bits she said fuck off inside the clinics aquablue waiting room a heavy woman with fearful eyes clutched a squalling baby and snuck glances at a sunkenfaced codger slumped half asleep his clothes were filthy he couldve turned the scene outside into the three amigos sitting upright in a corner was a skinnyflabby mohawked kid around twenty with branded arms a missing frontal incisor and vengeful eyes the receptionist was cute and buxom and blond whatever her black tank top revealed was smooth and tan she remembered my name and that killed her smile dr martins still busy sir ill wait it could take a while when she takes a break please let her know demaura montouthe may be dead dea her hand jetted to her mouth what kind of doctor are you i showed her my lapd consultant badge her lips worked she looked ill oh my god hold on she hurried through a back door the kid with the mohawk drawled everyone gets dead faye m martin dds was thirty or so and gorgeous with ivory skin a heartshaped face framed by gleaming redbrown hair liquid dark eyes and a figure a white coat couldnt camouflage stunning resemblance to robinshe couldve been robins younger sisterand god help me i felt a tug below my waist i worked at staying businesslike as we shook hands her businesslike manner and my thinking about demaura montouthe helped as she led me to an unused treatment room she asked what a psychologist was doing working with the police i gave her the short version and it seemed to satisfy her the room smelled of raw steak and mint gum care posters and ominous photos of what happened when gum care was abandoned papered the walls canisters of free toothbrushes and paste shared space with chromeplated picks and curettes and bottles of cotton balls off to one side was a bright red patient chart faye martin perched on a rolling stool and placed her hand on the chart crossing her legs she unbuttoned her coat revealed a black blouse black slacks a gold chain bearing chunky freeform amethysts her figure was fuller than first impression she seemed unaware of her looks the only other seating was the dental chair still in full recline she said oh sorry got up and adjusted the tilt i climbed on as long as youre here open wide and lets have a look at your bitesorry its terrible about demaura i shouldnt joke i said theres no better reason to joke faye martin said guess so im assuming it was a violent death if the body we have is her it was the body she sat back down poor demaura do you have any idea who did it not yet confirming identity would be a big help i described the dental irregularities dr hargrove had listed its her said faye martin darn you dont need to look at xrays before i swear to anything ill need to but its her that combination of anomalies is rare demaura and i used to joke about it baby teeth guess i never grew up doc she picked up the chart read for a few seconds put it down she had a nice laugh the rest of her was so what youd expect from her lifestyle but her teeth couldve belonged to a healthy woman an unpolished fingernail plinked a button of her white coat she was a nice person dr delaware almost always cheerful considering her situation i found that pretty remarkable sounds like you knew her pretty well as well as you can know anyone in this setting she said except for kids we mostly treat a transient population but demaura was pretty regular about her appointments she checked the chart again shes been coming in for three years for the first six months she saw dr chan he retired and i picked her up the patients get regular dentists when the workload permits we try to make it as much like a private practice as possible for demaura that was easy because all she needed were cleaningsoh yes and one replaced amalgam right at the beginning why would she need to be a regular just for cleanings she had some tendency to build up plaque but nothing extreme she played with the chart dr chan had been seeing her twice a year but i put her on every three months to keep tabs on her not just dentally for overall health i felt the only way shed get regular medical care was if i referred her she trusted you i took the time to listen truth is i enjoyed talking to her she could be funny unfortunately she stopped coming in flipping a page fifteen months ago when did she die possibly around then i shouldve known something was up she was always so dependable but the phone number she left was inactive and i had no way to contact her i found it surprising that shed held on to her teeth she had superlong roots lots of room for error said faye martin shed been told that by another dentist years ago and it became a point of pride for her so did her name montouthe its karma doc im the chomper queen and she didnt have too many points of pride healthwise what physical problems did she have you name it said faye martin arthritis bursitis acute bouts of pancreatitis liver issues at least one episode of hep a im aware of the usual stds she wasnt hivpositive at least shed avoided that not that it matters anymore whered you refer her for those issues the marina free clinic i called over there once to find out if shed followed through she only came in to get her prescriptions no followup i said no one she trusted there faye martins longlashed brown eyes locked in to mine her cheeks were pink guess i practiced your profession without a license good thing youre the first person weve found who knows anything about her we havent been able to turn up any relatives or friends thats because she had no friends or so she claimed she said she didnt like people was happiest just walking around by herself she called herself a lonely bad girl disowned by family back when she still lived in canada where in canada alberta i laughed we were told alabama hey an as an a said faye martin why was she disowned they were farmers religious fundamentalists demaura really didnt give out the details she came in to have her teeth cleaned would talk and id listen that happens here more than you think she brushed hair from her face i didnt get much psych training in dental school sure could use some is there anything in the chart that could help us know her better the official records just teeth and gums anything else demaura told me stayed in vegas but ill make you a copy if your forensic odontologist has time he or she can make the official match if not send me what youve got and ill do it appreciate it what stayed in vegas what she did for a living she wanted me to know right at the outset that she was a bad girl made love only for moneythats not the terminology she used but i dont want to imply that was a big part of our conversations for the most part it was just silly chat shed come in kind of goofy start laughing about some joke she heard on the street try to retell it mangle it and wed both crack up for a moment id forget whatwho she wasand it would be like hanging with a friend chicktalk but her last visit fifteen months ago was different first of all she looked better nice makeup not the crazy stuff she wore for work decent clothes and her hair was clean and combed out nothing could erase all those years of hard living but that day i caught a glimpse of what she mightve looked like if things had turned out differently i said the only picture ive seen was a mug shot faye martin frowned one thing i know is facial structure and demauras was well proportioned and symmetrical she had the underpinnings of a goodlooking woman dr delaware that day it shone through i told her how pretty she looked asked if she was going somewhere special she claimed she had a date with her boyfriend that surprised me shed never talked about men except as customers she claimed you had your doubts even with her teeth and fixed up demaura was far from ravishing and the man she described was younger and goodlooking how much younger she didnt specify but she called him a kid gorgeous kid i could be his momma but he likes em mature honestly i thought she was making it up or at the least exaggerating after i finished doing her teeth and my assistant left the room she started talking about the sexual side of their relationship and for the first time i saw a hint of i guess it would have to be arousal as if she could still feel so maybe this guy whoever he wasif he existedmaybe he turned her on though i also wondered if demaura had been the victim of some cruel joke misconstruing one of her business relationships as personal crush on a client i said what she told me next made it the wrong type of client she said he liked to hurt her and that she liked to be hurt hurt how i didnt ask the prurient details didnt interest me just the oppositeto be truthful i was repulsed i did warn her to be careful but she said they were just playing games she used that word yes games then she placed her hands around her neck and stuck out her tongue and wobbled her head as if she was being strangled dark eyes narrowed is that how she died theres evidence of strangulation but all that was left of her were bones my god she said it wasnt her fantasy it happened what else did she say about this boyfriend let me think back massaging the smooth space between shaped eyebrows she said now im sorry that i didnt press for details okay she said she liked rubbing his head he was her goodluck charm it was one of the games they played shed rub his head and hed do what he wantedher words he does what he wants whatever he wants she said she loved his head how smooth it was like a babys ass so i guess he was bald frowning i gave her a new toothbrush and a pick and some colgate total she sprang up let me copy this for you i said this has been helpful youve got nothing to regret she turned smiled at least someone has psych training chapter assistant district attorney john nguyen rubbed a baseball pristine dodger ball decorated with lots of signatures three other orbs in plastic cases shared shelf space with law books and case folders nguyen was senior enough to get a cornerview office on the seventeenth floor of the clara shortridge foltz criminal justice center foltz had been the first woman lawyer on the west coast i wondered what shed think of the soulless twentystory fridge that bore her name the vista was downtown rooftops and chromecold parking lots square footage was minimal milo and moe reed and i crowded nguyens cityissue desk leaving no room for dancing thats it said nguyen massaging a tightly laced seam a possible victim has a possible john but hes just as likely to be an imaginary boyfriend without hair reed said plus theres big laura chenoweth escaping from a homicidal skinhead and selena bass getting into a car with a baldie both stories were obtained from recollective thirdperson accounts making it hearsay twice removed dont you guys follow pop culture bald is the new lush nguyen touched his own thick black brush cut sorry no one will give you paper with that milo said cmon john its more than that travis hucks shown clear signs of evasion not being home when you drop in is evasive plus he was wearing a hat you cant be sure hes a cueball what was visible beneath the hat was clearly skinned what if he skins around the sides and on top theres a shaving brush like the freak in that movie david lynch did years ago you know the one im talking about silence nguyen said eraserhead hell what if you yank off the hat and out pops a onefoot afro youre relying on some dinkyshit physical description thats worth less than fleaspit but i wont stop you go judgefishing i just cant put in a good word with anyone way too anemic his eyes dropped to travis hucks most recent dmv photo here hes got surplus locks but lets say he shaved his dome youd have to prove it happened during a time frame that matches him to the dude seen with selena no even farther backto montouthe which was what two years ago fifteen months said milo nguyen played with the baseball some more im sure your instincts are right about this guy but what youve got is feeble lets stretch and say you dig up enough so mr huck becomes a viable suspect weve still got a problem getting into the house its not his residence belongs to his employer who is not a suspect moe reed said not yet nguyen rolled the baseball between his fingertips is there something you want to tell me as in the full picture milo recounted the swinger parties selena bass had described to her brother her subsequent hiring as kelvin vanders piano teacher the fact that the vander family had left town okay she advanced from bad girl to bach said nguyen so what reed said or bach was a cover to get her over to the house at regular intervals kinky rich people said nguyen boy thats a novelty in hollyweird same question guys who says swinger parties is anything more than good clean adulterous fun youve got absolutely no connection to the s and m stuff two of your hookers allegedly engaged in and frankly your other hooker chenoweth doesnt sound like shed let anyone tie her up just the opposite there was a riding crop in selenas so she liked horses girls do nguyen swiveled in his chair placed the baseball on a plastic stand placed the box over it with loving care i know im being an asshole but youll get worse from the other side so better to proceed with caution meaning get better evidence i said if the vanders gave permission to search would it extend to hucks quarters nguyen leaned back interesting question might depend on the nature of hucks arrangement with the vanders is his room a stipulated component of his salary if so it would be a legally contracted domicile no different from any rented or leased space and only the resident can grant permission if the resident is still in residence nguyen smiled you couldve been a lawyer doc yes if hes vacated and the vanders grant permission youre in and if there was no formal agreement visàvis the job and he just moved in i suppose a case could be made that hes a guest how longs he been there three years said reed nope no way thats a guest one more thing to be aware of even if you get someone to sign a warrant for the room hucks belongings wont fall under its provisions unless hes abandoned them and you cant play fast and loose with that they need to be obvious discards its exactly the kind of privacy issue the courts get picky about though the exterior surfaces of permanent furniture previously owned by the vanders might be its possible you can swab the furniture he scratched his head to be honest i dont have a clue without doing some depth research its not the kind of thing that comes up smiling you could make case law but lose your bad guy milo said if we get permission from the vanders and see something creepy in plain sight nguyen covered his ears what said milo that game might work on a braindead barmurder mope plain sight indeed huck hasnt answered your phone calls so hes clearly opposed to cooperating whos going to believe hed leave evidence around stupid criminals said moe reed without them the jobs as funny as a heart attack milo shot him a sharp look that took on amusement turned back to nguyen detective reed makes a good point john what if huck thinks hes all fortressed up and gets cocky we get in somehow use the element of surprise theres no telling if hes even there milo two days running none of you have seen him coming or going and that lexus is gone youre the detectives doesnt that smell of bunny hop running for president of the pessimist club john i thought of it said nguyen but theyre too giddy a bunch moe reed said he cant have it both ways guy rabbits with intention never to return what he leaves behind is abandoned right nguyen studied the young detective lapds growing them sophisticated huh yeah youd be okay if its indisputably obvious that he moved out permanently and believe me thats going to be challenged theyll claim it was a vacation with expectation of privacy vacation from us said reed that indicates guilt vacation from work boredom whatever he feels like getting away from detective reed the point is the founding fathers wanted people to be able to enjoy yosemite without returning home and finding their house subjected to a police state ransack and for this particular suspect a rabbit can be construed as something other than guilt he was railroaded as a kid what better justification for avoiding the cops reeds lips turned down he ran a finger under his collar listen said nguyen you get permission from the vanders theres some latitude but make sure its in writing at the least youll be able to go in get a feel for the place make contact with other peoplemaid a gardener whatever see if they can incriminate huck milo said so far theres been no sign of any staff other than huck reed said but the place is huge theres got to be someone nguyen stood always a pleasure guys got a meeting as we reached the city parking lot reed got a call liz wilkinson he said clicking off blushing doctor wilkinson she wants to talk about the hand bones crypts a tenminute ride said milo go for it shes back at the marsh studying those aerial photographs the chopper took this morning reed had initiated the aerial scan anything from that said milo reed shook his head hurrying to his crown vic he drove off fast we continued to milo s unmarked mind being the wheelman alex got some calls to make isnt that against regs hell yeah i need something to cheer me up i directed the big ungainly car westward as he called the fortylawyer beverly hills firm that handled all of simon vanders legal interests the first attorney who stonewalled was named sarah lichter but when milo kept pushing her secretary the fact emerged that ms lichter had represented mr vander on a business matter some years ago but mr vanders primary attorney for the majority of business matters was mr alston b weir weirs secretary was amiable but no more helpful referring him to weirs paralegal who put him on hold he switched the phone to speaker yawned stretched studied downtown streets the unmarkeds alignment was way off forcing me to wrestle the wheel my appreciation for milo s job performance kicked up a notch a cheerful syrupy voice said buddy weir how can i help the police milo told him travis thats a bit shocking said weir you know him ive met him what i mean is the fact that anyone simon or nadine would hire being i certainly hope thats not the case in terms of getting into the house i suppose given the circumstances that neither simon nor nadine would have a serious problem with a supervised visit you really think thats necessary we do oh my said weir if youre correct about travis being involved in something criminalthis is really shockingmy assumption is simon and nadine will appreciate your assistance our job is to assist sir thank you detective let me see if i can reach simr vander simone said he was in hong kong did she well thats helpful one thing detective criminal law isnt my specialty but im not sure simon or nadines permission to enter the house will indemnify you against legal roadblocks in the future what kind of legal roadblocks sir defense attorneys tactics said weir if it gets to that what comes to mind sir as i said its not my field of expertise but right off the bat i can see all sorts of tenancy issues if traviss living arrangement was a formal rental or lease either directly or in the form of a perquisite he spieled on repeating john nguyens oration nearly word for word milo stayed silent flapped his hand like a ducks bill when weir finished he said well bear all that in mind sir weir said lets return to the crux reaching simon and nadine in hong kong shes in taiwan with family oh said weir good thats helpful if i reach anyonelets think positive and say whenill have them fax me limited power of attorney that way i can get you in there thank you sir please include the beach house the beach house said weir cant see why not one more question said milo who else works in the main house besides travis huck im really not sure said weir maids housekeepers that kind of thing the times ive been there ive seen gardeners but no regular staff big place like that said milo who cleans it travis manages the estate maybe he arranges thingsone of those cleaning services you call as needed i really dont know lieutenant we dont pay the bills theyre handled through a private bank up in seattle here we are global investment he read off a number oh boy what sir buddy weir said if travis does decide when the house is cleaned hed be in a position to obscure evidence wouldnt he thats why we want to get in asap of course lieutenant on a onetoten scale how serious is this its a homicide mr weir but i cant honestly tell you mr hucks definitely the perpetrator but you suspect him hes a person of interest wonderful said weir just wonderful i need to reach simon chapter i took beverly boulevard west as milo phoned global investment in seattle several underlings and one private banker later he managed to cadge the fact that a palisadesbased service called happy hands cleaned both vander houses on an asneeded basis who determines when its needed said milo how would i know that said the banker click milo glared at the phone stashed it so huck does control the process my guts telling me hes split but like i said going public is always a double edge with huck living under the radar from the time he got out of juvey until three years ago putting on the pressure could get him burrowed deeper i said living underground can be an education what do you mean he may have been innocent of what put him in juvey but the experience and what followed couldve taught him nasty habits strangulation and mutilation for fun and profit how would a guy like that get in with the vanders maybe theyre kindhearted gentle nurturant rich folk it happens think so you dont im sure there are some like that but i have to wonder if the kind of ego it takes to amass all that dough excludes kindness ace detective vladimir lenin power to the people he thrust a clenched fist had to bend his arm to avoid hitting the cars headliner drive to moghul all this failure is giving me an appetite you say the same thing about success least im consistent we stashed the car in the staff lot walked to the restaurant the room was buzzing two long tables filled with whitecollar coworkers and a corner booth occupied by moe reed and liz wilkinson the two of them sat closer together than required for business serving bowls were untouched reed had his jacket on but hed removed his tie spread his collar liz wilkinsons unnetted hair was a wealth of glossy ringlets a tealblue dress worked well with her skin tone he smiled she laughed their elbows bumped they both laughed they saw us simultaneously startled like kids caught playing doctor reed shot to his feet loo doc dr wilkinsons got interesting stuff to tell us about those finger bones bout time we got something huh jabbering fast liz wilkinson stared up at him milo eyed a plate of lamb i converted you to curry detective reed shedr wilkinson likes it liz wilkinson said it just so happens to be one of my favorite cuisines so when moses suggested it i thought great im adding this place to my list join us reed said with more volume than necessary the bespectacled woman emerged from the rear of the restaurant todays sari was blood red the sight of milo made her glow she hurried back to the kitchen she sure looks happy said liz wilkinson hes a good customer said reed the lieutenant moments later a platter of lobster arrived with a flourish liz said whoa someones vip thanks for letting us ride your coattail lieutenant milo s fine doctor so what do you have for us we assembled the phalanges from the box and ended up with three complete sets given the dimensions of the left hands on all three of your buried victims it was fairly easy to match everything up laura chenoweths digits were noticeably larger than those of the other two and number threems montouthesshowed clear signs of arthritis the other finding is the bones were subjected to an acid wash sulfuric acid specifically diluted to a level where it debridedremoved soft tissue but did no serious damage to the bone i suspected some sort of treatment right off the surfaces are much smootherpolished reallythan youd expect from time and water and decomp i did a scraping and found traces of sulfuric acid in the outer layer for all three victims moe reed said shining them up fits with a personal trophy so does placing them in a fancy box i said the question is why go to all that trouble then abandon the cache in a way that guaranteed discovery that makes me wonder if they started as souvenirs but changed to something else a taunt look what i did said milo its consistent with the games hernandez found in the storage unit playing with us liz wilkinson said what kind of games reed said just the boardsmonopoly life money and basic existence she said thats pretty primal reed said money existence ending someone elses existence he shifted closer to her she didnt mind i said selenas murder also supports an exhibitionist angle up until her the killer chose victims he considered throwaways buried them where they couldve remained indefinitely selenas murder was called in her body left out in the open with id in her purse he wanted us to know who she was and what hed done to her reed said and with her there he was hoping wed search the marsh find the others if you didnt thered be other prompts milo said he stops paying for storage knows the unit will come up just around the time hes gonna do selena whole damn things a production liz wilkinson grimaced treating the fingers with acid means he kept the bodies maybe to play with them reed said you okay fine i just usually dont see this side of it as she moved to smooth hair from her face her fingers brushed his cuff people ask me all the time if i get grossed out working with remains when i tell them i love it they look at me funny but down at the tissue level you can deny once i start thinking about a human being connected to whats on the table she pushed her plate away guess id better be getting back if you want moses we can talk about that other stuff later ill walk you out when reed returned to the restaurant milo said what other stuff pardon what youll be talking to the good doctor about reed went scarlet oh that shes putting together a forensics reading list i figured its something i should know the power of educationyou eating any of that lamb all yours loo guess i should also be booking why thought id go by the vander house maybe i can catch huck coming or going milo shook his head ill go through his eminence get some patrol officers into civvies to run shifts youre meant for bigger and better like what go nationwide on unsolveds featuring missing limbs body parts treated with chemicals start with hands but dont limit yourself reed said legs arms whatever heads shoulders knees and toes i dont care as long as something got cut off youre figuring he couldve switched techniques as dr delaware likes to remind me patterns are for fabric he turned to me if the bodies were kept around to play with the vanders property probably isnt the crime scene estate manager or not setting up dr frankensteins lab in that place would be too risky reed said not if the vanders are also involved in weird stuff even so moses theyve got a kid on the premises kinky parties after juniors gone to bed is one thingand even there im doubtful because weve got no evidence saying these people are bizarre but hacking up corpses in the manse with junior around is over the top so huck has another place maybe thats why we havent seen him hes hiding out in his killcrib check with the assessor see if he pays property tax on anything rentals are a problem no way well be able to trace unless we go public on him and im not ready for that i said when we were at pacific storage you made a crack about people living there and the attendant denied it but im sure it happens milo thought about that worth checking out including back at pacific itself we never showed the clerk hucks picture your plate getting too full moe not even close said reed give me more nothing more sure you dont want any lunch no thanks let me get going after finishing reeds and wilkinsons food milo topped off his meal with the lobster and two bowls of rice pudding he returned to his office i went home and repeated searches on travis huck edward eddieeddyed huckstadter came up empty keywording simon vander pulled up the eightfigure grocery chain sale and a couple of mentions of vander and his wife on charity committees the art museum the zoo huntington library your basic genteel philanthropy if simon and nadine vander had a dark side theyd hid that fact from cyberspace at four thirty i logged off talked to robin about dinner pasta sounded good to both of us she kept working and i made a run up to the market at the top of the glen called my service one message from alma reynolds the operator said she said if you didnt remember her name shes sil duboffs lover i remember her interesting way to label yourself dont you think dr delaware someones lover then again you deal with all types alma reynoldss phone rang eight times i was just about to hang up when she answered lieutenant sturgis didnt call back i figured id get the same from you she said im running out to the mortuary theyre releasing sil in a few days he always talked about cremation as long as it could be done in an ecorespectful manner the ideal of course would be if all of us were just placed in the compost heap whats up anything new on the case not yet sorry well i thought of something been ruminating about what couldve gotten sil over to the marsh that night not that he needed prodding he was always going there to clean up trash make sure no one had trespassed he had a thing for that place truth is he was somewhat obsessed i know why his parents were beatniks who moved from ann arbor to a rural part of wisconsin the family lived in a cabin near a guesswhat freshwater and reeds a huge marsh fed by one of the great lakes sil said it was perfectidyllic until a paper mill opened up nearby and polluted the hell out of it all the fish died the air smelled horrible and eventually sils family had to move to milwaukee both his parents died of cancer and he was convinced it was the toxic air and water even though his father was a threepackaday smoker who got lung cancer and breast cancer ran in his mothers family but try telling sil that try telling him anything i said i can see why the bird marsh would be important to him obsessed said alma reynolds sometimes it got in the way of what us wed be relaxing and hed jump up suddenly say he needed to drive over make sure everything was okay it annoyed me but i rarely said anything because i could see the psychology behind the idealism but the night he wasthat night i really didnt want to go and he defied me so it had to be something major he told you the caller promised to solve the murders and i believed him when those bodies showed up sil took it personally as if hed allowed something to happen to his baby he was also worried the murders would be used to say the marsh was no longer pristine and that would open the door to development i know it sounds paranoid but sil didnt dance to anyone elses beat just the opposite the world waltzed he twostepped i said with that level of anxiety hed follow any lead exactly im glad i reached you and not sturgis did sil give any indication he knew whod called no she said i thought about that trying to remember if he indicated one way or the other and he didnt youre thinking someone he respected mightve gotten him over someone who supported his work do you have a list of save the marsh members never saw one dont know that one exists whos in charge of the office now dont know dont want to know she said i wash my hands of all of it no one answered at save the marsh the groups board of directors listed the progressive billionaires whod tried to build on the land in addition to silford duboff a woman named chaparral stevens and two men tomas friedkin md and lionel mergsamer phd chaparral stevens was a sierra madrebased jewelry designer dr friedkin was a ninetyyearold ophthalmologist emeritus at the us med school professor mergsamer was a stanford astronomer not a likely bunch criminalwise but i printed their names i looked for fundraisers held for the marsh found three westside cocktail parties no listed guests backing away from the trees i thought about the forest why had silford duboff been lured to his death dispatching him didnt fit with the thrillseeking aspect of a sexual psychopath the only motive that made sense was hed known too muchknowledge that came about innocently or otherwise more bones beneath the muck aerial photos had revealed nothing but the earth had a way of swallowing and digesting death or alma reynolds was right and duboffs desire to play saviorto undo his childhood traumahad led him to walk into a trap that felt analytically pat but i turned it over and came up with nothing further a soft rap on my office door snapped the tape loop you look engrossed said robin no im finished if youre not i can cook i got up and we walked to the kitchen she said cooperation just like on sesame street want to be bert or ernie maybe oscar that kind of day huh blanche waddled in and smiled i said she can set the table chapter head arms and legs in missouri said moe reed head hands and feet in new jersey three hands and feet only in he scanned his notes washington state west virginia and ohio milo said nothing with just hands nope and no acid wash plus in three cases they have a good idea who it is but dont have enough evidence to bring charges we were in a westside interview room at the end of another draggy day milo s followup call to buddy weir had evoked a still working on it message from the attorneys paralegal plainclothes surveillance of the house on calle maritimo had revealed no movement other than the entry of a gardeners crew none of the groundsmen had any idea if huck was inside the house and when milo convinced one of them to ring the front doorbell no one answered huck continued to refuse telephonic invitations to talk with the police reed said the one in jersey theyre sure is a mob deal victim was idd by a surgical scar on the back some goombah with disk problems anything else reed shook his head i said any of the amputations spare only one hand nope because chopping was used to hinder the investigation our case has nothing to do with that our hands are symbolic of what said milo im good with questions not answers i said but maybe something to do with selenas piano playing people play piano with both hands alex the right hand plays the melody both their expressions said thanks but no thanks an alternative i said is someones trying to make the killings appear bizarre psychosexual fakeout said milo to hide what i keep coming back to selena she really stands out from the others what if this is all about her and the other women were prep milo said over a year of prep what made selena so important something she knew turned her into a threat something serious enough to take her computer same reason duboff got killed longterm planning is usually about money reed said and the vanders have big moneyit keeps coming back to them and huck who works for them milo said if youre right about the other women digging up background on them isnt a good use of our time i said the killer had to connect with them somehow so it could still bear fruit reed said ive been up and down the airport stroll and no one remembers huck its a transitory population and people have short memories for all sorts of reasons milo got up paced pulled out a panatela moe reed relaxed when the cigar dropped back into a pocket a guy goes for hookers who says he limits himself to one neighborhood another stroll said reed huck lives in the palisades i said for pure fun he could stay on the westside but when hes trawling for victims he travels to where hes less likely to be recognized maybe somewhere closer to his killcrib said reed which could be relatively close to the vander house not that ive found anything in the assessors files or anywhere else milo said the airport the marshthat storage facilitytheyre all pretty close together so the crib could be in that vicinity reed said to find a rental we have to go public hope someone tips it may come to that moses but not yet lets stick with the secondstroll angle if we can find other working girls huck frequented learn hes into rough sex maybe even put his hands around someones neck it sets up cause for a warrant i could do lincoln boulevard farther north good idea that doesnt pan out we move on to the strip in fact we dont wait tonight you do lincoln then sunset from doheny to fairfax ill take sunset east to rampart then downtown ill refax hucks license to vice maybe someones memoryll be jogged what about surveillance of the house we continue to leave that to patrol huck doesnt show his face soon i guess ill have to talk to the brass about a press conference in addition to the deepburrow risk weve really got nothing on the guy and hes already been the victim of official injustice cant you just hear the defense attorneys opening statement he turned to me in terms of duboff getting gutted by another marsh hugger maybe but making our way through the ecocrowd is low priority i said ill see what i can find reed said might as well join the department doc milo said hes my friend watch your mouth save the marsh a citizens committee was headquartered in a beige frame bungalow in playa del rey where that district turns into a cute little village of cafés and shops two miles from the marsh closer yet to pacific storage the building was shuttered no cars sat in the threespace lot no ad hoc memorial to duboffno evidence at all hed been murdered i walked across the street to an eatery called chez dauphin white wood blue shutters screen porch a handful of snackers i ordered a roll and coffee finished half before asking the gallic proprietress if she knew who to contact at the bungalow she said non msieur i have never seen anyone there i began phoning the people on the save the marsh board the voicemail message at chaparral stevenss jewelry business was soundtracked by bird squawks trickling water and wind chimes stevenss voice was lowpitched and sultry her speech slightly halting the tantric ecstasy she claimed due to my sixmonth spiritual retreat at the monteverde cloud forest reserve in breathtaking cothta reeca came across like cannabis languor the secretary at the us ophthalmology center told me dr tomas friedkin hadnt been heard from in years at least ive never seen him in facti hope im wrongi think he passed away oh too bad i said are you a colleague a student oh she said well hold on and let me check several beats later yes im sorry he passed last year one of his other studentsdr eisenbergsays the funeral took place on a boat ashscattering you know dr f loved nature we all should be like that right go back where we came from and stop making a big mess dr f was involved with the bird marsh how nice i love birds professor lionel mergsamer was on fullyear sabbatical at the royal observatory in greenwich england everyone taking downtime when was the last time id bothered i tried the studio owned by the progressive billionaires got exactly what i expected long stretches on hold an eventual hangup an absentee board of directors implied ceremonial titles meaning running the organization was left to anyone willing to shoulder the responsibility meaning silford duboff who else would know about the group the volunteer kid whod taken the killers call chance brandt no listing for the brentwood residence but steven a brandts law office was in the book recalling his hostility i figured him for a stonewall or a tantrum and called the windward school fudging my police status and asking firmly to speak to headmaster rumley i cajoled a secretary into forking over master brandts cell number yeah i told him who i was he said yeah chance who did you see at the office besides mr duboff yeah female giggles and hiphop bass thrum i repeated the question that place his words slurred his girlfriend remained appreciative what about it chance yeah male laughter bottomed the girls squeals whod you see chance yea okay well talk at the police station nobody okay no one except duboff its his thing marsh man rising volume on the background hilarity like he fucks it all that mud using the present tense duboffs murder hadnt hit the news i thought of telling him about it hung up instead not to protect the kids delicate sensibilities afraid hed have none chapter moe reed burst into café moghul wrestlers body canted forward shoulders lowered aggressive surge but smiling as if charging toward victory first time id ever seen him happy milo swallowed his tandoori chicken and wiped his mouth at least someones having a good day hed spent the night in a futile search for street girls who knew travis huck the morning had been officebound filled with endless phone discussions with an escalating series of higherups of whether or not to go public with travis hucks identity the debate had reached the chiefs office and the answer had just come down from the mount given hucks history of judicial abuse wait for more evidence unless a new victim showed up nothing like bodycount politics id just finished telling him about chance brandts bad attitude he said generation n for numb reed sat down and waved his notepad two hookers milo put his fork down and the question is what weekly perk comes with a congressional office reed smiled found em on the strip loo forty bucks is what they charged huck theyre both sure it was him down to the crooked mouth and guess what he wasnt wearing a hat and he is totally skinned he flipped the pad open charmaine lduvalier real names corinne dugworth and tammy lynn adams that appears to be her righteous id they both work sunset mostly between la cienega and fairfax huck picked charmaine up right at fairfax a month or so ago tammy lynn hooked up with him two blocks west she thinks it could be as recent as six weeks ago both times huck was cruising at three four am in a lexus suv color and style match vanders guy gets to use the bosss wheels for recreation any unusual sexual habits they both recall him as superquiet adams admitted he spooked her admitted these girls like to pretend theyre streethard nothing scares them i pushed her a little and she said yeah he kind of spooked her in what way being so quiet like he wasnt even pretending to make it friendly the way a lot of the johns do like hed been paying for it for a long time and it was just another quickie business deal as opposed to her said milo all the romance in her heart what im seeing said reed is these girls need to feel in charge so they come on tough makes a lot of johns nervous not huck sounds like he was totally at ease heres the dough deliver the goods i said what did he pay for oral sex anything aggressive said milo grabbing their hair talking in a hostile manner nope said reed i think he spooked both of them but only adams admitted it shes been on the streets for five years says she has a good sense for which guys are off and huck impressed her as one of them but she took him on anyway first impression he looked well groomed was driving nice wheels it was only after she got in that he started to get to her by being quiet and businesslike zero talk said reed not making any sort of conversation you get callback numbers for these girls prepaid cells for what theyre worth in terms of addresses neither of them have drivers licenses and both claim to be looking for permanent residence ah the glamorous life said milo yeah its bs but its all i could get loo both of em did agree to ask around about huck it sounds naive thinking theyll cooperate but maybe my asking about him kicked up the fear level he tries to hook up with either of them again im betting theyll let me know he spotted the woman in the sari asked for iced tea she said no food no thanks just tea she walked off shaking her head milo said excellent work detective reed too bad i didnt know an hour ago he summarized the debate about going to the press not that im sure it would make a difference brass is really edgy about the whole thing falling apart due to lack of evidence huck suing the city reed said they really think hed have the balls to do that best defense is a good offense kiddo we shine the spotlight on him without enough juice hes in the drivers seat cant you just see him up on the stand some lawyer guiding him through everything he went through in juvey what if hes named as a person of interest not a suspect milo said that might buy us time but downtown isnt ready for it his phone jangled brahms sturgis who what about oh yeah yeah sure give me the number he got to his feet lets go whats up loo renewed faith in the flower of our youth the woman in the sari watched us leave reeds tea in hand as we exited she drank it the girl was barely five feet tall seventeen hardbodied and glossytan with luxuriant red hair light freckles and cornflower eyes younger version of her mother the two of them sat holding hands a pair of pixies perched on a massive royalblue damask couch the crimson silk sitting room gleamed like blood under a swarovski chandelier the fixtures long gold chain was wrapped in aqua satin suspended from a twentyfoot coffered gilded ceiling mullioned windows framed velvet acreage massive stone fireplaces graced both ends of the room renoir over one matisse over the other both paintings looked real wed

manse was as chilly as a supermarket deli case her daughters matching size juicy was moss green oster as in malls and shopping centers milo said were proud too maam his smile caused sarabeth to press closer to her mother hayley oster said youre sure i cant get you something to drink it was extremely gracious of you to come down here and spare us a trip to the police station no thanks maam we appreciate your calling it was the least i could do lieutenant after sarabeth became embroiled in that todo with chance brandt at school we made it clear that things had to change right honey smiling at her daughter but an elbow delivered a prod sarabeth looked down and nodded hayley oster said the way my husband and i see it lieutenant privilege is a blessing that should not be abused neither of us come from wealthy families and scarcely a day goes by that we dont thank our lucky stars for how far weve come harvey and i believe blessings should be repaid in kind we do not tolerate poor character which is why weve always had reservations about sarabeth associating with chance the girl appeared ready to argue thought better of it i know you think im being harsh baby but one day youll see im right chance is unsubstantial all looks nothing beneath the veneer worse he lacks moral fiber in a sense that makes me even prouder of sarabeth though she found herself in the company of amorality she chose to think independently the girls eyes rolled milo said why dont you tell us about it sarabeth its just what i said to mom tell them said hayley oster they need to hear it directly from you sarabeth inhaled and shook out her hair okay okay someone called last night over at seans house sean who said reed capelli hayley said another shallow young man that school seems to breed

chance bounced a tennis ball his mother sighed switched her racket to her left hand and slapped him hard across the face with her right perspiration sprayed finger marks rouged the boys cheek he had six inches and fifty pounds on her seemed to expand as his hands became fists she said you keep screwing around and ill do it again milo said theres no need for that maam lets keep everything friendly do you have children lieutenant no maam then you dont know anything im sure i dont even so chance said a guy okay it was that malibu thing the lame bullshit thing where everyone wore hawaiian shirts and pretended to be a surfer susan brandt said that one to us hes referring to a coastal alliance benefit we attended last yearlast fall despite what he says we generally dont make him go to any of our charitable events but that one it was an outdoor barbecue casual dress other people brought their kids it was supposed to be a family affair rock music and hot dogs to her son you eat you dance

tool trying to look like a surfer bigtime bondo job on the face bondo said his mother its putty used to patch cars said moe reed chance patted his cheek the finger marks had begun to welt milo said the guy had plastic surgery the boy snickered ya think chance warned his mother the boys eyes heated what youre gonna hit me again in front of the cops i could get you busted for child abuse right milo said easy now you never hit me before why you want to go do that because susan brandt wrung her hands im sorry i just didnt know what to right its for my own good she touched his arm he shrugged her away ferociously reed ushered her a few feet away eyetoeye with chance milo said blond tucked what else nothing how old like dad middle age guy was a total toolfuckedup hair fucked up how shaggy moussed up retrobullshit like billy idol all that shit in his face like whoa its true value hardware tell us about this guy and duboff he showed up how many times once when dunno was it close to when

bored fuckless look out the window theres two of them doing what talking i didnt hear what they were saying didnt give a fuck thats why i didnt say the whole thing to you when you called when this guy

small a regular envelope and duboff looked happy he shook dudes hand then what happened dude drives off in what mercedes color black gray said the boy who the fuck remembers staring defiantly and calling to his mother cmon susie give it your best shot susan brandt wept milo said were going to show you some pictures chance as we drove away from the country club reed said one day theres going to be a domestic violence call to their house milo said good bet unfortunately what the kid had to say boils down to nada blond guy who drives a mercedes and who the kid swears aint huck i said unless the guy was paying duboff off for something like what said reed swimming privileges in the marsh milo laughed congrats detective reed on what bitter sarcasm you have now achieved optimal workplace adjustment my bet is the guy was making a donation to the herons and gulls chance saw him at an ocean benefit were talking ecosensitivity water guy said reed meanwhile we drown chapter a flurry of message slips crowded milo s desktop three halfhearted media followups on the marsh murders two deputy chiefs requesting confirmation that milo had gotten the message about no bolo on travis huck he played target practice with his wastebasket kept reading all right heres a keeper mr alston buddy weir and another one selenas brother marc up in oakland brother probably wants followup grab yourself a phone in the main room and find out after reed left milo called weir switched to speaker so we can share the misery the usual paralegal answered but weir came on quickly lieutenant thanks for getting back to me weirs smooth voice sounded higher tighter whats up sir im getting concerned simon hasnt responded to my calls or my emails and when i phoned the peninsula in hong kong they informed me he checked out last week i immediately got in touch with ron balter at global but he had no idea where simon was i got him to go through simons recent purchases and we found that simon indeed flew back to the states but he hasnt used his credit cards since back to la no san francisco is that unusual for mr vander not really said weir simon and nadine love san francisco go for art fairs that kind of thing they generally stay at the ritz but theres no record of either of them checking in does mr vander generally keep such a low profile hes a lowkey person no question about that but hes generally good about responding to calls and he always uses credit cards carries very little cash thats not all lieutenant i tried to reach nadine in taiwan was told by her family that she and kelvin left around the same time simon flew out of hong kong did her family say why no said weir but theres something of a language gap so it could be a family vacationwanting to be together yes of course but the credit cards lieutenant both simon and nadine charge everything i phoned simone to see if she knew anything about this she didnt and she grew extremely upset about travis huck she thinks hucks harmed her family she doesnt know what to think lieutenant would huck know their whereabouts in san francisco i really cant say after i spoke with simone i felt i should do something so i went over to the house and looked around it does appear as if hucks jumped ship his room is empty everythings been cleared out i suppose that could be construed as guilt over something i just dont know milo mouthed a silent shit rubbed his face how thoroughly did you search i opened some drawers looked around hes gone you went by yourself no with simone i felt that as a close family member given exigent circumstances shed have a right to enter the premises in fact i dont know why i didnt think of that before when you asked me for entry whats your feeling about huck clearing out hard to say sir i suppose its possible said weir that he got spooked after being questioned by you people but still if theres nothing to worry about why flee or maybe he simply up and quit the typical california thing flaky seems to come with the weather lieutenant milo said when can we do our own walkthrough say when and ill have someone from the office meet you there how about in an hour an hour i didnt realize there are meetings all day let me see heremore meetings until noon tomorrow how about eleven am tomorrow ill send sandra my best paralegal have you checked the beach house simone and i had a brief look and it seemed to us no one had been there for a while ill make sure sandra has keys to the beach house as well thank you sir im sure the familys fine said weir theres absolutely no reason for them not to be milo phoned a source at homeland security and verified simon nadine and kelvin vanders flight schedules all three had traveled firstclass on singapore airlines with simon entering sfo a day before his wife and son the next call was to the seattle money managers where he cajoled a cagey ronald w balter certified financial planner and confirmed that nothing beyond airfare had been billed to the vanders credit cards do they have a place in northern california a home said balter no what about a rental property no any idea where they could be sir of course not of course balter said i manage their money i dont get involved in their personal life mr weir seems concerned im sure he is whys that hes more involved with their personal life moe reed returned to the office and gave a thumbsup marc green didnt want followup he recalled something else selena told him sudden memory jog said milo my feeling is he didnt want to bring it up in front of his mother apparently selena had started dating someone a few months before she died marc cant remember exactly when but he thinks it was three four months ago when she told him an older guy how old she didnt say marc says she was embarrassed about it so could be there was a serious age gap the juicy part is she kept up that confession habit of hers told marc the guy liked it rough and so did she the two of them fit together like a socket and a wrench her words sounds like something a guy would tell her i agree loo so now we have a dominance thing consistent with sheralyn and demaura maybe on that level selena wasnt that different from the others what do you think doc i said it does put things in a new light milo said an older guy into rough she say anything else about him reed said no no its likely some swinger she met at one of those parties right milo said older simon vander would sure qualify and so would huck hes thirtyseven which is eleven years older than selena the net does seem to be tightening and things could be even nastier than we thought he summarized the news of the vanders return and disappearance reed said simons sounding more like a victim than a bad guy unless he did bad things and needs to keep a low profile to me it still smells like hucks our prime guy we need to find him we really do milo first time hed addressed the boss by name optimal workplace adjustment chapter at seven pm the following day an lapd press release offered travis hucks name to the media the timing was finetuned too late for the papers or the six oclock news early enough for a feed to the eleven oclock broadcast or in dc henry weinbergs words a trickle not a flood were vulnerable lieutenant departmental spinners described huck as a person of interest and included a prior felony conviction none of the four women found in the marsh was mentioned by name the vanders never came up in the interim milo and reed and i did walkthroughs of both vander residences we hit the beach house first found no evidence the family had ever lived there soggy leather furniture sat on purple walltowall the smell was salt rust an oldpaint sourness that shouted disuse oars and a mans wetsuit in the closet said the place hadnt progressed much past bachelor pad heavy twin doors at the mansion on calle maritimo opened to a loose chain of high broad vanilla rooms tastefully if blandly furnished floored with golden limestone family photos tilted on a couple of mantels abstract art hung in the spaces where windows didnt dominate a grand piano took up a corner of a cavernous back room a spinet piano sat in kelvins skyblue bedroom travis hucks quarters consisted of a smallish room past a vast caterers kitchen and a lav twin bed ikea dresser aluminum reading lamp monastic but cheered by an ocean view placement in the service wing said the space had been designed as a maids room no signs of struggle or body fluids there or anywhere else but milo called for a crime scene team the legal assistant buddy weir sent to keep watch looked alarmed but she checked with the attorney and he told her to cooperate given a huge backlog the techs were expected within days and milo s call to the crime scene office didnt change that he tried the chief couldnt get through smiled grimly moe reed said keeping it in low gear heaven forbid kiddo reed smiled im learning i left the detectives to their frustration and drove home the discovery of selenas lover had scrambled my theories about the three other women being a rehearsal for her the case was boiling down to another hideous pattern of sexual sadism a killer building up his confidence selena the unlucky upgrade i phoned marc green to see if there was anything more to tease out hed been hovering on the brink of rage my voice pushed him over i waited until he stopped shouting i know its tough but i still need to ask is there anything more you more all that shit i just told them isnt enough slam i drove to the crenshaw district and paid a second visit to beatrix chenoweth big lauras mother ready to serve as an anger receptacle again if anyone was trained for that i was she saw me in graciously served coffee and chocolate wafers waited me out as i approached the topic with as much tact as i could muster she said let me understand this you want to know if lurlene liked being hurt weve found evidence of that in other victims so the answer is yes doctor i didnt mention it the first time because because i was so stunned when you all dropped in ive been thinking about calling but talking about that kind of thing is hard i wont pretend lurlene and i were close but she was my child imagining what happened to her hurts me terribly im sorry any progress not so far but youve got other victims who oh lord lurlenes time on the streets part of me has been waiting for this thin square shoulders rose and fell her hands shook did she like being hurt when she was a child just the opposite lurlene was the one hitting other people and getting in trouble over it i kept telling her being big meant she needed to be doubly responsible frown it wasnt until later when i realized what a problem her weight was that i knew id said exactly the wrong thing did she like being hurt apparently yes im talking about later when she was out of the house working she grabbed for a hankie stanched a sudden burst of tears as if thats a job clearing her throat she put steel in her voice a couple of times when she came byfor moneyi noticed bruises here here fingering both sides of her own neck at first i wasnt sure they were bruises lurlene was dark took after her father and the first time she was trying to cover it wearing a scarf which is exactly why i noticed lurlene never wore scarves i spotted something purple beneath the fabric put my finger there and she slapped it away wincing hard not just a love pat but i can be as pigheaded as she can and i persisted and she got terribly angry and ripped it offthe scarfand said happy i said im not happy if someone hurt you lurlene she said no one hurt me in any way i dont want to be hurt then she smirked i was appalled and that amused her she rolled up her sleeves and i said here it comes shell show off her needle marks what else does this girl have planned to disappoint me but instead she displayed more bruises on her wrists i was repelled and turned away and that fueled her up she told me people were willing to pay for extras and she had the confidence to handle anything so of course i got preachy told her dangerous ways led towhy bore you she laughed at me and left smiling thats the whole of it sir i said youve been through a lot my other girls are doing well may i pour you more coffee laura too now its a hat trick said milo id pulled up to the station just as he stepped out the front door and began walking all this exercise i said im starting to worry about you afternoon constitutional at a nonaerobic pace he said walls tend to close in when im feeling useless you probably jogged five miles this morning we passed the same houses and apartments this time the sky stayed gray and the air was soupy and lazy he said airport cops found the vanders lexus in the lax longterm lot but we cant find evidence huck flew anywhere oldest trick in the book young moses and i have been canvassing nearby hotels and motels anyway same for fancy places from sf to santa barbara looking for the vanders we also tried private charters zippo on all counts this is smelling like a wild man on a rampage and hes long gone four sadistic sexual murders playing with the bones of three victims i said then duboff then the vanders hard to see a theme there does there need to be he said that asshole in kansas killed women men kids whoever he found in the house same for ramirez zodiac blah blah blah in those cases the males were collateral damage the same could be true here how about this for a theoretical huck works for the vanders for three years develops a letch for nadine before he can have his way with her he needs to get rid of hubby and kid he manages to get them back from asia he lied about something that got them back these guys its all about control right can you think of a better power trip than moving rich folk around like chess pieces we come nosing around about selena he figures its only a matter of time so he splits i thought about that a family emergency mightve worked as ruse simones been hurt or shes sick simon and nadine trusted huck no reason to verify but how does duboff fit in when we nab huck well find out lets face it alex when you cut through all the bullshit this aint a whodunit we had the prime suspect in our sights right off the bathe had good reason to sweat ten steps later god only knows what huck was doing all those undertheradar years before the vanders took him in so of course he repays them in a metaphysically consistent manner no good deed i said im amending it he said no good deed goes untiedup and bloodied and degraded and dumped like garbage too long for a bumper sticker chapter limited tv exposure brought in thirtyfour sightings of edward t huckstadter aka travis huck milo and moe reed spent two days chasing air a man whod worked at the youth authority when huck was in custody informed reed that huck had given him the willies always crybabying about something but those eyes of his mean said reed crafty you know like when theyre plotting something i woulda never let him out he do anything bad while he was in not that i remember but so what i was right those types get all coiled up and wait like snakes hucks name didnt show up on the passenger logs of trains and buses leaving la but a metro ticket paid for in cash wouldve provided easy escape after some lawyerly hedging buddy weir consented to have the vanders lexus examined at the lapd motor lab but please lieutenant no damage i dont want simon and nadine returning home to that kind of thing no one was paying attention to silford duboffs murder but i couldnt let go of it i called alma reynolds listened to the phone ring no voice mail and shed bragged about no cell for her or sil maybe no computer or tv either i wondered if shed heard about the search for travis huck shed retired from teaching college hadnt mentioned another job i called milo to see if the file contained a work number he was over at the airport rescanning departure records and i spoke to moe reed he said let me check here it is doctors office west la what are you figuring she can tell you probably nothing you do this a lot huh helping out when he asks he ask you to check reynolds sometimes i improvise yeah said reed he told me that given alma reynoldss lifestyle my bet was on some sort of holistic practice for her employer but her boss turned out to be a conventional ophthalmologist in a conventional building on sepulveda near olympic the waiting room was full smallprint brochures for lasik were the preferred reading material reynoldss job title was office coordinator the receptionist at the front seemed happy for a break in routine about my age with short dark hair and an easy smile sorry shes gone to lunch two fortyfive i said kind of late we were swamped all morning i guess she didnt have time till now any idea where she eats this about her boyfriend it is she talk about him just that she misses him wants to see whoever did such a terrible thing payyou dont wear contacts do you nope thought so she said your eyes are that natural grayblue with colored lenses they tend to overdo the blue alma likes mexican theres a strip mall three blocks west the mall provided easy parking and six ethnic restaurants alma reynolds was the sole patron of cocina de cabo sitting in a blue moldedresin booth enjoying blue corn fish tacos and a can of coke zero despite the heat she had on the same mannish wool slacks below a white vneck that made her look ten pounds lighter than the work shirt shed worn at the station long gray hair was tied back in a ponytail and i thought i spotted makeup around wrinkle lines bright blue eyes made me wonder about cosmetic lenses i waved she slapped a hand on her chest stalking me only in the service of public safety may i sit down can i stop you if its not a good just kidding sentarse i think thats the right word when in cabo do as the caboans do her big jaw jutted and the blue eyes lowered to her taco sil was a vegan i eat fish from time to time i was wondering if youve come up with any other ideas her mouth narrowed citizen participation the answer is no one thing were still trying to figure out is how sil fits the other murders maybe he doesnt i waited thats all she said maybe he doesnt one of those lunatic copycats unless the scumbag who lured him over was trying to hide something about the first murders lured him with a promise to help him solve the other murders the hand on her chest shifted and i spotted a glint of gold she moved her fingers back into position yes do you think it couldve been someone who knew sil well enough to push his buttons such as a friend even an acquaintance who understood his attachment to the marsh his friend was me she said same for acquaintance limited social circle by choice people can be so tiresome what about someone who knew him indirectlythrough his work thats a possibility but he never mentioned a name we cant seem to find a membership roster for save the marsh thats because its not a real group in the beginningafter sil rescued the marsh from the bs boys billionaire scuma board was established but that was just rich people trying to feel virtuous no meetings were ever held for all practical purposes stm was sil who paid the bills said ninefigure scumbags i told sil it was risky once he got too dependent on them theyd have complete control like dope pushers but he said he wanted to take them for every dollar theyd give worry about consequences later her lower lip shook and her hand wavered for a second before returning to her chest just long enough to reveal a huge pearl on a chain she picked up a taco nibbled put it down id like to be alone if you dont mind bear with me please what was sils salary it was a stipend she said so the bs boys could avoid payroll taxes twentyfive thousand sil said anyone could live on that if they simplified her hand fanned out over the pearl pretty i said her neck turned red sil gave it to me for my birthday i hated it told him id never wear it too ostentatious now i wear it i nodded she said dont pretend you understand because you dont people like sil and myself are more than intelligent enough to play by the rules and live fat and sassy like every other urban droid ive got masters degrees in two subjects and sil had a ba in physics she leaned forward as if offering a secret we chose to embrace the core but even sil could be romantic for our last anniversary he wanted me to have something nice even idealists need some beauty in their lives i agree i told him i didnt want it demanded he return it he refused we sparred he outlasted me now im glad he did her eyes traveled to the restaurants wall of windows that your car the green whatever it is seville a cadillac she said seville nothing spanish about it what possesses corporate liars sales youre driving an egregious gas guzzler whats your excuse weve been together over twenty years and i dont have the heart to trade her in for someone younger and prettier the hand dropped and her chest arched flaunting the necklace the pearl was outsized creamy unblemished too heavy for the chain which looked flimsy maybe plated i said so the billionaires paid all the bills and sil ran the show did anyone else donate sure people would send checks in from time to time but sil called it petty cash without the bs brothers hed have been out of luck may i finish my lunch in peace i really dont want to think about this anymore i thanked her and headed for the door she said youre not conservationminded but at least youre loyal the eye doctors receptionist said you couldnt find her i found her thanks for directing me she seems pretty down wouldnt you be id probably be worse maybe that humongous pearl will cheer her up i doubt it she said but it is something she bought it for herself yesterday we were all surprised not alma s style not hardly grief changes people i said guess so what else can i do for you nothing i turned heel then whyd you just wanted to thank you for cooperating before she could process the lie i was gone chapter i drove a block west of the strip mall where alma reynolds lunched circled a few times before scoring a parking spot with an unobtrusive view of cocina de cabo reynolds left fifteen minutes later walked back to work on foot taking long slow steps looking grim i trailed her as slowly as i could stopped half a block from the medical building she bypassed the front entrance walked down the ramp to the sublot i didnt have to wait long before a dented old yellow vw bug puttputted up the ramp reynolds slanted forward as if urging the little car faster dark smoke belched from the exhaust tsk tsk she headed straight for a peagreen apartment building on fourteenth street just north of pico the numbers matched the home address reed had given me the place was ill maintained half hidden by shaggy palms the stucco molting the less glamorous side of santa monica even here membership had its privileges resident permit parking only i hung back alma reynolds struggled a bit to wedge the bug into a tiny space bumped cars on both ends without apparent remorse slamming the door hard enough to vibrate the vw she entered her building i stationed myself in front of a hydrant listened to music thirtyfive minutes later i decided reynolds was in for the day and drove home on the way i tried milo again left a message just as i reached westwood village my cell beeped hi doc its louise from your service a dr rothman just called nathalie rothman she didnt give a first name said call as soon as you had a chance something about a mr travis i hadnt spoken with nathalie rothman in years she said im tied up with patients alex but if you want we can talk later you know travis huck know thats a bitsorry alex hold on after several moments of dead air one of the residents just had a baby and were hellishly shortstaffed and the moment im free i need to leave i can spare you the time it takes me to wolf down dinnersay six you dont want to give me a hint too complicated does six work ill call you at the stroke no lets do it in person jarrod my oldest has a basketball game at seven i promised him id absolutely attend this one are you still in the glen i am this is a lot of intrigue nathalie right up your alley no ill meet you anywhere near jarrods school wheres the school brentwood she said windward academy how about a thai place i like bundy off olympic pad palace know it ill find it quality lowfat grub she said i get takeout there way too often another strip mall maybe one day real estate would be too expensive to make them viable pad palace made the most of what it was a storefront with a limited design budget screens and pine tables aimed for elegant simplicity walls were painted in variants of honeydew green slender shy young asian women waited on loud cheerful anglo hipsters the menu was vegetarian with eggs vegan on request lots of virtue making the rounds in la i half expected alma reynolds to bop in or maybe shed always been into the pound of fishflesh nathalie rothmans white bmw ragtop pulled in five minutes after id settled with a pot of tea she entered like a bullet tiny fast direct all of four ten and ninety muscular pounds her face was soft and smooth as a teenagers under a cloud of careless brown hair fortytwo and the mother of four boys she was married to a developer who owned chunks of wilshire boulevard had been in charge of emergency services at western pediatric medical center for a decade id met her when she was a brandnew yaleeducated resident then chief resident then fasttrack to faculty a lot of important people at the hospital considered her curt and abrasive i could see their point but i liked her she waved a finger at me bounced over to one of the waitresses im dr rothman is my food ready by the time the girls head stopped nodding nathalie had plopped down opposite me i call beforehand hi alex you look handsome the criminal side of life must be agreeable ever think of coming back and doing your real job good to see you too nathalie she laughed no im not on ritalin yes i should be that smidge of gray is flattering i tell charlie the same thing but he doesnt believe me okay cut to the chase i happened to be watching the news saw the broadcast on mr huck called the number like a good little citizen some policetype named reed said he was interested in talking to me but i dont think he really was why not because when i told him why id called he said he was out in the field would get back to me what crops do cops grow in the field i actually asked him that he didnt appreciate my humor do you know him young rookie detective well hes got some learning to do in terms of how to treat lawabiding sources of potentially helpful information he started grilling me who i was why id called like i was under suspicion when i told him i was a physician at western peds it was like a light going on he relaxed told me someone who used to work at western just happened to be consulting on the case did i know you i said sure we went way back he said good how about i talked to you no offense alex but i felt i was being shunted he was supposed to tell you id be calling did he not yet figures well im following through rookie detective reed may not want to deal with cognitive dissonance but too bad dissonance over what mr huck you do know him thats too strong a word she said i met him once but that was enough for me to see him as a hero a plate of cellophane noodles and tofu chicken arrived nathalie ate a few bites fidgeted with a diamond ring big square stone jewelry wasnt my thing but alma reynoldss mammoth pearl had gotten me paying attention nathalie said were talking ten years ago id just taken over outpatient as well as inpatient was doing the late shift to prove i was of the people three am or so the triage nurse pulls me over someones brought in a bloodcovered infant at first everyone thought it was going to be an incredible horror story but when they cleaned the little thing up there were no wounds not a pinprick anywhere little girl seven months old except for being cold and agitated she was fine she chopsticked a cube of tofu the good samaritan was your pal mr huck he never gave his name but im sure its him that face is hard to forget he was gaunt almost feeble not in good shape at all i distinctly recall some sort of neuro damage maybe an old closed head injury or a minor stroke offkilter mouth i said yes she said flashing a victory v i knew it was him his walk was unsteady at first the triage nurse thought he was drunk in danger of dropping the baby meanwhile the babys wailing all that blood it was some scene the news said huck was a person of interest for those killings what does that mean it means the departments being ambiguous why too complicated nathalie she gave me a long look fair enough but off the record is he a suspect for those murders i nodded wow she said i have to tell you alex i never got any ominous vibe from him he was nervous timid probably more scared than the baby he said hed found her on the sidewalk while taking a walk heard the squalling thought it was a wounded animal when he saw it was a baby he grabbed her up and handcarried her to us were talking from silverlake to east hollywood a good two miles on a chilly night hed taken off his jacket to keep the baby warm had on a tshirt and these cheap plaid pantsfunny the things you remember probably thriftshop stuff tied at the waist with a rope his teeth were chattering alex any reason he didnt call maybe he felt he could get her there faster i dont know or he knew that his history would make him an immediate suspect nathalie said did he scare us at first of course he did he had blood all over himself it was something out of those disgusting movies my kids like we didnt want to confront him but we did try to keep him there until the cops arrived once he saw the baby was okay he bolted past our guard you remember the caliber of our security old weak lazy myopic on a good day on top of that the cops took a long time to arrive and our attentions were focused on the baby which is somewhat alarming now that i think about it what if huck really had been a psycho killer how do you know he wasnt because the case closed right away thats the official term right closed not solved youve been doing your homework nathalie charlie likes those crime shows howd the case close we directed the police to where huck said he found the baby they found the blood trail followed it discovered a body lying in some bushes turned out to be the babys mother seventeenyearold girl named brandi loring she lived a few blocks away alcoholic mother and stepfather half sibs stepsibs the babys name was brandeen miniature brandi i guess the family knew who the killer was brandis exboyfriend another kid one year older than brandi apparently she broke up with him before the baby was born and hed been stalking her soon as the police showed up at his house he broke down confessed to beating her to death he had a broken hand and raw knuckles to prove it plus they found his blood on brandis face and neck and chest when the cops asked him why he left the baby there right out on the sidewalk he gave them a stupid look like oops i forgot about that who gave you all the details the detective who did the paperwork thats what he called it doing the paperwork this aint sherlock territory doc remember his name leibowitz she said jewish detective who knew before we parted i asked her how her son was enjoying the windward school interesting place she said interesting how its really two schoolssociologically smart rich kids and notsosmart really rich kids im sensing a common theme forty grand tuition makes it common alex charlie thinks its ridiculous and i guess i do too as to which group jarrod falls into depends what day you catch me you know adolescents no impulse controllook at what happened to poor brandi loring i wouldnt have minded sending him to public school and charlie definitely wanted that but our prince yearned to play varsity baseball and was sure hed never make the grade in public school i guess that makes him one of the smart ones knowing his limitations i phoned hollywood division and asked for detective leibowitz the clerk had never heard of him and neither had the desk officer detective connor then shes out i tried petra s cell she said barry leibowitz he left shortly after i came on and dont be making any causal connection there barry was in his sixties i laughed any idea where i can find him sorry no can i ask why i told her about travis huck rescuing the baby she said your bad guy did something good ted bundy worked a suicide hotline milo said doesnt mean a goddamn thing btk was president of his church moe reed said thats what i figured when she called doc i was going to let you know but i got swamped going over bus and train records and checking out car rental contracts milo said so theres no doubt the boyfriend killed the babys mom i said thats what detective leibowitz told dr rothman leibowitz dont know him he retired right after petra came to hollywood i was going to look for him but if you think its a waste of time i wont what would be the point if leibowitz managed to find huck and interview him it might give us some insight into hucks personality the insight id like is what huck was doing walking a dark deserted street at three in the morning in silverlake but sure go ahead reed said that time frame we know he trolls for street girls maybe when he cant connect he stalks houses peeps windows or worse milo said least now we know where he was ten years ago street guy no social security number so ten to one he was supporting himself illegally lets see what records can give us on hotprowl burglaries back then especially in east hollywood and silverlake ill do it moses you keep working the transport angle and taking phone tips you got it i said huck said hed walked the baby to the hospital if its true he didnt have a car that could mean his home base wasnt far from where he found her reed said he stays on the boulevard for fun crawls back to some hole up in the hills milo said could be but forget about canvassing the boulevard no one from ten years ago is gonna be around the residential neighborhood could be a different story we go back to where the baby was found we might turn up someone who remembers huck better yet i said huck remembers and returns there to hide milo chewed his cheek home is where the heart is huh reed said back to the old comfort zone might sound appealing when youre rabbiting from la policía chapter brandi lorings body had been found on apache street near the western edge of silverlake up four sloping blocks north of sunset the neighborhood was meager frame houses some no larger than shacks more generous structures sectioned into rentals the spot where travis huck had reported finding baby brandeen was a cracked buckling sidewalk on its way to being trashed by the roots of a gigantic banyan an hour and a half of doorknocks up and down apache produced quizzical looks and declarations of ignorance mostly in spanish a woman named maribella olmos ancient and withered but brighteyed remembered the incident the baby nice person to do that she said brave did you know him maam said milo wish i did very brave saving a baby saving taking to the doctor she said all those gangbangers riding around shooting its better now but back then hoo the bangers were out at three in the morning anytime they want sometimes im sleeping i hear gunshots its better now much better you guys are doing a good job snatching milo s big hand she pressed it to wizened lips one of the few times ive seen him caught off guard thank you maam maribella olmos let go of his hand and winked id give you another one right on the lips but i dont want your wife getting jealous next stop the last known address for brandi lorings mother and stepfather anita and lawrence brackle had lived in a pink twostory prewar divided into a quartet of apartments no one on the block had ever heard of the family brandi or the babysaving incident the rest of the afternoon was spent cruising silverlake showing hucks picture to people old enough to be of potential use blank stares and head shakes milo dealt with failure by stopping at a street cart for two glasses of iced tamarind soda other vendors had set up bins of clothing on the sidewalk he eyed the illegal display with amusement drank with fervor as cars bumped by on the potholeafflicted stretch of sunset back in the car he said it was a long shot you still wanna find leibowitz be my guest im going back to the office expanding the real estate search to neighboring counties just in case huck did manage to hitch a ride on the real estate train then its old hollywood hotprowls maybe ill find a severed hand any word on the vanders not yet and buddy weir keeps calling guys starting to sound hysterical i said a lawyer who cares he snorted all those billable hours down the tubes thirty seconds of internet search brought up a barry leibowitz whod come in fourth at a charity proam golf tournament held last year tres olivos golf club and leisure life resort in palm springs the desert could be an affordable place for an excop to retire i pulled up a group photo golfing barry leibowitz was a whitehaired mustachioed man of the right age standing in the back row further websurfing produced a followup piece in the club bulletin with capsule bios of the four top amateurs two dentists one accountant and detective leibowitz our law enforcement duffer nowadays he captures trophies instead of criminals i phoned tres olivos used my real name and title but made up a story about calling on behalf of western pediatrics as the hospital searched for mr leibowitzs current mailing address the trophy he won in our recent nine holes for kids tournament was returned by the post office and wed really like to get it to him at worst the club secretary would be cautious verify with the hospital learn i was on the staff but that no such award existed she said here you go doctor no desert air for det iii ret barry z leibowitz he lived in a onebedroom condo on pico west of beverwil i called got no answer set out anyway the address matched a gated complex called hillside manor not much of a development just a hundred yards of driveway lined with sandcolored boxes that bordered the northern edge of hillcrest country clubs verdant eighteen holes the club was a nice fit for leibowitzs interests but i couldnt see an exdetective making the membership fee a call box to the right of the gate listed thirty residents i entered leibowitzs code a bass voice said yes i started to explain who i was youre putting me on not at all im working with detective sturgis its about travis huck hold on five minutes later the man id just seen pictured in the tournament photo appeared on the west side of the truncated street wearing a gold polo shirt black linen pants and flipflops taller and broader than the picture had suggested barry leibowitz supported a winebarrel torso on short stumpy legs the white hair was thin the mustache was full and waxed his look of amusement recalled the jaunty monocled fellow from monopoly when he reached the gate i showed my consulting badge whats that supposed to do establish my bona fides i just called sturgis the gate slid open heard of him but never worked with him must be interesting the cases can be he studied me sure thats what i meant the condo was a secondfloor unit toward the back spotless almost antiseptic two leather golf bags were propped in a corner a portable bar sported good singlemalt and premium gin a dozen or so golf trophies shared a case with paperback books crime novels mostly leibowitz saw me looking at them and chuckled youd think busmans holiday right in the real world we got sixty seventy percent of the bad guys these creative types get a hundred want something to drink no thanks im pouring macallan for myself you sure you changed my mind leibowitz chuckled flexibility mark of a smart guy removing a couple of oldfashioned glasses from the bars lower shelf he held them up to the light took them into the kitchen washed and dried inspected again repeated the ritual through a split in the pine trees the kitchen window offered an oblique sliver of stunning green atop a rolling hill a figure in white contemplated a putt leibowitz said nice view huh im like that guy in mythology tantalus all the goodies just out of arms reach i said rancho park s not far you play nope i just know about rancho after oj got sued he went for the public courses leibowitz laughed oj thank god i never got near that one he brought over two stiff drinks settled in a recliner the first half of his glass went down in small slow sips he finished the rest in a single swallow lets hear it for the scots so you want to know about eddie huckstadterthats the name he was using back then in terms of my case he was one of the good guys especially given his circumstances what circumstances were those he was a bum he said excuse me a homeless individual who should never be judged by conventional standards laughing he reached for the bar poured himself another finger of whiskey truth is doctor i dont judge not anymore once you get away from the job you start to get a different perspective like with sturgis back when i started youd never get me working with someone like that now hes got the chops hell who cares about his outside life he studied me if that offends you what can i say no offense taken huckstadter left the scene howd you find him sheer brilliance more laughter not quite hospital described him i gave the description to patrol a couple of our uniforms knew who he was right away from working the boulevard eddie was just another street guy we picked him up the next day he hung out on hollywood used to panhandle outside the chinese theatre and farther up near the pantages wherever the tourists were i guess had his hair long a pierced nose the whole freak thing thats what they were back then not hippies anymore freaks did patrol know him from prior arrests nope just as a bum he was distinctive that crooked mouth of his plus the limp he screwed up his own lips the mustache went along for the ride they brought him to me i questioned him he gave the same story he gave the nurses at the hospital but by that time he was irrelevant anyway the case was closed instant guilty plea by the bad guysome scrotum named gibson depaul gibbie pronouncing the nickname with lingering contempt he sipped the refill still patrol goes to the trouble to follow through im not going to make them feel they wasted their time i rode cars myself ten years in van nuys then four in west valley before i decided to use thistapping his headinstead of this doing the same for his biceps a brawny arm hoisted down went the rest of the second scotch i used to live in the valley back when my wife was alivethats good stuff they age it in sherry barrels you dont like it i drank savored the taste then the burn i like it a lot leibowitz said huckstadters become a serious bad guy sturgis told me it almost knocked me over i missed that completely you didnt hear about it on the news nah never watch that crap lifes too short got a nineteeninch in the bedroom when its on its tuned to sports so huckstadter didnt seem violent nope but its not like we spent much time together psychoanalyzing still youre surprised im always surprised said leibowitz keeps you youngwhat i said before flexibility what was eddie like back then just another sad case doc hollywoods always full of them all the glamour that isnt hes got no adult record meaning he was a juvey offender he spent some time at cya but the case was reversed what kind of case said leibowitz i described hucks manslaughter conviction the crooked mouths probably the result of a head injury while in custody well he said i can see that making a guy angry huck seem angry nah just scared like he didnt like being out in the daylight drug problem wouldnt surprise me dope booze or being crazy is what gets people living on the street but if youre asking did i see track marks a raw nose was he speedtalking or spaced out or hungover the answer is no no overt craziness either guy was coherent told the story logically from a to b most i could say about him was he looked depressed over what i assumed over the way his life had gone being homeless its easy to get beaten down right i wasnt there to be his shrink doc i took the report when he was through i offered him a ride wherever he wanted to go he said no thanks he liked to walk now youre telling me hes serious bad news thats disconcerting doc my missing all the signs is there evidence he was strangling girls back then no no or not yet not yet those marsh murders theyre definitely his circumstances seem to point that way damn he said whoda known i didnt see a sign of that nothing i said maybe there were no signs he was crafty hid his dark impulses yup i said thats what i meant it took until nightfall to make contact with milo s mobile i said any interesting hotprowls only interesting ones were closed the rest are simple burglariesjewelry stereos no panty thieves nothing creepy and so far hucks avoided the real estate boom he owns nothing you might not want to spend much more time at the assessors ten years ago he was homeless hard to see him building up enough equity hard to see him jumping from that to estate manager maybe the vanders really do have tender hearts i said or by the time they met him hed turned his life around fine but how would people like them meet someone like him i thought about that couldve been through a temp jobhuck working as a waiter or a bartender at a charity function or just a chance encounter he fools em into thinking hes reformed were talking mushy heart alex the same kind of idealism that might lead them to donate to the marsh silence he said interesting unfortunately i cant find any list of save the marsh contributors and alma reynolds claims theres no formal fundraising group billionaire bucks fund the entire operation which seems to be rent and twentyfive grand for duboffs salary im wondering if duboff mightve supplemented as in the blond plastic guy with the envelope that chance brandt saw if that was a payoff what was señor bondo getting from duboff dont know but its possible duboff saved up some extra cash despite a low salary and alma got hold of it i described the huge pearl reynolds had tried to conceal how shed bought it shortly after duboffs death lied about its being a gift from him he said or she splurged on herself and was embarrassed to admit it being a selfdenying vegan ascetic and all that she eats fish i said steak wouldnt surprise me hypocrite holding something back the minute she saw me she tried to hide that pearl then she switched tactics and flaunted it as if daring me to make a big deal out of it but my seeing it clearly threw her instead of returning to work she went home maybe the food didnt agree with herokay yeah you might be on to some financial shenanigans but that doesnt mean its related to the murders and if duboff was hiding cash it wasnt at his apartment i went over the place myself at some point i can brace ol alma but not right now too much going on as in finding mr huck the airport fakeout may be stale but it works not a hint of where he is i said maybe hell write wouldnt that be loverly uncle milo is soooo lonely chapter the next morning brought no callback from milo or reed and neither detective was answering the phone id woken up warmed by sunlight and thinking about travis huck petra and milo were right a single act of kindness meant nothing because psychopaths are great actors and a façade of altruism lets them pursue the cruelty they love public admiration feeds the lust for control and attention the lookatme tango the marsh murders reeked of exhibitionism choosing hallowed ground for the dump site calling the murders in storing bones in a pretty box why face four women east not much had been made of that since the first day the only thing i could think of was geographic symbolism nadine vander was chinese american and her last sighting before san francisco had been taiwan simon had flown in from hong kong was all of this really revolving around the family or were the vanders just the crowning glory of a bloody orgy destroy the rich and powerful and inherit their souls if that was the motive why not flaunt their bodies but the only victim on display was selena an outwardly shy young woman whod entertained at literal orgies before graduating to pain games however i tossed it around the killings kept coming back to a sexual serial and maybe the link to the vanders was another young woman had nadine been hucks target all along as reed had suggested lady of the manor viewed from afar with lust and longing her husband and son collateral damage maybe travis huck was capable of all that but his tenyearold act of mercy hadnt been attentionseeking just the opposite hed fled the moment brandeen lorings health was confirmed or maybe even back then huck had dark secrets he didnt want exposed raised by an alcoholic mother locked up and abused until his rescue at eighteen his life until the second rescue by the vanders remained a mystery a lot could happen during a decade and a half on the streets i spent another hour on it ended up addled and popping advil to kill a massive headache shifting to robotwork i cleared billing straightened my office took a run and wound down by walking blanche for fifteen minutes and stretching and showering i told robin i needed to drive she wasnt surprised no sign of alma reynoldss yellow vw on fourteenth street i phoned the doctor where she worked out sick for all i knew milo had found the time to reel her in and she was sitting in a west la interview room i tried him again still no answer moe reeds guess about huck staying in his comfort zone made sense and i wondered if the same applied to alma when it came to buying jewelry looking up shops in santa monica i found two that specialized in pearls the first turned out to be false advertisinga booth in an antiques barn that specialized in costume gems the second le nacre on montana featured gray velvet cases of strands and solitaires including the larger south sea marvels i studied tray after tray of gleaming orbs white black gray greenish bluish gold no prices on display in a center case i spotted a pendant that couldve been the twin of alma reynoldss guilty pleasure the saleswoman fortyish frosted blond and foxfaced wore a black lycralaced suit that screamed torture at the gym she let me browse before gliding my way and pointing to the pendant its beautiful isnt it beautiful and huge i said thats what you get with south sea size and quality this ones a full seventeen millimeters they can go as high as twenty but you rarely see seventeens with such excellent luster shape and nacrethats the thickness of the outer layer this ones a solid millimeter good shape and smooth its our last one you had several we had two they came in from australia and the other one sold just a few days ago trust me this one will also move fast quality always does lucky woman i said birthday or guilt gift she smiled which is your situation birthday but give me enough time and im sure therell be guilt she giggled im sure youre right no actually a woman bought it for herself said her mother had always worn pearls it was time to treat herself to something nice this is more than nice may i look at it oh absolutely as she unlocked the case i received a minicourse on pearl grading and culture whats your wifes skin toneis it your wife why quibble it is shes got spanish and italian blood theres some rose in her complexion but its mostly olive i can tell that you love her she said when a man can describe a woman that easily hes got deep feelings for her rose with mostly olive means this would work perfectly for her the pinkish ones are even more valuable than the creams we had one of those a few months ago a sixteen went out the door the same day it arrived but pink doesnt work for everyone olive ladies do better with cream im sure shell adore it how much she flipped a tiny tag examined a code lucky for you we bought well so six thousand four hundred including the chain which is eighteenkarat and handcrafted in italy and has these adorable little diamond chips spaced perfectly id definitely advise leaving it with the chain theyre a perfect match we make sure of that i said people take them off what would you do with a loose pearl exactly but people get ideas the lady who bought the other one wanted only the pearl said she had her own chain i figured she meant something antique from her mother then she pulls out a cheap plated thing real junk she stuck out her tongue saving a few bucks it hurt me to see the pearl displayed that way but people can be strange she sure was had her own ideas not the type youd think would appreciate something of this quality she touched the chain so does your wife get to be ecstatically happy before you go do something naughty any flexibility on price hmm she said for you i could take off ten percent make it twenty and youve got a deal im sorry she said fifteens the best i can do when you consider what a large diamond costs its an incredible bargain i dont really know much about pearls but i do and trust me its worth it seventeen offs the absolute rock bottom youre lucky its me and not my husband at that price theres barely any profit and when leonard comes in and finds out what i did for you he wont be happy touching my wrist with warm smooth fingertips and guilt gifts for him are no picnic robins big brown eyes expanded like kaleidoscope disks what did you do impulse buy ill sayits gorgeous baby but way too big for me looks fine to me when would i wear it well find an occasion really alex i cant wear it once you dont like it back it goes you are something several moments in front of the mirror later i love you fits your skin tone perfectly its so wrong for me huge you got it flaunt it she sighed darn you really dont like it not that kind of darn she said darn if im not going to make it work a long dinner at the belair wine and lovemaking kod me hard enough for a decent nights sleep but memories of the pearl against robins chest brought me fully awake now the necklace was displayed on our bedroom dresser and when i peeked out the kitchen window her studio light glowed i tried milo again finally connected to his cell asked if hed reached alma reynolds instead of answering he said just got a call from my crime scene buddies travis hucks room in the mansion was clean but they found blood in his bathroom drain type ab weve got no typing on huck so theoretically it could be his but you know how rare ab is whats the chance of two people turning up with it whos the first simon vander medical examiner called simone and got confirmation daddy was always getting hit on to donate reed also talked to simone and shes going to give a dna sample see if that can be linked shes freaking out pretty much over the edge wouldnt surprise me if aaron fox shows up offering to help us poor dumb yokels meanwhile ive got a call in to his holiness this should be enough to name huck a flatout suspect get a fullcourt press on the search no blood anywhere except the drain i said sink and shower just the sink alex which is totally consistent with the bad stuff happening elsewhere huck spotting a stain on his clothes and deciding to wash it off he was careful to scrub the sink itself in fact the level of clean in his room is just as suspicious as if luminol had turned the place purple the place was gone over what the bastard didnt figure on is our taking the plumbing apart is that routine procedure for the techies it is when i tell them to do it im thinking the vanders were lured to sf he picked em up at the airport did them somewhere in northern or central california buried the bodies drove back to la and kept up the loyalemployee façade all those forests up the coast oh yeah i said a lust thing for nadine would explain facing the bodies east look to the orient his breath quickened what im getting that feeling alexstuff coming together listen i gotta keep all my lines open in case zeus calls from olympus if you want to help see if you can come up with a hypothesis as to where hucks hiding travis huck as prime suspect made the six oclock news and the papers a renewed rush of sightings kept milo and moe reed and two other detectives busy for the next fortyeight hours nothing panned out i tried to work up a guess as to where huck might be burrowed looked at maps drew blanks after two days of looking at her pearl robin locked it in the safe i drove to alma reynoldss apartment spotted her vw knocked on her door who is it alex delaware you are stalking me go away six thousand bucks for a pearl i said mom would be proud the sound she emitted couldve been rage or fear silence said she hadnt taken the bait i sat parked up the block for nearly an hour just as i was about to give up she hurried out of her building got in the yellow bug i followed her to a washington mutual on santa monica boulevard she stayed in the bank for another fortytwo minutes then drove to the ophthalmologists office building but after a brief pause kept going headed back to pico stopped at a korean barbecue on centinela glass window in front easy to follow the action i waited until her order arrived massive plate of ribs mug of beer i said celebrating she gasped and sputtered and for a second i thought it was heimlich time chewing furiously she swallowed her teeth ground go away just because the pearls in a safedeposit box doesnt mean you can keep it i dont know what youre talking about mom might be proud of your taste in googaws but would she approve of the financing get the hell out of here you put up with duboff for years see yourself as his rightful heir and i take no issue with that the problem is how he got the money even if it cant be linked to a crime the irs is sure to be interested she lifted a rib and for a second i thought shed use it as a weapon why are you doing this to me its not about you i said its about four other women i touched the rib bones she turned a bad color shot up and ran to the bathroom five minutes ten fifteen i went back found both lavs empty a rear door led to an alley that stank of garbage by the time id returned to the front of the restaurant the vw was gone chapter i parked three blocks from alma reynoldss building walked back to her corner and watched from behind an old dusty coral tree mr covert operations when i wasnt feeling ridiculous my mind raced forty minutes later reynolds hadnt returned and i figured id screwed up and caused her to run i was sure shed financed the pearl with payoff money duboff had left behind envelope passed in the parking lot donation or bribe either way nothing indicated a link to duboffs murder i returned to the seville drove a block before milo called huck lawyered up you got him not exactly debora wallenburgs law firm took up the top two floors of an ice cube on wilshire five blocks east of the ocean names crowded the door wallenburg was ranked second she was fifty or so greeneyed and applecheeked with a sturdy body packed into a gray cashmere suit platinum rings diamond earrings and a triple string of pearls bounced light in interesting ways the pearls were pinkish silver graduated in size my slightly educated guess was ten to fifteen millimeters goodlooking woman with the confidence to keep her feathered hair the same color as the suit shed deflected milo s invitation to the station insisted her office would be preferable now she sat behind a leathertopped desk listening to someone on the phone named lester tiffany giltbronze pieces livened the desks surface including an elaborate lamp with a glass shade crimped to look like paper the rear wall was devoted to a mary cassatt motherandchild pastel the perfect image of tenderness the absence of family photos or anything kidrelated turned great art into a prop milo and reed and i stood like supplicants while wallenburg laughed at something lester said the décor was a thousand square feet of overthetop arterial red brocade walls layercake moldings copperfoil ceiling tealandlavender aubusson rug over teak planks the fourteenthstory view was charcoal street aluminum water rustcolored talons of coastline scratching at the ocean i tried to figure out if the vanders house could be seen decided i was overreaching wallenburg said youre kidding les and turned in a way that directed my eyes to a side wall bearing ivy league degrees and bar association awards she said okay thanks les hung up sit if youd like gentlemen we arranged ourselves in front of the desk milo said thanks for meeting with us ms wallenburg thanks for making the dangerous trek all the way from the wilds of west la wallenburg smiled frostily glanced at her watch milo said if you know where travis huck is before we get into that lieutenant im going on record youre wrong about travis couldnt be more mistaken what evidence do you have to justify naming him a suspect with all due respect maam i need to be asking the questions with all due respect lieutenant i need to prevent a second gross miscarriage of justice step one in that process is clarifying what you think you know that justifies ruining my clients life again whats step two that depends on how one shapes up ms wallenburg i understand your point of view but disclosure will take place if and when mr huck is charged with a crime sounds like youve already judged him milo didnt answer debora wallenburg picked up a tiffany pen and suspended it between her fingertips sorry for making you come out here for nothing do you need your parking validated maam if youre harboring huck you could be putting yourself in now it begins the veiled threats green eyes narrowed give it your best shot lieutenant ive already begun the paperwork on a massive civil suit step two already said milo im sure were all busy lieutenant are you suing at mr hucks request or is it your idea wallenburg shook her head youre not going to pry information out of me maam this isnt the time for jousting were talking five known murders with several more likely brutal calculated slaughter do you really want to hitch your wagon to someone like that hitch my wagon i have no interest in publicity lieutenant sturgis quite the opposite for the last ten years ive done corporate litigation because i had my fill of the sideshow mislabeled the criminal justice system ten years said milo forgive me but is it possible youre out of your element or you are sir said debora wallenburg in fact i know you are travis huck is a decent human being and i am not some bleedingheart mushybrained dogooder who denies the existence of evil ive seen plenty of evil in my day corporate litigation gets that nasty witty lieutenant bottom line im not harboring travis neither am i aware of his whereabouts but youve been in contact with him the pen clicked im going to give you some free legal advice avoid tunnel vision and prevent a huge mess for all concerned any suggestions about alternative suspects maam thats not my job moe reed huffed if wallenburg noticed she didnt show it milo said huck fled not the behavior of an innocent man it is when that man has been abused by the system he called you because you saved him before you advised him not to inform you of his whereabouts or his guilt that way you couldnt be subpoenaed to divulge all legal ms wallenburg but it skirts the moral issue if huck kills again do you want it on your conscience oh please lieutenant you should write screenplays ill leave that to disillusioned lawyers wallenburg shifted her focus to me searching for the good kid in the classroom when i didnt respond she looked at reed he said huck will be found tried and convicted make it easy on who lets start with the victims families said reed easy for everyone but travis said wallenburg nineteen years ago he was hauled in like garbage tried before a kangaroo court tortured who tortured him said milo his socalled caretakers havent you read my appeals brief no maam ill fax you a copy reed said whatever happened back then doesnt change the facts now youre so sure hes innocent but youve got nothing to back that up wallenburg laughed do you really think youre going to pry facts out of me by insulting me how about you deliver something in the way of evidence go ahead convince me hes guilty the only link you have is casual knowledge of selena bass milo said he told you that wallenburg said that seals it youve got nothing why am i not shocked reed said you think we just picked his name out of the phone book i think youre looking for a quick and easy hook to hang your investigative hats on milo said if i told you we had physical evidence would that change your mind depends on the nature of that evidence and how meticulously it was collected reed laughed oj again wallenburg said think what you want gentlemen the fact is even if i could be a party to this sham i wouldnt milo said this sham being railroading travis again you really shouldve read my brief he was beaten so severely that he incurred permanent nerve damage and what got him in there pushing back at a bully coming up against wealth and power i said why didnt you file a civil suit wallenburg blinked travis wasnt interested hes not a vengeful person milo said granted the first time was an outrage youre the hero of the story but that doesnt relate to the present situation a hero dont patronize me lieutenant all i did was basic lawyering just like youre doing now i dont owe you any explanation i said traviss life between his release and being hired by the vanders is a blank when he got out you wanted to help him reintegrate but he disappeared on you went homeless all kinds of things can happen to a disabled young man living on the street what makes you think hes the same person you saved wallenburg put the pen down picked up a rocker blotter milo said were talking nineteen years with no legitimate identity that kind of caginess implies something to hide it implies nothing of the sort what then debora wallenburg plinked a long silver nail against the blotter you have no idea she said i said i think we do he was traumatized lonely in so much despair he wouldnt accept your help in readjusting no answer what part of the picture are we missing ms wallenburg her eyes lost lawyersteel and turned human another quick blink restored them to flat jade disks i said what happened to him during those hidden years the phone rang she picked it up and said sure put it through hi mort whats up that i sent it yesterday you should be getting it any minute whats that absolutely no just taking life easy making a show of relaxation she sat back chatted did more listening finally glanced our way feigned surprise at our presence and kept talking a tall blond assistant in a suit almost as nice as wallenburgs entered the office on lethal heels gentlemen the garage just called your car is ready john nguyen said theres nothing i can do milo even if shes harboring a fugitive did she acknowledge that she was she claimed she wasnt do you have evidence to the contrary its pretty obvious huck reached out to her im sure shes got an idea where hes bunked down nguyen said you keep putting me in this position what position having to be mr ice bath what you have doesnt mean squat milo and youre too experienced not to know that we were at the pacific dining car on sixth just west of downtown nguyen was demolishing a surf and turf reed and i stuck with soda water milo had ordered but he had no appetite which meant the world was coming to an end jesus john do you have any idea how highprofile this could get seen the memos said nguyen also heard rumors about your bosss slowing down the process well now my bosses want everything sped up i told wallenburg i thought shed dummied up deliberately and she didnt argue her situation thats what id do milo john weve got a goddamn serial lust maniac out there and she can help us find him maybe shes the hero of hucks story im sure he turned to her when he rabbited even without explicit knowledge of his whereabouts shes likely to have a pretty good idea prove that shes harboring and ill see if theres some way i can twist it in your favor surveillance on her would be your choice but i wouldnt be heavyhanded about it deboras going to be ready for you and if you overstep shell slam you with a civil suit so lawyers get special privileges said reed hey thats why we become lawyers nguyen forked a huge piece of steak reconsidered and sawed it in half what do you really expect to learn from watching her shes not going to drive her ferrari straight to hucks crib shes got a ferrari and a maybachthe supermercedes said nguyen whats that four hundred grand excluding the gasguzzler tax crime pays said reed i drive a honda dont make me cry i knew debora back when i was in school and she was teaching criminal law she was a great lecturer as well as one of the best pds in the city milo said she make all that money shuffling corporate paper not directly said nguyen shortly after she switched to corporate she was assigned to drawing up the contracts on a bunch of gazilliondollar dotcom deals invested early and cashed out at the right time i dont know why she bothers practicing anymore must be the thrill said milo ha ha ha nguyen dipped lobster in drawn butter sipped his martini john if i asked you for a tap on her id say so when are you opening at the comedy store all those women dead john and maybe the vandersa kid john maybe with his hand hacked clean off nguyen looked at his steak and sighed milo said publics gonna love us wimping out on this you cant tap her milo shes his lawyer not his girlfriend reed said who knows youve got evidence of an intimate relationship not yet find thatfind anything that shows me shes behaved illegally milo said if shes his girlfriend shes the dumbest smart person in the world his sexual partners tend to end up dead and dismembered and facing east i said wondering if nguyen would find that interesting he didnt i really wish i could help you guys maybe you should forget about debora and find huck the oldfashioned way milo said meaning shoe leather interviewing street peoplewhatever you guys do that brings in the goods he made a try for his steak chewed without apparent pleasure theres another reason not to piss debora off once you do get huck we could be contending with her at the defense table then ill be the one with the ulcer you see her putting aside her corporate clients and taking him on from what youve told me she believes in him said nguyen even if shes not chief defense counsel shell play a role i know debora tenacious i said beyond belief doctor ferrari maybach said reed she can afford to play wonder woman must be nice said nguyen chapter ive ridden in a few funeral processions the drive back to the station had that same stunned dispirited feeling milo said smart woman like that and shes taken in by his bullshit reed said like those losers who hook up with cons in prison whats behind it doc usually really low selfesteem and a desire for attention neither of which applied to wallenburg but why intrude on their resentment milo rubbed his face all that dough but her lifes empty so she wants to feel righteous again limousine liberals said reed the corners of milo s mouth twitched but gave up short of a smile havent heard that one in a while moses thats what my mother said my father used to call them milo said any suggestions about changing wallenburgs mind alex with someone else id try piling on the gory detailsvictim photos autopsy shots emphasize the suffering the women went through in wallenburgs case its likely to solidify her resistance because she sees herself as iron maiden saving huck was a major event in her life so viewing him as a vicious killer is too threatening but if you do get some serious evidencesomething that appeals to her rationalityyou could crack her denial thats what you were getting at in her office hucks not the same innocent kid no fault of hers reed said weve got blood in the drain milo said i thought of telling her didnt want to give her anything to work with first thing out of her mouth would be abo typings not dna reed said we get a full confession shell probably still stand behind him poor little victim of the system he shook his head ferrari debby milo said feel like following her moses sure said reed department paying for a maserati she gives me the slip conventional wheels arent going to cut it long as you can get it for thirty bucks a day i could boost some hot wheels said reed but god forbid i should be heavyhanded back home and away from their ill humor i wondered if debora wallenburg had lied about not knowing hucks whereabouts smart people made foolish mistakes all the time my profession thrived on that fact but if wallenburg had overstepped by harboring a dangerous fugitive my guess was wed never find out i thought about huck rootless haunted the cameo performance as a superhero saving a baby debora wallenburgs initial act of kindness had created a longterm bond between her and huck what if the same was true for huck and brandi lorings family no internet hits popped up for anita and lawrence brackle but larry brackle appeared on a threeyearold police blotter from the daily news arrestee age fortythree a van nuys dui bust no followup on that but an image scan brought up a twoyearold photo of brackle celebrating the turkey tenpin fest of the meadowlark association bowling club at a canoga park alley a dozen beaming keglers brackle had earned frontrow center because size mattered even compared with the slight women flanking him he was a small manskinny wiry with black hair slicked back and sideburns reaching to his jawline i plugged in meadowlark association and came up with the homeowners group at a condo development in sherman oaks eightynine deluxe units on three acres north of ventura boulevard just east of the freeway prices ranged from midsixfigures for a onebedroom hacienda suite to nearly a million for br ba rancheros highdef photos showcased white redroofed modules softened by ferns palms banana plants and rubber trees gracious pathways for strolling three pools two with whirlpool soaking spas as well as a screening room a gym with sumptuous steamroom and sauna nice upgrade from the silverlake rental brackle and his family had called home a decade ago i checked the names of the other bowlers none of the women was anita brackle maybe she had no use for tenpins or larrys drinking had continued driving her away along with baby brandeen i searched brackles face for signs of dissolution saw only a skinny little bespectacled man happy to be among his peers copying down the meadowlark address i told robin id be stepping out she said this time its not just restlessness youve got that heat in your baby blues i told her about brackle she said huck helped the family so theyre helping him im grasping no grasp no get she kissed me be careful when i reached the door she said be great if the babys thriving the reality of the meadowlark was white stucco grayed by time and pollution a profusion of plants in need of trim a constant overlay of freeway flatulence security was mechanical but effective a deadbolted iron mesh gate i checked the roster of residents failed to find brackles name figured him for long gone or a sublet then a listing at the bottom caught my eye ranchero five one of the highpriced units i was deliberating whether or not to try the direct approach when a fedex guy came charging through the gate i caught it before it could swing shut made my way past the first two swimming pools both unoccupied and leaflittered the haciendas were a collection of twostory units tucked into the northeast corner and segregated by a low wall of cutout cement blocks the orange door to five was nearly hidden by the broad leaves of a banana that had managed to thrive in the shade but would never bear fruit i rang the bell a female voice said larry forget your key again i murmured something that couldve been uhhuh or uhuh the door opened on a perilously thin brownhaired middleaged woman wearing an oversized white jersey top and black yoga pants and holding a cigarette bare feet pink toenails red polish for the tips of her spidery fingers a gold chain rested on the arch of one varicose foot a face perched on a long graceful neck bore the aftershocks of beauty puckers around her wide thin mouth gave her a capuchin look shadows under her eyes spoke of stories that could never be untold youre not larry smokers rasp olfactory stew of chanel and tobacco mrs vander whos asking i gave her my name and flashed the consultants id a doctor something happened to larry no im here to talk to him about what old friends well hes not here kelly vander began closing her door i said whens mr brackle coming back its important the door stopped moving mrs vander i heard you behind her was a big bright highceilinged room set up with a flatscreen and pink leather couches a halfgallon bottle of fresca stood on an end table music played jack jones advising some girl to comb her hair and fix her makeup kelly vander said he went out for cigarettes no problem im happy to wait outside what kind of old friends travis huck for one travis she said you know him why wouldnt i he works for my exhusband are you and mr vander in regular contact we talk have you spoken to him recently she shook her head this has something to do with simon i said did larry help travis get the job with simon she sucked in smoke i dont speak for larry for anyone give me your number ill pass it on id rather wait suit yourself the door edged inward another couple of inches i said simon hasnt been heard from in two weeks same for nadine and kelvin theyre probably traveling they do that two weeks ago they flew from asia to san francisco any idea where they might be staying i wouldnt know whats that got to do with larry you havent heard about travis heard what i told her thats insane what is travis doing something like that he loves us loves the entire family just about she said too bad about those women thats really horrible really really horrible jesus tugging the neckline of her top im sure theyre okaysimon and kelvin nadine adorable kid kelvin plays piano like elton john he calls me auntie kelly how often do you see them not often what did you mean by just about sorry you said travis loved just about everyone in the family he loves everybody her cigarette hand shook ash fell to her chest she brushed it off created streaks on the white jersey would you do me a favor examine the label tell me the laundering instructions hooking a thumb to the back of the neckline she pulled and bent forward provided enough slack for a glimpse of flat chest and puckered sternum i said dry clean only figures travis loves everyone i said who wouldnt he love she flashed brown corroded teeth the cigarette slipped through her fingers landed atop her left foot scattered ashes it had to hurt she stared at the smoldering cylinder as if assessing her loss i bent and retrieved the cigarette she snatched it jammed it back in her mouth sorry to upset you i said upset i dont think so let me look at that id of yours chapter kelly vanders pink couches were soft and yielding her condo had the afterthought look of temporary housing the seventyinch tv was the source of the music a cable or satellite station playing singers and standards jack jones had given way to eydie gorme blaming everything on the bossa nova kelly touched the soda bottle fresca if you want caffeine theres diet pepsi nothing thanks inhaling her cigarette down to the filter she ditched it in the kitchen sink found a pack of winston lights lit up some people think diet is bad for you but i think its better than all that sugar larry should be back soon she took something off the wall and brought it to me framed glassed newspaper ad fullcolor may company spread junior miss dresses and sweater ensembles on clearance the date thirtyone years ago this is me pointing to a blond girl in a plaid jumper even without puckers kelly vanders mouth had a simian cast and i wouldve picked her out you modeled she sat on a pink corner im five five now used to be an inch taller before my spine compressed but even with that i was too short for the big time in the beginning all they had me doing was kiddy wear my boobs came in late because soon as i got a chest the agency pushed me straight into juniors and thats where i stayed thats how i met simon he was in the rag trade repping synthetic knits for a downtown manufacturer there was a showcase for buyers they set up a runway at the scottish rite place squeaked like a haunted house over in hancock park i said near the ebell wondering if kelvin vanders recital venue would draw a reaction kelly vander said thats the one karma she poured herself fresca sure i cant get you any im fine what was karma meeting simon we girls were all lined up they gave us outfits randomly i just happened to end up with one of his companys suits blue doublebreasted metal buttons like a sailor i even wore a sailor hat she touched her head allowed herself a ragged brown smile crappy poly scratchy i couldnt wait to get out of it simon came up to me later hed gotten a big order thanked me he was a little older than me seemed sophisticated she exhaled smoke nicotine vapors wafted across her glass gave the soda the look of a potion youre a psychologist huh known plenty of those some good ones some notsogood ones thats better than no good ones you work for the police i freelance must be interesting it can be big grin what was your most exciting case i smiled back she said cant blame any of them the psychologists who tried to help me what i had was resistant to change chronic eating disorder resistant to change they told me if i didnt stop starving myself id drop dead of a heart attack that scared me but not enough you know like theres two parts of my brain the thinking section and the gimme section one of the doctors who helped me said it was a matter of developing new habits he had me do exercisesmental i mean getting the thinking section to dominate that make sense to you it does im okay now running her hands over her bony body i could probably still keel over from what i did to myself back then but so far knock on mahogany you were healthy enough to have a child you know simone she looks just like me i should do my teeth its obvious right theyre all rotted from bulimia everyone says id look ten years younger if i did my teeth but im not sure i want that to look younger exactly she said every time i see myself in the mirror and cringe it reminds me of how i got that way in the first place what do you think professionally speaking do i need that reminder i dont know you well enough i said ding good answer she pumped air checked a wall clock wheres larry i finally got some insights third rehabs the charm did you meet larry in rehab she shook her head i dont speak for larry i own what i own and his emotional acreage is his speaking of which she glanced at the door id been listening for footsteps had heard nothing moments later the panel of orange wood swung wide open and sixtythree inches of sunglassed alohashirted larry brackle charged in swinging a greasy white bag a carton of winston lights was pinioned under his arm got you donuts honey those crunchy maple walnut cinnam he removed his shades we got a guest kell kelly vander said you do larry its all about you baby doll larry brackle flicked ashes into a coffee cup youre trying to tell me travis is some kind of bundy no offense sir but thats lunacy kelly vander said thats what i told him sweets they sat next to each other knees pressed together smoking in unison making their way through the fresca i said the police consider him a prime suspect brackle said police thought that the first time you know traviss history hesitation sure it was in the papers not the local papers silence i said the ferris ravine clarions pretty obscure mr brackle unless you know his story from some other source brackle turned to kelly vander her face stayed blank he said whatever i heard about it travis told you whatever did you meet him in rehab look sir i want to be a good citizen but i dont speak for travis he owns what he owns and my shit is my own no offense i said speak for yourself then did you know him before he took brandeen to the hospital or after brackles jaws worked pintsized man but his wrists and hands were thick and sturdy man im hungry he sprang up jogged to the kitchen returned with a slab of pound cake on a paper plate split honey no its yours brackle kissed her cheek it could be yours too youre so sweet but ms tummys full said kelly vander ill wait till dinner youre sure its good cake i am sweetie okay lets have those steaks for dinner you can have one lar little heavy for me ill cut them into thin strips well see you liked em that way before yeah that was good but i dont know im kind of full i said im thinking you knew travis before he found brandeen he went looking for her and brandi in order to help you out now cmon sir dont be going off on some guessing game travis is a good man im not saying he isnt i know he didnt hurt brandi brackles hands became glossy white fists hell no he didnt everyone knows who hurt brandi sir gibson depaul scum they sent him up for life and he killed another inmate and got sent to pelican bay sir you keep tabs on him we get that victim notification mailer they send us us meaning the two of you or you and your ex i cant say what she gets where is anita you tell me lost contact anita couldnt change herself didnt wanna try what about the kids i see em on some holidays said brackle whats the diff to you why all this curiosity about my family sorry my main interest is travis then youre spinning your wheels sir he didnt kill nobody not then not now interesting i said what is the police consider him a prime suspect but people keep showing up who consider him a saint like who debora wallenburg brackle and kelly vander looked at each other burst into sudden strident laughter i said mustve missed the joke brackle said saints there aint no such thing were always talking about that all there is sir are sinners of different degrees and what we all need is to learn to forgive ourselves not wait for some preacher to do it i said so both of you met travis in rehab no answer its not a secret that can be kept very long travis is entitled to his privacy sir getting helps not something to be ashamed of mr brackle on the contrary he got himself together kelly vander said okay fine thats where we met him i said did you recommend him to simon as payment for rescuing larrys granddaughter brackle said youre a smart one why dont you use that brain on something important how long before brandis murder did you meet him right before okay six seven months id already decided to leave anita because she refused to get better and i knew if i stayed with her id be dead soon only thing that stopped me was the kids three of hersincluding brandiand we had one together thats randy hes in the service over in fallujah got decorated randys a wonderful boy said kelly wistfully brackle said we got a consensus on that yeah thats where we met travis the three of us trying to get straight his treatment was being paid for by that lawyer wallenburg i thought it was damn nice of her and told him so told him he should take advantage of amazing grace and improve himself i was using my own dough plus work disability place cost a fortune kelly said simon footed my bill even though we were divorced when was this i said twelve years ago simon and i had split up three years before but we stayed friends i put simon through a lot and he stopped loving me but he still liked me no matter what i never raised my voice to him never tried to squeeze any extra money out of him even after he got real rich i thought i deserved not to be loved so i made sure he stopped loving me simone was a teenager the stressi wasnt handling anything simon said give it another try kell you owe it to yourself well find a great place all the creature comforts he got me brochures i liked the one from pledges lots of trees pledges in south pasadena you know it good place i said closed down a few years ago larry brackle said great place they got bought out by one of those corporations bastards ran it into the ground kelly said first day i got there i met larry he liked me and loved me but it wasnt for years that he admitted it cause he was still married and i wasnt in a receptive statedidnt see myself committed to anyone how long have you two been together brackle said officially nine years in herepatting his heartfrom forever kelly vander said instant friendship and acceptance i never had that with a man simons a good man but i knew i was failing him constantly and you cant live being a failure all the time i said the cops say travis was a polydrug user no answer rehab helped the two of you but it didnt work for him two years afterward he was homeless thats where i saw him said larry brackle on the street used to work in hollywood big apartment building nice place west of la brea assistant super on my way home i generally took the boulevard drove past the chinese theatre one night i spotted travis there panhandling tourists he looked real bad compared to when he was at pledges i mean stringy hair beard all hunched over not doing too good with the tourists because he wouldnt get in anyones face thats travis he dont confront i drove around the block pulled up laid a twenty in his palm he saw it was me started to cry said he was sorry for screwing up kelly said before we got discharged the three of us made a promise to change and to reach out to each other when our thoughts turned bad larry and i stuck to it thats how we succeeded but we lost touch with travis brackle nodded i told him no ones judging you man come home with me for a meal and a bath he ran off and the next day he wasnt there same for the entire week but then i saw him again same deal his hands out even worselooking this time he agreed to go with me anita was pissed off said you see any extra room in this dump genius what with her me all the kids we had a couple of dogs too i said id sleep outside in the backyard if that made it better she said maybe both of you should what ended up happening was travis used this toolshed we had i cleared away junk and put out a mattress and hed come and go as he pleased i got him a haircut once the hair was off we saw all these pierces he had in his ears like a pirate especially with that limp he was like a pirate kids loved the pierces anita hated them kelly said but anita came to like travis what changed anitas mind was he was gentle with the kids soon she was letting him tell the kids stories then he was holding the baby being real good with the baby course anita could be unpredictable what with drinking and weed so it wasnt always perfect but mostly we had peace deep drag on his cigarette travis really liked that baby man its been a long time now youre wanting to tell me travis is some kind of murdermonster no way josé im no shrink but i know people pretty good and travis is good people i said tell me about the night brandi disappeared she didnt disappear sir she went with him that garbage we dont mention by name now that one was evil from the getgo his own family was scared of him when brandi didnt come back we went right over to their placetravis and me his folks looked scared said the little shitface talked about visiting with brandi and the baby thats all they knew travis and me went searching the neighborhood travis took a bunch of streets i took some others he found the baby saw the blood and took her to the hospital so he knew something had happened to brandi brandi was hiddenthats what the cops said off in some bushes the baby was out in the open he was thinking about the baby whyd he walk to the hospital rather than contact you scared wouldnt you be said brackle going to jail once for something you didnt do now theres a baby with blood not that he said it its just what i figured out that boys whole life was fear id walk by the shed and hear him moaning bad dreams daylight thered be this look in his eyes whats the wordhaunted he was haunted by what they did to him anyone would be way they beat his brain around he probably got all freaked out the cops would blame it on him but even with that fear he wanted to make sure the baby was okay i said so you never talked to him about it nope travis disappeared after dropping brandeen at the hospital howd you know it was him cops described him asked if we knew who he was but we didnt let on we were all crazy over what happened to brandi didnt want to complicate things the main thing was find out who did it to her and that we did tell em i said travis took a twomile walk in the cold travis was a walking man sir filled most of his days walking where everywhere said brackle but dont go misunderstanding there was nothing crazy to it he just liked to walk its the best exercise said kelly i used to do ten miles a day i still do five the skin around brackles eyes creased he forced himself cheerful exactly aerobic boy wanted to be aerobicnossir he just liked to walk i said how did travis hook up with simon kelly said that was years later we hadnt heard from him for a while then out of the blue he called larry to let him know he was doing better finally got himself some help that stuck said brackle where he didnt say and i didnt ask he sounded good i could tell this was different i invited him for coffee with me and kelly he looked good cleareyed said kelly intelligent that never really came out before because he was always so depressed he said he was looking for steady employment would do anything to make an honest buck i knew simon was looking for someone to manage his house hed been through a couple of flakes needed someone reliable he said sure hed try travis out it worked out great i said did travis talk about what hed been doing since the last time you saw him no sir said brackle where was he living i got the sense hed been traveling any idea where we didnt get nosy with him said kelly we were thrilled he was doing well it worked out great for everyone simon thanked me for finding travis travis is gentle hed never hurt anyone now i am getting kind of hungry brackle said yup dinnertime wed invite you to join us sir but we always portion for two i drove back to the city a yellow vw was parked in front of my house unoccupied cold engine no sign of alma reynolds my remark about her mothers pearls had scared her maybe robin had let her in as i climbed the stairs a voice behind me said now im stalking you she stepped out from the side of my house came toward me carrying a green vinyl attaché case brand new tag still tied to the handle not much different from the one milo uses when the murder books get thick she wore a plaid shirt jeans work boots gray hair flew in all directions her eyes were hot here take it she said thrusting the case were finished my hands stayed at my sides the case touched my chest dont worry it doesnt tick take it lets talk she snatched it away sprang the latches inside were stacks of twentydollar bills held together by rubber bands atop the money a black velvet jewelry box she said including the damn pearl satisfied i said going for the simple life stop being nasty this is what you wanted im giving it to you what i want is information doesnt this say it all it implies why dont you come up and well talk what therapy is there a couch the psych board website lists this as your office id think youd be more careful seeing as its your home what if i was a sociopath should i be worried oh sure im packing heat she laughed flipped her pockets inside out placing the case on the ground she stomped to the vw turned her back slapped her palms on the hood is this the proper position cmon i said just a few minutes of your time she straightened and faced me her eyes were wet sil taught me the position he got used to doing it automatically at protests sometimes the cops hit him anyway he was a man of principle and look where it got him sobut hell why should i have anything nice im sure his principles were strong that made finding his cashstash doubly shocking look she said im giving it to you every bit of it my hands are clean goodbye lets clarify a few things and that really will be the end of it so you say the way i see it youre the person of principle i said and im not the enemy arms folded across her chest she wiped her eyes nudged the case with a workbooted toe oh hell i used to be catholic whats another damn confession chapter alma reynolds bounced on my couch and laughed youve actually got one if leather could talk i placed the attaché case on the floor between us whats that she said the altar of eternal truth im supposed to see it and buckle i moved the case aside no matter what you think sil was a man of principle he may have taken the money but he didnt spend it the police went over his apartment carefully whered you find it whats the difference he was murdered everything matters cant see how that does but fine in his car okay in the trunk right out in the open which is my point it was nothing he was ashamed of theres no big mystery here people sent in minor cash donations and rather than go to the bank all the time sil saved them up so he could deposit them in the marsh account the small stuff so you actually listen i said he told you about the money no but its the only thing that makes sense sil controlled the account sil created the account he was save the marsh i already explained that to you every penny went to maintenance except for his salary he never gave himself a raise were not exactly talking rampant materialism now that ive seen how you live i understand why you cant seem to get that this place all the sunday supplement contempo california living i know what this neighborhood costs moneys your thing but it wasnt sils the fact that he left the case right out in the open is proof positive theres nothing corrupt about the money how much is in there fifteen thousand yes i counted it who wouldnt including the pearl she flushed keep the damn pearl it didnt fit me anyway and its obviously jammed a burr up your butt hell give it to your wife if you have one thankful robin worked in a separate building i said the pearls yours why shouldnt it be aw gee how tweet of you forget it im washing my hands of the whole damn mess sil was right filthy lucre does stain permanently i said the money could very well be yours too unless he left a will bequeathing it to someone else well he didnt she said neither of us had wills we made a joint decision to avoid pathetic attempts to control things from the grave then id say its yours you were his significant other are you dense or just being manipulative i dont want itand dont try to tell me the cops wont try to confiscate it isnt that part of the racket the entire socalledwarondrugs is nothing more than a revenue scheme the cops i work with are out to solve murders and detective sturgiss skin tones dont go with the pearl oh arent you charming she said probably had a soft upbringing always got your way because you were oh so cute this is the last time im going to say it i dont want the money and i dont want the damn pearl hell if i know what got into me in the first place so stop harassing metracing me to that damn jewelry store unbelievable youre like one of those homeland security scammers alma i said im just trying to figure out what happened at the marsh tracing me that crack about my motheryou actually found that jewelry store lots of motivation alma well bully for youif you must know i didnt go in there intending to buy anything expensive just a trinket something to remind me of sil why the hell not i was grieving she sniffed hes so damn gone you try filling hollow hours im sorry like hell you are youre toying with me right now what im trying to do is figure out who murdered the man you loved and a whole bunch of other people who says its the same person and even if it is talking about the money isnt going to accomplish anything its what i said small donations fifteen thousand worth i said it adds up less confidence in her voice are the bills of different denominations no answer its easy enough to check twenties okay she said its all in twenties kind of a coincidence so at some point sil changed it into twenties to make the count easier if he went to the bank to change bills why not simply deposit the money she shot to her feet my hands are clean forget all that catholic crap i was never into selfflagellation i said sil was seen taking an envelope from a man what in the parking lot behind his office seen by who a witness who i cant say she smirked one of those anonymous sources like the government always happens to find a witness with no motive to lie so you say it may not have been ominous but it happened alma someone delivered a donation in person big deal i described the man with the blond hair and the reconstructed face she said sounds like your typical la guy you have no idea who he is why would i goodbye and dont spend it all in one place i said one more thing with you people theres always one more thing us people as in representatives of the state i said everythings political youd better believe it does that include the knife in sils gut her arms turned rigid oh youre a beaut coming across all sensitive but theres a cruel streak you bring out at will im trying to get to the truth i thought we might share that goal truth is bullshit truth changes with context context is exactly what im looking for alma if you want to canonize sil fine but if you can open your mind long enough to consider an alternative we might actually find out who murdered him if shed walked out i wouldnt have been surprised she stood there what alternative consider the possibility that sil was paid off nothing illegal maybe just to bend the rules i think whoever paid him also lured himsomeone who knew the marsh and believed sil had to be silenced rich bastards she said everything is political any rich bastards in particular how about those movie crooks for a start money corrupts and they have obscene amounts of money they funded stm but ill bet theyve never stopped lusting for the land sil took their money but he despised them would sil have gone out in the middle of the night for one of their lackeys silence i said who did he trust alma no one sil wasnt a trusting person im the only one he confided in and even then he could be guarded about what he was moody could close up like a turtle just be unreachable but that doesnt mean he sold out that damn bunch of mud was everything to him besides what would anyone pay him off for i dont know well neither do i goodbye i popped the case took out the jewel box pressed it in her hand she shook her head violently but didnt push it away depending on how things shake out i may be able to get you the money as well i dont wawhy the hell are you doing this who the hell are you just another guy with a soft upbringing she studied me if i was wrong about that sorry but it doesnt change facts on the ground youre a government agent nothing to apologize for ive been pressuring you yes you have her hand closed around the box its been hell i need to get through it as i walked her out she studied each room we passed when we got to the vw she said the only possible thing sil couldve been no that doesnt make sense that wouldnt be worth fifteen thousand stinking dollars tell me anyway theres another way into the marsh clear on the opposite end of the official entry on the west side it was intended as the original entry but too many plants grew there and sil insisted it not be touched if it was up to him the entire place would be off limits to visitors where on the west side dead center its overgrown impossible to see from the street but if you push your way through theres a gate sil kept it padlocked he liked to go therehis secret place sometimes he took me there blushing its beautiful huge willows high reeds little brackish subponds where tadpoles and frogs colonize lots of birds because its closer to the ocean how often did sil go there i dont know he only took me three four times always at night wed spread a blanket be looking up at the stars and hed say this is a billiondollar view if people only knew but that was rhetoric whod pay fifteen thousand for a picnic spot and why would that put sil in danger she shook her head youre chasing your tail thanks anyway for letting my mind run wild its called creativity i said lord knows we could use more chapter i sped to the marsh and searched for the secret entry the preserves western border was a dense block of eucalyptus and willows a good twenty feet thick fenced by fourfoothigh metal pickets designed to look like wood it took me three passes to spot the notch in the trees several yards of branches in my face before the second fence came into view cedar stakes padlocked as alma reynolds had said but only three feet high and climbing over was no big deal once on the other side i endured another green gauntlet holding back limb after limb as i treaded on uneven leafstrewn dirt slow going as i checked for evidence of human intrusion ten yards in i found it shoe prints mostly blurred but one crisp impressiona mansized foot ringed by dots foliage whispered above still water cattails shimmered as a great blue heron huge serpentnecked with the deadeyed mien of a preyseeking pterodactyl rose awkwardly flapping its way to the ocean by the time it disappeared it had achieved grace several seconds of silence passed before something scurried i kneeled and got close to the shoe prints the dots seemed unusual but i was no expert i took pictures with my cell phone thought about what to do next all i could see up ahead was more green trees tall enough to obscure the sky and shade the ground black maybe this place was nothing more than a secret garden fifteen thousand worth of clandestine picnic spot not as absurd as it sounded in places like la and new york nothing stokes lust quicker than the threat of rejection its why the manufacturers of velvet ropes will never go out of business why costumed fools wait for hours on earlymorning sidewalks sweettalking bouncers and risking juniorhigh humiliation in order to score overpriced drinks and braindamaging dance track in places like la some people fill their blackberrysand their headswith two lists the places i go the places i shun the part of the marsh i avoid because everyone goes there and its so yesterday but theres this special spot baby way more gorgeous chance brandt remembered the blond man whod paid off sil duboff from a fundraiser an affair populated by people who cared about the ocean or pretended to no reason to doubt mr bondos intentions maybe the money would boil down to nothing more than a rich mans chumpchange payoff for private nights beneath the stars but then why had duboff been lured to his death gutted and dumped another body in the marsh the public side i stood there not sure if this beautiful place was malignant id print the shoeprint photos email them to milo for what it was worth the next morning at eight his recorded voice was a drowsy greeting reed managed to follow wallenburg but it didnt lead anywhere were lunching at noon tomorrow the usual if you have any sudden insights i will save room for dessert get the photos shoes he said probably duboffs but ill send them to someone who knows about that this time reed kept pace with milo forking food into his mouth like a combine career development when i sat he put down his fork wallenburg lives in a gated part of the palisades off mandeville canyon closest i could get was outside the gates i thought i might be on to something when she was still home at eleven then a rental chevy followed by a hertz van pulls up to the guardhouse and soon after the van leaves with two guys instead of one fifteen minutes later wallenburg drives out in the chevy im thinking she got herself a cover car this is going to be interesting she heads for mar vista parks in front of a house that is definitely below her tax bracket im thinking the bastards crib finally she uses her own key to get in comes out ten minutes drives away now ive got a choice knock on the door or keep tailing her he loosened his tie i go for the knock no one answers i try the back same deal drapes are drawn now im wondering if wallenburg spotted me and played me maybe its just a rental property she owns and shes off to his real crib milo said it was the right choice kiddo if you say so i said youre sure huck doesnt live in the house nextdoor neighbor says a family named adams lives there good people quiet i showed hucks picturewith and without hair no one recognized him he traced a foursided figure on the table welcome to square one i said the adams family how bout that another time i might be thinking its funny any idea what size family i didnt ask why if a woman and a girl around ten live there it could be brandeen loring the baby huck saved and her grandmother anita brackle and huck could still be a guest despite what the neighbors say no big deal sneaking him in after dark he keeps a low profile whos going to know hes there milo said what gets you from point a to anita harboring a fugitive its a theory and a minor one at that but in some circles hucks a really popular guy i recounted my talk with larry brackle and kelly vander reed said wife number one huh that clears up how huck got the job with simon but not much else you yourself said huck wasnt anitas favorite person it was larry who took him in but anita changed her mind about him conversion sometimes leads to the strongest faith milo said have to be more than strong to take him in with a kid in the house a kid hes viewed as saving i said for all we know hucks had regular contact with brandeenlike that chinese proverb save someone and theyre your responsibility forever thats also probably a big part of debora wallenburgs motivation reed said everyone saving everyone meanwhile weve got bodies you really see huck inspiring that kind of devotion kelly and larry are convinced hes a saint typical psychopath said milo guys ready to run for office reed scratched his crew cut resumed eating i said even if ms adams isnt anita she could be someone else huck knows from rehab misery loving company can lead to some pretty tight bonds if wallenburg wasnt playing you she went there for a reason the drapes couldve been drawn for a reason milo said if hucks got a network of rehab buddies there could be safe houses all over the city reed said hero something made him turn toward the restaurants front door he clenched his knife aaron fox walked toward us customtailored as ever in a black rawsilk suit seagreen shirt yellow pocket square nothing jaunty in his step reed got up and faced him bad time were busy no doubt bro but not too busy for me fox sank down next to his brothers empty seat his eyes were sharp but pink rimmed the sclera hed shaved carelessly sported nicks and bumps in the tight dark shadows below his jawline milo said long night aaron lots of long nights i could get screwed for talking to you said fox might as well be monetary and not legal reed said got yourself in a bit of a professional fix fox frowned is it my breath bro yeah its a fix little conundrums are part of the job but this is different may i he reached for a water glass drank greedily poured another and finished that reaching for the chapati he broke off a piece ground it between finger and thumb repeated within seconds hed created a pile of bread crumbs moe reed feigned boredom as fox smoothed the pile fox wiped his hand on a napkin plucked his pocket square and arranged it in three points when simone vander hired me to research huck she said it was her idea period i didnt have her permission to contact any of her fathers business associates i told her thats not how i usually work she wants library science she could do it herself reed said your mission should you choose to accept it give it a rest moses fox turned to milo simone said hiring me was more than wanting to know about huck she promised a much bigger jobrooting out a financial conspiracy against her dad by his minionsher word when i asked why she said despite being a good businessman he got taken advantage of all the time a deeppockets thing milo said which minions in particular bothered her every one of daddys lawyers accountants and financial managers she viewed them as leeches falling over themselves to rack up billable hours the lawyers in particular she thought were shady alston weir said milo weir plus all his associates she told me she wouldnt be surprised if the entire firm was in cahoots to loot the estate maybe even with huck that sounds paranoid a bit but with megarich folk you never know the incentives are always there ive seen plenty of predatory employees reed said did she suspect huck of any specific financial screwiness fox shook his head with him it was more his creepy personality worming his way into the family kissing kelvins ass in particular she claimed he spoiled the kid then when selena showed up dead she got downright terrified and called me reed said so far im not hearing much thats new whats new moses is she lied to me starting with there being another job finishing with her deadbeating me she hasnt paid a penny of her bill shut me out completelyno email replies no return of my phone calls my bad i didnt take a retainer figured it for a quickie which it was and were not talking a megabill still i like to be paid so now were your collection agency milo said how much are we talking about aaron four grand give or take for internet research not bad the results of which i passed on to you guys then again maybe you would have found it on your own milo said were grateful aaron is there a punch line approaching the horizon oh yeah said fox she annoyed me which can be a real bad idea my philosophy is go after every single penny really bulldog it you cant have word getting out youre a pussy so i go after her starting with a records check that turned up some interesting stuff bunch of drug busts when she was eighteen to twentytwo meth and weed daddys lawyers got her off with probation anything since not officially but wait theres more folks she lied about more than the big job lying seems to be her mo when i met her she spun me stories about being a singer a ballerina a financial analyst for a hedge fund reed said with us it was just teacher i said remedial teacher fox said that too supposedly she just loves the tots but her real love is the ballet milo wiped his lips tiny dancer huh she claimed to have been in the company of the new york ballet until she hurt her foot and lost a promising career the company never heard of her he permitted himself a smile so much for my reading people so now my adrenals are buzzing and i start watching her house check out her garbage milo said fun part of the job foxs grin took on wattage but oh so educational what i learn is she lives on air im talking diet soda and special kand not much cereal at that she also goes through a helluva lot of prescription decongestants and ritalin now im thinking back to those meth busts she just switched to legal speed i said ritalin could fit with the specialed fantasy if she had learning disabilities herself maybe she fantasizes about a power role the drugs also effective in weight control if you dont mind the risks same for the decongestants and she did have a role model for her eating disorder who i glanced at milo he nodded i described kelly vanders struggle with anorexia like mother like daughter said fox when i met her i didnt think much of it skeletal is half the girls on the westside yeah sure that all makes sense reed said so shes an undernourished skank what does it have to do with huck im setting the stage moses shes a liar and a possible addict which says personality problems right which could explain what else i found in her garbage can framed photo of her dad her stepmom and her brother all cut up the glass all smashed he raised the water glass as if toasting she trashed her family guys literally i said black ties for dad and son red gown for mom thats the one it was sitting on her coffee table she called our attention to it thats my brother kelvin hes brilliant well now hes brilliant and defaced said fox literally sweet little countenance sliced up into confetti like someone took a razor to it to top it off the damn thing was wrapped in toilet paper dont want to spoil your appetite but not clean toilet paper theres your glamorous side of the job milo said the picture was a prop for our benefit one happy family reed said now she doesnt need it anymore because aw jesus the vanders havent been heard from in two weeks fox reached for another chapati but wait theres more call in now and you get the ginzu knife and the automatic veeblefetzer given the real bad feeling i was getting from the little deadbeating bitch i decided to keep shadowing her first day she did more of the usual richgirl shit shopping massage more shopping which is weirdly carefree for someone who claims to be worried about her family second day starts off the same way neiman marcus little walk up two rodeo she checks out the jewelry at tiffany judith ripka buys sunglasses at porsche design then she drives two blocksbecause shes an la girlto an office building on wilshire and canon lobby directory says its the law firm daddy uses same guys she badmouthed to me and shes visiting them i sit across the street and wait for her to leave when she does its not in her beemer shes a passenger in a mercedes some guys at the wheel they make a beeline to the peninsula simones pal tips the doorman big enough to leave the car in front two hours later the two of them come out with that goofy nolongerhorny look meanwhile ive run the tags on the mercedesdont ask me how okay milo said perish the thought fox said comes back to alston weir attorneyatmischief such a greedy scumbag she wouldnt trust him as far as she could throw him meanwhile hes her lunchhour fuckbuddy reed said is weir bald you think moses is there any other good reason to saddle himself with a big old mess of phony pissyellow fakeo hair im talking halloween guys blond dust mop what i find weird is the guy knows how to dress zegna suit ricci tie magli shoes threads like that and he blows it with a bad rug go figure maybe hes got an exaggerated selfimage said milo meaning thinks hes cuter than he really is cause of all the bondo in his face fox frowned yeah that too so you know all this i just blew off a client for nothing no answer oh thats just great you guys sit there and let me spin my wheels to his brother having fun moses reed smiled but no irony no resentment maybe even something resembling brotherly affection what fox demanded we knew a little aaron you just made it a lot the four of us left the restaurant fox and reed walked side by side seemed on the verge of conversation but neither brother initiated milo said did you happen to hold on to simones garbage aaron lucky for you im a bit of a pat rack milo moses can verify his side of the room looked like some ashram mine was beaucoup toys reed said beaucoup junk fox said shall i have it picked up or would you like me to deliver well come to you aaron and thanks figured i had to the girls bad news any way to keep my part quiet well do our best fox fooled with his pocket square and eyed his porsche meaning no milo said you know how it goes aaron depends where it leads meanwhile do us another favor and hold off on trying to collect your bill from simone for how long until its no longer an issue meaning never meaning until its no longer an issue now said fox youre sounding like a lieutenant pulling alston buddy weirs drivers license took seconds fortyfive years old blond and blue betacarotene tan coating a heavy face that alternated between tootight and losing the battle with gravity the bored insolent expression of a man with better things to do than pose for the clerk no one had questioned the biological authenticity of the jananddean wig no criminal record but a bar association complaint still pending had been filed two years ago over misappropriation of funds locating chance brandt ate up over an hour we finally found the boy at the westwood house of a friend named bjorn loftus parents on vacation gussiedup suvs in the driveway earsplitting music and marijuana fumes blowing through the doorway as bjorn gaped he jabbered improbable lies until milo told him to bring chance out now both boys staggered out moments later chance smirked again reed said recognize this guy yeah thats him who dude i saw giving the envelope to duboffjackoff bobbing his head and waiting for laughter that never came mister look at me im all chances eyes clouded as he groped for a punch line sign your name to the photo said milo chances scrawl was unsteady reed had him repeat it bjorn loftus let out a dope giggle now youre gonna have to testify dude chance said no way and looked to us for confirmation milo said well be in touch hear that dude youre gonna get touched dude chance said not unless theyre gay dude and lurched back inside bjorn said dude milo studied the signed photo my head feels like its gonna split open time for advil and a sitdown on what we know and what we dont i said my house is ten minutes away and ive got an ice pack for that neck i said head not neck i was talking whiplash from getting jerked around he and reed laughed yeah lets boogie over to the white house hes got a nice place moses cute dog too maybe she can make sense of all this i said theres additional incentive fifteen thousand worth chapter reed and milo sat on the leather couch no one bounced blanche nestled in milo s lap she smiled he didnt notice all eyes on the money reed said when did reynolds bring that to you yesterday i said i was about to tell you when aaron came in milo said fifteen grand aint picnic pay maybe its time for the anthropologists death dogs too blanches ears perked no offense reed said weir and simone have been paying duboff for access to the west side for something nasty he finds out what their bribes are for and gets killed i doubt he knew hed have been screaming i said but they couldnt risk his finding out guy has free rein to the marsh if anyones going to find it he is what if he did find out then tried to make some extra dough milo said leaning on a serial killer for more dough is pretty stupid a nighttime meet no less i think the lure was just what duboff was told ive got something to make you a hero and the caller had credibility because he knew about the secret part of the marsh reed thought that makes sense loo duboff brought reynolds because he wasnt expecting trouble guy started thinking he was the marsh god but no matter what aaron found it doesnt let huck off well put detective reed okay im gonna try to get some speed on that shoeprint analysis hucks the one who rabbited loo more i think about it more i like the idea of all of them being in on it three nasty musketeers then why would simone hire aaron to focus on huck she and weir used huck but planned on ditching him all along weakest link said milo criminal history drug issues frequents hookers yeah that fits i said killing hookers makes me wonder if they tailored the murders to huck because hes a longtime john that blood in his drain could be real or a plant said reed but either way he still smells dirty which leads us to another issue said milo if hes expendable giving him a chance to split is a real bad idea reed stared at him they didnt and were chasing down a dead man or hucks a lone psycho killer and simone just happens to be an angry girl with a penchant for lying reed said cutting up her family ripping off her brothers face doc i said its offthescale rage and the family is missing milo said okay lets assume for the moment that simone weir and huck did collude the obvious motive would be getting rid of the vanders reed said hundred million worth of motive hell yeah then how do the women in the marsh figure in i said like we said before misdirects if the vanders were found murdered with no prior context attention wouldve shot straight to the money meaning an unwelcome focus on simone as sole survivor but with huck nailed as a lust murderer first the vanders could be seen as collateral damagevictims of a psychopaths final rampage that fits the staging of the crimes concealing the other bodies but making sure selena was found so she could lead us to the vanders that storage unit said reed board games we are being played milo said those bones being acidwashed and prepped means the other women were killed at leisure maybe warehoused somewhere then dumped sequentially reed said for all we know they were on dry ice in the unit i said one question the evil bald guy huck or weir minus his wig milo said you have any feelings on that could go either way but two guys who just happen to be skinned could be part of setting up huck like nguyen said alex its not that rare of a look but the more i think about it the more hucks shaping up at least a partial patsy if huck murdered a bunch of people and was smart enough to leave no trace why would he rabbit and make himself an obvious suspect i said maybe fear overcame good sense or he caught on that weir and simone had plans to end his future with that much money at stake he had to know hed never be an equal partner reed said yeah thirtythree million is a bit high for wet work but he goes along with it anyway because killing is his thing or simone seduced him another kind of threeway why not i said but huck finally figured out he was expendable and ran maybe he somehow learned about aarons investigation or he just got nervous when your investigation took on steam milo said simone heaps it on to aaron hucks bigtime weird shes always been afraid of him huck doesnt help himself by actually being weird i wouldnt be surprised if his corpse shows up at a strategic momentapparent suicide accompanied by a nice neat confession note and a tipoff to where the vanders are buried a whole bunch of cases close simultaneously and simones one of the richest girls in la milo rubbed his face hundred million wars have been fought over less reed said if huck pulled a real rabbit weir and simone have to be freaking out i said maybe thats why simone hacked up the picture milo said low frustration tolerance if thats the case she and weir are working on plan b right now get rid of any evidence that incriminates them gussy up the case against huck my head tightened thats why duboff had to die he could link weir to the marsh reed said oh man these people are from another planet milo said we forgot something if huck was dead wallenburg wouldnt be shielding him i said maybe she thinks hes alive anyone can send a text message so whos the adams family she just visited creepy and kooky folk wallenburg just happens to know boot up your computer alex reed was faster than milo on the keyboard and he knew the access codes within seconds hed pulled up county records anita brackle née loring had given marriage a third shot two years ago civil ceremony in van nuys court the lucky groom wilfred eugene adams black male sixtytwo years old home address in mar vista his name pulled up three duis the final conviction six years previous reed said probably another rehab romance milo said rdatedotcom theres a business opportunity for you okay lets check it out were holding off on the dogs and the anthropologists not at all call dr wilkinson tiny smile while youre at it she can also check out the western edge of the marsh reeds jaw dropped milo said goes with the job kiddo what does long periods of futility livened by moments of chagrin reed made the call as milo and i waited in the unmarked as he headed for us he looked defeated milo said maybe she turned him down for a second date the young detective got in back everything okay moses not in left a message something on your mind text messaging i shouldve thought of that what cause youre the technogeneration and im the poster boy for horse and plow and just gave up on my betamax whats that a brand of buggy whip a dodge van sat in the driveway of wilfred and anita loring brackle adamss bungalow if wilfred was home he wasnt advertising the fact anitas voice was a gritty drill bit that threatened to pierce the locked door from behind you go away maam i will not open my door and you cant force me to open it fourth time shed recited the mantra milo said we really can return with a warrant then youd really better do that milo leaned on the bell when he stopped anita adams laughed the sound was rocks in a tumbler you see humor in the situation maam youre playing the bell like some sort of brainwashing tactic why dont you go get some of that rap music and blast it all over the street see how popular that makes you with the neighbors specially when it turns out you had no good cause to milo and i returned to the unmarked her taunts reached nearly to the curb sweet lady he said gosh i wish she was my mom we sat in the car and watched the little frame house i drank cold coffee and he swigged red bull five minutes in he phoned moe reed liz wilkinson and three grad students interning at the bone lab were on their way to the western edge of the marsh insufficient daylight prevented a comprehensive search but theyd do a spot examination wilkinson suggested a helicopter sweep and sure the dogs were fine nothing back on the shoe print milo clicked off just as a car pulled up behind us steelcolored maybach debora wallenburg got out and looked up and down the street before approaching the unmarked aqua chanel suit silver hair pulled back severely lots of diamond glint tired of the chevy counselor wallenburg flinched but recovered quickly youre following me charming have a chat with your elusive client recently wallenburg laughed here goes the tape loop whats funny counselor is your viewing the situation as a yukfest i view it as theater of the absurd the way you claim to feel about huck id expect you to be taking it seriously your alleged case your clients demise wallenburgs cheek muscles twitched courtroom training delayed her response what are you talking about whens the last time you actually spoke to ol travis wallenburg cocked a hip in a display of mellow tension around the eyes blew the performance just like i thought said milo is this the moment where your artful goading causes me to blurt out some crucial piece of information lieutenant its the moment that i tell you i know huck didnt call you got a text message and assumed no offense counselor but maybe its an age thing digital naïveté youre mad said wallenburg more like peeved i meant in the mental illness sense insult registered digested soon to be excreted my clients that concern you at this time are mr and mrs adams she said they request that you cease harassing them thought you were corporate said milo how does that get you to front for a couple of workingclass alkies who just happen to know travis from dryout camp okaay said wallenburg now we switch to class warfare and denigration of people with the courage to recover my dads shirt was blue and ive known a few tipplers but the issue aint politics its murder wallenburg didnt answer hell said milo whats a few strangled women with their hands hacked off to a courthouse vet like you thats repellent thing is said milo youre not even doing good lawyering here im not after your client as the prime bad guy im figuring he was used and tossed its in both our interests to get to the real evil debora wallenburg shook her head diamond earrings swung youre talking nonsense then prove it if hucks still respirating bring him in he cooperates everyone stays friendly wallenburg clicked her tongue hopeless stop harassing the adamses theyre good people and youve got no reason to be bothering them last i heard the departments legal costs had climbed precipitously a girl named sue said milo what grounds ill think of something wallenburg turned to leave hucks a foot soldier counselor i want the officers you people said wallenburg everythings war or at least armed conflict prove hucks alive by bringing him in hes innocent you know that because wallenburg began walking away the key is timing deb once we get a warrant for this house theres no telling youre in fantasyland mile talk about no grounds tell that to judge stern lisa was a classmate of mine then you know how she feels about victims rights and how she views attempts by officers of the court to meddle in extracurricular matters wallenburg ran a manicured finger across her lips what a nice man you are she got in the maybach and sped off i said when did you call judge stern must be two years ago he said gang shooting slam dunk easy paper the science of war more like marching in the dark at four fortyseven pm an la unified school bus pulled up to the house a blond girl in a red tshirt jeans and sneakers got out and headed for the door ten or so slight and sticklimbed she labored under the weight of a mammoth backpack i said baby brandeen more to hear the sound of it than to inform him makes me misty lad they grow up so quickly before the girl reached the door it opened a short heavy whitehaired woman reached out and drew her inside instead of closing she took the time to glare at us a man materialized behind her tall black bearded weary eyes even at this distance wilfred adams said something to his wife she snapped back flipped us off slammed the door milo said maybe huck is alive shes sure protecting something his phone rang again moe reed checking in a second time from the marshs western edge no obvious signs of disturbance but the same cadaver dog had arrived and was looking interested pretty place said reed got that garden of eden thing going on milo said find me the snake he lit up a cigar had puffed twice when debora wallenburgs maybach roared toward us from the north the car pulled alongside the unmarked a tinted window lowered silently wallenburgs hair was loose shed refreshed her makeup but couldnt hide fatigue you missed me said milo oh i pine maybe we can play nice but first some ground rules i know the law allows you to lie like a conniving sociopathic bastard to a suspect but i wouldnt recommend trying it with an attorney of record the client being i need you to be straight with me i am nothing if not sincere what you said beforenot seeing travis as the prime evil was that utter bullshit no im serious lieutenant i need your assurance that were operating in the same context plus there can be absolutely no heavyhandedness heavy as in swat nonsense property damage scaring a small child my pledge in return is full disclosure of i cannot specify at this time milo blew a smoke ring then a second that pierced the first debora wallenburg said you need to trust me he rested his head on the back of the seat when and where those details will follow in due time may i assume dr delaware will be there huck needs mental health consultation id feel better if hes involved that okay with you doctor id never been introduced sure she said mal worthy and trish mantle and len krobsky belong to my tennis club naming three heavyhitter family lawyers give my regards they all like you to milo so were on ill call you slow wink or maybe ill text chapter travis huck trembled veins wormed across his temples crossed his hairline invaded the dense black stubble capping his skull eyes so deepset they vanished in all but the strongest light stared at nothing his cheeks couldve been hollowed by melon scoops the sag of his face was a history of its own debora wallenburg had bought him a brandnew shirt skyblue crisp cotton sharp boxcreases he looked like a candidate for parole shed had her desk moved forward several feet positioned huck and herself behind the wooden barrier mary cassatts mother and baby looked down with jarring serenity the kind lighting wallenburg had choreographed failed to calm her client he rocked in his chair sweated maybe hed fare worse under the fluorescence of a police interview room maybe nothing would make a difference it was four am wallenburgs text message had roused milo at two fifteen and hed called me twenty minutes later a sahara of silent streets turned the ride to santa monica into a motorsprint but for a hyphen of amber upperfloor windows wallenburgs office building was a granite spade excavating a starless sky as the unmarked pulled near the sublot a mesh partition slid open and a uniformed guard stepped forward id please milo s badge was exactly what the guy expected elevators over there park wherever you like waving at a sea of vacant slots the only vehicle in sight a coppercolored ferrari her sporty wheels said milo hope its not a game from the backseat moe reed squelched a yawn and rubbed his eyes im ready to play debora wallenburg touched hucks hand he slid away from her she sat up straighter every silver hair in place fulltilt makeup diamonds courtroom confidence wavered only when she glanced at huck he remained in his own world had yet to make eye contact wallenburg said whenever youre ready travis a minute passed thirty additional seconds moe reed crossed his legs as if sparked by the movement huck said the only person i killed was jeffrey wallenburg frowned that was an accident travis huck tilted his head away from her as if offended by the characterization i think about jeffrey a lot before i wasnt able to i said before huck sucked in breath i used to live in a dreamstate now im sober and awake but its not always good too many things to think about i suggested bad things sir travis said wallenburg huck shifted and caught a faceful of caressing light his pupils were dilated his forehead an oil slick some sort of rash had spread around his nostrils tiny berries sprouting in a pallid field bad dreams fill me im the monster travis you are nothing close to a monster huck didnt answer how could you not feel stigmatized travis with people prejudging you all the time pretending to talk to him but addressing the jury debora his voice lowered to a whisper youre the rare bird who flies freely i dont know what i am what you are is a good person travis the average german pardon man in the crowd said huck comfortable in his suit and his good shoes oblivious to the stench travis we need to concentrate on dachau debora rwanda darfur slave ships cambodia melting deserts average man sits in a café and eats his cream cakes he knows which way the wind blows the stench blows into his nose but he pretends you choose to fly freely debora the crowd chooses a cage i chose a cage travis this isnt an issue of war and huck swiveled toward her it is debora war breathes in all of us raid the neighboring pack raze the village eat the young in a good world to be human is to be unanimal you made the choice to be human i travis were here for you to tell them what you know sniffed the wind and stench blew through my head i allowed it to happen debora before wallenburg could retort i said you allowed the murders huck clapped his hands on the desk as if bracing for a fall long knobby fingers pressed on leather slid back leaving snailtrails of perspiration he worried his sagging cheek wallenburg said travis you had absolutely noth i couldve stopped it i dont deserve to live he bared his wrists ready for shackles debora wallenburg pushed one hand down huck grew rigid i said when did you know itheres no beginning said huck it was just in here here here hereherehere slapping his head his cheek his chest his gut increasing the force with each blow you sensed violence was coming kelvin he said lowering his head he mumbled to leather i took him on walks we didnt talk much kelvins quiet we saw deer lizards eagles coyote kelvin likes listening to the ocean says the oceans a ground bass the universe hums like a gregorian chant i said and kelvin is huck stared at me i said the familys dead huck sobbed raggedly a mustache of snot formed over his crooked lips debora wallenburg offered him a tissue and when he didnt take it she wiped him i said how do you know where are they he wailed you have no idea where they are i thought she loved them i thought she was capable of love one hand opened as if panhandling his palm was scrubbed clean his nails gnawed stubby when the fingers rotated i saw scars on his knucklesglossy white what appeared to be old burns i said by she you mean no answer who travis he mouthed the word sound followed an instant later as if digitally delayed simone moe reeds eyes narrowed milo s were shut and his hands rested on his belly to the casual observer sleeping i knew better no snoring i said youre saying simone killed the vanders each word made huck shudder thats your theory travis or do you know it for a fact its noti knowfrom what shei thought she was vulnerable notbecause she hurt herself hurt herself how wounds you cant see unless its a secret game simone cuts herself nod she tastes her own blood when we met her we saw no visible wounds she chooses the secret places licking his lips you know that because his head lurched forward a cold raw sound made its way past clenched lips i said you and simone were intimate strangled laughter he supported himself on the desktop again stupid dream she had other ideas wallenburg prompted tell them exactly what you told me about her travis silence tell them how she seduced you travis huck shook his head furiously that makes it sound romantic it wasnt romantic it was a a a tell them or i will huck pleaded debora i told them youd give them facts travis they wont believe you unless you give them facts several moments passed huck said iitshe came over to the big house no one was home id been watching her because shes beautiful physically talking to her was out of the question shes the daughter im hired help but she talked to me it was like she knew my brain from the inside out being with her was like opening a window i said easy for her nod she made herself small we stared at the ocean she came into my room rested her head on my she showed me her wounds cried into my shirt it was a revelation the geography of flesh holding her as she cried he rubbed glossy knuckles you knew about the geography of flesh he stared at leather i said for her its blades for you its fire crooked smile i used to need punishment in jail after waiting for wallenburg to scold him she said nothing im sorry debora being free brought back pictures of jeffrey i didnt want to worry you to me i needed to feel something i said what exactly does simone use everything razors kitchen knives a box cutter she has guns gifts from simon when he married nadine nadine said please no guns in the house simone holds them talks about them expensive guns she puts the barrels in her mouth makes believe she put her hands down her throat to vomit sometimes she gives herself a sore throat coughs blood she loves her own taste reed exhaled silently milo continued to slump barrel chest heaving wallenburg looked at him then at me i said what else are you going to tell us about simone huck said the first time she showed me fresh stigmata thats what she called themthe first time i held her then we she shaved my head told me i was her priest my bones were beautiful i thought the dream was thinking i could help her how long did the two of you have a relationship his eyes rolled back snapped back into place like slotmachine cherries an eternity i said give us something more concrete debora wallenburg said two months it ended around six months ago that true travis nod how did you learn simone wasnt the person you thought she was i stalked her reeds shoulders bunched milo didnt budge wallenburg said poor choice of words just give them the facts travis huck said i stalked her debora you had concerns so you began watching her i said you followed simone i called for a week but she didnt answer i was confused the last time we were together she said kind things then all of a sudden nothing i started to worry she was hurt then i thought maybe shes waiting for me to do something spontaneous she told me spontaneous turned her on i needed to loosen up i was afraid to improvise surprises arent i dont like them simone knew i didnt like to leave the script so it would be a surprise you made a spontaneous visit to her house just once when three months ago said wallenburg huck said simon and nadine and kelvin were in ojai for the weekend they went because kelvin wanted to meet nikrugskythe composer the house was quiet simone wasnt calling back the quiet turned into old desires came back for heat and pain i found matches lit them but didnt broil myself i called a sponsor we talked but not about what was really in my head the quiet kept getting louder i said go go go be spontaneous drove to malibu canyon and picked flowers made a bouquet tied it up with grocery twine poured grape juice into a wine bottle wrapped it with a ribbonblack her favorite color i took water biscuits from the pantry two boxes havershams from england licensed to the royal family simone doesnt eat much more than water biscuits but when she does ive seen her go through two boxes later she expels them her throat bleeds it looks like strawberry porridge i said you went over to her house i wanted a loving surprise she didnt answer my knock i went out in back simone likes to be outside all kinds of weather she takes off her clothes outside is where she bleeds herself there are stains on her furniture teak furniture its a tiny backyard overgrown steep hillside in back a little gazebo where she sleeps before i got there i heard it simone and someone my brain understood but my legs kept moving i found a stalker spot watched there was no reason i already knew what was catching his breath he studied the ceiling i said what did you see licking each other cats grooming licking licking grooming moistening his own lips licking growling laughing talking brutality simone and long silence who was with her travis the wig give us a name him said huck thewigthesmileweirthelawyer a nightmare she told me she hated him he was corrupt stealing from simon she was going to tell simon i shouldnt do it she would do it shit would hit the fan teach those scumbags a lesson then wed be free but in the backyard licking no hatred except what they shared i said they shared hatred silence hatred of who travis hucks breathing quickened his eyes jumped who travis licking laughing that disgusting word what word gook nadine i said because shes asian they spewed it out like vomit gooklover gooksucker gookfucker gook bitch slanteyed gook scumspawn clenched fists turned burn scars into pearls my headhearing it i wanted to burn myself up went home found more matches soaked them in water called another sponsor tears filled his eyes i never told simon simone hates her family more than hatred said huck itshetheres no word for it had simone ever shown resentment about simon remarrying no no no no just the opposite she loved nadine nadine was smart stylish beautiful not like her mother i know kelly kellys good people but she wasnt there for simone okay i understand that we all understand that but simone claimed she loved nadine she said she wished nadine had raised her they hugged they kissed nadine treated simone like a sister when simone came to the house she played with kelvins hair beautiful hair she always said she kissed his cheeks so cute travis i love him travis a genius i love him travis hands of gold i love him travis hands of gold gold diamond platinum magic hands she said his music was pure love and his hands went straight to his soul no love that day in the backyard my world flamed said huck i crawled back in my cage wallenburg said you didnt say anything to the vanders because you had no proof why would anyone believe you huck smiled objection overruled travis i didnt say anything because im a coward thats ridiculous travis you have more courage than most i said she may be right moe reed arched a brow milo still didnt stir i said it was a tough choice travis lance the boil and hope you can dodge the pus stream or pray that it stays at the verbal level excuses said huck average german oh for gods sake travis said wallenburg were not here to be cosmic and philosophical these are legal matters there was absolutely no way for you to know what they had planned and you had absolutely no obligation to divulge what you heard one of milos eyes opened unless he was involved wallenburg said oh please have you been awake for the last ten minutes oh yeah heard a good story travis huck said its logical debora i killed someone i pay for sex be quiet travis i said lets talk about the other victims huck said three women sheralyn dawkins lurlene chenoweth demaura montouthe no flicker of recognition no tell whatsoever huck said i heard about them on the television thats when i ran why then what they did for a living i go to women like them i started to feel i knew them maybe i did do something did you sometimes its hard to know what i do i repeated the names he said no i dont think so wallenburgs teeth clenched travis that is not what you told me deb reed fished out three mug shots huck studied them for a long time shook his head wallenburg said he had nothing to do with it he panicked and fled i said have you ever picked up women near the airport no where do you cruise for them sunset strip why not the airport i have to stay close to home in case simon and nadine need me need you for what errands takeout from allnight placessometimes nadine gets hungry late at night sometimes i get a cd for kelvin at tower records on sunset used to it closed now i go to virgin both stores were minutes from where reed had found prostitutes who knew huck twentyfour seven availability i said its my job did simone know you frequented prostitutes tiny smile hard to decipher something funny said reed huck gave a start noit wasnt frequent i i occasioned i said did simone know i confessed to her why we were talking filling in dark spaces sharing secrets yes what dark spaces did simone fill tasting her blood needing to feel wanting the perfect body always feeling huge hating the mirror seeing lumps what did you tell her about prostitutes i said before her there were only women like that i said being with her was like landing on the moon new life new universe so discovering her with weir was huck clapped his hands together crashdown i glanced at milo back in shuteyed repose travis tell us about silford duboff clouded eyes who the guy who takes care of the bird marsh ive never been to the bird marsh never never i repeated duboffs name huck said am i supposed to know him im sorry lets talk about someone you do know selena bass huck seemed prepared for the question selena is how i knew for sure knew what simones hatred didnt stop at words you figured simone murdered selena selena came from simone came from her how simone found her said she did it for kelvin simone brought selena to the house finding a teacher for kelvin finding a friend whoguess whatis also a piano genius and a teacher simone called selena her friend they acted like friends how so happy skinny girls laughing said huck those low jeans they wear how do you know they werent friends simone told me later said she heard selena play piano at a party selena had magic hands golden hands just like kelvin shed be perfect for kelvin kelvin had a grumpy old teacher wanted to stop his lessons simone told selena she could make big money i shouldve known there was more more what the first time i was bringing in groceries and simones car pulled up shes got another girl with her theyre giggling i went inside they didnt when i came out to get more groceries they were looking at the ocean hands around each other simones hand went to selenas her butt selena and simone had a sexual relationship maybe this was before you and simone had a relationship yes it didnt make you wonder about what simones sexual preferences hucks eyes turned fiery i didnt care i said later after you were involved simone told you shed met selena at a party nod what did she say about the party just a party tea and cookies silence he said later i had ideas what kind of ideas in the backyard after the licking he got up and simone stretched on the teak lounge and wincing she had a razor blade he came back tasted her he brought things with him ropesbeadsbig huge plastic i turned from that didnt want to look but i could hear he said party time she said golden hands baby all were missing is her and the piano huck shook his head dripped sweat onto the desk debora wallenburg saw it let the spatter sit there i said party time meaning selena was into the same things looking to me for confirmation when you heard about selenas murder you developed a theory about what happened to her a feeling when we came to tell you about selena you didnt mention that feeling i was i didnt you put fog in my head finally it drifted out and i had the feeling i didnt know what to do without opening his eyes milo said you couldve picked up the phone wallenburg said and told you what he had an intuition milo favored her with an avuncular smile on whodunit cases counselor we take anything we can get oh sure you wouldve believed him huck said i was going to tell simon if i said if what i told anyone reed said if longest word in the dictionary i thought about it said huck telling simon but shes his daughter he loves her i do errands so you did nothing said reed no i i phoned him to hear his voice maybe his voice would tell me what to do he didnt answer i kept trying he didnt answer i emailed he didnt answer i switched to nadines email she didnt answer then i started worrying then those other women got i heard about them and said those are the women you go to i said so you ran i killed someone i pay for sex i knew selena everyone else is rich turning to wallenburg you told me to come back i disobeyed travis its not a matter of dis milo got up walked to the front of the desk focused on huck that the whole story pal yes sir some yarn put me back in a cage sir i deserve what you want to give me that so wallenburg shot to her feet thrust her arm between huck and milo that was not an admission of guilt milo said selena the hookers one big setup just to frame you convenient for gods sake cant you see it said wallenburg superficially hes the perfect scapegoat superficially look at his core a man who was railroaded but harbors no anger whos led a totally nonviolent lifewho saved a baby for gods sake i didnt save her debora i just lifted her from the sidewalk and shut up travis youve seen how brandeen looks at you if you hadnt found her that bastard mightve come back and beat her to death the way he beat her mother to death debora dont debora me travis its about time you got smart and started looking after yourself you were stupid to run stupid not to return when i told you to now youre being a total blithering idiot i life sucks fine we all get that travis but you are not to blame for this particular disaster and if you stick to the facts the police will believe you looking at milo he remained silent huck said i let it all happen debora you were their gofer travis you are not a cosmic watchdog if youd said anything negative about simone youd have lost your job and she wouldve remained free to charm her father and go about her plan what plan are we talking about said reed a hundredandthirtythreemilliondollar plan said wallenburg that girl would never have been deterred never milo said pretty precise figure wallenburgs smile was icy milo said if thats the case were talking about a real longterm plan killing prostitutes over a fifteenmonth period dumping them in sequence just to set up the vanders as a thrill kill were talking about a hundred thirtythree million worth of incentive lieutenant selenas murder got you focused on the vanders which led you to travis the three women made all of it look psychopathic that conniving little bitch spoonfed you travis given his history she knew youd put on your blinders garsh said milo can someone tell me the way to keystone a hundred and thirtythree million lieutenant a years worth of planning doesnt seem too much for that pot of gold be a great movie oscar for documentary lieutenant were supposed to buy it because of mr hucks feelings in here massaging the swell of his belly youre supposed to buy it because its true and it makes sense and you havent a shred of evidence tying travis to a single act of violence milo flashed his happywolf grin bent over the desk and put his face inches from hucks huck licked his lips wallenburg said theres no need for physical intimida travis i like your stories now tell me another one about what sir the blood we found in the drain of your bedroom sink hucks adams apple rose and fell i maybe i cut my hands i go off balance headaches maybe i got a cut and washed it got any scabs inspecting hucks hands nope clean huck said put me in a cage i dont care whats your blood type son o positive abs what we found in your drain huck turned white milo placed his paw atop hucks left hand hucks fingers clasped milos like a child wanting security tell us about ab son simon said huck its rare he always gets asked to donate looks like he donated some to your drain tell me another story son wallenburg said someone whod slaughter people in a calculated manner would have no problem planting blood in a damn drain simone had access to that houseill bet weir did tooof course he did given his relationship with simone all she had to do was give him a damn key and still gripping milos hand huck held out his free arm put me in a cage dont say another word travis milo said counselor looks like weve come to a sort of consensus get up please son were going to read you your rights and take you into custody i agree said huck wallenburg shot to her feet clamped her hands on hucks shoulders on what charges well start with a whole bunch of s go on from there her turn to tremble youre making a disastrous mistake reed said youre really committed to this guy what am i not seeing wallenburgs mouth formed a curse lieutenant our explicit agreement was that wed listen said milo we did now were arresting him wallenburgs mouth worked oh this is great so predictablei promise you itll be futile lieutenant and youd better make damn sure hes not abused the moment you walk out that door ill be drafting motions i wouldnt expect anything less maam please get up son huck complied please step around to this side of the desk out came the cuffs wallenburg said are you booking him at west la or downtown well hold him at west la until appropriate transportation can be arranged everything according to procedure said wallenburg talk about average germansyou damn well better put him on suicide watch im already dead said huck wallenburg raised a hand as if to slap him stared at her quivering fingers and let her arm flop thank you for everything debora said huck you she spat are a firstclass pain in the ass riding the elevator down to the sublot huck said you really had no choice reed said whys she so devoted to you huck blinked once she told me about volunteer work she does at animal shelters she cant have children youre her kid said reed no but once you save an animal in the shelter she said youre responsible for it youre one of her puppies huh huck smiled i think maybe i am the door opened milo took hold of hucks cuffed arm propelled him to the car anything else you want to tell us i dont think so you dont believe me anyway they teach you passivity in rehab huck exhaled lifes been long longer than i thought so its time to give up when theres something to do i do at this point theres nothing left i said not necessarily chapter milo stashed huck in an empty west la interview room took his belt and his shoelaces no booking no printing no mug shot just a tall cup of water a coarse blanket and a second patdown that produced nothing the first frisk in the hallway outside debora wallenburgs office had produced lint a seriously chewed blue bic pen three dimes an lax parking stub a yellow postit with a washington boulevard address wheres this travis internet café mar vista yes your link to the world silence you dont have any cash spent it debora was going to replenish no answer milo said you travel light friend shrug wheres your id i lost it sure you did you know who i am that we do milo waved the parking stub this gonna match to the one we found in simons lexus huck said im sorry for what leaving it there to mislead us kind of a stale scam pal sorry your brilliant idea or deboras the tooquick reply mine ill pay for the tow reed and i watched through oneway glass as milo stood behind huck then shifted facetoface huck braced himself on the back of the chair sit travis im okay sit anyway huck obeyed what else do you want to tell me travis cant think of anything sir milo waited huck said really sir okay sit a spelltemperature okay yes gets too cold youve got the blanket thank you milo left and joined us in the adjoining room a milky patch marred the glass on the other side dried sweat or some other body fluid hucks position placed the splotch directly above his head man under a cloud we watched as he sat there finally he walked to a corner and lay down placing one arm over his eyes he curled himself smaller than id have thought possible moe reed yawned nothing like an action film to start off the morning within seconds hucks mouth had fallen open and he was sleeping reed said pretty mellow for a guy supposedly all guilty and torn up i said or hes escaping reality maybe he got duped but you cant think hes totally clean i think his mind works differently isnt that the point doc hes a nut easy to prime i know the obvious suspects usually the right one but the way we were led straight to huck via your brother always bothered me hucks account of simones hatred for her family fits the mutilated pictures aaron found in her trash her lie about despising buddy weir also syncs with what aaron saw as does the fact that simone and weir are in a relationship blood and toys said reed some relationship i said sparse food in simones trash fits bulimia so do her upbringing and her body mass overall hucks account has the ring of truth and minus his wig buddy weir could be the bald guy selenas caretaker saw hes also a better fit than huck to the charming dominant man demaura montouthe described after meeting her at a sex party weir couldve known where selena lived through dating her or he found out from simone either way it would be easy to take her computer but make sure to leave the toys he found in her drawer reed said the bald guy could just as easily be huck the way he was talking about selenacoming in with simone giggling lowcut jeans to me that sounded like he lusted for both of them guy like that doesnt get it unless he pays for it coupla hotties show up his mind starts revving finally he cant take it and boom and one more thing doc hes growing his hair out perfect if he was planning to disappear which is something hes good at but he came in voluntarily because he knew we were closing in on him i said he says simone shaved his head perfect move if she was trying to provide cover for weir reed rubbed his crew cut he says everything depends on us believing him milo said weir generally wears his wig had it on when he paid off duboff thats another thing i said the payoff what motive would huck have to kill duboff when i mentioned duboffs name there was no recognition and i couldnt spot a tell weir on the other hand has a link to duboffpassed him cash in the parking lot had to be payoff for access to the secret garden fifteen grand for picnics and duboffs not suspicious pure la i said the vip room weir fit duboffs notion of a major donor beverly hills lawyer backs environmental causes duboff figures the guys racked up a lot of billable hours is spreading the joy given duboffs shoestring budget hed have been thrilled and likely to trust weir when weir said hed discovered something about the marsh murders the west side said milo okay something turns up there ill adjust my attitude reed said exactly till then i like huck i said i can be fooled as easily as anyone but i dont see huck as sufficiently dominant if hes been putting on a performance why not spin it so he ends up in the clear as in i never knew anything instead he told us he suspected impending violence didnt report it feels guilty the guy just about invited you to arrest him reed said that could be another ploy setting up a doublejeopardy thingwe charge him prematurely wallenburg plays lawyer games gets him out we cant touch him ever again milo watched huck sleep i can see wallenburg building a castle like that huck i dont know he really aint no smooth dude moe she coached him loo no doubt she did but theres a limit something about the guy he disappeared for years couldve evaded us a lot longer than he did the question is can we believe simones that bad of a girl i said at the risk of introducing psychology he smiled what a taste for paingiving and receivingis consistent with simones makeup reed said she cuts herself supposedly she cuts and starves herself grew up with an impaired mother had aspirations she couldnt achieve that could lead to a seriously distorted body image and emotional numbness sometimes people like that need extreme stimulation feel no pain feel no mercy either said milo were talking bigtime cruelty here alex aaron did find that photo reed muttered her not paying aaron was a bigtime mistake i said lets say simone met selena at a party ended up playing sex games with her and weir eventually introduced selena to her family it couldve started out as finding a friend a job and earning her fathers approval but later when she and weir devised their plan selena was the perfect victim reed said lives alone estranged from her family maybe some secrets of her own yeah guess so whoever killed selena used her as a lure the first three bodies were concealed but hers was advertised to the point of an anonymous call pinpointing her location id sure like to see simones and weirs phone records for the time of that call hucks too that would go a long way toward showing whos dirty we have any grounds for phone subpoenas loo ill call john at eight i said the bones in the box were another prompt if you didnt find them no loss if you did another step in the game also said milo playing with body parts coulda been fun that too reed said youre saying selena was basically a human flashlight directing us to the vanders who have vanished i said meanwhile simone hires aaron to educate us about huck milo said with huck in our headlights we realize the vanders are missing start thinking about wholesale psycho slaughter with ol travis as pol pot he obliges by rabbiting hell even if he never gets found suspicion doesnt fall on simone and weir and she steps into a hundred thirty mil hundred thirtythree said reed but whos counting i cant even imagine dough like that i said i bet simone can especially after weir clued her in on the size of her fathers estate my guess is the plan was hatched over a year agomaybe after they murdered and dumped demaura montouthe in a bondage game that went wrong that led to finding other street women and setting up the pattern reed said whos the boss simone or weir i dont know for weir its probably all about the money simone wants more milo said a hundred thirtythree huge ones isnt enough motive sure it is i said but what makes things really satisfying for simone is wiping out the competition were talking the ultimate plunder the interloper who horned in on daddy and his dough daddy too for abandoning her what about kelvin competing heir and too damn talented i said a genius who gives concerts meanwhile simone cant hold on to a job which brings us to the severed hands and the bodies facing east theoretically they could also be misdirectssimulating a lust serial but why choose those particular trademarks weve got to be talking symbolic value reed said kelvins golden hands i can see simone seething about that on long cold nights the right hand plays the melody shes ending the concert reed said and facing east is looking at asia like you said if hucks telling the truth simones contempt has racial overtones milo said the gword lovely gal our simone reed said if youre right and shes basically erasing the new family any chance her own mothers in on it i dont think so kellys sad but basically passive and she adores huck evil little girl said milo palled up with a greedy lawyer redundant said reed you dont admire ms wallenburg moses i admire her cars how long before she starts pulling strings to spring huck we book him on multiple s forget strings hes remanded milo peered through the smudged glass hucks mouth had shut but he hadnt shifted position reeds cell phone chirped a check of the number brightened his face but he squelched the reaction turned almost comically serious hi really oh boy let me write it down whats that sure afterward yeah good blushing pardon glance at milo depends on what the boss says um me too yeah bye milo said let me guess dr wilkinson has nice news for us plus she wants indian for lunch again reeds blush deepened she got there early with her interns they used spotlights the color drained from his face dogs found four more bodies loo who besides the vanders two adult vanders plus two more sets of bones lots of scatter hard to say if they were turned in any direction and all the hands seem to be there probable females one skulls definitely african american other ones not clear simon and nadine were easy to id not that much decomp they were dumped far into the marsh but left on the banks with their clothes on wallets and purses nearby he took a breath missing right hands facing east plus they found chicken bones what looks like old potato salad coleslaw guess there was some picnicking going on no sign of the kid said milo maybe someone had pity or just the opposite moses reed winced something even worse for little mister golden hands shit any way his body could be in the marsh and they havent found it theyre still probing it might get easier after daybreak they also got a second cast on that shoe print dr delaware described found a few others from the same footwearlooks like a sneaker of some kind but unusual nothing domestic may not be in the databases lab promises to have an answer either way by the end of today clearing images of kelvin vander from my head i said lots of scatter could mean those other two bodies preceded the first three no trademarks says it did start out as simone and weir playing bondage games dispatching victims for fun once they got their rhythm they adapted their methods for a huge financial scheme movement on the other side of the glass drew our attention huck had rolled so that his back faced us he curled tighter hugged himself milo said what you said in the garage alexmaybe theres something he can do you were thinking civic duty if hes innocent he might be open to it any point telling him about the vanders to gauge his reaction and give him additional motivation not if youre seriously considering enlisting him i said the emotional firestorms too risky moe reed said now were enlisting him milo pointed to reeds cell phone get on the minihorn moses

was hermetically silent milo had directed reed to sum up the situation maybe as part of training the younger detective or was there a chance he wanted to get the brothers talking no sense conjecturing hed never admit it fox remained expressionless when reed finished he said murderous little bitch i knew she was bad news but not that bad youre sure hucks up to it reed said were not but he says yes and thats worth something hes what weve got aaron and well be watching okay shes the one suggested the beach it really is an open spot fox said its open all right but whats to stop her from paying him off then having him followed if she does well be ready fox tamped down the collar of a whiteonwhite silk shirt another possibility is weir positions himself on the deck of the house with a nightscope rifle and nails the poor sucker shots synchronize with the incoming tide noise wipes out the sound reed said well be watching weirs office and the house he shows up there we reevaluate not mentioning robins call to weirs office claiming to be a prospective client the secretary taking her bogus name and volunteering that mr weir was in meetings all day shed be sure he got the message fox said reevaluate as in call it off reevaluate as in reevaluate la costa s private sand moses howre you going to get access reeds neck swelled all of a sudden youre dudley downer im a realist bro leads to longevity we got access from a neighbor our watch carll be stationed across pch everythings covered this is the plan aaron up to you fox ran a finger around the circumference of a silverdisk desk clock its already four whats to say weir hasnt gotten there and hunkered down milo said were on it aaron okay okay malibu neighbor huh you guys have the right friends anyone i might have heard of reed said someone dr delaware knows fox stretched onyx cuff links gleamed sounds like dr delaware and i need to get better acquainted okay ill go get the toys after he left the room milo said nice work space sure beats civil service foxs place was on san vicente near wilshire the southeast corner of beverly hills the décor was skinny italian leather seating charcoal felt walls chrome and brass and glass and cubist lithographs the building was a twenties duplex one of the last carryovers from the streets former life as a quiet residential byway now the structure shared space with commercial and professional buildings foxs workland had once been a master bedroom big and bright with a rear view of a cactus garden soundproofed padding beneath the felt playlandhis living quarterswas on the second story accessed through a teak spiral staircase probably salvaged from a yacht reed said he probably writes the whole building off aaron needs his deductions fox returned with a brown suede carrying case settled back behind the glass desk fishing out a black box the size of a cigarette pack he laid it down added what looked to be a pen then a tiny white button attached to a cord and a pinjack similar wires spaghettied from the other components the whole kit could fit in a trouser pocket foxs mocha hands passed over the equipment like a battle priest blessing armaments onestop shopping gentlemen milo said thats all of it plus my laptop feeds programmed to interface one keystroke and weve got dvds for posterity cute private enterprise milo pointed to the little black box thats the recorder recorder and transmitter said fox this heretouching the white buttonis the camera dont ask me what it cost were talking highdef infrared cuts through the dark like a knife through trans fat deft fingers rolled to the pen decent mike but truthfully not spectacular manufacturer claims a twothousandfoot range ive found one thousand to be closer to the truth and sometimes it blanks out hightech industrys like congress promises more than delivers for best results have your mope stay no more than ten feet from her ive got another one a little more reliable but its embedded in a jeans jacket if he gets hugged hard enough it could be detected how much wiring of our mope do we have to do said reed recorder goes in his pants pocket we cut a hole in there run one cable up to the pen in his shirt pocket i substitute the button for one of his and install the video feed any of you guys sew silence great so now im your tailor be sure hes wearing a shirt with a pocket and that it already has buttons the same color and dont even think of asking me to donate one of mine there are limits reed said hes wearing a blue buttondown with white buttons brand new courtesy his lawyer wallenburg said fox i thought she was corporate whats her connection to him anyway its complicated said milo ever work with her i wishhey maybe if this works out you can put in a good word and shell send me some of those enronworldcom cases reed said maybe if i wish you the best said fox but hardwares one thing the human factors another when i play with these toys im in chargewearing it myself or rigging up one of my freelances my people usually have sag cards youre working with a guy with mental problems hes motivated said reed good intentions and all that milo said road to heaven if you say so travis hucks reaction to the plan had changed his demeanor evaporation of fear a smile almost broad enough to hide his lopsided mouth i wondered if his concept of heaven included early arrival but said nothing what would be the point aaron fox said youre sure all you want me to do is sit on my ass and check the feed thats it said milo aw shucks you want action aaron you can always come back to the real job gee why didnt i think of that i guess billing for my time on thisnot to mention having the department insure my gearis a fantasy milo said ill guarantee full coverage of the hardware on my own ticket and who knows everything works out you might get the dough simone owes you oh ill get it said fox one way or the other chapter seven fifty pm la costa beach malibu the world has compressed its boundaries the blackrimmed rectangle of a nineteeninch laptop screen greenandgray world tinted by infrared illumination in the background waves roll in a lazy almost sexual rhythm a man stands by the tide line motionless i sit at a long table of ancient pine my seat affords me an oblique view of the screen milo faces the laptop moves his face close to it at times then he retreats polishing off more red bull aaron fox is positioned to his left he drinks sparingly almost daintily from his personal bottle of norwegian fjord spring water in between swallows he chews cinnamon gum moe reed stands in a corner and watches the ocean the table is a sevenfoot trestle waxed and knotted and crisscrossed with scars that look calculated it fills most of the dining space of a house ten

shuttered pizza joint a cheap laptop sits on the passenger seat programmed to stream the same feed aaron fox has rigged into his computer getting the inferior piece of crap to cooperate has turned out to be the biggest hitch so far with aaron fox cheerfully demeaning civil service snitware before finally succeeding even after the connection is made transmission is spotty sound obscured by the traffic on pch binchy received the laptop from milo at six pm has already been watching the vander house for an hour when we arrive at gordies no one has entered or exited and the garage door has been left open per travis hucks instructions huck stands in the sand eight oclock arrives passes eight oh five ten twelve we wonder if this will fizzle the garage door left open is a positive sign and we cling to it eight fifteen huck seems undisturbed then i remember hes not wearing a watch it finally happens at eight sixteen sudden and jarring as a heart attack moe reed is the first to notice he points at the screen nearly levitates from his seat simone vander has materialized on the beach from nowhere the camera in travis hucks button captures her willowy frame floating forward i think of a mermaid rising from the ocean as she gets closer the bag in her hand takes shape large paper trader joes logo everything right on course so far so good simones clothes are dry maybe a walkonwater miracle sothin girl dry hair fluffing in the breeze she walks along the beach bare feet mold to the sand walking with confidence a rich girl accustomed to private silica ambling looselimbed swinging the bag not a care in the world huck stands there milo says where the hell did she come from aaron fox says dont know camera is great for up close but past a certain point you lose clarity in the long image as if in illustration simone steps within fifteen feet of huck stares at him stops and her facial features clarify maybe a bit more tense than her easy walk had suggested green overtones dont help bones sharper than i remember but still a pretty girl the outfit shes picked is socal cutie sprayedon lowriding jeans dark middy blouse revealing a drumtight belly bangle bracelets big hoop earrings two pierces in her navel the breeze blows dark hair away from her left ear revealing a solitary diamond glinting from cartilage the feed is that good huck doesnt move and for several seconds neither does simone travis the sounds a bit grainy and her voice seems high distant muffled as if shes talking through a mouthful of whipped cream or blood simone where will you go not important simone smiles steps closer swinging the bag poor travis poor kelvin simones smile freezes your little buddy your little brother half brother she says gook brother he says she gives a start her eyes narrow backtracking trying to figure out where he got that she says didnt know you were a racist i heard you say it simone something has changed in hucks voice deeper tighter fox catches it sounds like hes working himself up he goes for her were too far to stop it no one in the room answers him simone vander says you stalked me i did she laughs at the shameless admission i fuck you four times and you cant get over it five four loser the first time was a joke you have to actually put it in before you spooze to call it fucking she laughs harder the tail end of her cruel mirth is softened by the fizz of an incoming wave she walks closer to huck you are such a dickbrain loser travis i know his flat agreeability enrages her and her eyes turn to surgical incisions she stops sinks into the sand a bit shifts position and finds higher ground the bag swings wider you think you can escape your loser self by admitting that youre a loser whats that some rehab bullshit huck doesnt respond youre a loser a retard a dickbrain preemie burnout so dont go thinking you can mess with me travis only reason im here is because i feel sorry for you okay and guess what the first thing youre going

whyd you kill them simone doesnt confess nor does she deny she appears to glance past huck as if expecting company the four of us tense moments pass huck says all of them kelvin how did you get

therapy patientto use the silence simone swings the bag arches her back appears to be flaunting whatever chest she has aaron fox says she never stops first time i met her she was all sex simone says catching ups been fun stud but lets just do this huck doesnt answer simone appears distracted by the ocean now youre a dickbrain dumbie too silence fox says say something dude keep her stringing along his jaw is tight and all his insouciance is gone and i catch a sense of what he was like working homicide simone steps closer to huck just out of arms reach a steady buttoncamera says huck remains still he hasnt budged since we planted him on the sand just like that he says like what you pay me youre free of sin sin says simone what the fuck is that sixth commandment whatsoh thou shalt not yadda yadda yadda all for money says huck with sympathy in his voice nothing sweeter it was more than that says huck youre jealous of kelvin always were jealous she says as if the word is foreign hes

mutters go go go huck says all because you wanted the gold for yourself simone smirks ive got the gold loser a kid simone you hugged and kissed him and played with his hair you hugged nadine now theyre gooks they were always gooks you kissed them simone laughs like in the mafiathe godfather you get kissed before you get blown away was it easy simone did you look in their eyesdid you look in kelvins eyes simone laughs louder whats the big deal everyone dies the same keep talking says milo huck says you looked into his eyes the eyes change says simone and her own orbs illustrate by taking on a dreamy look its like watching the light go out theres nothing like it arching her back again i watched the light go out in her eyes and i came milo pumps a fist got her she drops the bag on the sand heres what you want have a bad life the camera doesnt falter what you think im punking you loser cmere look what did you do with them simone ate em says simone with fava beans and chianti what did we do we jammed dynamite up their asseswho cares take this and crawl like the maggot you are she bends toward the bag inserts her hand comes up with a bound wad of bills tosses it huck doesnt budge the money lands on the sand simone stares at it what its fine says huck leave it and go simone studies him leave it and go huck repeats have whatever life you think you deserve whats that a curse some kind of hex says simone from you a curse is a blessing she turns to leave stops rotates jams her hand into the bag and comes up with something that isnt money long and thin she holds it aloft oh shit said fox as she charges huck the camera captures her eyes hot and frigid simultaneously the blandness of her face as she thrusts the knife hucks hands shoot out into the cameras eye as he grabs for the weapon simone lunges twists grunts blood spurts huck says nothing as she continues to stab him milo runs toward the deck stairs that lead to the beach reed races on his heels overtakes him aaron fox gapes at the screen i catch the look on his face as i run after milo and reed see him right now and you wouldnt know he was ever a confident elegant man the sounds from the screen wet thumping insistent fill my ears as my feet hit the sand and im well out of range and hearing is no longer relevant chapter when we get to the spot where simone vander has attacked travis huck he is sitting on the sand crosslegged like a yogi his face is calm as he watches blood rain from his hands and arms and chest simone is stretched out several feet away inches from the waters edge flat belly exposed to the moon twin pierces winking the knife protrudes from the side of her neck longbladed woodenhandled kitchen utensil her body is twisted as if in escape her eyes are white and dull moe reed stoops on the sand like a baseball catcher checks needlessly for a pulse he stands up shaking his head joins milo at travis hucks side the run has left milo panting struggling to keep up with reed he managed to call for an ambulance he and reed attend to huck tearing off their shirts to use as tourniquets within seconds milo s undershirt and reeds broad bare chest are slathered with blood huck seems amused by the fuss two bound packets of money lie on the sand later well discover both are bundles of singles covered by twenties at both ends seventy dollars each aaron fox shows up surveys the scene approaching simones body his look says shes something alien and slimy washed up by the tide a wave rolls over her leaves a coating of foam on her face that dissipates as bubbles burst in the warm night air no lights have gone on in the neighboring houses this is a haven for weekenders by sunrise all blood will be laundered by the ocean but now the sand is gummy fox and i stand around as milo and reed working silently in perfect concert reduce spurt to seep huck turns pale then an odd offwhite begins to nod off milo braces him and reed holds his hands the young detective says hang on pal huck looks at simones corpse moves his lips uhahuh milo says dont talk son hucks eyes remain fixed on simone he shrugs leaks dont move says moe reed huck mutters something shh says milo hucks head sways his eyes close he forces himself to form words says i did it again im thinking about that as movement from the beach house grabs my attention brief flash of activity below the house where a bulb fastened to the bottom of the deck casts weak light on the pilings and the bulkhead beneath the main structure something shifting no one else notices i go over a zodiac raft hangs on chains from a rafter behind the boat is a door slightly ajar cut flush with the plywood that veneers the bulkhead no lock some sort of storage space it probably blew open but no wind tonight maybe its been that way for a while i make my way between the pilings smelling salt and tar and wet sand enter the cavelike space created by the overhang of the deck the zodiac is fully inflated other things dangle from the rafters like sausage at a deli a small metal rowboat two sets of oars an old cocacola sign rusted beyond easy recognition nailed to a listing warped crossbeam things go better with i approach the door barely wide enough to squeeze through no movement no light from within and unlikely to be deeper than the few feet allowed by the bulkhead blown open who knows how long ago i swing the door open just to be sure come facetoface with a black figure eight double shotgun barrel above the lethal tube a face slack in spots unnaturally taut in others hairless no eyebrows no lashes a visage turned masklike by the tickle of indirect light bald head pale eyes dark tshirt and sweats dark running shoes big diamond ring on one of the fingers gripping the trigger what i can see of the shotguns stock is shiny and burled engraved metalwork elevates the weapon to art a whole different level from my fathers birdslayer one of the pricey weapons simon vander got rid of when his new wife asked him to buddy weirs diamond ring bounces as his finger tightens easy i say weir mouthbreathes its his turn to sweat a softlooking slopeshouldered man stinking of sulfurous fear more dangerous than if hed been angry pale eyes look past me at the scene on the beach he seems about to cry the ring bounces again the barrel moves closer stops inches from my nose a strange wonderful numbness takes over as i hear myself speak i say wrong eye confusion freezes weirs hand youre righthanded but you might be lefteyed close one then the other see which one makes my face jump more also you need to stop fighting the gun guns dont like to be wrestled with lean in embrace be part of itgo ahead blink test your eyes weirs look is scornful superior but his eyes effect unconscious compliance and the shotgun wavers i duck hit him hard as i can low in the gut follow with the most vicious kick i can muster connect with his groin he gasps doubles over the gun points upward thunder wood shreds weir is still in pain as i put all my weight into a twohanded blow to the back of his neck he crumbles to the sand still holding the shotgun i stomp his arm break some bones free the weapon lovely trap gun probably italian the burl is glorious walnut the metal engravings scenes of renaissance hunters stalking mythical beasts weir moans in agony later i will learn that his ulna shattered like glass will never be the same i watch him writhe allow myself a moment of satisfaction that i will never disclose to anyone milo has heard the shotgun go off arrives with his ninemillimeter in hand he flips weir uses plastic ties to bind weirs wrists and ankles just as a malibu emt squad arrives one squad one stretcher travis huck gets priority weir suffers during a brief pause in his wails i hear something from the bulkhead faint bashful knocking a higher tide wouldve obscured it milo hears it too keeping his gun in hand he points at the doorway stops peers in vanishes i follow the boy is propped against cement block the stench of feces and urine and vomit is overpowering he has been wrapped in black garbage bags bound with loops of nylon cord like a pot roast the blindfold over his eyes is black muslin the rubber ball in his mouth is bright orange his nostrils are unobstructed but snotsmeared his head has been shaved he kicks small bare feet against the front plywood wall of the storage area six feet square convicted murderers live in bigger spaces milo and i hurry to free him milo gets there first calls him by name tells him hes safe everythings okay as the blindfold is peeled from dark almond eyes kelvin vander looks up at us dryeyed in another world i touch his cheek he screams like a trapped raccoon milo says everythings fine son nothing to worry about youre safe now the boys eyes bore into his acute studious his cheeks sport finger marks welts small cuts he has both his hands milo says youre gonna be okay son tilts his own face away from the childs hiding the lie chapter case closed big case the police chief was happy or some reasonable facsimile of such ada john nguyens work was just beginning but he was also smiling for all their scheming and planning simone vander and buddy weir had left a lovely evidentiary chain over a year of phone calls and another rented storage unit this one in the heart of west la paid for faithfully each month with weirs personal check inside were more box games and paperwork attesting to weirs national rankings in scrabble and backgammon and bridge credit card records documenting monthly trips to vegas often with simone weirs blackjack and poker winnings appeared to exceed his lossesthough nguyens staff still digging into weirs finances hadnt unearthed all the details one nice detail the shoe prints at the western side of the marsh matched to a pair of sixhundreddollar legnani driving shoes found in the closet of weirs encino home three polished wooden boxes were also found in the bin not unlike the cache that had held the finger bones each receptacle offered up a trove of photos weir and simone in full s m regalia women five of them partially clothed then naked three of the subjects were easily matched with mug shots of sheralyn dawkins lurleen big laura chenoweth and demaura montouthe the remaining two were phenotypically consistent with the bones found on the west side of the marsh but took longer to identify with help from vice milo and moe reed finally idd them as mary juanita thompson twentynine and june junebug paulette thirtytwo prostitutes known to work the airport stroll the news didnt grab a single second of media interest nor did the department choose to issue a press conference the depiction of each victims involvement with weir and simone spelled out a sequence so stereotyped it had clearly been scripted initial exchange of cash smiling participation a gradual morph into gagged bound terror death by strangulation postmortem closeup of a pair of greenhandled garden shears sometimes in weirs hand others in simones bones milo was too smart to think in terms of happy endings but a call from the chiefs office to review five more cold cases sent him off to ponder and grumble moe reed applied for transfer to west la but an executive order to get something done on the caitlin frostig disappearance kept him in venice he called and asked if i could help i agreed to meet to review the case but my attentions were focused elsewhere one day driving to the station to deliver my proofread statement on the marsh murders i spotted reed walking hand in hand with dr liz wilkinson both of them laughing up to that point id never seen the young detective crack half a smile that night i took robin out to dinner at the hotel belair she wore her pearl travis huck spent two months at cedarssinai most of his stab wounds had sliced muscle and a few had damaged nerves leading to residual weakness and soreness deep gashes in his left arm would probably render the limb useless and prone to infection his doctors raised the specter of amputation somewhere down the line a possibility confirmed by richard silverman md director of the er rick asked by milo to keep tabs on hucks progress said the patient was healing physically but i dont have a feel for him psychologically alex kind of inappropriate affect no i said the smiles exactly no matter what even after refusing painkillers for him it could be the best choice guess so but its got to hurt when i visited huck i found him at peace his face so slack and serene that most of the droop was gone the nursing staff voted him their favorite patient on a busy ward that translates to compliant he watched a lot of tv read and reread all seven volumes of harry potter ate some of the fruit and candy debora wallenburg messengered over gave most of it away wallenburg volunteered her services in the prosecution of buddy weir john nguyen declined respectfully confided to me that hed probably screwed my chance of going corporate one time i approached hucks room and encountered kelly vander and larry brackle leaving seeing me flooded kellys face with shame and she hurried past brackle held back seemed to want to talk i smiled he ran after kelly the hospital security guard who sat near hucks door when time permitted hustled over hi doc when she gave me her name i didnt want to let them in crooking a thumb mr huck said it was okay so i searched her purse nothing iffy how long were they in there twenty minutes said the guard i was listening doc no problems whatsoever once i took a peek they didnt see me she was holding mr hs hand toward the end she cried a bunch and i think he was asking her to forgive him or something like that and she was saying no it was she who needed forgiveness then there was a whole bunch of crying what did the other guy do just sat there i thanked him and cracked the door huck was on his back sleeping peacefully he hadnt roused by the time i reviewed his chart and chatted with his physical therapist i left and drove to another hospital at the inpatient rehab center at western pediatrics kelvin vander lived in a private room sentried twentyfour seven by private eyes subcontracted by aaron fox a third of every billable hour the freelancers submitted was deposited directly into foxs bank account kelvins new lawyers were happy to pay their own hourly billings were drawn upon a sevenfigure account attached to the vander estate the estate had been valued at over a hundred and seventy million a family court judge assigned to protect kelvin promised to keep an eye on the boys money if things got out of hand hed cap the attorneys annual draw at a million or two over a threeweek period i spent over a hundred hours with kelvin would eventually send my own bill but had other things on my mind when i showed up the boy looked straight at me one month later still not a word i tried drawing games just sitting there my own benevolent silence at my wits end i called the judge and made a request he said hmm kind of creative doctor you think itll work i thought hed open up by now no predictions know what you mean went to see him myself cute but like a little statue sure ill authorize it the next day i was in kelvins room when a spinet piano and matching bench were delivered in the bench drawer were folders of sheet music id retrieved from the steinway grand gracing the boys oceanview bedroom in the house on calle maritimo i removed some of it fanned it on his hospital bed he closed his eyes i waited awhile left his room was charting at the nurses station when the music began first tentative then louder streaming through the door and perking up the private cop on shift everyone listened whats that said a nurse mozart i said chopin one of the études i was pretty sure over and over i drove home and dug out a box of cds ten minutes later i had it opus number in f minor technically
