bertrice small a memory of love prologue the prince lay atop his lover groaning and sweating his pleasure the child standing at the head of the bed watched impassively the princes eyes met hers go outside rhonwyn he said tis raining the child whined then take your sheepskin and lie quietly by the fire lass he replied beneath him the woman moaned softly shifting her hips suggestively as her impatient ardor grew i want to sleep with my mam rhonwyn said stubbornly nay lass the prince laughed softly tonight i sleep with your mam now make your bed by the fire if i have to get up ill beat you go finally cowed the child did as she had been bid and lay by the fire wrapping herself in the warm sheepskin she hated it when the prince came to their cottage then her mother had no time for her or her baby brother the prince was their father her mother had told them they owed him their love and their allegiance without him they would starve she and glynn must always remember that her brother was already asleep by the fire his thumb in his small mouth his dark lashes brushing his rosy cheek she loved glynn more than any other person on this earth he did not prefer the prince to her as her mother did yet when llywelyn ap gruffydd came to their cottage he always brought his children gifts and greeted them lovingly but i still dont have to like him rhonwyn reasoned silently to herself she heard her mother cry out and the princes deep voice said christs bones vala no one feeds my itch like you do and then her mother laughed her husky laugh rhonwyns eyes closed at the sound and she slept at last there was no use in trying to stay awake the prince would remain the night part i rhonwyn chapter the late spring rain was heavy and chill some of it was seeping through the roof where the thatch was worn the fire had gone out the day before and the two children did not know how to restart it they huddled together to keep warm their mothers body lay on the bed amid a pool of blood that was now congealed and blackening the stench in the cottage had already numbed their nostrils even as the cold had numbed their fingers and toes the wind suddenly howled in mournful fashion and the smaller of the two children whimpered pressing himself closer to his elder sister rhonwyn uerch llywelyn focused her brain again as she had these past two days how was she to save glynn and herself from certain death their mama was dead birthing the princes latest child their cottage was isolated from any village for decent women would not tolerate the princes whore and his bastards the old crone who had helped vala in her two previous births had not been there this time because this time the child had come too soon much too soon they needed to be warm rhonwyn thought sleepily how did one start a fire if only it would cease raining perhaps they could walk and find another cottage or villagebut whatever a village was for she didnt really know having never left the hill on which she had lived her whole five years rhonwyn hugged her threeyearold brother tighter against her when he whimpered again hungry he complained to her there is nothing left glynn she repeated for the tenth time when the rain stops we will go and find food if we leave the cottage now we will surely die they were apt to die in any event rhonwyn thought irritably if she could only start a fire to warm them the gnawing in their bellies might not seem so fierce she hadnt meant for the fire to go out but when her mam began screaming with her pain rhonwyn had taken her brother from their cottage so he would not be frightened they had gone out on the hillside to pick flowers for the new baby but when they had returned their mother was dead and the lire was out not even a lingering coal remained that rhonwvn might coax into a warm flame as she had often seen her mot her do then the rain had begun it had rained all night and into this day which was almost over suddenly rhonwvns ears pricked up at the sound of dogs baying in the distance the noise grew closer and closer until it was directly outside the door to the cottage was slammed open and llywelyn ap grulfydd was outlined in the failing light of day he stepped quickly inside his eyes sweeping about the room seeing his children huddled together on their pallet he asked them what has happened here mams dead rhonwyn answered her father the new baby came too soon why wasnt the midwife here he demanded who was to send for her and where is she mam was screaming and screaming i took glynn and went outside when we returned mam was dead there was no fire no food i didnt know what to do i didnt know where to go or i would have gone our mam is dead and you and your rutting have killed her she would not have died but that you put another baby in her belly startled at the venom in the childs voice he looked down at her seeing his daughter for the first time it was like looking into a glass but for her coloring which was valas she didnt like him he knew her green eyes glared angrily into his he would have laughed but for the seriousness of the situation rhonwyn was certainly his get and every bit as intense with her anger as he was ill make a fire he replied go outside and look in my saddlebag there is food in it do not mind the dogs he turned away from her and began to prepare a new fire seeing his small son staring at him half fearful half curious he said come here lad and i will show you how to make a fire so you will never be cold again the little boy crept from the pallet and came to stand by his father watching fascinated as ap gruffydd gathered a bit of kindling together and drew a flint from his purse using the blade of his knife the prince stroked the flint until it sparked and the kindling caught light glynns eyes were wide with amazement and the prince smiled reaching out to ruffle the boys dark hair ap gruffydd added wood to the fire until it was blazing merrily and the chill began to dissipate the man stood and handed the flint to his son tis yours glynn ap llywelyn now you know how to make a fire but only in the fireplace for now eh lad aye tad came the reply and the prince smiled again it was the first time the child had called him father so you know i am your sire he said mam said the child answered simply she did not lie god assoil her sweet soul now the princes attention was drawn back to his dead lover she must be buried although no priest would say the proper words over her it didnt matter god would have vala uerch huw because she was a good woman he would not condemn her to a fiery hell because she had been llywelyn ap gruffydds leman he wished now he had married her even though she had had neither wealth nor powerful family ties to recommend her at least his children would have been legitimate well he would formally acknowledge them that would please vala he should begin to consider marriage he thought he was well past thirty and had nought but his two wee bastards to carry on his name rhonwyn had reentered the cottage she took bread and cheese making small pieces for her little brother seeing the flint she said whats that she picked it up and rolled the quartz in her hand gently give it back glynn shouted at her our tad gave it to me it makes fire rhonwyn shrugged and handed him hack his prize was the baby born ap gruffydd asked his daughter she shrugged i dont know she replied shoving bread and cheese into her mouth i didnt look he nodded understanding he would have to look has the rain stopped yet rhonwyn aye ill go and dig a grave for yer mam he said put it where she can see the sunset the little girl said mam always liked to watch the sunset he nodded and went outside taking the shovel from the side of the cottage nearest vala s garden he sought for a westerly direction the storm had gone and the skies were clearing now finding the right spot he began to dig what was he to do with his children he considered as he worked while there was a truce between him and the english for now there was still no place he really called home besides it would be far better if as few people as possible knew of these two little ones even bastards had their relevance they could be exploited by his enemies or used to cement treaties particularly as he had no other children he had been faithful to vala for he had little time for his own amusement besides there had never been a woman who pleased him like this descendant of the fair folk had the earth was soft with the rain and he was quickly able to dig the grave setting the shovel aside he went in to fetch the body valas face was at peace although her body was stiff and contorted between her outstretched legs amid the black and thickened blood he saw the child it would fit neatly into his palm but it was perfectly formed you would have had a sister he told rhonwyn and glynn get me a basin lad and you lass put on a kettle of water to warm your mam and your sister will go to their grave clean a sister rhonwyn thought sadly she had wanted a sister mam had talked about names huw after her father if a boy gwynllian for a girl rhonwyn dipped the bucket into the water barrel by the corner of the cottage and then filled the iron kettle swinging it over the fire to warm then she went to the cupboard and took out a pristine length of cloth bringing it to her father and handing it to him wordlessly ap gruffydd smiled almost imperceptibly there was a grim look in his eyes he remembered how vala had begged him for the cloth how many years back if she or the children died she had explained to him they would have a clean shroud to be buried in he had laughed at her macabre request but then he had assented and brought her the cloth she was alone here on this green hill with her children because she had chosen to belong to him thus eschewing respectability and the company of her neighbors no one would help her in a time of trouble she understood that and accepted her fate because she truly loved him he should have married her he thought again her father had held a small bit of land and was free oh he would make a dynastic marriage eventually but it was vala he had loved would always love ap gruffydd spent the next hour bathing the body of the woman he had adored he washed the barely born infant valas body had pushed forth the bloody bedclothes on which she had died he burned then he tenderly wrapped the cold body in the immaculate shroud tucking the baby into her embrace her limbs were so stiff it had been difficult to do so but he knew that was how she would have wanted to be buried come and say farewell to your mam he beckoned his children he saw rhonwyn hesitate just a fraction of a moment but then she took glynn by the hand and came to him he kissed his lovers icy lips a final time and the children followed suit rhonwyn reached out and gently touched the babys tiny head he would have sworn for a moment that there were tears in her green eyes but then she turned her hard gaze on him tis all your fault llywelyn ap gruffydd she told him now what is to happen to glynn and to me with our mam gone who will care for us you are my children he replied i will not desert you your mother trusted me why can you not trust me i am your father you sired us on our mams body llywelyn ap gruffydd she returned coldly but when have you ever been a father when you came here it was to see her and to pleasure yourself because of you i have never seen another living being in all my life but for you my brother our mam and that old crone who helped birth glynn saw you did not starve or go unclad he defended himself what more is a lather needed for lass a man must fight and strive to gain his position and keep it there are enemies to be defeated new lands to gain that is a mans world a womans is her children everything was as it should he between your mother and me now let us bury her and your wee sister then i will take you with me to a place of safety vala and her infant were placed with care in the wet grave her shroud had been laid over her face the earth was filled in as glynn sobbed his little heart out cradled in his sisters protective embrace the setting sun in a burst of red and gold glory lit the skies to the west ap gruffydd raised a small mound over the grave and then replaced the strips of greenery he had first removed from the site this way the grave was not likely to draw attention of either wild beasts or anyone who might pass by this remote place we must remain the night here he told his children rhonwyn you will gather up what you wish to take for both you and your brother we will depart tomorrow at first light go inside now while see what i can hunt up for dinner for you keep the fire going when he returned two skinned coneys in his possession he found the cottage swept and neat again the bed he had so often shared with vala however was stripped of its straw mattress he said nothing broiling the rabbits over the open fire and dividing them among himself his children and the dogs rhonwyn had set the little table adding some of his bread and cheese the rest he knew she had saved for the morning he watched as she carefully pulled the meat from the bones of the rabbit feeding it along with bits of bread and cheese to her little brother only when he was satisfied did she herself eat she had learned well from her mam he thought sadly shell be a good mother some day i must make an advantageous marriage for her shes a pretty lass the children slept together on their pallet wrapped in their sheepskins he made certain the fire did not die in the night when the dawn came llywelyn ap gruffydd arose and stood in the doorway of the cottage it would be the last time he would ever come here he knew he had not expected vala to die before he did she had been so strong and healthy she had been just fourteen when he had first seen her in his uncles house he had taken her away with him and his seed had planted itself in her womb the first time he breached her she had been a virgin nine months later she had borne rhonwyn as easily as a cat having her kittens then two years later glynn that she should begin her travail two months before she should have and die of it surprised him he would go to a priest and acknowledge these two offspring of his body the sun was now just about over the horizon he turned back into the cottage and roused his children they finished what was left of the rabbit the bread and the cheese he gave them each a sip of wine from his flask glynn coughed as it slid down his throat but rhonwyn swallowed the liquid facilely so you like wine he chuckled it is good she replied do you have everything you wish to take he asked her there isnt much she answered but ive put it in our mams shawl she handed him the small bundle its corners tied together if not neatly tightly go outside and take the lad he told her i will be there in a moment what are you going to do she demanded of him he looked directly at her his dark eyes meeting her green ones im going to burn the cot he said but she did not to his surprise object instead she nodded and taking her brother in her charge exited the dwelling ap gruffydd emitted a small bark of laughter vala had been all softness and spicy sweet this daughter of theirs was as hard as flint even as i am he smiled to himself grimly he took the reed torch he had made earlier and thrust it into the fireplace to catch the flame when it was burning well he walked about the small cottage setting it ablaze as he worked his way toward the open door once outside he flung the torch hack into the room and stood with his son and his daughter watching as the cottage burned itself to the ground when there was nothing left of the little building he said we will go now the ground is wet and the embers left will not spread he went to his horse tied to a nearby tree undoing the reins rhonwyn you will ride behind me glynn before me he lifted the little boy onto the saddle noting the sudden fear in the childs eyes as he did so it was the first time his son had ever been astride an animal addien is a welltrained beast lad someday i will see you have a horse every bit as good perhaps one of his offspring would you like that he pulled himself up onto his mount putting a strong and comforting arm about glynn aye tad came the reply a bit unsure but the little voice was strong he was no longer afraid ap gruffydd reached down to his daughter and drew rhonwyn up behind him put your arms about me lass he told her and when she did he signaled addien to move along where are we going rhonwyn asked him ap gruffydd thought a moment where were they going then he replied cythraul its a fortress that belongs to me and not more than a half days ride from here they rode the morning through the dogs loping along beside them ap gruffydd asking once if his children desired to stop to rest but they did not he was pleased to see they were made of strong stuff he would leave them at cythraul but after that what he needed time to consider their fates for he had never expected to have their care they were valas responsibility but vala was dead he sighed aloud and unaware he loved her rhonwyn thought at least i know that to be truth both glynn and i came from that love but he has no feelings for us i think what will happen to us a fortress why would he leave us in a fortress what is a fortress she wondered i will not be afraid if i show any fear then glynn will be afraid he is already frightened by losing mam i must be strong for my brother mam would want me to protect him and see him safe but i am afraid then before them arose a dark stone edifice that seemed to spring from the mountain cythraul ap gruffydd said riding straight for the dark pile of rock they heard his name being called from its heights as they drew nearer then they rode through the open ironwork of the entrance rhonwyn would later learn the ironwork was called a portcullis the courtyard was suddenly alive with men one took addiens reins while another reached up to lift both her and her brother down ap gruffydd dismounted giving orders that the beast be fed and rested then he said where is morgan ap owen here my lord a deep voice boomed and a barrelchested man came forth he was tall and had a black beard and his hair was tied behind him although the top of his head was bald we must talk ap gruffydd said and walked toward a tower which seemed to be the only building in the fortress it was built into the walls at one corner of the structure inside he told his children go and warm yourselves by the fire pit then he accepted a wooden goblet of bitter beer swallowing it down in several gulps and seated himself in the lords chair vala is dead these are our children the girl is just five and called rhonwyn the lad is three and named glynn i want to leave them with you while i decide what is to be done for them he told morgan ap owen the captain of cythraul your word lord is my command came the reply but why here and why me this is a great honor you do me entrusting me with the care and safety of your offspring you were valas blood kin morgan and besides i didnt want to exhaust them by taking them farther they have never until today been off the hillock where vala had her cottage what about your brothers households the captain queried few knew of vala and no one knew until today that i had children by her now you know morgan ap owen you and i and a priest of my choosing you know the danger my enemies would kill the lad and use rhonwyn as a pawn in some marriage i am far past my youth and if i do not many glynn will one day be my heir as for rhonwyn it will he her lather who arranges her marriage not strangers he smiled at his longtime friend they are small morgan surely you can find a place for them here there is a bedspace for important visitors near the fire pit they can have that morgan ap owen answered his overlord but what am i to do with them they are children they will amuse themselves just keep them safe for me warm and well fed ap gruffydd said what am i to tell my men the captain asked just say these children are of special importance to me came the reply they will draw their own conclusions no matter but admit nothing to anyone will the children speak ap owen wanted to know rhonwyn glynn to me their father commanded and the children came to stand by him you are my offspring my blood and am proud of it but you must not admit our relationship to any rhonwyn i know you understand but you must make your brother comprehend the danger can you do it lass the green eyes met his and she said briefly i can good girl he praised and gave her a quick kiss atop her head chuckling at the surprised look that encompassed her features then he arose i must go now i am expected elsewhere this day and while i may be late i must get there will you return rhonwyn asked him he nodded when she demanded when the time is right lass you will be safe here at cythraul morgan ap owen is blood kin to your mam he will guard you with his life promise me you will obey him both of you aye rhonwyn said dispassionately aye tad little glynn piped eager to please his sire ap gruffydd lifted up the little boy and kissed him on both cheeks before setting him down again then he looked at his daughter she met his gaze straight on her look neither warm nor cold you havent made up your mind about me yet have you he gently teased rhonwyn shrugged her narrow shoulders i dont really know you but i am grateful you came yesterday and i am grateful you have brought us to a place of safety more than that i do not know nor can i say llywelyn ap gruffydd he nodded you are my daughter and honest to a fault he told her take care of the lad rhonwyn i will be back then ap gruffydd turned and in his captains company left the hall of the tower tad glynn called after the retreating figure hell be back soon rhonwyn comforted her brother let us explore this place that is to be our new home glynnielad she coaxed him turning his thoughts from ap gruffydd it is a tall tower when the day had finally waned and the hall filled with the menatarms the two children felt almost lost for a time but then morgan ap owen set them up upon the high board and told his men these wee ones are of great importance to our lord llywelyn they are to be kept safe and not mistreated i am going to appoint eight of you to be their particular guardians lug adda mabon nudd barris dewi cadam and oth i choose you just make certain these two younglings dont fall off the walls there was much goodnatured grumbling among the eight but they were all good men and secretly pleased to have been so honored it didnt take an educated man to figure out that these were the lords children even if morgan ap owen hadnt quite said so the lad had his stamp and the girl for all her fair hair was obviously his theyre his arent they his lieutenant said to his captain i have not said so was the response nor should you came the veiled warning rhonwyn listened to this exchange as she sat feeding her little brother their sire was obviously a very important man after the meal the chosen men gathered about them like a pack of kindly grizzled watchdogs rhonwyn was mostly silent letting her little brother capture the mens hearts for glynn was and always had been a very winning child when he began to grow sleepy one of them oth picked up the boy and tucked him in the bedspace you had best go too oth told her i am older rhonwyn replied then she looked across the hall at several of the men who were kneeling on the floor what are they doing she asked oth dicing he answered her it is a game i want to learn rhonwyn said do you he answered with a chuckle i dont know if the captain would approve lass why not she demanded tis a game of chance he explained i dont understand oth she told him i am very ignorant of the world you see having lived all my life on the hill with my mam he nodded i see he said well then perhaps i shall teach you to dice myself but not tonight you have had several hard days and you need your rest i will wager you have never before today ridden there is a small mare in the stables that no one uses i can teach you to ride too would you like that rhonwyn nodded eagerly aye i would then crawl into bed with your wee brother who is already asleep tomorrow will be a very busy day for you oth led her unprotesting now to the bedspace in the stone walls of the tower lifting her up he tucked rhonwyn in beneath the furs next to glynn good night lass he said and then left her well done morgan ap owen praised him quietly what in jesus name does ap gruffydd mean by leaving those two wee children here oth said what kind of a place is cythraul for wee ones he picked up a wooden cup and drank down his beer hell be back soon enough for them gamon ap llwyd replied theyre his only offspring unless of course he has a few others hidden about the countryside he was faithful to my cousin vala morgan ap owen said quietly i will wager there are no others and did i tell you not to speak of them thusly we all know they are his gamon ap llwyd said poor lad and lass oth replied their mam gone and them brought to a place like this still if we are not to have them long we must make their time here a good one the peace is holding for now aye morgan thought to himself the peace is holding but for how long and if it broke cythraul would be in the thick of it being located so close to the border guarding a mountain pass between what was known as the welshry and the englishry sections of the marches it had been blessed providence that the prince had arrived at valas cottage when he did had he not the children would have died as well oh rhonwyn would have tried hard to survive and keep her baby brother safe but she was only a wee girlie their tragic end would have been inevitable but ap gruffydd had come in time and saved his offspring yet morgan ap owen knew that the prince would not be returning soon he had other greater problems god only knew how many years these two children would remain at cythraul there were several things to consider clothing was the first dewi one of the men he had appointed to look after the children was the fortresss tailor he must clothe both rhonwyn and glynn in boys attire that way anyone spying on them or sheltering with them would see the children assume them to be the sons of one of the men at cythraul and think no more on it anyone seeing a little girl among them would assume there were women at cythraul also such a notion could prove dangerous to the safety of the fortress and what was he to do with the children during the day he could neither read nor write nor could anyone here if rhonwyn was to make a good marriage one day she should know something but who was there to teach her well that would be ap gruffydds problem the men at cythraul lortress could hardly be expected to raise two children as a gentle dame would why hadnt ap gruffydd taken them to his sister the abbess gwynllian they would have had a far better opportunity at mercy abbey than at cythraul but ap gruffydd took the easiest route where his son and daughter were concerned his passion was for his country which was why he had put off the matter of his marriage even now approaching forty he had no idea of finding a wife and siring a legitimate heir morgan ap owen shook his dark head despairingly two small children to care for what had ap gruffydd been thinking he looked about the hall most of his men were now wrapped in their sheepskins as near to the fire pit as they could get rising he went outside and checked the preparations for the night the gates were barred and locked the watch stood upon the walls all was quiet and peaceful above him the skies had finally cleared and the stars shone brightly a crescent moon had already set a cold wet nose pressed itself into his hand absently he reached out and stroked his favorite dog a large irish wolfhound well brenin tis a fine responsibility we have been given ill be expecting you to watch over our young guests the lad is small yet and less likely to mischief but i fear for his sister headstrong like her tad she is and clever im thinking the dog whined as if in agreement and pushed his master with his massive head morgan chuckled youre getting old brenin that you would go in on a fine night like this but im ready for my bed too together master and beast returned to the hall morgan ap owen found his bedspace but to his surprise the dog went and lay before the two children the captain smiled he always knew brenin understood him no matter what anyone else said chapter ap gruffydds children were no better than peasants morgan ap owen thought as he watched them over the next few days they had known nothing but their cottage and their hill they hadnt even had a pet to keep them amused they were at first wary of brenin but the great wolfhound quickly won over the bolder rhonwyn and her shy little brother soon he was carrying glynn about on his back as the child tried to emulate his sister whom oth was teaching to ride we ought to get the laddie a pony oth remarked one evening in the hall hes wearing out poor old brenin and we all know how the captain will feel if the dog dies there was a nodding of heads in agreement hold still you wee vixen dewi said as he measured rhonwyn for her tunic youre worse than water running over rocks rhonwyn giggled lug says i have very little feet he measured me for boots of my own yesterday will i like boots dewi ive always gone barefoot i have you must learn to wear boots dewi told her ill make you some nice hose to wear under them what are hose she asked curiously a cloth covering for your legs and feet he told her by the rood these children knew so little hose will help keep your feet warm in winter and the bugs from biting your legs in summertime lass youre making her hose lug interrupted ill have to wait then to make the boots for i must measure her again when she is wearing the leg coverings dewi you might have told me before i made the pattern youve not cut the leather yet have you nay you told me just in time lug said morgan ap owen restrained a chuckle his men all of them were absolutely besotted with the two children he neednt have appointed a guardianship for they were all eager to look after ap gruffydds offspring they carried the boy about when he tired which he seemed to quite easily they made certain the choicest bits of the meal were put in rhonwyns and glynns bowls a bit subdued at first the children began to grow more comfortable with their new home at one point later morgan did not ask how a dappled gray pony was found along with a small saddle glynn joined his sister in her riding lessons on his feet glynn was sensitive and timid but astride the pony he quickly became an excellent even daring horseman frequently besting rhonwyn who had absolutely no fear of anything at all both youngsters roamed the fortress at will after they had been seen several times playing with sticks as they would swords small weapons were forged for them and the lessons began as well glynn was easily wearied with the rough games that rhonwyn so liked he preferred the company of the fortress cook gwilym who kept him amused with wonderful and fanciful tales of fairie folk warriors and beautiful maidenssome pure and some devilishly wicked gwilym often told his tales to the men in the hall on winter evenings he had a deep rich voice that could call forth magical and mysterious stories sometimes he would sing the history of the ancient cymri accompanying himself on a small lute glynn attached himself to the cook like a winkle to a rock no one seemed to mind as glynn was a gentle child while the men liked him they were not quite certain what to do with him his attachment to gwilym solved the problem for all quite nicely rhonwyn on the other hand was far easier to understand even if she was a little girl morgan himself taught her swordplay which she very much enjoyed he taught her how to use a main gauche a dagger held in the left hand while one used ones sword in the right barris the blacksmith made rhonwyn her own small kiteshaped shield oth devised a padded body armor called an arming doublet for her practices she learned to use a javelin and a mace next to the sword however rhonwyns favorite weapon was an alborium a bow made of hazelwood she became extremely quick and very proficient with it particularly astride her horse guiding her mount with her knees the reins wrapped about the saddles pommel she used the bow with deadly intent while coining at a full gallop by the time she was ten there wasnt a man in the fort who wouldnt have fought at her side and felt sale for the next few years a series of truces ensured the peace between england and the wales the english king henry iii was involved in a serious power struggle with one of his greatest lords simon de montfort the karl of leicester who also happened to be his brother inlaw the rebellion of de montfort and the barons was a popular one for henry was a weak king meeting the opposition at oxford he reluctantly signed a treaty limiting his royal power three years later the king repudiated the treaty of oxford saying his word had been forced while he walked cautiously for a time eventually the barons war broke out and the king was defeated by de montfort the very first parliament was summoned consisting of lords bishops knights and burgesses who were the representatives of the towns de montforts next move to ensure peace to the west was to formally in the name of the crown recognize llywelyn ap gruffydd as prince of wales and overlord of magnates wallie or all the great men of wales llywelyn was now a vassal of england and his power was at its absolute height shortly thereafter however prince edward the kings eldest son defeated de montfort at evesham killing him wales nonetheless was left in peace it suited england to permit the welsh autonomy for the time being after all there was scotland to the north to contend with and the french across the channel who had now in their possession almost all of england s french territories a treaty was proposed to be signed between henry iii and prince llywelyn isolated at cythraul the news of all these goingson still managed to filter through brought by travelers seeking shelter rhonwyn while interested in the news brought to cythraul pretended indifference she had no love for her father knowing his rescue of his children those few years back had been nothing more than chance bringing them to the fortress was merely a duty done for the men of cythraul had drummed one lesson into rhonwyn uerch llywelyn duty to family and country first if her father ever asked a duty of her rhonwyn knew she would grant it despite her dislike of ap gruffydd he had sired her he was her overlord she owed him duty she thought it unlikely however that she would ever be called upon to perform a duty for ap gruffydd he had yet to marry although he was in his late forties there were rumors of a possible alliance with a daughter of simon de montfort but a lady of such distinguished lineageshe had a king of england a king of france and a holy roman emperor for unclescould not possibly accept a mere prince of the welsh for a husband or could she the lady in question however was in france so she could not be asked rhonwyn had turned fifteen now and morgan ap owen began to worry she dressed like a boy but while her breasts were small they were still visible beneath her tunic there wasnt anything feminine about her other than her chest she strode boldly about like any young man at cythraul her fair hair was cropped short she could outride anyone at cythraul even her brother it had been easier when she had been a little girl but now morgan fretted some of the younger men were beginning to look at her with lust in their eyes he had twice in the last months seen her cornered while she had attacked her foolish admirers so that one of them sustained several broken ribs and the other had his nose broken in two places morgan ap owen knew it was just a matter of time before rhonwyn would be forced to face the reality that she wasnt one of the lads but rather a pretty lass before he might consider what to do about the situation llywelyn ap gruffydd rode suddenly into cythraul one day he had not been to the border fortress since that day ten years ago when he had brought his children to morgan ap owen this time he did not come alone but rather with a troop of about twenty men in his train the watch on the walls had called out the sighting of an armed party and then called again to say it was the prince himself the portcullis was raised and the gates to cythraul thrown open to welcome the lord of them all my lord prince we are most happy to see you morgan said coming forward what news i have signed a treaty with king henry we will keep the peace a while longer morgan ap owen ap gruffydd looked about where are my children he asked before the captain might answer oth came forward with glynn and morgan said here is your son my prince ap gruflydd looked at the lad and was pleased the boy looked relatively healthy he was almost as tall as his father with dark blue eyes and black hair but he was a bit thin ap gruffydd remarked on it to his captain lads are gangling at his age my prince morgan answered he is growing and we cannot keep him filled up with food he smiled at glynn who grinned back mischievously how old are you now lad the prince asked his son thirteen tad the boy replied have you been happy here at cythraul aye tad was the enthusiastic reply good good ap gruffydd said he looked about where is my daughter morgan she is out hunting my prince so she has been taught to ride ap gruffydd said sounding satisfied with the news excellent rhonwyn is the best rider and soldier at cythraul came glynns endorsement all the men say so tad ap gruffydd chuckled a soldier is she he was amused by his sons innocence but then all the boy had ever known in his thirteen years were places of isolation perhaps that should change but first he had his daughter to deal with and her future was assured aye tad the boy continued and morgan ap owen could only silently stand by rhonwyn is very skilled with sword main gauche javelin and mace too with the alborium she never misses her target shes our best hunter tad it was obvious the boy was extremely proud of his sister ap gruffydds attention had been quite engaged by his sons recitation he looked to his captain you taught my daughter how to use weapons morgan it was either teach her or have someone get injured my lord prince came the reply she wore padding and even has her own armor we thought it best my daughter is the best soldier at cythraul i am told did you teach her nothing but warfare it is all we could teach her my lord prince morgan replied and my son have you taught him warfare too why is he not considered as skilled as his sister came the query i do not like weapons tad glynn spoke up for himself oh i can use a sword if i must and i ride well but i do not like warfare i cannot bear to see anything killed even an animal jesu mary ap gruffydd swore startling the boy who shrank beneath his fathers fierce gaze seeing it the prince asked what do you like glynn ap llywelyn i i llike poetry and tales of daring and magic he half whispered his father was not pleased did he not like stories the lad has the makings of a fine bard morgan said gwilym our cook has taught him to play the harp and all the stories and poetry he knows youll see tonight in the hall what an excellent young bard you have sired my lord prince a lass whos a warrior and a lad who is a poet jesu ap gruffydd said then he laughed at the absurdity of it at that moment there was a clatter of horses behind them at the fortresss entrance and a party of hunters came through ho cousin morgan their leader called out to the captain ive brought you a fine young deer for our dinner the speaker rode directly up to morgan ap owen and pushed the deer from the saddle to fall at the captains feet rhonwyn llywelyn ap gruffydd didnt know whether to be pleased or horrified at the young ruffian who suddenly stared down at him at the mention of her name recognition dawned in the green eyes by the rood lads tis my sire the prince come to pay us a call she slid easily from her saddle and bowed mockingly my lord prince i am at your service he glared at her intently aye she was female her bosoms betrayed her hut other than that her sex was indistinguishable from any of the other men in the fortress her hair was cropped like a mans and dirty she was dirty why had he thought she would be like her mother like his delicate and gentle vala jesu mary he swore then anger began to overwhelm him he turned on morgan ap owen this is how you have raised my daughter to be the toughest soldier at cythraul what the hell were you thinking morgan morgan ap owen wasnt in the least intimidated by his prince what did you expect us to do llywelyn ten years ago you brought me a fiveyearold girlchild and a wee laddie of three you left them here and have not returned once in all that time to see how they were i did my best by them they have been well fed and clothed and aye loved by the men of this fortress we taught them what we could honor duty to you and to our people what else was there you might have taught her that she was a lass roared the prince of wales how demanded his captain there are no women here llywelyn we guard the welshry for you oh occasionally my men seek out a local whore but they are not the kind of women we bring into the fort nor are they the kind of women you would want your daughter associating with my lord prince do not complain to me rhonwyn is a fine young lass even if she has not learned how to simper and preen like the highborn ladies you have undoubtedly been associating with my lord prince do not blame me that your daughter has not the feminine traits you desire her to have if you wanted her to have those virtues you should have taken her to your sister the abbess instead of bringing her here come into the hall now i need a drink if we are to continue this argument ap gruffydd burst out laughing again and followed his captain inside the hall they quaffed cups of apple beer that had been aging in barrels since the previous autumn the beer was strong with just a hint of sweetness their immediate thirst satisfied they sat by the fire pit and the prince explained the reason for his visit i have promised rhonwyn in marriage he said but the bridegroom will expect someone in a gown with a gentle manner not this breeked and swearing huntress you have created out of my child i thought she would be like her mother but she isnt at all how could she be morgan answered she has had no example but ours to follow and we are a fort of rough men jesu mary the prince swore softly again cant you find another of your female relations for this man the captain asked sensibly did you ever even bother to acknowledge rhonwyn and glynn to the church aye that was done years ago the prior in cwm hir at the cistercian monastery was told he has documents with my signature llywelyn ap gruffydd sighed deeply and shook his head the marriage is the unwritten portion of the treaty i signed with king henry at montgomery as a show of good faith i offered rhonwyn in marriage with one of the kings chosen marcher lords in the englishry his name is edward de beaulieu lord thorley of haven castle having offered my daughter i cannot substitute another without appearing to be deceitful with king henry it could jeopardize everything i have worked for morgan certainly you can understand why i will not do that the captain nodded aye i can llywelyn you have worked hard for our people but what are you to do now rhonwyn is hardly anyones idea of a blushing bride he chuckled and his gaze went across the hall to where the girl was dicing and drinking with her companions it was not rhonwyns fault that she was so unsuitable she is a virgin he said as if to cheer his overlord of that i am certain she has no interest in the young men although of late several have approached her she has physically injured them in her refusals at least that is to the good the prince remarked dryly i shall have to take her to my sister at mercy abbey gwynllian will be able to make her into a maiden fit to wed with a lord i know now i should have done that in the first place morgan and perhaps glynn might have been better off there too until he was old enough to be fostered out but i didnt want anyone to know of the children while they were so helpless and i didnt want to separate them when they had just lost their mother so tragically i should have come back for them he sighed the years have gone too quickly and there never seemed to be enough time for them still at least my children have survived he chuckled the english were mightily surprised when i announced i had a young daughter of marriageable age how they would have loved to have rhonwyn as their hostage these years past it might have been better for her if she had been their hostage his captain replied she would have been treated with honor and raised as she should have been raised llywelyn will you take the lad too the prince shook his head nay they are grown now and can be separated glynn can remain with you for the present morgan ap owen knew what that meant glynn ap llywelyn was of no current use to his father and so he could stay where he was perhaps it was better that his lord wasnt married he was not the best of fathers he knew glynn would be devastated to lose the sister he loved so devotedly but morgan thought at least the prince wouldnt attempt to make the boy into a rough soldier glynn was better off with the people who understood him best and they were here at cythraul when will you tell her and when will you take her the captain asked his overlord i must take her immediately for the wedding is set for a month from now we will have to get to mercy abbey as quickly as possible he looked across the hall rhonwyn uerch llywelyn to me he called out she arose to her feet almost reluctantly tossed the dice to one of her companions spit into the rushes and then sauntered across the floor to where morgan and her father sat by the fire pit she bowed but the courtesy was almost insulting what do you wish my lord prince she asked him despite her demeanor her voice he found was musical morgan arose from his seat sit rhonwyn he said she looked at him with startled eyes but sat then she saw the captain leave them she was alone with her sire what did he want of her how much do you know of my accomplishments he asked her enough to realize you are a great lord she replied i ratified a treaty several days ago at montgomery with the english king part of the treaty agreement was a marriage between my blood kin and an english lord it is a show of good faith between us you are to be wed in a months time to edward de beaulieu of haven castle he is not an important man but his family descends from one of the first of king henrys sons born on the body of the heiress of thorley haven castle is small but the lands it possesses are prosperous you are most fortunate to have gained such a fine husband llywelyn ap gruffydd told his daughter watching closely to gauge her reaction to his words but for a long minute rhonwyn said nothing and he could not help but wonder what she was thinking well he finally demanded what is a marriage she said at last the four words stunned him his mouth snapped open and then closed again his first thought was that she was simpleminded but then he knew that not to be the truth why would she know of marriage here in this place a marriage he said slowly and carefully is the formal and legal union between two people it is an honorable estate rhonwyn the treaty i have signed at montgomery with king henry must offer an outward show of trust between us besides our signatures and seals on the parchment in a case like this it has always been the custom to make a marriage between the two sides do you understand at all what i have said to you my daughter what does this marriage involve she finally asked of him what am i expected to do i have been taught i have a duty to you my lord and i would not he derelict in that duty or bring shame upon your good name you will become edward de beaulieus wile his mate you will be expected to manage his home and give him children of your body her green eyes had widened slightly at his words but she yet remained calm i have absolutely no idea of how to do any of the things you have told me i must my lord prince have you not another female relation of your blood who would be better suited for this marriage nay i do not rhonwyn but more important i have given my word that it is my daughter who will marry edward de beaulieu having given my word i must keep it aye she said understanding his pledge was a matter of honor you are my lord and i have been taught i owe you a duty rhonwyn began this marriage is my obligation to you is it not it is he said how amazing she was incredibly ignorant in almost every way but she understood duty and honor he must thank morgan he had expected tears and refusal not this calm acceptance my lack of knowledge and unfamiliarity with the world outside of cythraul may prove an embarrassment to you my lord prince i do not wish to be a liability i would not have people say llywelyn ap gruffydd has gulled the english by sending an unsuitable and uncivilized bride what will you do to help me it was a reasonable request and it pleased him that she was aware of her deficiencies we will leave on the morrow for mercy abbey where my sister your aunt is the abbess she will help you to become the lass you must be rhonwyn and my brother what of him he remains here the prince said i have no use for him at the moment and he is still but half grown he saw the look of anger in her eyes but she strangely remained silent you do not like me rhonwyn do you he probed nay i do not my lord prince you gave me life and you saved my brother and me from death once but i do not like you why should i you have done nought but a scant duty for us but both glynn and i will repay that duty with duty of our own do you have any clean clothing he asked her suddenly weary of their conversation i have what wear my lord you sent no coin or fabric cythraul has little to spare my cousin and his men have done their best by us if it would please you will wash my garments there is a warm wind to dry them in the night and if they are a bit damp on the morrow what matter and wash yourself he ordered her what have you done with your beautiful hair lass long hair does not fit under a helmet my lord prince she answered him sharply leave the helmet here he said you will not need it nor the weapons with which i am told you are so proficient i am to bring the english a sweet virgin to wed not a warrior maid whose skills will terrify them and lead them to believe i meant the bridegroom harm to his surprise rhonwyn laughed aloud i am not like others my age my lord prince am i nay lass you are not he admitted go now dismissed she hurried to find her brother in the kitchen with gwilym she told him everything that had passed between her and their father then she turned to the cook i need your help she said whatever i can do rhonwyn he replied hot water is the best for cleaning will you boil it up for me i have been told to wash both my clothing and my person before we leave in the morning glynn go and beg morgan for the use of his extra sherte i must have something to wear while i wash my own garments and to sleep in tonight while my clothing dries glynn ran off to do his sisters bidding alter ive fed the hall well set up a rack by the fire to dry your things gwilym said the wind will be too clamp and you shouldnt ride wet on the morrow after the meal while i entertain the hall you come down and do what you must i will warn the captain and the prince of your intentions and they will see you are not disturbed she was not as she scrubbed her chemise her sherte and hose her tunic she brushed thoroughly of dirt and dust then after she had hung her garments on the drying rack she polished her wellworn boots the kitchen of the fortresss main building was located beneath the hall rhonwyn barred the doors leading to the kitchen garden and the hall satisfied she was secure she removed morgans sherte and climbed into the small oak washtub to bathe herself the water was still warm and very pleasant on the rare occasions that she bathed she did it like her companions in a nearby stream cold water however was not conducive to a long stay the thin sliver of soap she had used to wash her clothing easily removed the dirt from her person and hair rhonwyn climbed from the tub and rubbed herself dry with a rough cloth she couldnt ever remember having been totally naked morgan had always insisted she bathe in her chemise when she went to the stream to wash herself curiously she began to examine her body her breasts seemed to be growing larger each year she had a thick tangle of curls on the mound between her thighs it was just slightly darker than her pale hair since she had caught a glimpse of glynn once with the same thatch it didnt bother her as much as her burgeoning breasts she pulled the sherte back on then sat by the kitchen fire to comb out her short wet hair she could hear gwilym and glynn in the hall their voices rising in a duet she climbed the stairs and slipped back into the hall going to her bedspace she and glynn now had separate sleeping areas for morgan had decided several years ago that they were both too big in form to make sleeping together comfortable any longer now her brother was singing a tale of love lost and found again rhonwyn felt her eyes growing heavy with the sweet sound of his voice glynn came to wake her just before dawn climbing into the sleeping space with his sister to ask what will happen to me now rhonwyn why is tad leaving me here alone he pressed his thin frame next to her seeking reassurance and comlort he says you are but half grown and so be has no use for you yet she answered her brother putting a protective arm about him i am afraid the boy admitted nay you need not be she tried to reassure him you will be in the place you know best with morgan who is our mothers kin and with gwilym both care for you as they would a son little brother some of the others do not like me they say you are more our fathers son than i am glynn told her do not listen to such things rhonwyn replied thinking angrily she would like to get her hands on those who would hurt her brother we have never been parted rhonwyn his face was woebegone where is tad taking you why can i not come i must learn to be a wife you cannot come with me to mercy abbey it is a place for women only but when i am married to this lord i will ask him to let you come and live with us glynn there is more i am beginning to realize to the world in which we live than just cythraul you are not meant to be a soldier like the prince there is something that you can be but you cannot learn that here at cythraul tell no one of what i have said to you except perhaps morgan and gwilym i have never lied to you glynn i promise you i will send for you when i can she kissed his cheek and then shoved him from the bedspace go to the kitchen and bring me my clothing from the drying rack he ran off and rhonwyn lay quietly for the next few minutes she was wide awake now and a little nervous today she would leave her home forever soon she would leave the princes realm as well for england what was it like would it have the green hills and deep valleys of wales would she like this lord she was to marry would he like her did it even matter she had a duty and she would perform it to the best of her ability so as not to bring shame upon her lord father glynn had returned with her garments and rhonwyn dressed herself carefully beneath the furs then climbing from her bedspace she ran her fingers through her cropped hair to neaten it she pulled on the boots glynn had left by her bedside stamping her feet the boots were just a bit short now her feet were obviously still growing she pulled her tunic down and buckled her belt about her narrow waist sliding her dagger with its horn handle into its sheath in the hall the men were stirring now and hurrying out into the courtyard to pee gwilym brought a kettle of porridge from the kitchen and began ladling it into the round trenchers of bread upon the table rhonwyn sat in her usual place with glynn and ate silently higher up the board morgan sat with llywelyn ap gruffydd eating and talking occasionally they would glance at her and rhonwyn wondered what they were saying about her around her the men ate silently or spoke in low morning tones finally the prince arose it is time for us to leave rhonwyn are you ready where is your pack lass i have nothing to carry but what i wear my lord she answered him you have instructed that i leave my weapons behind rhonwyn stood llywelyn ap gruffydd looked at his daughter she seemed very young and vulnerable in the light of the morning she was well scrubbed he could see but her garments were practically threadbare and as simple as any soldiers the brown tunic unornamented and plain made her look so pale yet the girl was in good health for a moment he felt guilty that he had not until he needed her thought of her say your goodbyes lass he instructed her gruffly and then he left the hall they crowded about her these men who had raised her since she was just a wee girl rough soldiers with tears in their eyes their voices broke when they instructed her to be a good lass remember what they had taught her and not forget them they turned away one by one each wishing her good luck but morgan ap owen who loved her best said this is your home i am your blood kin if you need me i will come then he kissed her cheek and led her out into the courtyard where the prince and her brother awaited her glynn had been crying she could see rhonwyn put her arms about him dont she pleaded or i could weep too be patient and i will send for you brother we will not be parted for long you never cry he said softly you are the strong one and you the clever one she replied kissing his damp cheek i love you glynn you are safe here at cythraul glynn gave her a half grin tad sees what i am and is too wise to make me change i shall make up a poem about you rhonwyn and sing it in the hall tonight they shall all weep for you sister the siblings hugged and only ap gruffydds voice broke their tender embrace when you come to me rhonwyn instructed her brother bring my weapons with you glynn but tell no one do you understand she looked directly into his eyes and then smiled once more rhonwyn mounted her horse a gray gelding with a black mane and tail that morgan had obtained for her two years ago when she had outgrown the dainty old mare the gelding was a big beast with large hooves ap gruffydd was a little surprised to see his daughter mounted so and remarked on it the animal is steady morgan ap owen replied i wanted her to have a safe horse the prince turned his mount and led them through the gates of cythraul and down the hill upon which it sat rhonwyn rode by his side they did not speak behind them the troop of men accompanying ap gruffydd also rode silently rhonwyn realized that even the hooves of the horses were relatively quiet as they moved along it was unlikely an enemy would bear them until the soldiers were upon them when the sun was at the midpoint in the sky they stopped if you want to pee ap gruffydd said go into the bushes she took his advice going deep into the greenery when she returned she was handed a chunk of bread and a wedge of cheese she ate swiftly cramming the food into her mouth the prince passed her his flask and she swallowed the liquid within without thinking the taste of apple on her tongue told her it was cider they remounted and continued on their way as they crossed an open meadow rhonwyn said low how long will it take to reach our destination my lord until tomorrow late he told her she was about to offer to hunt for their dinner when she realized she didnt have her bow she swore softly beneath her breath and the prince chuckled you cannot say words like that any longer rhonwyn he told her ladies do not swear and i fear your aunt would beat you black and blue if she heard such language she had best not raise her hand to me rhonwyn responded darkly i am not an animal and i have never allowed anyone to beat me morgan did not punish you when you were naughty ap gruffydd was surprised by the revelation he did not feel he had the right to lay his hand on your children he had other ways of punishing us he would forbid me from my horse or take my alborium from me so i could not hunt glynn was rarely bad a harsh look could set him crying rhonwyn told ap gruffydd my brother is a gentle lad he is not meant to be a soldier but there are so many things he is good at that there is surely a place for him in this world the prince said nothing more he was no fool and understood what she was telling him and he had seen his son was not fit for a military life he had spawned either a bard or a priest he was not yet certain once they could determine if the boy liked women then he would know he could not be sure if he wanted a priest in the family his sister the abbess was more than enough he smiled to himself gwynllian would certainly be surprised to learn he had two children she was always railing at him for not getting married and he was always telling her he did not have time for a wife and family if wales was to be independent well it was true vala had been content to wait in her cottage for him to come she had never whined or complained at him for not being more attentive vala had understood what he was doing how many wives would have soon enough he would need a highborn mate whose family and connections could help him keep what he had gained but not yet he glanced sideways at his daughter while she had her mothers coloring she was his spit although her features were more softened and feminine he smiled to himself again his timing was always just right where his children were concerned he had come just in time to save them from death now he was just in time to keep rhonwyn from becoming a soldier gwynllian was going to have her work cut out for her his daughter was ignorant and crude it was going to cost him a large gift to mercy abbey to turn her into a refined and blushing bride for edward de beaulieu but if anyone could do it it was gwynllian as the sun was setting behind the western mountains they stopped once again a camp was set up with a fire over which roasted the rabbits his men had caught along the way that day the horses were led to a nearby stream to drink and then allowed to browse about the trees where they were tied the company ate and then settled down for the night rhonwyn had never slept outdoors belore she found it both exciting and a little frightening the night noises seemed louder and more mysterious than the noises she heard during the day still she managed to get some sleep belore the prince was shaking her awake as they rode in the cold and dark dawn hour ap gruffydd handed his daughter an oatcake to eat it was hard and virtually tasteless she chewed it slowly nonetheless quieting the rumbling in her stomach she already missed gwilyms hot morning porridge they rode again until the noon hour stopped to rest and water the horses then continued on once more the countryside was beautiiul and lonely they passed no fortresses or cottages in the very late afternoon as the sun was sinking they crested a ridge and there in a lovely valley below stood a cluster of stone buildings it looked a bit grim and forbidding in the late autumn light she heard a noise and turned to the prince what is that sound my lord she asked tis the pealing of a bell rhonwyn have you never heard a church bell lass he was surprised by her ignorance as always i dont even know what a church is my lord she replied he chuckled richly oh gwynllian was going to have her hands full his elder sister had always lorded over him and his brothers when they were growing up now he would have his revenge for all of them he would wager that gwynllian had never had a lass like rhonwyn in her custody he almost wished he could be there to see the inevitable confrontation that was sure to ensue between his daughter and his sister then it dawned upon him how much alike the two were he laughed aloud what amuses you my lord rhonwyn inquired of him nothing lass really nothing he told her that he pointed with a gloved fingeris your destination that is mercy abbey will i like it there she wondered probably not he replied honestly you have a great deal to learn rhonwyn in a very short time it is important that you learn else i be made to appear a liar i have enemies i am not surprised she said dryly he laughed again there was an honesty about his daughter that he very much liked you have a duty to me rhonwyn uerch llywelyn what you have to do will not be easy but i know you can do it for you are not i have been told someone who shirks a duty and you are loyal my kinsman morgan ap owen speaks kindly of me rhonwyn said with a small smile but he does not lie i will do what i must to meet my obligations to you prince of wales and i do not lie chapter gwynllian the lady abbess of mercy abbey looked down her long thin nose at her brother they could have been twins so similar were they in face and form and what o prince of wales brings you to my house this day she demanded of him she was a tall thin woman whose long black robes and startling white wimple made her appear even taller and more spare an ebony crucifix banded in silver and adorned with a silver lily in its center lay on her almost flat bosom can i not come to visit my only sister without reason he replied jovially jesu he hated having to beg you came six or was it seven years ago llywelyn you were seeking funding for your neverending disputes with the english or your fellow cymri cannot remember which we gave you what we could and you were as quickly gone now what do you want brother and do not waste my time in prevarications and halftruths she said sternly ap gruffydd reached behind him and drew rhonwyn forward this is my daughter he said to his sister her mouth fell open and then closed with an audible snap well llywelyn you have surprised me for the first time in years you are certain of course the abbess peered at her niece and immediately recognized her as kin her mother was my mistress he began she gave me two children first a daughter then a son she died attempting to birth a third child i came by chance and found my children yet alive i brought them to cythraul the lad his name is glynn is still there gwynllians brown eyes swept over the girl at her brothers side she hardly looked like an orphan of the storm she looked hard and quite capable of taking care of herself how long ago did you leave your children at cythraul she asked her brother fearing the answer he flushed guiltily ten years ago he said ten years and seven moon cycles the girl spoke up for the first time the look she gave the prince was scathing why bring her to me now llywelyn the abbess said i spent the summer in shrewsbury hammering out an agreement with the english king henry my ally de montfort is dead and henrys cub edward is a fierce man i thought to make a treaty with henry so that his heir will leave us in peace the pact was signed at montgomery at the end of october you know the customs gwyn i offered the english my daughter in marriage with one of their lordlings but when you went to fetch her she wasnt quite what you had expected was she llywelyn the abbess chuckled then she looked to her niece what is your name child and what have you done to your hair and do you know your age my name is rhonwyn uerch llywelyn and i like my hair kept short she was fifteen april first last ap gruffydd said who raised her the abbess inquired morgan ap owen my captain at cythraul was the reply were there no women at this fortress the abbess exclaimed shocked tis a fort in the welshry women dont belong there ap gruffydd told his sister no they dont yet you left your daughter there llywelyn you are truly the most thoughtless and foolish man i have ever known for all you have managed to become prince of wales the abbess said angrily why did you not bring rhonwyn to me in the first place what do you expect me to do with her now cythraul was nearer to her mothers cottage less than a days ride to bring my children to you would have taken me almost three days of traveling i had not the time could you not have instructed morgan ap owen to bring them to me you dolt she swatted at him indignantly she isnt lit to be wed he said his voice desperate has she become a whore then the abbess demanded i am no mans whore rhonwyn said angrily nay nay that is not it sister ap gruffydd replied she is ignorant totally ignorant morgan and his men loved my children and protected them but they could teach them only what they knew my daughter has a knack for war and weapons she is it seems a worthy successor to me my son prefers to compose songs and poetry and has no talent for a warriors pursuits at all hes only fit to be a bard or a priest you must teach rhonwyn how to be what she is meant to be a lass not a lad how can i give her in marriage when she doesnt even know what marriage is she must be taught the norman tongue for as you see she speaks only our language she needs to learn how to wear skirts not chausses and braies she must be a christian sister yet she has no idea of religion or faith she says moon cycles not months i dont even know if she has her womans flow yet you must gentle her gwynllian so that in a months time i may take her to edward de beaulieu at havens castle to be wed the abbess laughed aloud amonths time you are mad llywelyn it will take more than a month to tame this bedraggled fierceeyed wildcat you have brought me if indeed i can do it at all if she does not cooperate then you are out of luck brother how could you promise a daughter you had not seen in ten years to an english treaty marriage what in the name of all that is holy were you thinking were you thinking at all then what the hell am i to do gwyn he asked her running a big hand through his dark hair the abbess turned to rhonwyn do you understand any of this my child aye i do rhonwyn said my lord has explained to me that a marriage is a formal and respectable union between a man and a woman it is honorable it is my obligation to my lord to take part in this marriage i know how to do my duty well the abbess remarked to her brother she may have little learning but she is i believe intelligent she turned to her niece you are willing to be married to edward de beaulieu is there a choice in the matter rhonwyn said nay there is not the abbess told her then i am willing and will do my duty came the cool reply you have much to learn my child the abbess said then teach me rhonwyn answered the abbess turned to her brother tell edward de beaulieu that his bride is finishing her education at mercy abbey and will leave here in early april for haven castle a messenger will arrive before her to announce her coming but she will be there before midmonth he may prepare for the marriage ceremony then and you will bring your daughter to him yourself it is unlikely your future soninlaw will object to this arrangement he may have some small pursuits and matters to clear up before a bride can come to him she smiled suddenly at him this favor will cost you dearly llywelyn i know he responded wearily she chuckled i shall make a list of my demands none of which are negotiable brother he nodded whatever you want gwyn he said the abbess turned again to her niece your first lesson my child is in how to address me when i speak to you you will conclude your answer with the words my lady abbess do you understand rhonwyn aye my lady abbess came the reply the nun smiled excellent i like her rhonwyn thought to herself she understands me as no one ever has understood me the abbess reached out picked up a small bell on the table and rang it almost immediately another woman dressed in the same fashion entered the room yes my lady abbess this is my niece sister catrin she will be staying with us for the next few months preparing for her marriage to the lord of haven castle she is a true innocent raised in an isolated place by a group of pagans give her a chamber in the guest house rhonwyn you will stay there until i send for you bid your father farewell now my child rhonwyn turned to the prince and bowed politely my lord i shall return for you in the spring he said rhonwyn laughed wickedly will you my lord i certainly hope so the abbesss lips twitched with amusement as she saw the color flood her brothers face this is different rhonwyn he told her through gritted teeth this is a matter of my honor rhonwyn nodded her head slightly in acknowledgment and then followed sister catrin from the abbesss receiving chamber she has your temper gwynllian remarked amused i hope you will find it as humorous when you must deal with her he shot back now write your damned list of demands sister on reflection i realize it is not necessary to write a list i can tell you exactly what i want first you will pay the expenses for your daughters schooling we are not a rich house you will go to hereford and purchase a generous supply of fine materials so we may garb her properly for her marriage and subsequent life you will take a pattern of her feet and have proper shoes made for her you will purchase veils gloves a good jeweled girdle as well as some small but fine pieces of jewelry she is your daughter llywelyn and if you are the prince of wales then the lady rhonwyn is a noblewoman of the first ranking and while you are in hereford you will go to the convent of saint mary on the east side of the town they are a very small house and always in great financial distress i am informed they possess a saints relic that want brother for this abbey it is a fingernail paring from st cuthbert himself and is kept in a bejeweled golden box on the altar in their church pay what you must but bring me that relic llywelyn you want me to go into england and negotiate for a saints relic with a nun before or after i purchase lovely fabrics fine pieces of jewelry and the other geegaws you desire for my daughter he snapped name your price gwynllian and i will pay it but i will not go myself i have much work to do keeping the peace you will have no peace brother if you do not deliver your daughter to be wed to the englishman and you cannot bring her to them as she is they would refuse her and say you had insulted them and compromised the treaty we are not so isolated here that i do not know prince edward will prove a dangerous enemy to you once he is king i told you there would be no negotiation between us in this matter rhonwyn may remain here while you go and bargain for my relic o prince of wales when you return with it i will begin her tutelage but not a moment before then she drew herself up to her full height and stared directly at him the longer you delay llywelyn the less time i have to turn this mutton you have brought me into a sweet little lambkin you are the damnedest woman he complained to her you always were impossible gwyn and i suspect that rhonwyn is just like you he laughed very well i will go myself and dicker for your saints discarded fingernail if necessary he told her darkly i will steal it but you shall have it sister and then you must keep your part of our bargain do not steal it llywelyn she warned him sternly if you do i cannot display it i am not capricious in my desire for this relic i would draw pilgrims to mercy abbey to ask the saints blessing such a relic will prove profitable to us it did not to st marys in hereford he remarked that is because they could claim no great miracles of it the abbess replied with a small smile i am certain the saints fingernail paring will be more content with us and work to the glory of god and mercy abbey brother in fact i sense it in my heart he laughed roughly you are a devious woman gwynllian and i thank god you were not born a man owain daffydd and rhodri our brothers were easy opponents but you sister would have been stronger than all three of them i am not surprised you are abbess here she smiled archly at him always remember llywelyn that i am your equal our brothers were not are these all your demands he asked i will also want a virile young ram twenty ewe sheep and a bag with a donation of ten gold coins i will take either bezants ducats or florins but their weight must be true make certain none of the coins has been clipped these are all my requirements she finished her dark eyes were dancing with pleasure at his look you will beggar me sister the sheep i can obtain but where the hell am i going to get so much gold for you it is too much no negotiation llywelyn she reminded him he swore a particularly vile oath and the abbess laughed as he glared at her havent heard those words in many years brother she mocked him i had almost forgotten they existed my daughter had better be able to compete with any princess alive when this is over and done with sister he warned her she will the abbess promised then she softened a bit it is already dark brother may i offer you and your men shelter for the night nay he snapped if i stay a moment longer with you i may be tempted to kill you gwynllian there is a moon well ride on i said my farewell to rhonwyn and now i bid you adieu he bowed briefly and then stamped from the receiving chamber the abbess smiled softly as the door closed behind her brother his brief visit had proved highly fortuitous for the abbey he would do all she had asked him because he needed rhonwyn for a treaty bride then gwynllian grew more thoughtful it was an enormous task she had been set and she had to complete it successfully then suddenly she realized her brother had not taken rhonwyns foot pattern ringing for a nun she sent the woman quickly after her brother so he could complete the task and get her niece decent shoes in hereford she glided from her receiving room and across the abbey quadrangle to the guest house there she found sister catrin seated with rhonwyn she dismissed the nun and joined the girl by the brazier well hes gone ive exacted a very high price from him for my help you are going to have to work very hard my child she chuckled i could always get the better of your father and our other brothers you know none of them do you nay my lady abbess at cythraul morgan told me that the prince had overthrown and imprisoned his elder brother owain and his younger brother daffydd the youngest brother rhodri is not an ambitious man it was said he sounds like my brother glynn if wales is to be united there can be but one ruler the abbess answered her niece your father finds it hard bowing his knee to any even almighty god he only knelt to the english because by doing so he obtained what he wanted there is no shame in that rhonwyn considered the abbess chuckled you are a practical lass i see that is to the good i told your father i would do nothing to help you until he fulfilled his word to me but that is not true although he will believe it having never caught me in a lie you have so much to learn that we must begin tomorrow if we are to have any chance of passing you off as a noblewoman in six months time llywelyn will do what he must for me now tell me child you have never had any women companions not since mam died rhonwyn answered her aunt she looked about the little hall of the guest house am i to stay here alone my lady abbess i have never been alone before gwynllian shook her head i have two young postulants with us right now who are near your age they will come and make their beds with you rhonwyn so you will not be by yourself they must of course attend to their own duties during the day but you will be busy with your studies they will share your chamber you will eat together in the refectory with the community and you may take walks in the gardens we do not have a school like some other convents so you will he unique as a student my child what of my horse rhonwyn asked it is salely in the stables do well at your studies and i will permit you to rule it the abbess said but hardd needs his exercise my lady abbess rhonwyn protested you may walk him daily belore your lessons my child but there will be no riding unless you progress in your duties the abbess said then she held up her hand to prevent the further protest she saw on rhonwyns lips one of your first lessons is obedience which means doing what you are told by your superiors you obeyed morgan ap owen because he was your captain or superior you must obey me for the same reason my child obedience and good manners can cover a multitude of other sins rhonwyn you have been raised in a community of rough men i know they had good hearts for i can see you miss them and you would not had they been unkind but soldiers are not the best example for a young girl to follow come with me now and we will go to the refectory to have something to eat tonight i will excuse you and the companions i have chosen for you from compline but beginning tomorrow you will attend mass daily then she patted rhonwyns hand you know nothing of god and our dear lord jesus do you my child this is all very confusing i can see do not be afraid of your innocence and your ignorance rhonwyn you will quickly learn i promise you you are an intelligent girl and your mind i already see is facile for the first time in her life rhonwyn found herself uncertain and retiring she followed her aunt from the guest house to the refectory which she quickly learned was a place where the nuns dined the women who lived in this abbey were called nuns they were also called sister except her aunt who was reverend mother or my lady abbess and the nuns were ranked according to the position they held within the community her companions elen and arlais were called postulants and were the lowest on the abbeys social scale being considered candidates for the religious order the novices and there were five of them currently had completed their years training as postulants and now were spending the next two years preparing to take their final vows the vows were those of poverty chastity and obedience rhonwyn knew what poverty and obedience meant chastity she learned was a promise to remain pure which meant no going beneath a hedge with a man or doing what her father used to do with her mother the nuns devoted their lives to god the supreme being she hadnt heard enough of god at cythraul to make any sense of him now her new companions elen and arlais spent their evenings teaching rhonwyn as they would have taught their children had they wed instead of entering the abbey they found rhonwyn rather fascinating never having known anyone like her before but they also treated her with respect for she was the abbesss niece and the princes daughter elen and arlais were the daughters of freedmen who farmed their own land the three girls got on rather well despite their dissimilar backgrounds rhonwyn went with her companions to the early church services of the day prime at six oclock in the morning and tierce the high mass at nine oclock in the morning she attended vespers before nightfall but was excused from the other five canonical hours after prime she broke her fast in the refectory with oat porridge in a small bread trencher and apple cider she then sat with sister mair until tierce practicing how to write both letters and numbers sister mair did the lettering on the illuminations the abbey sold to noble households after tierce rhonwyn studied with her aunt learning latin and the norman tongue to the abbesss delight her niece had a facility for languages other than the welsh tongue and learned far more quickly than she had hoped within a month rhonwyn was reciting the latin prayers in the church services she attended as if she had been doing it all her life and she was beginning to read as well her ability with the norman tongue was equally swift and rhonwyn was soon conversing in that language on a daily basis with her aunt both in and out of the classroom gwynllian uerch gryffydd gave thanks before the altar of the church daily for her nieces progress it was truly miraculous alter the midday meal rhonwyn joined sister una in the kitchens so she might see bow meals were planned and prepared here her progress was not as quick and sister una complained to the abbess that her niece could burn water the infirmarian sister dicra was kinder for her new pupil seemed to have a knack for healing and concocting the potions salves lotions syrups and teas needed to cure a cough or make a wound heal easier the lass has a healing touch reverend mother sister dicra said enthusiastically shell need it to cure the bellyaches shes going to give with her cooking sister una remarked dryly she doesnt need to know how to cook the abbess said just how it should be done the castle will have its own cook have you taught her how to make soap for both clothing and skin yet we begin tomorrow sister una replied i hope she has more of a knack for that the abbess turned to sister braith how is she coming with her weaving embroidery and sewing skills my sister slowly answered the nun rhonwyn has little patience as you know she finds sewing and embroidery foolish weaving however seems to calm her she says there is a logic to it chuckled sister braith i have shown her how to spin and she seems to like that quite well they were progressing slowly in some areas faster in others the abbess thought silently the fabrics have arrived from hereford she told her companions we shall have to fill rhonwyns bridal chest ourselves if it is to get done and the relic sister winifred inquired my brother sends word he has obtained it at great cost he is bringing it to us himself the prince arrived several days later accompanied only by two of his men he handed the bejeweled gold box to his sister twenty gold florins this cost me he growled at her the mother superior at st marysinthegate ought to be hawking maidenheads she haggled so closely with me it had better be worth it gwynllian would you like to see your daughter the abbess asked him as she stroked her prize you have begun then he said eagerly visibly relieved of course she told him there was no choice if we are to be ready by spring llywelyn she reached for the bell on the table and rang it instructing the nun who answered her call to fetch the lady rhonwyn at once llywelyn ap gruffydd gaped in surprise for a moment as his daughter entered the room she was garbed in a graceful deep blue gown with long tight sleeves and girded at the waist with a simple twisted gold rope her pale gilt hair was beginning to grow out it was clean and almost to her shoulders now on her head she wore a simple chaplet with fresh flowers she bowed to her aunt first and then to her father you sent for me my lady abbess she asked your father wished to see you before he departed my child gwynllian answered quietly shes speaking in the norman tongue ap gruffydd said excitedly i am learning my lord i am told this is the language the english use although there is another rhonwyn replied aye but what youre learning is what youll need the prince turned to his sister the transformation is amazing are you certain she isnt ready to go yet nay llywelyn she most certainly is not the abbess said do not be in such a hurry this is small progress and we have much more to do not to mention a wardrobe to sew you cannot take her until the spring come on her birthday unless of course in the meantime she decides to become one of us the abbess teased her brother god forbid the prince cried rhonwyn laughed i lave no fear my lord this life your sister my aunt leads is not for me i will be ready to do my duty when you return for me in april bid your farewell rhonwyn and then you are dismissed gwynllian said adieu my lord rhonwyn told him bowing again then she departed the room she never calls you tad gwynllian remarked softly the lad does he returned rhonwyn holds me responsible for her mams death she has never liked me sister with the logic of a child she wanted her mam all to herself and she resented it each time i came to visit my fair vala she has never gotten over it i fear but it matters not as long as she respects and obeys me i do not know how much she respects you llywelyn but she will do her duty by you rhonwyn will do you proud and if she proves to be a good breeder her english lord will have a large family she will need her husbands loyalty when you and the english eventually come to a parting of the ways which i have not a doubt you will that is her fate mine is greater he replied now sister i must go you have your relic and everything else you have asked of me he handed her two small leather bags my daughters fees he said dropping the first one in her hand and your gold bezants he concluded handing her the second little bag i am pleased by the progress i see in rhonwyn when i return for her in the spring i expect a complete transformation you will have it brother gwynllian said i know i will your word has always been good sister and i thank you for what you are doing even if it has cost me dearly she laughed at him do not complain llywelyn that for which you pay nothing is worth nothing godspeed to you now the winter came and snow covered the hills the sheep were brought in from the far pastures and kept within the walls at night to protect them from the wolves it was a festive season rhonwyn discovered the feast of st catherine was celebrated in late november and there were a host of other saints days leading up to christs mass which celebrated the birth of jesus whom rhonwyn had now been taught was gods son come to earth to expiate mans sins for all her rough upbringing rhonwyn found christianity comforting the notion of a gods son dying for mere mortals was both generous and honorable in her eyes the abbess smiled when rhonwyn told her that she was grateful her niece approved of the concept of religion at all while she found the thought of delivering a fullblown pagan to the english amusing she did not think her brother would agree she giggled in spite of herself at the picture it presented then she saw to it that her niece was baptized on christmas day with twelfth night came the end of the festive season rhonwyn settled down and worked harder than ever she was learning that the brain was as difficult and as skilled a weapon as her alborium she was now put in the care of sister rhan a nun whose plump and cheerful countenance belied an incredible intellect sister rhan somewhere in middle age had once according to the gossip elen and arlais offered been a powerful lords mistress if the rumors were to be believed she had also dressed as a boy and studied with the greatest minds in england youhave intelligence rhonwyn sister rhan said the first time they came to study together your intellect and reason will serve you far better in the long run than your body that is how i held my lords interest for so many years until he died then the gossip is true rhonwyn was surprised to hear the nun admitting to what she had now been taught was a sin sister rhan laughed aye tis true and i have never made a secret of it my child once i loved and was loved i was faithful to him as he was to me but he had a wife rhonwyn said indeed he did and a very good woman the lady arlette was too she brought him excellent lands to add to his own and gave him healthy children whom she raised to be regardful and devout he treated her with devotion and great respect even as he did me we each served a purpose in his life when he died his lady wife and i washed his body and sewed him into his shroud together she is a benefactress of mercy abbey now a man can love more than one woman then rhonwyn said thoughtfully i did not know that i thought once the choice was made and the vows spoken a husband and wife cleaved to each other only ideally but not always sister rhan answered her but we are not here my child to discuss my past sins you have mastered both norman and latin you can read and write it as well although sometimes you are impatient with your letters your housewifely skills are at best passable but you do not shine in that venue the abbess believes your mind can absorb more serious learning and so she has sent you to me we shall study together grammar rhetoric logic music arithmetic and astronomy i will help you to become a support to your husband so even when he becomes bored with your young body he will find your mind invaluable to him you will find much satisfaction in aiding your lord for the betterment of your lives and the lives of the children you will have together rhonwyn then marital love doesnt last the young girl observed if there is love at all and do not mistake lust for love sister rhan warned her what is the difference rhonwyn demanded to know how shall i make the distinction excellent excellent the nun approved you are thinking the abbess was right to send you to me lust is when your bodies crave each other for no reason the urge will be strong and fierce love however is an entirely different thing love is a powerful yearning not just for the body of the object of your affection but for everything about him you will be unhappy out of his sight the mere sound of his voice will set your heart to racing you will put his interests ahead of your own because you want him to be happy ideally he will feel the same about you just being held in his arms will bring you a warm contentment ah my child love is very difficult to explain you will know it when it strikes you and you will find that when you make love then it is entirely different than just pure and unbridled lust i know nothing of either marital love or lust rhonwyn said at cythraul my brother and i were the fortresss children lately however young men newly come into our midst had tried to feel my breasts and kiss me i beat them with my fists and the others beat them afterward with rods for their temerity was what they attempted lust the nun nodded it was and you felt nothing toward them nay rhonwyn replied vehemently they were pockmarked lads and nowhere near as skilled as i am with weapons i think i must respect the man who uses my body and loves me a wise decision my child now let me turn the subject to the matter of arithmetic it is best you have some familiarity with computation and calculation that way if your husband goes off to war you will be able to be certain the steward doesnt cheat you you know your numbers i am told so let us now begin she held up two fingers on her right hand how many she asked two rhonwyn said and now how many the nun revealed two fingers on her left hand two there as well rhonwyn said but how many altogether sister rhan asked rhonwyn quickly scanned the digits counting mentally four that is correct and that my child is called adding she reached into a basket by the table where they sat and brought up a device with several rows of beads which she set on the table this is called an abacus rhonwyn now watch she slid two beads from one side of the instrument to the other two and two more equal how many four take away one head how many three excellent that second calculation is called subtraction sister rhan explained they quickly discovered that rhonwyn had a talent for arithmetic each day she increased her knowledge until sister rhan assured the abbess that her niece would never be cheated by anyone at least not where arithmetic was concerned grammar and logic appealed to the young girl but while her handwriting improved markedly rhonwyn seemed to have no real talent for rhetoric and she knew it my brother would do well with it she told her teacher he makes up stories and poems and puts them to music that he sings in the hall of cythraul i think he will be a great bard one day her time was growing shorter at mercy abbey and her days it seemed were busy from dawn to dusk her two companions elen and arlais ended their trial as postulants and became novices the three girls had never really become close having different interests but rhonwyn was pleased that they were halfway to attaining their hearts desire rhonwyn on the other hand was suddenly beginning to consider her forthcoming marriage she would not meet her husbandtobe until just before they married such a thing was not unusual her aunt said now as well as increasing her education rhonwyn was being fitted for her wardrobe her father had brought fine materials indeed for his daughter and gwynllian could not complain at him for being niggardly in either his choices or the quantity there were silks and velvets and brocades as well as linen and fine cottons the fabrics were rich and colorful rhonwyn was shocked however to learn women did not wear braies beneath their gowns ive worn mine all along since you put me in a gown she told her aunt what is substituted to cover the bottom ladies wear nought beneath their chemises gwynllian replied nothingthegirls eyes were wide your skirts will cover all i assure you rhonwyn the abbess said it is quite acceptable i dont think it respectable was the answer gwynllians lips twitched but she managed to keep from chuckling her niece was more prudish than she would have expected of a girl raised in a fortress of men were it not for the childs continuing warlike tendencies the abbess would have believed her a candidate for the nunnery and not marriage but rhonwyn still rode daily outside the gates of the abbey galloping along at a breakneck speed that had the porteress almost swooning at rhonwyns maneuvers on march the twentieth the abbey celebrated the feast of st cuthbert who had been a bishop of lindisfarne and whose fingernail paring now resided in its bejeweled gold box on the abbeys church altar it was bruited about that the relic could cure a variety of minor illnesses but as it was not a large memorial great miracles could not be expected of it rut the pilgrims came nonetheless to touch the gold box and pray to the saint the abbey coffers grew at a modest but steady pace that day april first the day marking rhonwyns sixteenth birthday came and llywelyn ap gruffydd appeared to reclaim his daughter her cool elegant demeanor was slightly intimidating but her manners were flawless he was rather astounded to learn of all her accomplishments since her arrival at the abbey almost six months ago he was equally appalled by the amount of baggage she would be leaving with but accepted his sisters explanation on the matter and her dictate that he could not leave until the morrow rhonwyn had been turned from a roughspeaking halflad into a beautiful young woman her cropped hair had grown out it was parted in the center and hung down her back contained by a simple silver ribbon her bosom seemed larger which was to his mind all to the good men liked a woman with plump breasts she no longer walked with determined strides but rather glided gracefully the hands that had held a sword were now perfumed and soft and the long fingers that bad so skillfully drawn her bow now plucked at the strings of the mandora in her lap while she sang softly the english could have no complaints about his daughter you have worked a miracle gwynllian he told the abbess yes she agreed with a small arch smile she is more than well worth the price you have paid for her transformation however brother i must be honest with you were rhonwyn not an intelligent girl none of this would have been possible and you should show the men of cythraul some appreciation for they are the ones who taught her honor and duty while turning her into a rough foulmouthed soldier he grumbled at his sister and that cost me a fortune to reverse i am tempted to burn cythraul down about their ears this is not someone elses fault llywelyn the abbess said sternly to her brother this mishap was your failing you know it and you know why put it behind you and tomorrow take your daughter to england to her husband remember however this time you travel with a lady and not a laddie then the abbess chuckled at her own small play on words the morning of april second came and rhonwyns baggage was loaded into a sturdy cart she bid the sisters farewell taking special time to thank those nuns who had given her all the knowledge she now possessed particularly sister rhan and the abbess remember my child that you will always have a home and a refuge here at mercy abbey gwynllian told her may god bless you with happiness and many children not too many rhonwyn teased her aunt but i do promise to save at least one girl for you my lady abbess with a chuckle the abbess hugged her niece kissing her on the cheek godspeed rhonwyn uerch llywelyn she said mounted upon hardd rhonwyn rode through the abbey gates by her fathers side she heard the portals close behind her but she was not sad she was free from the constrictions of the nuns at last and off on a new adventure they had turned her into a mannerly lady but they had not tamed her spirit nor dimmed her enthusiasm for life she had spent these past months in earnest study so she could be worthy of her fathers name and her new position now she must turn her mind to edward de beaulieu the man who was to be her husband she couldnt even begin to imagine what he would be like but over the next few days of their journey she tried chapter the messenger has arrived from prince llywelyn my lord the servant said bowing to his master bring him into the hall came the reply yes my lord the servant bowed again and backed away some feet before turning about he returned only moments later the messenger from prince llywelyn my lord edward de beaulieu glanced briefly at the rugged welshman my master and the lady rhonwyn will be here by nightfall my lord he said then he fell silent i await them was the brief answer cold bastard the messenger thought as he bowed to the lord of haven castle and departed the place to ride back to ap gruffydd with the reply edward de beaulieu watched him go and then absently took the silver goblet of wine his servant offered him staring into the dancing red gold flames in the fireplace he wasnt ready to marry yet he would shortly have a wife a wild welsh girl half his age but having no betrothal agreement with another and being located so conveniently near the border the king had chosen him to be his sacrificial lamb in this treaty marriage he had considered refusing but prince edward had stared hard at him when the king announced his decision and edward de beaulieu had known he dared not refuse the prince was an enemy he was not interested in having when the welsh prince had asked the marriage be delayed until this spring because his daughter was completing her education at mercy abbey edward de beaulieu had been pleased to acquiesce he had an attractive mistress and was in no hurry to wed when he thought of it though a conventbred wife did have her advantages she would be meek and obedient keeping his home in excellent condition and bearing his children haven had known no lady since his mother had died seven years ago while he had enjoyed the company of his mistress renee de faubourg these past months he had pensioned her off several weeks ago with her own house in shrewsbury and an annual allowance he placed with a reputable goldsmith a wife was to be respected and if the truth be known he was beginning to tire of renee he wondered what the welsh girl would be like she would probably be small for so many of the welsh were and she would have dark hair and eyes and a fair skin he wondered if she spoke the norman tongue or if she was conversant only in welsh it probably didnt matter a great deal as no words were really needed when a man took a woman to his bed she would eventually learn of course if she was to control the servants still he couldnt help but feel annoyed at having been forced to this marriage but the girl had had no choice either and was not to be blamed hopefully they would like one another and could come to an arrangement that would guarantee peace between them he was uncomfortable however having llywelyn ap gruffydd as a fatherinlaw the prince was a dangerous man and extremely ambitious haven would be caught between him and prince edward who liked not the welshman one bit for ap gruffydd had supported the princes uncle simon de montfort quite openly against the king prince edward might not have a great deal of respect for his sires style of governance but he did love his father de beaulieu arose and left the great hall going to the south tower where his brides apartments would be located the young serving girl his steward had chosen to serve the bride turned startled eyes on him as he entered the dayroom she curtsied quickly keeping her frightened eyes lowered he looked about the room the furnishings of oak were polished and the stone floor well swept the lamps burned without smoking there was a bowl of daffodils on a table he smiled you have done well enit he told her your new mistress will arrive by nightfall have been informed she may want to bathe after her journey make certain a tub is ready yes my lord enit said bobbing another curtsey her uncle was stewardat haven and this was a great opportunity she had been given particularly considering her mother was welsh and not english enit was sixteen and had been in service at the castle for five years she was a plain rather than pretty girl with brown hair and eyes edward de beaulieu left the apartment and went in search of his priest father john all the legalities had been signed and sealed at montgomery with regard to his marriage all that was left was for the priest to perform the sacrament he decided upon the morrow so his bride might have a proper nights rest the king had personally instructed him that the marriage was to be consummated on his wedding night i do not trust ap gruffydd henry had said breach the girl and make certain the bloody sheet flies from the castle top on the following morning for all to see use her well prince edward had continued you want her with child as quickly as possible my lord else her sly sire attempt to annul your marriage and take her back to use to better advantage elsewhere the welsh are not honorable peoples but with ap gruffydds daughter in our power we may keep him under control he must love the wench that he has kept her so secretly all these years edward de beaulieu now reached the priests quarters father my bride approaches and will arrive at haven before night we will celebrate the formalities on the morrow my lord the girl is young and gently reared the priest said will you not give her some time to know you we must wed no matter edward de beaulieu said let it be sooner than later ap gruffydd will remain to see the deed done and i would have him gone from haven as quickly as possible though this match be the kings and princes decision i do not want the welshman here any longer than necessary lest i later be accused of some misdeed these are dangerous times good father the priest shook his head i cannot disagree with you my lord he said sadly i will marry you tomorrow afternoon that will give the lady rhonwyn time to recover from her long trek agreed edward de beaulieu said and left the priest as he crossed the courtyard of his castle he called to the watch upon its heights what do you see nought yet my lord came the reply edward de beaulieu decided suddenly to go to his stables saddle my horse he told the groom who hurried forth to meet him how many men will you be taking with you my lord the groom asked him no escort he said i am riding out to meet my bride and i am safe on my own lands the black stallion was brought out and the lord of haven castle mounted him and rode forth from his home he was pleased to see the fields were already being plowed for planting soon those fields would be golden with wheat and barley in his meadows the blackfaced white sheep browsed followed by their gamboling and enthusiastic lambs which were in plentiful supply this year he possessed a large herd of cows who gave a rich milk that was made into butter and cheese and sold in shrewsbury on market days beyond his fields were great stands of woods where he might hunt and below the hill on which his castle stood the river severn flowed he stopped in his passage and turned about to look at his home it was a fine castle small and elegant in structure not at all great or impressive like others he had seen the grayishbrown stone of which it was built was mellowed with age and in some places covered in ivy there were four towers one facing each compass point despite the castles battlements its interior was more that of a comfortable manor house edward de beaulieu loved his home the one good thing he thought about his marriage was that he would have children with whom to share his love of haven castle for her sake he hoped his bride would like it too he turned his horse again to the road the welsh prince and his train would be traveling he rode for several miles before coming upon llywelyn ap gruffydd and his party he stopped allowing them to approach the prince rode forward and greeted his soninlaw are you eager then edward de beaulieu to meet your bride the englishman smiled sardonically but before he could answer the girl rode forward stopping at her fathers side think him curious she said in a sweetly musical voice is that not so my lord her look challenged him he answered as quickly and you lady are you not curious as well rhonwyn laughed aloud but did not speak suddenly her eyes were lowered and she appeared every bit the meek conventbred wife he had been told would be delivered to him he was confused may i welcome you to haven castle my lord prince and the lady rhonwyn as well i know your journey has been arduous my home is but a few miles onward there is warmth and wine i know you will want to rest lady our marriage will be celebrated tomorrow afternoon well she thought he wasnt giving her a great deal of time was he and since she had not ever imagined what he would be like edward de beaulieu came as a pleasant surprise to rhonwyn he was tall and lean a man obviously used to physical pursuits the shape of his face was oval as were his silvery gray eyes his nose longer rather than shorter had a bump in it and had obviously been broken at one time he had high cheekbones and his mouth was long the lips narrow his hair which was cut short had a bang it was the warm brown color of oak leaves on the forest floor in autumn the big hands guiding the black stallion so skillfully were square the nails pared and short he would not be unpleasant to look at across the hall if she had examined him in their brief encounter so had edward de beaulieu scrutinized her as well he was astonished by the lady rhonwyns beauty he had not expected it at all a small dark welsh girl was what he had anticipated not this slender creature of medium height with delicate features and even more delicate coloring the silk gauze veil she wore did little to hide the glorious pale gilt of her hair and her eyes they were every bit as green as the emeralds in his swords hilt her cheeks were brushed with rose her brows and lashes startling ebony against her snowy complexion her nose was in perfect proportion with her heartshaped face narrow and flaring only in the nostrils her mouth was small but the lips were full llywelyn ap gruffydd watched the man at his side with amusement he knew precisely what he was thinking her mother descended from the fair folk a fair race in ancient cymri she is beautiful isnt she despite the fact she favors me in her features i had not noticed his companion said still slightly dazed shell give you beautiful children her mother did before she died and she is accomplished my lord you have noted she speaks the norman tongue as well as our own welsh and latin flushing edward realized he hadnt noticed at all but then he gained mastery over himself and said i am pleased we shall be able to communicate easily tell me of her other achievements my lord the nuns tell me she has great skill in weaving and spinning as well as in making medicines poltices and salves ap gruffydd replied i am knowledgeable in calculating and logic rhonwyn told her bridegroom moving her mount to his other side these things are not important for women her father quickly said as if she had told edward de beaulieu something unseemly i beg to differ with you my lord but they are most important what if my husband should go to war and i be left in charge of the castle do you think i want the servants cheating him in his absence this knowledge is important for me to know and my lord she turned to edwardyou had best know the worst of me i can both read and write he nodded solemnly but said nothing this was not at all what he had expected not at all everything he had imagined was now blown away with the wind in the reality of this beautiful girl he was to marry on the morrow she is musical ap gruffydd said eager to cover her deficiencies all the welsh are musical to some extent rhonwyn replied dryly and edward de beaulieu laughed aloud haven castle suddenly came into view he reached out and took her gloved hand welcome home my lady rhonwyn she was silent for a moment and then said softly how lovely they rode up the hill across the drawbridge and into the courtyard de beaulieu noted his fatherinlaw taking in every aspect of the castles defenses and hid a smile the wily welsh prince would never enter haven by force and after his daughters marriage it was unlikely he would ever enter it again once they were wed edward would allow no divided loyalties in his house dismounting he lifted rhonwyn from her horse she did not look at him but rather kept her glance modest and averted he was already confused by her manner quiet one moment and outspoken the next when they reached the door of the castle residence de beaulieu surprised rhonwyn by picking her up in his arms and carrying her over the threshold tis an old custom to carry the bride over the sill into her new home he said setting her back on her feet we are not wed yet my lord she replied all the legalities are signed and sealed my lady it is only for the priest to say the words over us licitly you have been my wife since the treaty was ratified at montgomery last autumn i was not aware of it rhonwyn assured him i am not conversant with the law i would not expect you to be he told her as he led her into the great hall are you thirsty or perhaps you would prefer to rest in your chamber i have had my steward choose a young maidservant for you her name is enit and she will care for you you are kind my lord i have never had a servant rhonwyn said i am quite capable of looking after myself my daughter has been raised simply ap gruffydd said quickly interjecting himself into the conversation before rhonwyn said something she should not mercy abbey is not grand in material comforts he shot his daughter a quelling look that obviously did not intimidate her at all she shrugged her return glance almost mocking now what was that all about de beaulieu wondered and how was he to get to the bottom of it i should enjoy some wine rhonwyn said quietly the lord of the castle signaled to his servants and the requested wine was immediately sent for come and sit by the fire he invited her april can be a cold month despite the fact it is spring he seated her on a bench facing the blaze rhonwyn leaned forward pulling her gloves from her hands and holding them toward the warmth even in profile she was beautiful he thought he took a goblet of wine from the serving man and handed it to her she smiled up at him gratefully taking it and admiring the beauty of the silver its base studded in green stones slowly she sipped the wine and felt its warmth coursing through her veins will your guests arrive in time for the wedding ap gruffydd asked his soninlaw jovially there will be no guests de beaulieu replied i have no nearby family my closest kin are my cousins rafe de beaulieu and his sister katherine i have not yet told him of this marriage for rafe has always hoped i would wed katherine i suppose i might have but there was no formal or even informal agreement between us besides i could not be certain when you would arrive you your men and my servants will witness the ceremony but the formalities were settled months ago my lord prince i could bed your daughter tonight and be within my rights but i prefer to wait until we have celebrated the sacrament in my church rhonwyn blanched at his words the bedding was something that no one at mercy abbey had explained and she was damned if she would ask her father she remembered him with her mother and assumed it would be the same although she had never quite known what they were doing for their bodies had always been pressed so closely together a small flame of rebellion burned deep within her she wasnt certain that she wanted this bedding if she was de beaulieus wife wasnt the treaty marriage agreement satisfied she arose suddenly i am weary my lords i would retire until the morrow i will show you to your chamber my lady de beaulieu said then turned to ap gruffydd i will return shortly my lord and we will have food he took rhonwyn by her arm and led her from his hall your rooms face southwest lady it is the warmest tower my possessions she began hesitantly will have been brought to your apartment by now your young maidservant enit will be unpacking for you suddenly rhonwyn burst out i have never been in such a fine place my lord am i truly to be mistress here he smiled at her ingenuousness you are mistress here now lady this is your home rhonwyn uerch llywelyn how charming she was his conventbred bride he had to wed sometime and now having seen this tender beauty he thought that perhaps the king had done him a great favor although that had not of course been henrys intent when he had arranged this match with the welsh prince rhonwyn was to all intents and purposes a hostage for her fathers behavior and he edward de beaulieu lord thorley of haven was her keeper the marriage was a practical matter but if they were content with one another so much the better he led her up the stone staircase and down a short passageway and then opened the door to her apartment enit hearing them turned and curtsied looking anxious here lady are your chambers there is a dayroom for your pleasure a bedroom and a garderobe for your clothing which also has a sleeping space for enit he led her from the dayroom into her bedchamber that door connects with my apartment lady he pointed rhonwyn scarcely knew where to look to have all these rooms for herself alone at cythraul she had slept in her sleeping space in the hall at mercy abbey she had been assigned a tiny cell in the guest house but this was all hers there were tapestries on the walls sheepskins on the stone floors fine oak furniture the like of which she had certainly never seen the bed appeared to her eyes to be huge and was hung with gold and green brocaded velvet curtains there was a red fox coverlet atop it i have two fireplaces she was astounded then you are pleased he asked her she turned eyes shining aye my lord i am pleased would you like enit to fetch you something to eat before you retire he asked her her eyes were so green how could someone as hard as ap gruffydd produce such a delicate creature for a daughter thank you my lord i should like something to eat but i could not sit in the hall with my father another minute i am weary she quickly explained for we rode several days from sunup to sunset i am glad for your coming he replied but your father should not have exhausted you so rhonwyn i shall speak to him do not bother my lord he will soon be gone from here will he not she turned to look out the window to where the sun was setting how beautiful it is i shall never grow tired of this view then she turned back to him you are kind i thank you for it he flushed at her words saying i suspect it will be easy to be kind to you rhonwyn now i bid you good night enit will see to your needs we will meet tomorrow at the altar he bowed and was gone with your permission my lady i will fetch you some food enit said looking anxiously toward her new mistress yes thank you rhonwyn replied absently and when she heard the door to her chambers close behind the girl she began a closer examination of her quarters in a chamberwhat had he called it a garderobeshe found her clothing neatly stored there was a small door at the end of the garderobe she opened it and was astonished to find a stone seat built into the wall the seat had a bole in it next to the stone seat was a large bucket of water she had never seen anything like it what could it be enit would know she closed the door on the dark stone seat and moved back out into the dayroom the small fireplace was flanked by winged creatures on either side in the center of the room was a rectangular oak table with tall highbacked chairs at either end of it there was an oak settle adorned with a tapestried cushion to one side of the fire there were two tall narrow windows overlooking the hills and through which the setting sun now spilled into the room turning the gray stone floors and the snowy sheepskins rosy rhonwyn stood in the alcove of one of the windows looking out at the dark hills just a few days ago she had been on the other side of those hills in wales with a soft sigh she sat down on the settle before her fire could she really be the lady of haven castle the abbess had assured her that she could but it was all so strange and not just a little frightening she didnt know if she really wanted this and yet it was a duty an obligation owed to llywelyn ap gruffydd who had given her in marriage so easily and expected her to be everything a lady should be but i am not a lady to the manor born rhonwyn thought rebelliously six months ago i was but one of the soldiers at cythraul fortress i would have as soon killed an englishman as marry him she arose and began to pace restlessly i am not certain i want to direct my servants and order provisions that we do not grow or make ourselves she thought i want to ride and hunt with my alborium not sit meekly by the fire weaving and spinning damn ap gruffydd for condemning me to this life i cannot be penned up any longer how i bore those months at the abbey are beyond me but i cannot be held captive like some wild thing they wish to tame oh god and what of the intimacy i must have with this man who is my husband i know not what is expected of me and i am not certain at all that i want to know the door to her dayroom opened and enit came in bearing a tray that she set down on the table i thought you might be hungry but as you are tired i chose delicate foods my lady she said come now and eat while it is still hot rhonwyn got up and came to the table where enit seated her then the young serving woman set before her new mistress a silver server upon which was roasted capon breast small new peas and a large crusty slice of hot bread the cheese atop it browned and melting there was also a silver goblet of fruity golden wine rhonwyn fell upon the food eating with gusto when she had cleared half her plate she grinned up at enit i have never been known for having a dainty belly my kinsman morgan ap owen says i eat like a barbarian enit looked momentarily distressed have i brought enough then my lady rhonwyn nodded convent fare was not half as tasty she chuckled what about you enit have you eaten i will in the kitchens afterward my lady the girl told her mistress we have kitchens beneath the hall which is considered very modern most castles have a cookhouse separate in the courtyard but often the food is cold when it arrives the master does not like cold food he even created a device to bring the food quickly into the hall it is a shaft in the walls that runs from below the food is put upon a platform and by means of ropes drawn up into the hall that reminds me rhonwyn cried jumping up and signaling enit to follow her into the garderobe what is this she demanded opening the small wooden door that concealed the stone seat you sit upon it and perform your necessary bodily functions my lady enit said when you are through i flush the shaft clean with the water in the bucket is it not wonderful by the rood rhonwyn swore the words slipping out most unexpectedly and then she blushed but enit giggled i know she said understanding my uncle who is the steward here says all the best castles have them it is nice not to have to go outside and pee on a cold morning my lady now it was rhonwyn who giggled i have so much to learn enit i have been raised in virtual isolation my whole life and in wales we have not these wonderful modern conveniences tomorrow i would speak with your uncle so he may inform me of all these wonders tomorrow is your wedding day my lady enit reminded her then the day after tomorrow rhonwyn said is there a priest in residence here who says the mass yes my lady it is father john and he says the mass at the hour of prime each day you will see i am awakened in time to be there rhonwyn told her servant if there was one thing the abbess had impressed upon her niece it was that daily attendance at mass was essential if one was to set a good example to ones servants now let me finish my meal the hole in my belly is not quite filled she sat down again at her table and ate the food remaining upon her plate when she had finished enit offered her lady a bath but rhonwyn refused wanting to sleep instead enit brought a silver ewer of warm water for her mistress to wash her face and hands in so that she would not get grease upon the sheets among my possessions you will find a small stiff brush enit bring it to me rhonwyn instructed the girl after she had washed and when the brush was in her hand she showed enit how she kept the yellow from her teeth brushing them vigorously then rinsing with her remaining wine and spitting it into the basin in future i will want mint leaves to chew to sweeten my breath sister dicra taught me that she explained to enit enit helped her mistress disrobe carefully brushing the gown and putting it away she drew the shoes from rhonwyns feet promising to clean them before the morrow will you wear your chemise to bed my lady enit asked not this one for the sleeves are tight rhonwyn said you will find a white chemise with long wide sleeves among my possessions that is what i prefer to sleep in enit enit rummaged through her ladys chest and found the required garment she helped rhonwyn out of the one and into the other if you will seat yourself my lady she told her mistress as she placed the gown chemise in the garderobe i will brush your hair then as she did she sighed admiringly ah to have such a crowning glory my lady rhonwyn i have never seen hair like this surely it is spun from thistledown and touched by the sun itself i am said to be descended from the fairy folk of ancient cymri rhonwyn told the girl as she braided her hair for the night they were fair like i am like my mam was not dark like ap gruffydd and his ilk the servant helped her mistress into her bed saying the fire should go the night my lady and keep you warm if you need me you have but to call and i will come for i am not a heavy sleeper she blew out the small taper by the bedside and entered the garderobe where her own sleeping space was located rhonwyn lay quietly so here she was in the castle that was to be her home for the rest of her life tomorrow she would be a wife ap gruffydd would depart good riddance to him she would be alone with edward de beaulieu who seemed pleasant enough would he allow her to have her brother here it had been six months since she had been separated from her younger sibling she had promised glynn and she had to keep that promise while she had been at the abbey there was no hope of their being together but now surely one small boy could not matter to this lord and god only knew ap gruffydd had no use for his son he would remain at cythraul the rest of his days if she could not rescue him what if the fortress were attacked by the english or by another faction in opposition to ap gruffydd glynn could be killed or worse if ap gruffydds enemies learned who he was she had to gain his custody as quickly as possible she had to enit awakened her just as the darkling skies were showing signs of growing lighter she dressed quickly in a simple dark brown gown wild a girdle of delicate copper links enit put a matching furlined cloak over her shoulders and together the two young women hurried to the small church that was located within the castles walls there they attended the mass and afterward the priest came forward to greet the girl who would be the castles new mistress you are rested now my child bather john asked her was sorry we did not meet at table last night i was very wearied from my journey rhonwyn explained the prince was most anxious to deliver me lest the english think he had reneged on his promise to marry his daughter to king henrys man the priest heard the faint tone of mockery in her voice you are content with this arrangement my child he gently inquired i am told i must marry good father if i have no calling to gods service which i most assuredly do not she laughed it is my duty and my obligation to my prince to accept his decision in this matter the lord of this place seems kind and has been most considerate of me i have never had a suitor nor is there anyone who has captured my fancy this match is acceptable to me good the priest replied i am happy to see what an obedient and dutiful daughter you are rhonwyn uerch llywelyn you will undoubtedly be an obedient and dutiful wife as well the lord has asked that the ceremony be performed after the hour of none will that be acceptable to you my child rhonwyns eyes twinkled at the priest i have only but to be there good father do i not she told him then she and enit hurried off the priest watched her go and he could not keep a small smile from turning up the corners of his mouth the new lady of haven castle was a touch independent and headstrong he could see well she would need her strength she was very much like her aunt the abbess of mercy abbey he had once served in the church there some ten years back he sensed a disdain in his new lady for her father and wondered why still she seemed quite reconciled to her fate so he had to assume that all would be well because it was considered ill fortune for the bridegroom to see the bride prior to the marriage ceremony rhonwyn kept to her chambers until it was time for her to go to the church again enit dressed her in the gown her aunt had made for the occasion it was creamcolored silk the neckline high and rounded the sleeves long and tight over it she wore a sleeveless gown of gold and silver brocade with a matching fabric girdle studded with tiny pearls her stockings were plain and gartered at the knee her shoes had a pretty painted toe enit brushed her hair leaving it loose to signify her virginity the servant set a small fillet of twisted gold and silver threads on rhonwyns head there was a knock at the door and enit opened it to reveal llywelyn ap gruffydd she curtsied run along lass he told her i would speak with my daughter before i bring her to the church he gently pushed the girl from the chamber and closed the door behind her what do you want rhonwyn demanded of him irritably to remind you that whatever you may feel toward me you are still the daughter of the prince of all wales and welsh by your birth remember it rhonwyn uerch llywelyn i will expect you to write to me regularly my daughter can you actually read she mocked him then her look hardened i have worked hard to overcome your neglect of me my lord and i have accepted your choice of a husband for me i have done my duty by you but once the priest says that i am edward de beaulieus wife my loyalty will lie with him do you understand me my lord i will not spy on my husband or on the english for you your duty he began to bluster but rhonwyn cut him short i am doing my duty my lord but shortly you will no longer have charge over me my english husband will and i will not betray him what more do you want than you already have llywelyn ap gruffydd you have wales and a strong england is your overlord if you do not deceive them and keep faith with your sworn word what future difficulties can you have my lord and how dare you ask me to break faith with the man who will be my husband my mother never broke faith with you do you expect me to be any less than vala uerch huw ah i despise you ap gruffydd now take me to the church so i may be quit of you your mother loved me and would have done whatever she had to to ensure my safety and wellbeing the prince said but i do not love you my lord rhonwyn told him i gave you life wench he snarled at her and until today that is all you have ever given me she snapped back at him i thank you for today though ap gruffydd for now i shall be free of you for all times there is no arguing with you is there he said suddenly amused she was so like gwynllian and how had that happened no rhonwyn said quietly there is no arguing with me my lord prince of all the welsh now she repeated take me to the church chapter edward de beaulieu dressed in a tunic of olive green and gold awaited his bride in the church he smiled with encouragement as llywelyn ap gruffydd led his daughter forward placing her small hand in his the bridegroom noted with pleasure how perfectly his wife spoke latin as she made her responses and recited the prayers when they were finally officially pronounced man and wife he turned her face to him and gently kissed her lips the startled look in rhonwyns green eyes surprised him greatly tis the kiss of peace between us he told her softly i have never been kissed before she responded then the reality of all the other things his conventbred wife had never done rose up to assail him the king wanted the marriage consummated immediately lest llywelyn take his daughter back on some pretext or another to use her in a more advantageous marriage yet it was painfully obvious that his bride was a true innocent still he owed the king his allegiance and would do what had to be done although he would do his best to be gentle with the girl the day had been mild and sometimes sunny but now as the evening approached it was beginning to grow cloudy and the spring rain was threatening the little wedding party returned to the hall where a fine meal was served there was lamb and venison and a lovely fat duck that had been roasted and garnished with a sweet sauce of raisins and figs there was a blankmanger chicken cut into pieces and mixed with rice boiled in almond milk salt and seasoned with sugar then sprinkled with fried almonds and anise rhonwyn had never eaten it before and she knew almost immediately that it would be a favorite of hers there was fresh bread sweet butter and a fine sharp cheese a bowl of new peas was offered the cook had made a small subtlety of colored almond paste and sugar a couple in a cockle being drawn by a swan it sat upon a silver dish surrounded by green leaves it was admired and praised by both the bride and the groom who drank a toast to each other afterward with rich red wine the day had waned and the rain was beginning to beat against the shutters of the hall windows rhonwyn called for her mandora and settling it in her lap played and sang for her husband and the prince she sang in both her own welsh tonguerich mournful tunes her father translated for his soninlawand spritely amusing songs in the norman language that brought a chuckle to edward de beaulieu he was beginning to believe that his bride was the most perfect creature on gods earth and looked forward to being alone with her finally when she had ceased her entertainment he said perhaps my lady you will want to retire now she blushed and ap gruffydd chortled saying you could not have a purer maid in your bed tonight my son had god himself chosen you a wife and not king henry remember she is a virgin when you satisfy your lust my lord rhonwyn chided him sharply your words are unseemly and very indelicate and your caution unnecessary for i see what my wife is edward de beaulieu told his fatherinlaw then he took rhonwyns hand and raising it to his lips kissed it tenderly i will join you eventually my lady wife he said quietly she glided from the hall with as much dignity as she could muster thinking her father crude and her husband gallant in her chambers she found enit awaiting her her servant had arranged for rhonwyn to have a bath the tall oaken tub had been brought from its storage space in the garderobe and filled while they had eaten the wedding feast in the hall below enit helped her mistress to disrobe and then step into the tub the warm water felt wonderful rhonwyn pinned her long hair atop her head with a tortoiseshell pin put my garments away she told enit i am quite capable of washing myself what is that delicious scent it is so delicate heather enit replied my mother makes an oil from the flowers she gathers on the hill each year i put some of it in the water my lady i hope you like it she bustled about brushing rhonwyns overgown and undertunic storing them away in the garderobe its lovely rhonwyn answered ive never had a scented bath before its quite wonderful and i thank you she took the washing cloth and some of the soft cleansing soap from a stone crock and set about washing herself the tub had been set before the fireplace in her dayroom rhonwyn splashed happily then the door to her chambers opened and she heard her husband say enit you will sleep in your mothers cottage tonight yes my lord came the dutiful reply and rhonwyn heard the door close again are you enjoying your bath lady edward de beaulieu asked rhonwyn turned slowly so as not to spill water onto the floor he wore only a sherte that came to his knees my lord she said am i allowed no privacy in my bath i have always enjoyed watching my women bathe he said quietly your women her eyes had widened at his words surely lady you do not think me a virgin he responded i am a healthy man with healthy appetites i have kept my share of mistresses i shall no longer however now that i have a wife she nodded it was reasonable and his promise to remain faithful to her was comforting you are flushed with the heat of your bath rhonwyn it is very becoming to you he told her she did not answer him for she was not certain what to say how she hated being made to feel a fool but this was a situation she had never imagined are you coming out of your tub soon rhonwyn he asked her how can i when you are standing here my lord she replied it is my right to see you as god fashioned you wife he told her and his silverygray eyes were twinkling but i have never stood as god fashioned me before any man she responded quickly i am not certain i can reaching over the edge of the high wood tub he put his hands beneath her arms and quickly lifted her out of the water setting her down upon the floor he drew a deep breath of pleasure she had sweet little round breasts that begged to be loved with a gasp of both surprise and shock rhonwyn snatched at the drying cloth and covered her nakedness that was unfairly done my lord she scolded him has no one ever told you that all is fair in both love and war my lady wife his eyes were burning a hole in the cloth there is no love here my lord so we must be at war she declared and you will find i am no easy enemy reaching out he plucked the pin holding her hair atop her head then wrapping a hank of the gilt mass about his hand he pulled her against him looking down into her beautiful but determined face you belong to me rhonwyn as my warhorse belongs to me as my weapons and my castle belong to me i am your husband and i have certain rights that i am privileged to take of you certainly you know that he brushed his lips across her forehead you are young and innocent and shy i understand your fears but our marriage must be consummated i barely understand what you are asking of me my lord but must this consummation take place tonight can we not have time to know one another better we have only just met what difference does it make tonight or another night eh lady were you any other mans daughter but ap gruffydds i should gladly honor your request but you are not my king fears your father will seek to take you back if the marriage is not immediately consummated that he would seek an annulment and use you in a more advantageous marriage with an enemy of king henry aye rhonwyn agreed he is that wily my lord i will be as gentle with you as i can he promised her caressing her cheek without realizing she drew back from his touch my mother died when i was five she said i know nothing of what is expected of me the nuns did not speak on it i saw the prince atop my mother but i never knew what transpired between them i am sorry for my ignorance but there it is my lord and i should rather be honest with you even if you think me a fool for my stupidity you are a conventbred virgin rhonwyn you are not expected to know what transpires between a man and his wife until your husband teaches you he said gently my lord i am not convent bred i spent the last months with my aunt the abbess gwynllian but before that i lived at cythraul rhonwyn told him let us get into bed wife and then you can tell me he suggested releasing his hold on her taking the toweling from her he dried her as best he could and then led her into her bedchamber rhonwyn quickly climbed into the bed and her husband pulling his sherte off so that he also was naked joined her it was done so swiftly that she had no time to really examine him as he had examined her now tell me rhonwyn what is cythraul a fortress in the welshry my lord it was only chance that ap gruffydd discovered my brother and me the day after our mam died from birthing too soon our new sister when he had buried them he took glynn and me to cythraul and left us in the charge of our kinsman morgan ap owen that is where we remained until ap gruffydd came to fetch me several months ago and you were raised by your kinsmans wife de beaulieu asked his bride rhonwyn shook her head cythraul my lord is a fortress of men there were no women there at all it would have been too dangerous if the english came over the border you see she attempted to explain there were no women at cythraul he looked down into her face to see if she was making mock of him none my lord rhonwyn responded softly and would it not have been as dangerous for you and your brother if your enemies attacked this fortress he said perhaps when we were little before i learned how to be a good soldier my lord she told him frankly a soldier he said weakly surely she was mocking him but he could see that she was quite serious i ride they say as if i were part of my horse rhonwyn said i can use a sword and main gauche extremely well i am passably proficient with a mace and a javelin but it is with an alborium that i excel did most of the hunting for cythraul from the time that i was ten we ate very well and your brother is equally soldierly she had to be playing a game with him women were not soldiers good or otherwise glynn has no interests in weapons or war he is a poet a singer of songs ap gruffydd has no use for him rhonywn explained rhonwyn tell me that you are jesting with me he begged her why would i do such a thing my lord nay i do not jest but you are so so beautiful you are educated he said when ap gruffydd came to cythraul six months ago and found he had two sons she chuckled he took me at once to my aunt all i have learned i learned in the last few months for i swear to you i could speak no language but my own before then i knew not our dear lord jesus or anything else for that matter but war and weapons the prince of wales needed a daughter for this treaty marriage my aunt saw he got a perfect daughter back and believe me it cost him dearly edward de beaulieu was astounded by her story that is why he put the marriage off until now he said thoughtfully aye she agreed you call me beautiful my lord six months ago i dont think you would have thought so my father should have put his children with my aunt when he found us nine years ago but cythraul was closer and it was easier to leave us there fortunately for my brother and me our kinsman morgan ap owen has a large and good heart i had no woman to model myself after until i went to my aunt the abbess i am certain that lasses raised in a normal way know enough about consummation not to be considered fools my aunt is a holy virgin if she knew of such things she did not discuss them de beaulieu suddenly laughed the entire situation was absurd and yet the upshot was he now had a beautiful wife you find this situation amusing my lord she was puzzled i can but imagine ap gruffydds chagrin when he came to fetch you and discovered you as you were he must have been terrified at least momentarily edward de beaulieu chuckled you do not like him rhonwyn said i do not dislike him her husband quickly replied nay my lord you do not like him she insisted neither do i i doubt i have seen him more than a dozen times in my life while he was never unkind to us his passion was for our mother not his children but none of what you have told me rhonwyn changes our situation this marriage between us must be consummated tonight he said reaching out he caressed her small breasts tenderly rhonwyn squirmed nervously please dont she told him why not he demanded half angrily i am not used to being touched in so intimate a manner it unsettles me my lord you will grow to like it he assured her brushing his fingertips across her right nipple teasingly never it is all too possessing my lord it is as if you owned me body and soul rhonwyn cried out softly moving away from his bedeviling fingers i have already told you rhonwyn that i do own you you are mine to do with as i please our marriage will be consummated tonight if you let me i will make the experience as pleasing as possible for you i am not a man who takes his pleasure heedless of his womans enjoyment but whether you will or nay i will have you my fair wife then swiftly he was atop herand as swiftly gasping with surprise at the dagger pressing against his throat what will you kill me then to preserve your virtue or do you fear i will learn you have no virtue he said in a hard voice you will be the only man to have my virtue of me my lord rhonwyn said but i will have something of you in return what he contemplated taking the dagger from her ap gruffydd will leave haven once our marriage is consummated will he not she asked aye that is why he waits this night to see if he may snatch you back he will go however on the morrow when i show him the bloody bedsheet with the prool of your defloration upon it why you must ask him before he leaves to send my brother glynn to haven rhonwyn said my brother is still a lad we have never been parted until these past few months i have seen how much there is in the world since i left cythraul i have learned and gained such knowledge as i never knew existed i want those same advantages for my little brother he is a gentle soul and does not belong in a fortress of rough men only that i was there and as great a roughneck as the others was i able to protect him please my lord do this for me and i will yield myself without further ado to your wishes and desires she pleaded softly please unexpectedly he grasped her wrist disarmed her and threw the dagger across the chamber he slapped her lightly on the cheek in future when you seek a favor from me rhonwyn do not threaten me with a weapon then he pinioned her hard and laughed at the anger in her eyes such a fierce little virgin it is he said crooningly i will grant your request rhonwyn now what have you for me in return his mouth came down hard on hers forcing her lips to part and he thrust his tongue into her mouth to ravage hers with wildfire rhonwyn lay still not knowing what else to do he was almost gagging her with his tongue and it was all she could do not to become sick his lips began to kiss her face and her throat she shivered his kisses covered her breasts her belly she almost screamed as his fingers began to forage in her nest pushing through her nether lips she bit her lips until they bled as his fingers went deeper slipping into a place she had not even known existed probing her gently this is the place where our two bodies will be conjoined he told her thickly it is called your love sheath and like a sword my manhood will fill it rhonwyn wow he plunged himself inside her and rhonwyn screamed aloud as his manhood made contact with her maidenhead and thrust hard through it oh god she hated this it was impossible not to resist him now and she fought him with all her strength biting and scratching at him no more no more she sobbed but he only groaned a sound of distinct pleasure and thrust again and again into her body finally he stiffened a moment and then she felt him relax and collapse atop her by the rood the girl had aroused him much to his surprise and when she had stopped lying silent and had fought him his lust had grown so hot he was surprised his head had not exploded he knew it had not been a good experience for her and he regretted it gently he kissed the tears from her pale cheeks and said there rhonwyn it is over and done with now we have both done our duty and i shall leave you to recover yourself wife catching his breath he climbed from her bed rhonwyn swallowed hard glynn she said your father shall not leave haven without giving me his promise to send the lad to us rhonwyn he assured her whatever you may think of me i want you content do we have to the question was unfinished but he understood not until we are ready rhonwyn we have done what was expected of us by king and prince now we will wait until you are happier good night wife he moved through the small arched door separating their bedchambers and she heard the lock click shut for the first time in her life rhonwyn wept edward heard her on his side of the door and felt sadness that she was so unhappy hopefully these feelings would soon pass especially when her brother arrived he had never forced a woman in his life it had never been necessary for him to do so he felt guilt sweeping over him worse was the fact that he had enjoyed her despite everything why he shook off the question she was intelligent and he had explained the situation to her her fears he understood but her stubborn determination and her sudden threat to his person followed by a demand in exchange for her cooperation had truly infuriated him she was his wife and therefore belonged to him she must obey him and that was all there was to it still be had promised her a respite from his attentions and he would keep his word common sense told him that it could not hurt for them to know one another better he listened by the connecting door again her weeping had died away now and he felt better for it enit gently shook her mistress awake the following day you must wake my lady it is time to dress for the mass the servant felt shy for she knew rhonwyn had lost her maidenhead the previous evening she had been fearful that the master would be in her ladys bed yet and was relieved to find it not so she bustled about the apartment laying out her mistresss clothing and skirting about the oak tub that still stood before the fire in the dayroom as she arose rhonwyn realized that she ached she saw her dagger across the floor and hurried to pick it up she always kept it beneath her pillow at night for she had been taught an enemy can come upon you at any time and an enemy had but she had not killed him when she had the chance had it been necessary for him to be so rough with her he had enjoyed it the fiend well at least she would not be bothered with his attentions any longer he had promised her that and she sensed that edward de beaulieu was a man of his word in spite of everything that had happened between them the night before enit helped her lady dress the two young women were silent together they walked to the church rhonwyn spoke the words of the mass quite automatically startled to suddenly realize that her husband was by her side ap gruffydd was nowhere to be seen for he only went to church when it was absolutely necessary when the service had been concluded de beaulieu took his wifes hand and they walked back to the great hall where the morning meal was being laid out rhonwyn saw the prince standing by the fire a large goblet in his hand you have not forgotten she asked de beaulieu anxiously nay he reassured her softly but in exchange rhonwyn i would have you call me by my name from now on wife will you do that aye edward i will she responded low llywelyn ap gruffydd saw de beaulieu smile down at his daughter and the prince thought to himself perhaps it will be a happy union for her sake i hope so in the end i did my best for her vala good morrow his voice boomed my lord de beaulieu replied you will be leaving us this morning prince llywelyn will you not it wasnt really a question perhaps if i am satisfied you are well and truly wed to my daughter edward de beaulieu show me the proof of this marriages consummation i would see my daughters innocence bespattered across the sheet of your nuptial bed rhonwyn felt her cheeks burning at his words her husband however turned to enit and said fetch the bedding lass nay ap gruffydd said i will go with the girl and see for myself my lord you cannot object to it i am certain go then de beaulieu answered him calmly but was angered that rhonwyn should be so openly embarrassed by her own father when ap gruffydd returned to the hall he said you did not spare her that i could see very well my daughter is now your wife other than paternal affection i no longer have any claim upon her paternal affection rhonwyn burst out you never had any affection for me ap gruffydd how can you mouth such words with such piety you ought to be ashamed of yourself rhonwyn her husbands voice warned her she was about to turn her scorn on him but then she remembered she was suddenly silent come my lord and let us eat edward de beaulieu said i have a boon to ask of you they sat at the high board rhonwyn between her father and her husband the servants bustled about small round trenchers of bread baked fresh earlier that morning were set before them into them the servants spooned an oat stirabout with bits of dried apple a square board with a small cheese upon it was placed in front of them along with a platter of cold roasted rabbit their goblets were filled with watered wine they ate for a time in silence de beaulieu amazed and amused to see his wifes prodigious appetite he wondered if she always ate like that but he doubted it considering her slender form finally when they were finished and the servants were clearing away the remnants of the meal the prince spoke what is it you would have of me soninlaw rhonwyn wants her brother here at haven she misses him edward de beaulieu said if it would make her happy then i am willing so the english having had my daughter would now take my only son ap gruffydd said not the english prince but your daughter his sister de beaulieu explained there is no trick in this my lord surely you can understand that never having been separated until a few months ago she misses him rhonwyn and her brother are my only offspring ap gruffydd said as she has had her value so my son one day might prove useful to me but if he is in english hands already then his value is lost to me soninlaw you will marry eventually prince de beaulieu said you must for your hereditys sake the children of your legal marriage will be of far greater value to you than the two children who were born to you on the wrong side of the blanket let rhonwyn have her brothers company again my lord i swear to you that i will protect the boy from any political chicanery and send him directly back to cythraul should i find i am unable to do so i must think on it ap gruffydd said slowly now rhonwyn was unable to contain herself any longer glynn means nothing to you she cried i will be here and you will go your way without another thought or care for my brother i know you well o prince of the welsh glynn is your son but he is not you or your brothers he has no ambitions other than to create beauty let me have him my lord you know in your heart that you do not want him if i let you bring him into england he could be a dagger turned against me one day rhonwyn ap gruffydd said and if you do not let me have him what will happen to him would you destroy him because of some imagined fear my lord she said there were tears in her green eyes and edward de beaulieu vowed then and there if ap gruffydd would not willingly let his son go he himself would ride into the welshry and bring the lad back to his wife please my lord prince rhonwyn pleaded let me have my brothers company you have said yourself that he is good for nothing more than the priesthood or poetry surely there is no threat to you in that it is not glynn who worries me rhonwyn it is the english ap gruffydd said i have said i would protect him de beaulieu replied you are the kings man soninlaw which is why he chose you to be my daughters husband the prince said you are reliable and can be trusted this is why i have waited so long to marry i never wanted to be torn between my duty and the woman i loved that is where you will find yourself edward de beaulieu if i put my son into your keeping as for your wife you do not love rhonwyn you barely know her perhaps one day you will have an affection for her perhaps not therefore i believe your stronger loyalty would be to your king and not to your wife and her brother please tad rhonwyn said slipping into the welsh tongue you have never before called me father he answered her in the same dialect rhonwyn smiled wryly it is unlikely i ever will again she said honestly let me have glynn i swear to you on my mothers honor that if i think the english mean to use him against you or wales i will either aid him to escape or kill him myself you know i am worthy of your trust llywelyn ap gruffydd you know that as much as i love glynn that will do my duty whatever it may be please say it again he replied she hesitated a moment and then said please tad you have my pride daughter but you know when to yield even as your mam did had you been my son the english would have truly had something to fear rhonwyn uerch llywelyn the prince turned now to his soninlaw and spoke norman words to him my daughter has convinced me that my sons interests are better served here at haven castle rather than at cythraul since you have given me your word to protect him i will send glynn to you i know you have made rhonwyn happy de beaulieu said quietly thank you my lord prince you will find i keep my word should it be necessary to protect your son from the crown since i do not intend to inform the king that the boy is with us it is unlikely we should face any difficulties henry is indecisive but his cub is far fiercer than most i have known ap gruffydd warned his soninlaw he will be king sooner than later and you must remain on his good side he is the best and the worst of all his ancestors soninlaw how long the peace will hold after he becomes king i do not know if we should meet in battle edward de beaulieu look away i should not like to slay my daughters husband the father of my grandchildren he arose from the high board i have remained here long enough it is time for me to depart lest you one day be accused of conspiracy he chuckled de beaulieu arose as did rhonwyn together they walked the prince of all the welsh to the courtyard where his men awaited him taking his daughter by her shoulders llywelyn ap gruffydd kissed her first on the forehead and then on each of her cheeks farewell my daughter may god be with you always he said farewell my lord prince she responded i thank you for what he teased her for my husband and for my brother she replied giving him a small and rare smile he chuckled a son you should have been a son he said in his own tongue then he looked to de beaulieu farewell soninlaw god grant my daughter gives you many healthy sons and daughters thank you my lord prince de beaulieu answered godspeed ap gruffydd mounted his charger and led his men from haven castle his daughter and her husband stood for a short time watching them go and then they turned back into the castle how did you manage to convince him to send your brother to us de beaulieu asked his wife i called him father she said i have never before called him that the prince is a strong man but he is also sentimental my calling him father touched him it was also a victory in his eyes he felt i was forced to do something he had always wanted he knows however that we are both victorious in this matter for we have both attained what we sought she finished what did you promise him he wondered aloud nothing she replied why should i have to promise him anything my lord perhaps you agreed to send him certain information her husband suggested softly if you doubt or fear for my loyalty then make certain that i am not privy to your delicate english matters she told him i promised ap gruffydd nought i merely called him father a word he has longed to hear from my lips i had never done so before there is nothing more to it edward you will have to earn my trust rhonwyn he told her whether you trust me or not makes no difference to me edward she said coolly i must live with my own conscience by the rood you are the most aggravating woman i have ever known he said have you known many women she asked him sweetly a wife should be meek and obedient to her lords will he said my mother was meek and obedient she gained no wedding band by her position and lost her life i believe because of it rhonwyn replied hers is hardly an example i wish to emulate you have a wedding band he said softly we have already satisfied the treaty between our two nations edward she reminded him as soltly he flushed but then said would you like to ride out with me and see the lands i possess my lady wife aye she agreed i should my lord husband so the truce was now set between them they slept each in their own beds but met at meals and rode together each day his time was spent in overseeing the management of his lands meeting with his bailiff and those freedmen who farmed portions of his lands and paid him in kind for the privilege his flocks of sheep were large his herds of cows ample fields needed to be plowed in rotation crops had to be planted and harvested and stored for winter the days were busy and full rhonwyn with the help of enits uncle alfred the castles steward was learning the proper management of her home putting into practice those lessons she had learned at the abbey she was astounded by all the things she had to oversee and grateful now to the nuns who had given her some of the knowledge she would need the year alfred told her was a neverending round of duties and chores there was a time for slaughtering meat and salting it away for winter the kitchen gardens had to be planted the root crops stored in a cold place for use in the winter the winters at haven alfred said were among the worst in all of england fruit had to be harvested at the proper time and turned into conserves and jellies apples pears and quinces could be dried as well as coldstored there was a time of year in which soaps candles and beer were made the hives had to be well kept if the castle was to have honey sugar sold in loaves at the shrewsbury market fair each month was expensive the weeks went by swiftly april was followed by may and then on one bright june day the castle watch called out that riders were approaching from the hills to the west three riders and a single pack horse rhonwyn could scarcely contain her excitement she hurried to find edward the watch has spied a small party of three riders coming from wales it is my brother it has to be glynn she said let me ride out to meet him my lord please we will go together he told her and ordered their horses saddled at once they rode out with several menatarms in attendance and with each pace the horses took she grew more elated finally rhonwyn could no longer contain herself and to edwards surprise spurred her gelding forward into a gallop a rider broke away from the incoming party rushing forward to meet her edward de beaulieu held his hand up to halt himself and his men even as the other riders ceased their movements as well he watched a small smile on his face as rhonwyn pulled hardd to a stop and leapt off her mount as did her brother off his the two siblings flung their arms about one another crying joyfully sister oh sister how beautiful you have become glynn ap llywelyn said admiringly and you you have grown so you are taller than i am now little brother oh glynn i have so much to tell you and you have so much to learn i actually called him tad and he softened and let you come to me did i not promise you glynn i have your weapons he said softly but you have become such a fine lady rhonwyn will you want them now i will want them she assured him come now and meet my husband glynn no greeting for us lady a familiar voice called to her rhonwyn turned oth dewi i greet you both she swept them a curtsey laughing as she did so we scarcely recognized you rhonwyn uerch llywelyn such a great lady you have become oth the more talkative of the two said i am no great lady she replied just a simple lords wife you arent used to seeing me dressed so prettily oth good thing you didnt look like that at cythraul rhonwyn else we should not have been able to keep you chaste he chuckled go on now and take the lad to your husband well follow behind together the siblings walked their horses to where edward de beaulieu awaited them when they reached him rhonwyn introduced her younger brother to her husband edward greeted the boy graciously and glynn responded in kind rhonwyn translating for both of them that is your first task she told glynn you must learn the norman tongue it isnt hard i learned very quickly far easier than the welsh edward said in that same tongue rhonwyn gasped with surprise you speak welsh my nursemaid was of the cymri he said to her why didnt you tell me she demanded suddenly both angry and worried if he spoke welsh then he knew exactly what she had said to ap gruffydd to convince him to let her have glynnthat she would free glynn or kill him if the english tried to take him he grinned wickedly i wanted to surprise you one day he turned to glynn i shall not often speak welsh to you lad for you must learn the norman language if you are to succeed in this world do you understand me glynn ap llywelyn aye my lord i do glynn agreed not comprehending the deviltry in his brotherinlaws eyes how could you do that to me rhonwyn said as she remounted her horse and they turned to ride back to the castle glynn between them how could you speak my native tongue and not tell me so why do you think i was the one chosen to wed you rhonwyn he cocked an eyebrow at her king henry asked who among the bachelor lords in the englishry could speak welsh well enough to take a welsh wife i was the only one to admit such a talent it was thought you would not speak the norman tongue when you did i saw no reason to bring up my own abilities for i was pleased you cared enough about your impending marriage to learn my language but you know then what i promised the prince she said and you should know i will never let it come to that he told her fiercely do you not think i realize that if you had to kill glynn you would then kill yourself rhonwyn do you think me so great a fool not to understand that i can protect glynn without compromising my loyalties this i swear to you my lady wife do you believe me rhonwyn his gray eyes turned to look directly at her she met his look searchingly and then seeing the truth of this mans word replied aye edward i believe you good he replied we will not speak on it again chapter glynn ap llywelyn had never known a world such as that he entered into at haven castle he had a chamber all his own he was treated with deference as the son of the prince of wales at cythraul be bad just been glynn the lad and more often than not he was known as rhonwyns little brother not that he minded he had new experiences the first of which was his baptism into the christian faith his brotherinlaw standing as his godfather when his two companions oth and dewi admitted to not being certain if they had ever been baptized they too were christened there can be no heathens in my home the lord said with a small smile surely you have not been christians before now else you would have taught prince llywelyns children their faith have you been baptized sister glynn asked rhonwyn at the abbey with our aunt gwynllian my godmother she told him it was ap gruffydds wish that oth and dewi remain at haven with his son edward de beaulieu did not object a princes son should have his own retinue however small he said graciously but in truth he understood the real reason for ap gruffydds wish should the english ever threaten glynn his two watchdogs could get him safely over the border into wales with neither edward nor rhonwyn being held accountable you must learn the norman tongue edward told the two welshmen in their own language you will be of more use to me if you do however it is not necessary that strangers be aware of your skills he winked at them meaningfully our loyalty is to our prince first my lord oth told him honestly we are welsh not english if the day comes when there is war between our peoples again edward said i will expect you gone without my saying it i understand your loyalty so i know you understand mine until that day however your loyalties must be with me at least in part are we agreed the lady oth began is my wife and her loyalty as you may ask her lies with me now as for the lad that will be his choice to make be certain he does not forget his own tongue should he ever need it one day you are more than fair my lord oth replied and he bowed glynns life now had more structure and like his sister when she had first left cythraul he chafed at it he was required to be at early mass with rhonwyn after he broke his fast he was schooled for several hours in a variety of subjects by father john only in midafternoon was he free to ride or follow his own pursuits learning to read and write was for him a joy now he could copy the words to the songs he created onto parchment for all to see with his brotherinlaws aid his manners became polished and elegant regular meals and plenty of food caused him to fill out and grow a bit taller one afternoon as he and rhonwyn sat their horses atop a hill in view of haven she said to him i believe you are truly happy glynn for the first time in your life the boy thought a moment and then he said aye sister i am and i am not afraid any longer i was always afraid at cythraul especially after you left are you happy rhonwyn edward seems a kind man but there appears to be little between you we are only getting to know one another rhonwyn said to him i am told that marriages are always arranged affairs there is an advantage to each side ours was a marriage devised as a matter of good faith between two warring parties england wed to wales my husband and i are yet strangers now enough i just have time for sword practice with oth before the evening meal come on little brother ill race you home she cried and spurred hardd into a gallop from the castle heights edward observed them as they sped down the hill and across meadows scattering the sheep as they came unable to help himself he chuckled his wife was a changed person since the arrival of her younger brother the love between the two had made him jealous until he realized that her love for glynn was almost maternal she had watched over the boy her whole life and felt responsible for his wellbeing and the lad was certainly no trouble he sopped up knowledge eagerly being a very quick study rhonwyn had been correct when she said he was a gentle soul not fit for a soldiers life he was now writing poems in the norman tongue that he put to music edward watched as glynn and rhonwyn entered the courtyard dismounting their animals oth came forward with a padded garment helping rhonwyn to don it fascinated edward observed his wife as she was handed her sword one that had obviously been made just for her hand she began to practice her moves beneath the eye of the welshman edward could hear him directing her sternly youre out of shape lady think think and follow your instincts else you find yourself dead of your own carelessness oth picked up his own sword and began to block her blows thats it lady he leapt aside dodging her thrust you didnt anticipate that lady ow he jumped back swearing softly and you didnt anticipate that she grinned at him lowering her weapon i didnt hurt you did i it was just a tap oth youre beginning to remember he said with a rueful smile all right now back to our practice my fine lady the lord of haven watched for a time as his beautiful wife turned into a warrior before his eyes this was another side of rhonwyn he had not anticipated he found himself excited by this new knowledge but he wasnt certain he approved surely such mannish activities could harm her abilities to bear him children for now however he held his peace rhonwyn was such a complex creature and he really did want to know her better but he was finding that it was not easy they seemed to coexist but nothing more with alfreds help she was learning how to manage the household with father johns aid she was becoming charitable to the less fortunate his servants and his people liked her well it was only he who seemed to be shut out of her life although she was certainly polite and thoughtful of his wellbeing but he had not entered her bed since their wedding night five months ago he wanted children and it was certainly her duty to give him heirs but each time he attempted to touch her rhonwyn shied away from him distress all over her beautiful face they could not go on like this and if she would not make the first move he would have to do so but he needed to choose his moment carefully lest he repel her even more he needed to be alone with her without her brother and his two welsh watchdogs then fate intervened in the person of father john i should like to take glynn to shrewsbury the priest told his lord one evening as they sat at the high board he has never seen a town and as you know my lord it is a fine one he turned to rhonwyn knowing her approval was paramount there is an abbey of monks lady and many churches and shops trading vessels come up the severn from bristol for the river is very navigable oth and dewi would of course come with us there are many welsh who visit the town regularly and so they would not stand out at all what think you rhonwyn edward asked her and you glynn would you enjoy such an educational journey oh i very much want to go edward the boy said enthusiastically he looked to his sister rhonwyn please say i may perhaps i shall go with you rhonwyn said thoughtfully i have never seen a town either little brother glynns face fell oh do you want to go he said his dismay very evident this was obviously a trip he and the priest had previously planned edward leaned over to murmur in his wifes little ear he is growing up rhonwyn this is the first time in his life he has been treated as he should be as a princes son should be his tutor wants to take him on a brief journey i dont think he wants his big sister with him as much as he may love you she had never before considered that glynn would grow up he was her baby brother whom she had always watched over and protected she bad brought him to haven and expanded his world now like a little bird he wanted to leave the nest to fly on his own it came as somewhat of a shock surely he wasnt ready yet then she realized that edwards large hand was covering hers in a comforting gesture she turned her gaze to him and he smiled at her encouragingly i will take you to shrewsbury myself one day he promised her in a soft voice only she could hear rhonwyn sighed deeply and then she turned to her brother how long would you be gone she asked him just a week no longer glynn replied you must be certain no one knows you are the princes son she warned him he can be known as glynn of thorley a young relation of mine edward said it will be assumed he is my son by one of my former mistresses in the care of the castle priest it will be presumed that his mother is dead which is of course a truth tis a grand idea the boy said enthusiastically when can we leave father john would tomorrow be too soon my son came the answer and glynn cheered his sister unable to help herself smiled you must have oth and dewi with you at all times she said firmly and you will obey father john without question glynn if i learn you have been a wicked rascal there shall be no more trips my lad i promise you rhonwyn sternly warned her brother he grinned at her happily and the following morning he rode off with his little party with nought but a scant wave for his sister to her surprise rhonwyn began to weep and edward who was with her put an arm about her shoulders for once she did not shrug him off there wife he will be back soon he reassured her he is growing up she admitted oh edward what shall i do when he goes off for good one day i am so used to looking after him what will i do she repeated you will raise our children to be every bit the fine young man your brother is becoming rhonwyn he told her our children she swallowed we have no children my lord nor the hope of any unless we can together overcome your fears rhonwyn he said quietly our wedding night was a cruel time for you but it was necessary for all the reasons that you well know by the rood wife would you have your father still living with us he teased her as they walked back into the hall marys blood no she exclaimed he chuckled do you think you know me well enough my wild welsh wife that you will let me into your bed again with your brother away it is the perfect time for us to attempt our reunion let me think on it she said low you have had almost six months to think on it rhonwyn he told her a slight edge to his voice what the hell was the matter with her will you force me again my lord she said angrily i know i cannot hope to overcome your strength but i will hate you for it i do not know if i can bear to be so possessed again when passion is felt by both lovers rhonwyn both are possessed and the pleasure is sublime i promise you he responded patiently yet he was impatient whenever the matter of conjugal relations came up she behaved as if he were a monster i felt pain and fear and loathing on our wedding night my lord she told him frankly i hated it when you covered my body with yours i was helpless to your lusts and there was no escaping it i do not know if i can feel any other way we do not have to mate at first rhonwyn he said we will begin slowly by touching you are as free to touch me as i am to touch you wife we need not be in our bed or even unclothed at first i do not think you would be fearful then does it always hurt she asked him pointedly nay the first time when a maidens virtue is taken from her aye but once she is used to her husbands lance sheathing itself ona regular basis nay there is no pain he promised her rhonwyn was thoughtful for a time she didnt know if she could ever overcome her distaste for this passion of his but for his sake she must try edward was a good man and he had been very patient can you bear to go slowly my lord she asked him i must for your sake he replied honestly then i will try she said why are you so fearful rhonwyn shrugged i cannot say she told him i know what you want is a natural thing particularly between a man and his wife but felt so powerless on our wedding night never before did i feel so impotent and i never again want to feel that way edward i will never forget seeing my mother helpless to ap gruffydds passions not that she seemed to mind her whole existence was for him so i was left to take care of myself and glynn it is true my kinsman and the men of cythraul had charge over us but i was my own mistress i wanted to ride and they taught me i wanted to learn how to use a sword they taught me they even taught me how to dice although they were reluctant to do so especially afterward when i beat them i was always in charge of my own being yet when we consummated our marriage i was not in control of myself you were in control and i could not bear it she bit her lower lip in vexation i am sorry edward i truly am but it is a mans place to lead he said slowly trying to understand her point of view but he really didnt why could she not be obedient he was half in love with her yet he did not know if he could be happy with a woman who constantly questioned him and would not do her duty by him why she asked why because that is the way it has always been rhonwyn is that not what the church teaches and did not god create adam the man first he said somewhat tersely and realizing his error rhonwyn replied quickly he created eve the woman or so my aunt the abbess says you are too independent for a wife he said shaking his head in mock despair unable to be angry with her i was raised to be so my lord she responded softly be independent wife except when you come to our bed then i would have you rely on me rhonwyn i find that i am beginning to care for you in ways that have nothing to do with lust or desire although i do desire you i believe they call what i am feeling love he took her hand in his and raising it to his lips kissed it softly first the back and then turning it over the palm the moist warmth of his mouth on her flesh sent a small shudder through her but it was not she decided entirely unpleasant she did not pull her hand away from his he drew her close and said softly put your head upon my chest rhonwyn and let me hold you for a moment his arms came about her but his grip was an easy one she might have broken away from if she chose to do so you are so beautiful rhonwyn uerch llywelyn he told her your hair is like moonbeams that have been spun with the sunlight by spiders and it is as soft as thistledown wife her cheek rested against his doublet just below his shoulder she could smell the scent of him and it was not unpleasant reaching out he captured her chin between his thumb and his forefinger tilting her head up to him you have eyes like emeralds what are emeralds she asked ingenuously the green jewels in my swords hilt he told her you think my eyes are like green stones for that is what those pieces of glass are green stones rhonwyn told him not certain that what he had obviously meant as a compliment was truly a compliment edward laughed dont be so damned practical he scolded her and then he brushed her lips lightly with his before releasing his grip on her emeralds are in their unset form exquisite jewels and your eyes are exquisite wife her mouth was tingling as it had when he had kissed her at the altar it was rather nice she thought your eyes are like a rainy sky she told him and your hair is like an oak leaf in november he grinned at her tis as pretty a compliment as i have ever received wife rhonwyn giggled i think you mad my lord she said now i must go about my chores for just because glynn has departed and you are of a mind to play the gallant does not mean i have been relieved of tasks she curtsied to him and turning hurried off edward watched her go he felt they had made a good beginning this morning in the months she had been his wife he had grown to genuinely like rhonwyn he had told her the truth when he had said he had deeper feelings burgeoning within him and it had all happened without kisses or copulation much to his surprise he had done what he must on their wedding night but now that he knew her he honestly desired her he had heard of women for whom passion had no meaning he hoped that his wife was not one of them he prayed silently that she simply needed to be awakened there was no pleasure in just satisfying an itch he could do that with any female he wanted to really love her and have her love him in return until now it had been easy to be patient he sensed it would not be any longer that evening he invited her to play at dice with him laughing when she won a silver penny you have been well taught lady he complimented her next time i shall challenge you to a game of chess instead he finished with a wry grin rising from the game table and moving to his chair by the fire i am skilled at that as well my lord edward she told him the hall was empty the servants gone a fire burned in the fireplace flanked by their great stone lions edward de beaulieu now sat in the masters chair with its leather seat and back will you sit in my lap rhonwyn he asked her what harm could there be in it she thought rising from the game table she sat herself within the curve of his arms they remained quietly for a time and then rhonwyn said the harvest has proved to be excellent my lord the granaries are full the orchards are ready to be picked and if the rain holds off we shall be able to start tomorrow why does your hair smell like heather he asked her sniffing enits mother makes the oil we put in my soap she replied the apple crop would appear to be bounteous we should begin pressing the cider in another week or two its delicious wife the scent is delicate and suits you well he sniffed again and then kissed the top of her gilt head my lord do you not wish to know how we fare here at haven tell me after the mass when we break our fast on the morrow he said the evening hours should be for gentler pursuits then he tilted her back in his arms and kissed her a lingering soft kiss that to rhonwyns surprise set her pulses racing but as quickly as his mouth had made such delicious contact he tipped her gently from his lap go to your bed now wife i bid you pleasant dreams i know that i shall have them this night slightly dazed she walked from the hall and climbed the winding staircase to her chambers enit was awaiting her and helped her prepare for bed finally alone rhonwyn lay in her bed eyes wide open considering what had happened this day would she be able to overcome her aversion to her husbands passion she was beginning to hope she could the following day they had surprise visitors edward was in the orchards overseeing the apple picking alfred rushed into the hall where his mistress was seated weaving a tapestry that would be placed over the fireplace the steward was flushed and pale by turns my lady my lady the lord edward and his wife are but a mile from haven the messenger has just now come what are we to do the lord edward rhonwyn was slightly confused the prince my lady king henrys son with his lady wife what shall i do rhonwyn stood up we do not know if they will remain the night but have the best guest chamber prepared just in case they do did the messenger say how many are in their party the cook must be able to feed them all and well no matter send john to the orchards to fetch my lord immediately i must go and change my gown i cannot greet the kings son looking like this hurry alfred hurry she ran from the hall calling as she went enit to me lass but enit by some magic known only to servants was already in her mistresss garderobe pulling out a more elegant gown for her lady to wear it was apple green silk with a sleeveless overgown of deeper green and silver brocade she lay it with a silver brocaded girdle upon the bed even as rhonwyn hurried into the chamber pulling her everyday kirtle over her head as she came after dressing rhonwyn enit quickly redid her hair parting it in the center and plaiting it and then fixing the braids about rhonwyns head a gauze veil with a small silver circlet completed the attire thank you rhonwyn said jumping up and hurrying from her chamber it simply would not do to have the prince and his wife arrive and have neither she nor edward be there to greet them she ran down the stairs hearing enit coming behind her in the hall the servants were running back and forth with wine and plates of fruit and cheese for the high board the fire was built higher edward dashed in his handsome face streaked with dirt seeing his wife he gave her a wave and bolted out again heading to his own chamber to change his clothing theyre at the foot of the hill lady alfred said as a young lad ran in to whisper to him rhonwyn swallowed hard there was nothing for it she would have to greet the prince and his wife alone she walked from the great hall down the corridor a short distance and out the door of the castle to stand a moment on the stairway landing even as the lord edward and his wife rode into the courtyard then she glided down the staircase reaching them as the prince dismounted and lifted his lady from her horse rhonwyn curtsied gracefully and low my lord edward my lady eleanor i bid you welcome to haven castle the prince raised her up and looked directly into her face so you are ap gruffydds wench he said i am my lord rhonwyn replied you are not at all what i expected the welsh are dark are they not lady most are my lord but my mother descended from a race who were known as the fair folk while i resemble ap gruffydd in features i have my mothers coloring you are far prettier than ap gruffydd prince edward said with a small chuckle he turned away from her a moment mon coeur this is the prince of the welshs daughter and the wife of edward de beaulieu the lady rhonwyn he turned back to his hostess my wife the lady eleanor rhonwyn curtsied again then rising said will you not come into the hall and be refreshed there is both food and wine awaiting you and water with which to wash the dust of your travels away she led them into the castle in the hall edward de beaulieu came forward and bowed to the royal couple forgive me my lord for not being here to welcome you but i was in the orchards when i was informed of your arrival as i would not greet you in the clothing i have worked the day in and as there was little time to change i had to leave my wife to see to you both he bowed to the prince again and kissed the lady eleanors gloved hand your wife did you proud de beaulieu and i was happy to be greeted by so fair a lady prince edward said graciously rhonwyn nodded to alfred who hurried forward with a tray holding four of the silver goblets with the green stones he offered one to the prince first and then to his wife his master and his lady to the king de beaulieu said to the king his companions repeated and they drank their wine as the princes retainers filed into the hall you will stay the night edward de beaulieu said we will prince edward said can you feed this lot of mine there are twenty of them and they carry oatcakes if you cannot there is more than enough food at haven for your men my lord edward rhonwyn said quickly i usually have the cook prepare too much to he honest with you but then the poor who come to our door are more easily fed we had at least a half an hours warning of your arrival she said with a twinkle in her eye the prince burst out laughing you are nothing like your father lady he said jovially you could not have given me a greater compliment my lord edward she replied ap gruffydd is not a man whom i would emulate you speak harshly of him lady the prince remarked i mean him no disrespect my lord edward rhonwyn said he is a dilficult man but he did me a service when he arranged my marriage with my own edward the prince nodded and then his wife said to rhonwyn have you children yet lady rhonwyn we have had four although we lost our daughter joan shortly after her birth still eleanor john and henry are fair children and i am grateful to god for them we were only wed in april rhonwyn answered the princes wife and you are not yet with child you must pray to saint anne lady for she will not fail you the princess smiled warmly at rhonwyn i can see you care for your husband the children will come they always come from love the castle cook had worked a miracle and when the dinner hour came the food began to appear upon the tables above and below the salt with great rapidity bread and fruit had already been set upon them earlier along with small wheels of cheese now came roasted venison enough for all there were platters with capons in lemon sauce and trout broiled in wine upon beds of cress lampreys in galytyne a large dish of mortrewsa meat dish made with eggs and bread crumbsand rhonwyns favorite blankmanger there was lettuce braised in wine and boiled peas loaves of freshly baked bread and sweet butter apple beer was served but at the high board where the prince and princess sat with edward de beaulieu and his wife there was wine you have no priest the prince asked he has gone to shrewsbury to visit friends at the abbey his host said smoothly i wished him to be here when i spoke with you on a certain matter the prince said king louis of france is preparing another crusade for next year my wife and i intend to go i have spent the summer traveling about visiting various lords to ask who would go with me will you edward de beaulieu is it safe for you to leave england my lord edward his host asked concerned with my uncle de montfort dead and buried there is none who would oppose my father or me once i become king may it be many years hence i cannot indulge myself i am not my greatuncle richard coeur de lion to rule england i must be in england now is my chance to help retake the holy land and drive the infidel to hell and beyond will you come with me edward de beaulieu i will go with you my lord edward came the reply and i too rhonwyn said enthusiastically the lord of haven laughed softly my wife has a warriors heart he explained but i would go with the prince rhonwyn said earnestly and before her husband might speak further the princess spoke i am going with my husband my lord if your lady wishes to go i see no reason why she cannot come unless my lord you do not wish her to come oh edward please rhonwyn begged him i do not wish to be separated from you now the emerald eyes were shining with excitement and he suddenly realized that he did not wish to be separated from her either it will be a hard life wife he said i have lived a hard life my lord she replied he sighed you must swear to me that you will obey me implicitly if i let you come with me he warned her i promise she swore i will be happy to have the lady rhonwyn and her servant as part of my train the princess said graciously if of course you let her come with us she quickly amended she may come my lady eleanor and i thank you for your most gracious invitation to include my wife among your women thank you both rhonwyn said excitedly how the hell did ap gruffydd sire such a daughter the prince wondered to himself fair of face and obviously good of heart there would appear to be no guile in her she seems content with de beaulieu and i am glad now having met her he was pleased his host had agreed to come with him it proved that edward de beaulieu was loyal to edward plantagenet while he spoke as if his father would live a great deal longer the prince knew it wasnt so his father was over sixty now and there were things his mother had told him that others did not know but if the worst happened and his father died while he was on crusade his mother queen eleanor was strong enough to hold the country together until his return and if he died on crusade he had two young sons in england whom his mother would protect with her own life the dynasty would continue he was content knowing that the prince and his wife departed the following morning their business at haven completed successfully the two edwards had discussed when and where they would meet the lord of haven had promised to bring with him one hundred soldiers whom he would feed equip and house at his own expense he would also attempt to raise a group of ten mounted knights but he quite honestly told the prince he could not guarantee it do your best the prince said every man who comes will be guaranteed forgiveness of all his sins by the church when we return to england i have this on the authority of the archbishop of canterbury himself de beaulieu those who die on this crusade will be guaranteed entry directly into heaven and will not have to go to purgatory the pope has promised it the royal couple then rode from haven castle taking the shrewsbury road when they had gone rhonwyn said enthusiastically i must begin more serious practice with my weapons if i am to be ready when we go on crusade the prince and his wife were scarcely gone when another visitor arrived at haven rafe de beaulieu had not been happy to learn of his cousins marriage now as he entered the great hall he was greeted by the sight of edward kissing the hand of a beautiful young girl surely this couldnt be the bride cousin he said loudly grinning as the couple broke apart and who is this pretty wench are you already bored with your wee welsh wife edward and where did you find this glorious creature greetings cousin and as always you jump to wrong conclusions edward said this is my wife rhonwyn uerch llywelyn sweeting my nearest kin rafe de beaulieu rafe was stunned but quickly recovering he bowed to rhonwyn and taking up her small hand kissed it lady my cousins good fortune overwhelms me all the welsh i have ever known are dark jesu she was absolutely magnificent poor sweet kate was but a faint star to this girls brilliant sun for a moment he was angry that his sister should have been so cheated but then the lady rhonwyn wasnt responsible she was only a woman and must do the bidding of her menfolk you are welcome to haven my lord rafe rhonwyn told him thinking that he was arrogant how dare he enter her home and assume ap gruffydds daughter was some tiny dark creature and she was a woman of loose morals who was edwards leman he could see the anger in her eyes at his assumptions and he knew he couldnt blame her if she hated him i have come to pay my respects and bring you katherines good wishes cousin he said your sister is well edward asked and then he suddenly thought that katherine de beaulieu must surely be hurt by his apparent rejection of her kate had always been such a gentle and softspoken girl she is well she would have come but it is cider season and kates cider is known throughout the region she will allow no one else to oversee its making he chuckled she is a good chatelaine i shall be hardpressed to find a wife who can oversee ardley as our kate does rafe de beaulieu was a tall slender man with edwards light brown hair and light blue eyes he and his sister were edwards only living relations they were the children of his fathers younger brother they lived on a small manor near the town of shrewsbury two daysride from haven you will stay edward said knowing full well the answer aye just for the night i must leave tomorrow rafe answered then you came out of curiosity rhonwyn said sharply aye lady i did he admitted with a grin wondering silently how it was his cousin edward was so damned fortunate i shall see a chamber is prepared for you rhonwyn said and with a smile at her husband and a cursory nod at rafe she hurried from the great hall of the castle their visitor she decided was an irritating fellow and she was glad he lived two days ride from haven she was not unhappy to see her husbands cousin depart the next morning edward had said nothing to rafe about the crusade while he intended to ask him to steward haven in his absence he wasnt certain yet whether they would really go he doubted king henry would be happy to have his heir gone so far from england and it was the king who held the purse strings the prince needed loosened to finance this great adventure rhonwyn however had no doubts that they were going and no sooner had rafe gone his way home she began to worry about her brother oh edward what are we to do with glynn ap gruffydd will never allow us to take him with us and you cannot leave him alone here at haven for some reason that i have never fathomed glynn adores the prince of the welsh he would not mean to betray us but he could very well be persuaded by that wily man who sired us both we cannot send him back to cythraul it would be too cruel although morgan ap owen would care for him rhonwyns face was concerned we us his heart soared she was beginning to think of them as one even if she still held his passion at bay perhaps we might send glynn to the abbey school in shrewsbury he suggested they could teach him far more than father john can i will pay his fees myself and he will be safe there from your father but what of his identity she fretted glynn of thorley he reminded her he will be thought to be my get i shall tell the father abbott that he is my relative that his mother is deceased and that his pater is not to be discussed that is enough to give truth to the idea that i sired him but glynn must remain silent rhonwyn regarding his true parentage can he do it she nodded he can he will be disappointed not to go with us on crusade but he will be equally excited about going to the abbey school now that he has been exposed to learning it would seem he has a great capacity for it i think he might be a priest or a scholar that evening she curled herself in his lap again and he stroked her silken head in a leisurely fashion this time she had come to him we shall have little time once we begin the crusade to cohabit as man and wife he told her meaningfully we do not go for many months she said softly thinking that she must ask enits mother what could be done to prevent conception if she was to yield herself to her husbands passions once again she did not intend to conceive a child and thus be prevented from going with him on crusade oh his hand was gently fondling her breasts they are like the perfect round apples in our orchards he told her rhonwyn could feel her breath tight in her chest his hand was very exciting teasing tenderly at her bosom she neither forbade him nor stopped him from his love play i know it is too soon he said but i cannot wait for the night when we lie naked side by side and i may cover those precious little orbs with kisses wife i am less afraid and repelled than i have been in the past she admitted shyly we are getting to know one another he said his hand removed itself from her breasts and tilted her face to his he touched her lips softly at first and then as her budding passion began to overcome them both his lips took possession of hers with a deeper fierceness she didnt resist indeed her lips moved beneath his with a girlish innocence that enchanted him before she might grow fearful before he might allow his desire for her to gain a mastery over them he broke off the kiss and looking down at her said you are so lovely rhonwyn i am in love with you and i would have you be in love with me wife give me time edward she said to him i am only beginning to understand this thing you call passion and i do thank you for your gentle patience with me you are a prize very worth having rhonwyn uerch llywelyn how much sweeter our coming together again will be for the waiting we must endure his gray eyes smiled down at her reaching up she touched his cheek i will try very hard not to keep you waiting too much longer she promised him her slender fingers caressed his face catching her hand in his he kissed each of those fingers with fervor it shall be in your time my love for i want more than anything else for you to be happy i am happy now safe in your strong arms she replied on the night you tell me our waiting is over rhonwyn i shall make you happier than you have ever known he vowed passionately part ii rhonwyn chapter glynn returned from shrewsbury eager to recount his travels and small adventures rhonwyn had never known her brother to be so very talkative i saw ships that came upriver from cardiff he said excitedly and the abbey and the churches sister and the markets with all their goods and the shops never have i seen their like i ate a pomegranate rhonwyn its a fruit from the south there is so much more to the world than i could have believed possible i want to travel some more when i am older i shall earn my way singing my ballads in inns and festivals and noble courts first you must finish your education rhonwyn told him and as much as i dislike mentioning it our sire may have something to say about what you make of your life glynn ap llywelyn he may even plan a marriage for you as he did for me not until i have traveled the world glynn said firmly and for the first time she saw ap gruffydd in her brother as they sat at the high board that evening edward said to his young brotherinlaw would you enjoy going to the abbey school in shrewsbury glynn could i the boy asked his eyes wide with hope perhaps next spring it could be arranged while you were gone prince edward and his wife came unexpectedly to haven king louis of france is planning another crusade to the holy land next year your sister and i are to accompany the prince while we are gone you must continue your education what better place than in shrewsbury my lord father john spoke up why would the prince come here we are but a small marcher holding and not important to him edward plantagenet will sooner than later be englands king good father it is for the very reason i am a marcher lord that he came to havenatthorley and the fact that am wed to ap gruffydds daughter he seeks to divine my loyalties without asking there was no way i could refuse him without arousing his suspicions that my lady wife enthusiastically volunteered to go along has quite raised prince edwards esteem of me edward de beaulieu finished with a chuckle why can i not go too glynn asked because brotherinlaw i am certain your father would not allow it there will be time for you to go on crusade when you are older for now i think it best and i believe your father will agree that you continue your education in shrewsbury edward replied if you retake the holy land there will be no more crusades glynn said gloomily the saracens and the christians have battled back and forth over the holy ground for centuries now glynn there will always be crusades i fear do not despair you will have your chance one day martinmas the feast of st martin was celebrated on november eleventh a fat goose was slaughtered and roasted to be served in the hall on november twentyfifth st catherines day was celebrated with cathern cakes and a beverage called lambs wool named for the roasted apple that floated in it which was served in a special cathern bowl edward presented his wife with a special brooch in the shape of a wheel made from silver and onyx the twelve days of christmas came and went and it was january edward de beaulieu was already recruiting men to accompany them on crusade he had been informed by royal messenger that while he was away his taxes would be forgiven he so informed his tenants and serfs that whoever accompanied him would also be excused from their taxes and rents there was no shortage of volunteers under those conditions the lord of the castle was able to pick and choose whom he would take with him by midjanuary the one hundred chosen men were hard at work training with bow and pike and stave they learned how to use a battering ram and a siege weapon called a tarques they learned how to dig beneath a wall so as to collapse it three young men from less important families than edward de beaulieus and who had already been knighted but sought adventure came to havenatthorley to join the lords party such an opportunity was not to be missed for if they performed well on the field of battle and drew favorable attention to themselves their fortunes could be made sir fulk sir robert and sir hugo all came with squire horses and weapons they were welcomed and given places in the hall and at the lords board they were at first amused by the ladys desire to fight alongside them but when they learned firsthand of rhonwyns skill with weapons their laughter turned to respect edward bristled silently at his wifes unorthodox behavior as her passion for the crusade deepened it seemed she became less interested in a shared passion between them yet his desire for her was growing daily and he was forced on several occasions to restrain his jealousy at the open admiration for rhonwyn of the three young knights it was he well knew nothing more than esteem on the part of sir fulk sir robert and sir hugo as for rhonwyn the company of the knights meant nothing more to her than that of oth and dewi with warriors about her she simply seemed back in her element once again edward de beaulieu was beginning to wish that edward plantagenet had never come to haven with his talk of crusades and with a wife who was both willing and able to follow him at least the prince had legitimate heirs rhonwyn had never been counted a fool she sensed her husbands unhappiness and knew there was but one way to placate him she must allow him possession of her body once more she wondered if she could do it without showing distaste she no longer worried about becoming enceinte for enits mother had indeed known just what to use to prevent such an event each morning her maidservant brought her a draught to drink but of course rhonwyn knew she could never be certain of its effects unless there was the chance of her having a child she had to admit she found kissing and caressing less unpleasant than at first edward might become passionate with her but he had never been cruel or rough but for that first night rhonwyn counted herself a brave woman she did not fear battle or even death but she did fear the marital act it was simply too allpossessing but she would have to learn to endure it as she endured the pain of a wound edward was a good man and she owed him not just her loyalty but his rights as a husband if he repudiated her her father would be shamed and she could not allow that to happen she gathered all her courage and that evening before she departed the hall she whispered to him perhaps tonight i am brave enough my lord to share my bed with you then she hurried to her chamber in the south tower as was her custom since being civilized she bathed and put on a clean chemise then she dismissed enit she waited sitting on the edge of her bed as she brushed her long hair coming through the door connecting their bedchambers he silently took the pearwood brush and skimmed it down the silken length he did not understand this change of heart that had suddenly affected her but he sensed he must be tender with her his arm slipped about her narrow waist to draw her back against him he nuzzled at her ear and all the while he brushed and brushed and brushed the swath of hair then to her surprise he ceased and efficiently plaited her tresses into a single thick braid fastening it with the ribbon he pulled from her chemise he drew the garment off her shoulders and it slid to her waist kneeling before her edward reached up and began to caress her small breasts she shivered but did not stop him his fingers teased playfully at her nipples arousing her slowly and carefully standing now he drew her up with him and kissed her his mouth working tenderly over hers here at least he knew she was not afraid for his wife enjoyed kissing it seemed rhonwyn slipped her arms about his neck and as her bare flesh pressed against his chest she realized that he wore no clothes she had been so intensely focused on her own situation that she hadnt even looked at him now she felt him against her his thighs were hairy as was his chest its fur tickling her his lips were intoxicating and for the briefest moment she allowed herself to become lost in his kisses then she felt it his manhood burgeoning against her thigh and she tensed once more she knew what was to come next he would cover her body with his big frame and possess her in a way that terrified her and this time she could not cry out or struggle against him trust me he begged her feeling her slender body becoming tight once more he kissed her closed eyelids the tip of her nose the corners of her mouth pressing her back onto their bed he murmured into her ear there is pleasure in a man and womans coming together my lambkin let me share that pleasure with you rhonwyn please i cannot help how i feel she half sobbed please edward my lord just do what you will with me he rolled away from her and then propping himself upon his elbow said angrily you are behaving like a whore damnit you spread yourself for me and yet you feel nothing at all why she was weeping now i do not know she said surely ap gruffydd loved your mam and treated her well edward said struggling to keep his lust under control he did rhonwyn cried their passion for one another is the stuff legends are made of i know now they shut everyone and everything out of their lives even glynn and me their thoughts were only for each other do you fear to love me rhonwyn he asked her aye i do she admitted fiercely i dont want to lose myself edward can you understand that i love you yet am i any less the man i was when you met me he demanded of her you seem kinder she whispered his hand was caressing her quivering belly you make me want to be kinder rhonwyn but that does not mean i have lost control over myself nor will you if you love me ap gruffydds passion for vala was a unique occurrence an obsession they both felt in the powerful attraction they had for one another most marriage unions are not like that my lambkin what are they like she said low his fingers were tangling themselves in her thick silvery bush she was fearful yet found it very exciting and did not stop him my parents despised one another they were wed because their lands adjoined each other and my mother was an only child my fathers brother however fell in love with his own wife they were happy together and they respected one another they were faithful till death unlike my parents my father kept a series of lemans my mother grew more bitter over it as each day passed but she would not let him in her bed after she had given him his heir he died in the bed of one of his other women and my mother would not wash his body for burial my aunt came and did it she was a gentle woman with a forgiving heart my mother finally died several years ago of her own bile i am certain only the poor may have the luxury of marrying for love rhonwyn but often those of our class grow to love our mates i have fallen in love with you and i feel a fury within me when other men admire you especially because i know that i cannot have you any more than they can oh it cannot go on between us like this he said i know she replied certainly you cannot fear what is familiar to you wife from this night on we will share a bed you know i mean you no harm but i want you and by the rood i shall have you his fingers caressed the pink slit that hid all her treasures he pushed past it and began to tease at the tiny nub of flesh within soon she was moist and he slid a finger deep inside her rhonwyn gasped softly at this unexpected onslaught but she managed not to cry out it wasnt really that awful the digit within her moved slowly edward leaned over and began kissing her again but then without warning his finger was withdrawn and his body was covering hers rhonwyn fought with herself not to scream as his weight pressed her down into the feather bed and mattress his rockhard manhood slid easily into her this time there lambkin is it not better this time he murmured into her ear his breath was hot and moist she couldnt speak she could barely breathe but she forced herself to embrace him so he should not know her terror so that he might gain his pleasure from her and leave her be he moved with increasing rapidity upon her his manhood driving deep inside her until he collapsed finally he rolled away allowing her to draw a deep breath of relief after a time he said sadly you had no joy of it did you wife taking her hand up he kissed the fingers individually i want you to love me rhonwyn and by god there will come a day when you will i think i may she told him and i shall never again deny you your rights my lord edward in time i may come to gain happiness from our bodies joining i am no longer fearful of your kisses or your touching the rest will come in time i know it i pray it she thought silently as he gathered her into his arms and fell asleep what was it she wondered that made her resist so natural a happening if he had been a cruel man she might have understood herself better still something niggled at the back of her brain and fretted her over this passion between a man and a woman he continued to join her each night and rhonwyn grew quite used to having him beside her she was actually beginning to find his bulk comforting but for the nights when her womans show of blood was upon her he used her body regularly while her fear of him had subsided she could not seem to gain the same pleasure from their coupling that he did it saddened them both but rhonwyn learned by caressing and kissing edward she offered them both some measure of enjoyment for now it was all she could do but pray for some change that would one day allow her to delight in their coming together th e winter subsided and spring came they had been wed for a year and in that time had heard nothing from ap gruffydd having received a message from prince edward edward finally sent for his cousin rafe de beaulieu the crusade was to proceed at edwards call both rafe and his younger sister katherine came to haven katherine de beaulieu was much like her brother in features but in manner she was a quiet and delerential girl she was eighteen to rhonwyns seventeen and neither married nor betrothed she did not according to rafe have enough of a dowry our parents were of modest means we always thought she would wed edward he said boldly i told you i should give kate a generous dower edward said through gritted teeth she is worthy of it and my blood kin besides i am content to remain at ardley and care for your house brother katherine said openly embarrassed by her siblings rudeness her fair skin was flushed will you remain at haven with your brother while he is here mistress rhonwyn asked or will you return to your home she ignored rafe my brother feels i should not be left alone at ardley cousin rhonwyn the girl said he has a trusted bailiff who will care for the manor in our absence with your permission in your absence i shall take your place overseeing this household you have my permission cousin rhonwyn replied i should appreciate it if you would have young glynn of thorley home on his school holidays should he wish it so your wife is thoughtful of your bastard ned rafe de beaulieu said clapping his cousin on the back heartily which of your wenches did you get the lad on you sly dog why do you put up with his rudeness rhonwyn grumbled later when they had a moment of privacy edward smiled rafe is a good man wife but he loves his sister dearly and is jealous seeing you in what he believed would be her place i know his tongue is sharp ofttimes but his serfs and his few tenants worship him for his heart is kind he will not permit children beneath the age of ten to work in his fields more than three hours a day i do not like him rhonwyn said although i think his sister a sweet girl with no jealousy or ambition in her heart rafe is arrogant and i believe sees himself in your place edward laughed nay he does not but i will agree his way is sometimes rough but if you fear such a thing give me a son and rafe will be forced to melt away rhonwyn my wild welsh wife she blushed but she also smiled it had been decided between them that rafe and his sister not know glynns true identity ap gruffydds son was far safer that way and edward was not really certain how far he might trust his cousin rafe was his heir in the event he died without issue but now that edward had a wife and it appeared he had fathered a son on a former leman perhaps his cousin would be less proprietary of haven he had been very angry and greatly disappointed when edward told him of the marriage that was to be arranged between him and the welsh princes daughter but rafe de beaulieu had not bothered to look for a husband for his sister now that there was a chance that edward and his wife might not even return from the crusade they were embarking upon such a venture was a dangerous thing and many who went never lived to see england again if rafe became lord thorley of haven he could make kate a far better match than rafe de beaulieu of ardley manor could by waiting he increased both their chances and what if the welsh wench perished on crusade but ned came home he could wed kate to their cousin as his parents had always hoped and if ned perished and the lady rhonwyn returned he would marry himself to the welsh girl in a trice and thereby gain haven by both inheritance and marriage to ap gruffydds daughter whose very presence would keep those marauders from his gates he could sense that his fortune was already made preparations for the departure were well underway as the spring deepened and the fields grew green with new growth provisions had to be gathered and packed for the troop of men edward had promised the prince horses were shod wagons repaired made solid and packed the women at thorley had sewed all winter making waterproof tents for the expedition a large one for the lord and his wife smaller ones for the knights and the foot soldiers was the grindstone packed and the bedding and small furniture for the lords tent a separate wagon was loaded for the kitchen and its basic utensils glynn was taken by his sister and brotherinlaw to shrewsbury to the abbey school where he had been enrolled the abbott received them in his private chambers and fixing edward de beaulieu with a stern look said i want the truth of this boys heritage my lord or i will not have him it has been implied that he is your get but i see nothing of you in this lad you may speak to me as you would were we in the confessional but for the safety of my abbey i will know the truth he is glynn ap llywelyn my wifes younger brother father abbott was the immediate reply the prince left the boy in my charge months ago as my wife had never been separated from her sibling and from his character it is obvious to all that he is not meant to be a soldier he loves learning and creating music poetry and songs his true identity we have kept carefully to ourselves for i would not have this boy used as a weapon against any even my cousin rafe does not know who he is we thought it better that it was believed he was mine the abbott nodded understanding does his father know where he is my lord aye he does when he brought the boy to us he left two of his men with the lad i have sent them back into wales to tell ap gruffydd where his son is he will not object you have sworn this conversation between us is private my lord abbott now i beg you to keep the secret of my brotherinlaws true identity hidden and to yourself alone should there be war between wales and england while my wife and i are gone on crusade the lad will disappear from your abbey and no harm will come to you or your people i swear it though glynns father thinks little of his inclinations for learning and his penchant for poetry he loves the boy few if any know of his existence although it is rumored that the prince of the welsh has a son the abbott was silent a moment and then he turned to glynn tell me my son are you content to be known as a bastard within these walls as a noblemans get you will of course be treated well but there will be some who may bully you for your supposed birth i am a bastard glynn replied quietly for our father was not wed to our mother except in their hearts my lord abbott still i have been treated well my whole life if there are those who seek to dignify their own paltry existences by denigrating mine i can but pray for them have not a warriors heart i fear you are most welcome to the abbey school glynn of thorley abbott boniface said with a small smile the lad was indeed intelligent and his quiet reply led the cleric to wonder if the boy might not be a fit candidate for the religious life only time would tell bid your sister and brotherinlaw farewell my son he said glynn shook edwards hand thank you he said simply i will pray for your success and speedy return my lord you may visit haven whenever there is a holiday and you wish to go home rafe and katherine will be your family until we return edward replied giving the lad a quick hug and ruffling his dark hair glynn turned to his sister there were tears in rhonwyns eyes and her lip was trembling with emotion do not dare weep sister he scolded her gently for the first time in their lives taking the lead this is what i want and to be with your husband in the service of god is what you want glynn put his arms about rhonwyn and hugged her she drew away from him taking his face in her hands when had he gotten so tall so big was that a bit of beard starting to grow on his chin she kissed him on both of his cheeks when i return you will be a man she lamented i should be a man eventually in any case he told her with a small smile gently touching her cheek with his knuckles you will study hard and obey the brothers she said suddenly stern with him then she lowered her voice if there is trouble oth and dewi will come for you go with them without hesitation glynn promise me that little brother i promise he answered her he kissed her quickly on the lips and the forehead go with god rhonwyn uerch llywelyn and return safely to us when you can then he turned and followed the brother who had come to escort him from the lord abbotts chambers rhonwyn immediately burst into tears flinging herself into edwards arms and sobbing piteously they have hardly been separated in all their lifetime edward explained to the abbott it is good to see such devotion between a brother and sister the abbott noted then he said to rhonwyn whose sobs were now sniffles we will take good care of your brother my lady i swear it ththank you mmy lord abbott rhonwyn managed to say they left the abbey and returned almost immediately to haven where their party was ready to depart for the coast katherine and her brother bid them adieu i shall pray every day for your safety and your success she said softly godspeed cousins there were tears in her soft blue eyes and rhonwyn swallowed her jealousy when she thought kates gaze lingered a fraction of a second too long upon edward my husband and i thank you dear kate we shall be grateful for your prayers she returned their train moved off down the castle hill onto the local road that would lead them to a wider and larger main road what a woman she is rafe said softly the fates have played us both a nasty jest little sister you with your gentle ways would be a far better mate for edward and rhonwyn with her fiery ways would find herself happier with me for a husband rafe kate was shocked to hear him voice such sentiments their union is the kings will she said chidingly he laughed softly do not scold me kate for wanting what i shall never have i firmly believe that they will both return one day the english army was to gather at dover and from there go on to bordeaux their journey would be by both land and water barges took them from haven down the severn to gloucester they moved overland from there skirting about the city of london and heading for their first destination at dover arriving there in midmay they discovered that prince edward was not ready to go those already in dover would leave england on one of the advance vessels for france and travel onward across the countryside for aiguesmortes on the mediterranean sea meeting up with the french there prince edward and his train would follow as quickly as possible my wife was to be a part of the princess eleanors train edward told the port official in charge shell join the princess when prince edward reaches aiguesmortes was the reply if shes going shell have to travel with you for now my lord the port official said then his manner softened theres another lady traveling on the ship im assigning to you my lady youll share a tiny cabin and be company for each other her husband too is among the kings knights my husband and i cannot be together rhonwyn was distressed the men will have to find places to sleep on the deck my lady you are going to war against the infidel not on a honeymoon voyage the port official said sharply you will address me courteously sir rhonwyn said an equally sharp edge to her voice i am the prince of the welshs daughter not some country squires wife your pardon my lady the official quickly replied with the prince being delayed i am at my wits end trying to make everything come out correctly rhonwyn nodded regally at him and her husband managed to suppress his amusement the vessel aboard which they sailed from dover was a large one all their menatarms and the three knights their horses and their equipment was upon it as was a smaller party from oxford they sailed in a season of good weather but were at sea for ten days before reaching bordeaux the boredom that had enveloped them aboard ship evaporated as they now headed south overland for frances single mediterranean port of aiguesmortes as they traveled the road grew more and more crowded with noblemen knights and menatarms all bound for the same destination and the crusade it was almost the end of june when they reached aiguesmortes there they learned that prince edward had not left england yet the english were not certain what they should do the french king frail his eyes aglow with the fire of a zealot came to speak with them all we are assured he said that your prince will join us if not here then in the holy land he has sent word that those of you already here should follow me and he will meet us as soon as he can there are ships aplenty for you all we are happy to have been chosen for so worthy a crusade on behalf of our dear lord jesus christ when king louis had left them the english began to talk among themselves some of them were angry and others were reticent about following in the french kings wake without their own prince tis typical of edward longshanks to leave us here at the mercy of the french one knight grumbled he was so damned insistent that we be ready on time and then tis he who is still in england he will come another man said i have heard it was difficult getting money out of the king for this venture king henry did not want his son to go but the queen finally prevailed upon him saying that enough good men were joining with the prince that it would be churlish if he did not come now having already promised and just where did you obtain your information the first knight asked disbelieving the messenger from our king who came to king louis was the reply a friendly mug or two of ale always loosens a good mans tongue and this fellow had ridden hard to bring his message to the french from our henry what of the women with us came the question now edward de beaulieu spoke up they must come as they had planned he said we can hardly leave them here in france at the mercy of strangers besides if the prince comes straight through from england as i believe he will he will not stop at aiguesmortes and then our ladies would be stranded we must see the french make accommodation for them aye aye aye came the agreement of the men gathered together the french were approached there were only six english noblewomen and their maidservants in the group the french queen graciously invited them to travel to carthage upon her vessel where they would be comfortable after all she reasoned to her husband these ladies were to travel in the train of my nephews wife we cannot simply cast them away they are very brave louis to have come with their husbands for christs sake until edward and his wife arrive we must have a care for them the eighth crusade departed aiguesmortes on the first of july in the year twelveseventy the voyage to carthage took them seventeen days and was uneventful but for their departure aiguesmortes was frances only toehold on the mediterranean and it was a poor harbor separated from direct access to the sea by enormous sand dunes and girded about by large lagoons the ships had to navigate through continuous and unceasing channels before reaching the open sea it took a full day as they moved across the mediterranean it grew increasingly warmer neither the english nor the french were used to such heat the crusaders encampment in carthage was set up with its rows of tents the great tent in the center of the camp belonging to the french king there were cook tents for the soldiers and a hospital tent water was available but not in great supply as some of the wells outside of the city of carthage had obviously been deliberately poisoned sickness began to break out within the encampment despite the best efforts of the physicians to prevent it cesspits were dug for the epidemic of loose bowels that affected the men they were quickly filled and covered even as new pits were being opened king louis grew ill he was not a young man and the heat was taking its toll on him many around him were ill including several of the english knights when edward de beaulieu grew sick rhonwyn was at first overcome with fear but then she rallied the sickness she suspected came from the filth in the camp she insisted on having their tent moved to the very edge of the encampment the dysentery that affected him made his bowels run black and left him weak rhonwyn insisted the water her husband drank be boiled with three quinces then strained through a clean cloth quinces were excellent for stopping dysentery rhonwyn knew she then mashed the pulp of the stewed fruit with very sweet dates and fed it to him the tent she kept scrupulously clean emptying the night jar and cleaning it with vinegar and boiling water each time he used it she recommended this manner of care to the french queen but the kings physician laughed and said that rhonwyn was oldfashioned when the evil humors drained from the king he would be well and the crusade would continue as god had planned it edward de beaulieu had truly thought he was going to die but then his wifes treatment began to work his bowels stopped running and his belly calmed are you a witch he teased her tis but practical medicine i was taught at mercy abbey she said with a smile coming to sit on the edge of the camp bed where he now lay leaning down she took a sea sponge from the basin of warm water at her feet and began to bathe him gently the infirmarian at the abbey had always said that dirt was nasty and attracted evil humors no matter what the priests said about cleanliness being a vanity the water smells like you he told her i put a drop of my oil in it she replied sweeping the sponge over his broad chest she worked swiftly for she did not want him to get a chill if such a thing was possible in this heat when she had bathed every bit of him and tucked him back beneath the coverlet she emptied the basin and then came to sit by him again lay with me he said pulling her into his arms he stroked her fair hair with his big hand le was truly feeling better and was grateful for her kindness in his illness he had thought often of his cousin katherine and wished that rhonwyn would be more like her he felt no guilt for the secret reflection women should be like katherinewho was nurturing and kind it was true that the two young women had lived different lives but still rhonwyns sojourn at mercy abbey should have taught her that women must subject themselves to their husbands her recent behavior and nursing skills had given him reason to hope that perhaps rhonwyn was becoming more the woman he desired and needed he smiled down gently on her she could feel his heart beating beneath her ear as her head lay upon his chest i love him she thought suddenly the mere idea of losing him makes me feel as if my heart would crack open she had to tell him looking up at him she said edward i love you i know i am not the most affectionate of women but i do love you if i should lose you i would die my lord i would and suddenly tears were rolling down her pale cheeks and she could not stifle them his arms closed back about her and he replied oh rhonwyn my wild and sweet welsh wife do you not know how long i have waited and yearned to hear you say those words nay lambkin you cannot imagine when i am well we will consider the rest but for now just knowing you love me renews my hope and i already feel new strength pouring through my veins i will get well all the quicker for knowing you care he kissed the tears from her cheeks what a lass you are and he smiled tenderly at her she was indeed changing le would get her with child as soon as his full strength returned and then send her home with his heir in her belly she would leave him without protest for by then she would fully understand her wifely duty to him he smiled well pleased and kissed her lips softly king louis grew worse with his illness dysentery and plague were rife among the crusaders worse the infidels were sending out raiding parties to harass the invaders the kings brother charles of anjou who was the king of naples and sicily had been the one to convince his sibling that coming to carthage and converting the emir would gain him favor with the pope as the king grew weaker charles of anjou began to talk of a truce finally on the twentyfifth day of august king louis ix died of his illness several days later prince edward finally arrived from england to find his uncle already prepared for burial and the long trip home to france charles of anjou was in the midst of negotiating a truce with the infidel much to prince edwards fury you are a traitor to all of christendom he roared at the frenchman i will not be party to such treachery jerusalem must be freed from the infidel and instead you cowardly dog you seek to make a truce with our enemy faugh you sicken me my lord i cannot be in your presence without wanting to puke you are free to pursue your crusade my lord charles of anjou said silkily with my brother dead i must think of my own kingdom of sicily it is not as distant from the infidel as is your england prince edward left the royal tent and called for the english knights to meet with him he told them what had happened and of his disgust with the french i am going on to acre and from there i will mount an expedition to take jerusalem back from the infidel are you with me my lords he raised his sword to the glory of god and of england he cried for god and for england the english replied with one voice prince edward came to the tent of edward de beaulieu smiling at rhonwyn as he entered i am told lady that your lord improved each day thanks to your tender care would that my aunt had heeded your simple advice my uncle king louis would be alive today he waved his hand at edward who was struggling to arise nay my lord lie back i can see you are yet in a weakened condition he sat on the single chair in the tent that rhonwyn had fetched for him and explained the situation if you feel you cannot continue on my lord you are free to return home with our blessing and our thanks i will go on with you my lord edward said why did we come this far if not to free jerusalem when do you leave it will take ten days or more to remount the expedition the prince said do you think you can travel by then aye my lord i will be ready edward said enthusiastically rhonwyn bit her lip in vexation but remained silent the prince arose i thank you my lord for your loyalty i do not as you well know forget my friends even as i remember my enemies he turned to rhonwyn my wife will be happy to receive you when you are able to leave your lord lady he told her and then prince edward turned and departed the tent you are not well enough to continue on rhonwyn said i will be he vowed in ten daystime she scoffed i have to be he insisted besides the prince is overly optimistic it will take at least a fortnight before he is ready to depart and he will not be traveling at a great pace as he has his wife and her ladies with him you must go and see the lady eleanor enit will look after me while you are gone lambkin if i do not believe you well enough to travel my lord i shall say so and let none stop me rhonwyn told her husband he chuckled such a fierce little welsh wife she is he teased her i promise to behave lady if you will make me well in time to go how can we not follow in the princes wake now go and pay your respects to bis wife rhonwyn he waved her off i will see to him lady enit promised rhonwyn quickly bathed her face and hands she smoothed her hair beneath its sheer veil brushed an imaginary wrinkle from her gown and hurried from their quarters to the royal english tent across the encampment having given her name and business to the guard she was shortly admitted she curtsied to princess eleanor how nice to see you rhonwyn de beaulieu the princes wife said come sit by my side and tell me of your good lord whom i am told is ill he recovers aye lady rhonwyn replied and then she told the princess of their adventures to date i fear she concluded that my lord will not be well enough to travel but he insists otherwise men the lady eleanor sympathized they all think they are indestructible then she laughed go back to your good lord and make him well so he may have his wish then you will come and serve me as we make our way to the kingdom and city of acre she smiled warmly at rhonwyn what stories we shall have to tell our grandchildren lady first i must have a child rhonwyn replied you are not yet a mother the lady eleanors voice was filled with compassion we must make a special devotion to our ladys mother saint anne i have told you that she will not fail you when you come to serve me we shall pray together rhonwyn returned to her tent she was suddenly filled with energy find sir fulk she told enit i need to practice my swordplay she turned to her husband nursing you is hard work my lord but i feel the sudden need of exercise will you let me go for a little more time he nodded feeling generous although her request was not pleasing to him still he knew he couldnt expect her to change entirely overnight a little bit of horseplay with fulk could do no harm and her new attitude was welcome to him he then asked her what did the lady eleanor say that men thought they were indestructible she replied with a chuckle she bade me make you well enough to travel and so i have no other choice but first i will work off some of this surfeit of energy that i suddenly seem to have she turned her back to him so he might fasten her padded vest wear your mail shirt he instructed tis too hot she complained nonetheless wear it lady even in practice you fight fiercely and rouse the blood of your opponent i do not want you harmed lambkin nor did he want her ability to bear him children impaired by injury her arming doublet secure rhonwyn pulled on her chausses over her legs then her hauberk with its articulated shoulder plates and her mail coif i will be boiled alive in these things she grumbled tis the price we warriors pay he teased her practice out of the direct sun and not for too long if you get sick who will i have to so tenderly nurse me my lambkin fool she mocked him you are only jealous that i get to play with my sword and you cannot i should prefer it if you played with my sword he said with a wicked smile rhonwyn blushed to the roots of her pale hair edward he grinned mischievously come and give us a kiss lambkin you dont deserve one saying such naughty things i shall leave you to think on your sins my lord and perhaps when i return i shall give you a kiss if you are truly penitent and deserve it then she picked up her weapon and ran from their tent he watched her go a smile upon his handsome face he would certainly not have believed that going on crusade with his wife would have brought them closer but it had perhaps this was gods blessing upon them both for their faithfulness for the first time in the months they had been wed he was beginning to have hope chapter rhonwyn practiced her swordplay with sir fulk beneath an open awning on the shady side of the camp those who passed by and saw her assumed that the two knights were both men for rhonwyns long hair was hidden beneath her mail coif the high summers heat made it difficult to drill for long periods of time without cessations for rest and water in between the exercises it was during one of those short respites that the alarm rang out in the camp quick lady i must take you back to your tent sir fulk said nervously nay rhonwyn responded this is our chance to meet the infidel in battle fulk with the french negotiating a truce when will we have another chance but when we reach acre we will battle for jerusalem lady there will be time then fulk responded hopefully faugh we cannot be certain of that rhonwyn said neither of us has bloodied our swords yet and you know had not my lord been ill we would have by now come on to horse fulk to horse then she ran off toward the pen where the animals were tethered for a moment fulk hesitated he knew that he ought to go to the tent and tell edward de beaulieu but if he did the skirmish would likely be over and done with before he even had time to find his own mount the infidels harassed the crusaders several times daily but they never remained long enough to engage them in serious battle his decision made sir fulk ran after rhonwyn it was not fair that she have all the fun at the horse pens his squire had already saddled both her horse and his mounted they charged through the maze of tents to where they could hear the sounds of action sir fulk had to admit that his lady was absolutely fearless she charged eagerly into the fray with a fierce war cry her sword slashing right and left as she attacked her opponents it was so exhilarating rhonwyn thought as she fought the enemy she had never before known such incredible excitement there was a faint red mist before her eyes and while she knew she felt fear she was not afraid her skills would see her through for she knew she was a more than competent warrior she could almost hear oth in her ear directing her every move as if he had been right by her side her foes gave way before her and she almost laughed aloud with her elation around her the english and the french seemed energized by her ferocity and the infidels were suddenly aware of a new attitude in the enemy this was no mere skirmish for the first time this was a real battle rhonwyn could hear fulk beside her for he had a tendency to hum beneath his breath when he fought her sword plunged into softness and she focused to see the shocked look on her victims face as he fell from his horse to die on the sand beneath hardds hooves a howl went up from the infidels the casualty had obviously been someone of import she was overwhelmed with sudden surprise she had killed a man this was no mock battle this was bloody reality and the cries of the wounded and dying assailed her ears now as they had not before her sword arm fell and in that moment rhonwyn found herself surrounded by blackbearded infidels her instinct for survival rose up and she attempted to fight her way out sir fulk howled a battle cry as he came to her aid rhonwyn was not certain how it happened but she and her companion were completely cut off from the other crusaders the infidels seemed intent on moving them away from any and all aid one reached out and yanked the reins from her gauntleted hand then the troop galloped off rhonwyn in their midst sir fulk in wild pursuit even in possession of her sword there was no chance to defend herself she considered slashing the reins free from her captor but she was so tightly wedged in the middle of them there was no room to fight her way out she had no choice but to go along it had been late afternoon when the battle had begun but now it was dark the terrain was rough and rhonwyn noted their direction was toward a range of mountains in the near distance when they finally came to a halt the infidels pulled her from her horse and took her weapon sir fulk was hauled from his mount and disarmed as well pushed to the ground they were told by one of the infidels sit in hard rough tones as he pointed to a spot near some rocks say nothing sir fulk whispered to her rhonwyn nodded she knew as well as her companion that their captors had no idea she was a woman they were given a small round flat bread and a cup of brackish water to share between them when they had eaten and sipped the water reserving a bit for later fulk spoke once again sleep i will take the first watch lady rhonwyn nodded and closed her eyes but sleep was not easy they had to escape before much longer as it was they were going to be hardpressed to find their way back to the crusaders encampment and edward he was going to be absolutely furious with her she would be fortunate if he didnt send her back to england immediately she knew now that fulks had been the wiser path she should have let him escort her back to her tent when the sounds of action had come to their ears what would happen if the infidels discovered she was a woman she shuddered to even contemplate rhonwyn felt tears welling up behind her closed eyelids and she struggled to force them back if she allowed herself to give in to her fears she could not think and she had to think if she were to come up with a plan of escape sir fulk was a good fighter but he had no skill for tactics then to her surprise she actually dozed but for how long she didnt know fulk was shaking her awake we are moving on lady he said softly it is night she whispered back there is a moon and it is cooler to travel at night he replied one of them speaks the norman tongue get on your horse before any of them gets too close to you we must escape she said desperately how his tone was bleak rhonwyn mounted her horse sitting despairingly as her wrists still covered by her gauntlets were lashed together to her saddles pommel she glanced over to sir fulk to find he had also been bound in the same manner they rode on through the night stopping only when the sun was high in the heavens again they were fed flat bread and a cup of water between them and told to sit beneath a rock overhang that sheltered them from the burning sun below them rhonwyn could see the plain and the sea but nowhere did she glimpse the city of carthage or the crusaders encampment what will happen to us rhonwyn murmured low to sir fulk the one who speaks our tongue says knights are frequently ransomed lady he replied they are impressed with your fighting skills and say they are taking you to their leader in hopes he may convert you to islam and to their side they say you are too great a warrior and none could pay the price of your ransom jesu rhonwyn swore softly she didnt dare ask what would happen if or when they learned she was a woman sir fulk knew what she was thinking but there was nothing he could say that would be of comfort to her if he had known this was going to happen he would have killed her himself rather than let her end up in some infidels harem which was where she was certain to be taken he had heard enough talk around the camp to know that fairhaired women were considered a great prize among the infidels we had best rest lady he said low we are sure to ride again once night falls and the moon rises rhonwyn nodded if she could retain the secret of her identity there was just the slightest chance she might be returned to where she belonged and sir fulk too she glanced a moment at her companion he was just twenty a stocky man of medium height with sandy hair and warm brown eyes his family lived across the severn from haven edward had known sir fulk his whole life he had been very brave to follow after her but perhaps it might have been better if he had returned to the camp to raise the alarm that she had been captured sir fulk had followed his instincts and not his head but then so too had she rhonwyn thought ruefully they rode the nights through resting in the daytime the infidels gave her and fulk water only once during their travel at the end of their day she got more water but even so she did not get enough to satisfy her thirst her thoughts were constantly of edward was he all right would he ever forgive her this folly at the completion of their fourth night of travel they came through a narrow pass with sheer rocklined walls to a green and verdant valley before them was a blue lake and at the far end of the lake lay a small and gleaming white city the infidel who spoke their tongue was riding next to them cinnebar he said and nothing more they rode onward conscious now of other paths all leading to a single wide paved road they passed a heavily ladened camel caravan as they went a farmer and his son drove a large herd of goats ahead of them a smaller caravan came behind them the sweetsmelling spices it carried perfuming the air it was all so fascinating that for a brief time her fears left rhonwyn and she looked about her with interest she would have quite a tale to tell edward and the children they would have one day the traffic into cinnebar now waited patiently at the citys gates for the portals to be opened this morning as the sun rose over the eastern hills a great creaking and groaning was heard as the ironbound double doors were slowly pulled open to admit the travelers and commerce that stood outside identities were carefully checked but their armed and mounted party was quickly waved through the citys streets were narrow and twisting they appeared to be riding upward and at last they came out into a wide square before a great marble palace again their identities were perused at the entry and then they were motioned inside they rode into a small courtyard the ground beneath their horses hooves were of perfectly matched squares of black and white marble the captives were aided in dismounting their bonds slashed free the normanspeaking infidel came to their side this is the palace of rashid al ahmet the mighty caliph of cinnebar may allah bless the names of his antecedents and his descendants in equal measure your fate is in his hands but he will be eager to learn of the great christian warrior the slayer of his brother who was considered the finest manatarms in all of cinnebar come follow me rhonwyn had blanched at the infidels words and sir fulks mouth fell open in surprise they looked at each other in desperation and then followed their guide into the palace once inside they were brought into a small attractive chamber water was brought so they might wash the dust of the road from their face and their hands plates of newly baked flat bread sliced fruits and a hot clear beverage smelling of mint were carried in to them and then they were left alone for the first time since their capture do not eat sir fulk advised her it could be poisoned rhonwyn picked up a curved slice of melon and began to chew it eagerly if it is i will die a quicker death than the one i face for having slain the brother of this caliph we might as well eat fulk besides i dont believe the food is tainted they have not kept us alive this long to poison us now she picked up a piece of flat bread and began to chew it it was warm from the ovens and delicious the beverage too was excellent sweet and aromatic she had never had anything like it before her companion considered her words and then began to eat as well when they had finished they washed their hands and face in the silver basin again and then seated themselves to wait the chamber was very quiet fulk considered how he was going to protect rhonwyn when it was discovered that she was a female and she most certainly would be exposed very soon he truly feared what was going to happen to her and without a weapon he was utterly helpless to aid her had he a weapon he should slay her so that she would not have to suffer the indignity of being ravaged by her captors perhaps however they would be so outraged at a woman having killed the caliphs brother they would simply and quickly behead her he prayed silently for such a merciful outcome the door to their chamber opened without warning and the normanspeaking infidel was there come he said the caliph is giving his weekly morning audience they arose and followed after him through the cool marble corridors of the palace two ebonyfaced guards stood on either side of a pair of tall wide bronze doors they wore clothofgold balloon pants gold medallions shaped like hunting leopards hung from gold chains around their necks and onto their chests and silver tipped spears carved from pure onyx were clasped in their hands without a word they swung open the doors and the trio walked through into the caliphs audience chamber the room was square the pillars that rimmed it were of green and white marble decorated at the bottom and top with carved gold bands the floors were white marble covered in thick blue carpets tall censers shaped like lilies burned aloes and polished wood torches burned fragrant oil at the far end of the room rhonwyn saw a low carpeted dais upon which a man sat crosslegged she could tell he was tall and slender with a long face and nose he wore a short wellbarbered black beard about his mouth and chin his beringed hands which he seemed to use to punctuate his speech were elegant and slim he was dressed in a simple white robe and upon his head was a small turban the room was filled with men the caliph was obviously hearing grievances and mediating disputes of one kind or another the captives remained at the rear of the audience chamber for some time and then finally were beckoned forward the normanspeaking infidel brought them to stand before the caliphs throne kneel dogs he hissed at them shoving at fulk we kneel only to god and our king rhonwyn said defiantly the normanspeaking infidel merely glanced to the side and at once there were guards forcing them to their knees before the caliph their captor began speaking but almost at once the caliph help up his hand speak in their frankish tongue so they may understand what it is you say farouk and defend themselves if indeed they can yes my lord came the reply which one of them killed prince abdallah the caliph demanded that one farouk said pointing to rhonwyn who knelt her head bowed as she strove to conceal her identity the caliph arose quickly and descended the dais he stood before the kneeling knights suddenly his nostrils twitched quite visibly he looked hard at the two kneeling figures he sniffed softly once twice then with a swift motion he reached out and pulled rhonwyns mail coif from her head yanking her to her feet he stared in surprise a moment before he burst out laughing even as her long gilt hair tumbled from the top of her head and spilled down her back a woman he roared with laughter a woman has killed that arrogant braggart who was my half brother this is the fiercest knight in all of christendom farouk you make a jest do you not his admiring gaze took in her fair beauty my lord surely this is sorcery it was a mounted and fierce knight who killed your brother and whom we took captive i swear it to you my lord caliph i swear it farouks face was filled with fear take your hands off me infidel rhonwyn snapped pulling away from the caliph your cowering dog does not lie i killed your brother he was a careless swordsman and deserved to die for being so reckless in the heat of battle ah the caliph breathed slowly you are right woman abdallah was a feckless warrior so much so that he could be killed by a mere female are you as ferocious in your lords arms as you are on the battlefield we shall see you and i he prowled about her reaching out to take a handful of her hair in his fist raising it to his nostrils this is what i smelled your hair is perfumed woman the fragrance suits you i have never smelled anything like it before releasing his hold on her hair he caught her face with his thumb and his forefinger holding it in an iron grip you have skin the unsullied white of the moon and your hair is like pure golden gilt you are beautiful but then you must know it the emeralds you have for eyes are fiery with your anger i can see i shall call you noor which means light i am rashid al ahmet the caliph of cinnebar and you shall be the jewel of my harem noor he turned from her and spoke to a tall distinguished black man take her to the womens quarters baba haroun see she is properly bathed and well rested then bring her to me at moonrise find someone within the harem to act as her translator until she can learn our language wait my lord rhonwyn said what is to happen to my companion is he your lover the caliph asked her of course not she replied indignantly he is one of my husbands knights his name is sir fulk anthony since he is not your lover i will be merciful and not kill him i shall ransom him or if i cannot then i shall sell him into slavery the caliph responded he was disappointed she was not a virgin but then he hadnt really expected someone as beautiful as noor would be still these frankish women were usually backward in the arts of love he would enjoy teaching her and there would be no difficulty with virginal fears only her christian virtue which he would eventually overcome the tall black man baba haroun came to fetch her fulk go with god she cried out to him and you also my lady rhonwyn he called as he was taken away in the opposite direction by two guards rhonwyn shook the mans hand off her arm and glared at him indignantly i will follow you she said you do not have to drag me like some shivering creature baba haroun stared at her angrily but then the caliph spoke to him and he chortled nodding he does not speak your frankish tongue noor i have told him you are to be respected and treated gently rashid al ahmet explained he is not used to women disobeying him the caliph smiled then turned away to conduct the next business on his daily calendar she was dismissed and so having no other choice she turned and followed the tall man from the audience chamber he led her across an open courtyard into another section of the palace the guards at the entry stiffened to attention as they passed down a dimly lit and scented corridor she followed until finally they came through a gilded archway into a large room with a bubbling fountain the room was filled with chattering women of all hues seeing baba haroun they grew quickly silent he smiled a superior smile at rhonwyn as if to say you see i am a person of some importance where is the woman nilak he demanded loudly in arabic a small dignified female came from a corner where she had been seated yes my lord haroun how may i serve you do you still have command of your frankish tongue he demanded roughly of her i do nilak said politely then this woman is now in your charge by order of our most worthy master the caliph rashid al ahmet may his name be blessed she is to be bathed and well rested for he desires her presence at moonrise tell her and also inform her that bad behavior and disobedience will be punished by a beating on the soles of her feet until she cannot walk but must crawl he then shoved rhonwyn toward nilak the older woman caught the girl and said quickly in norman do not retaliate child the caliphs chief eunuch is a man who holds grudges if you shame him before the other women he will never forgive you and no one not even the caliph will be able to protect you from his vengeance rhonwyn swallowed down her anger and nodded at nilak good nilak said softly now come with me and we will talk you will tell me who you are and i will answer all the questions i see bubbling upon your lips she took the younger woman by the hand and led her off into a quiet corner speaking a few quick words to a passing slave girl as they went i have told her to bring us mint tea and gazellehorn pastries she explained to rhonwyn sit child who are you rhonwyn asked her and how do you know the tongue of the normans i am called nilak it means lilacflower in the arabic tongue my history is a simple one my father was a merchant in provence the moors raided the town in which i lived and i was captured and sold into slavery i was twelve then i have now seen fortytwo springs i was brought to cinnebar with a princess who was given to this caliphs father as a gift she died giving birth to a daughter the caliphs hall sister i raised the child until she was given in marriage i am too old now to sell off and so i am allowed to remain being useful where i can be baba haroun is glad to have me as a translator when girls speaking the frankish tongue are brought here as they occasionally are now tell me child who are you and how came you here rhonwyn explained her adventures to the openmouthed woman you killed prince abdallah nilak said awed i did not know who he was rhonwyn replied he was just an enemy in battle she shrugged then asked tell me about this baba haroun who is he the chief eunuch of the caliphs harem child nilak responded i dont know what a eunuch is nor a harem rhonwyn said a harem is where the caliphs womenhis wives his concubines his sisters and other assorted female relationslive no real man but the caliph is allowed in the womens quarters a eunuch is a male who has been castrated so he may not function as a real man would nilak explained castration is usually done when young all men within these quartersthe servants the slaves the guardsare eunuchs and this baba haroun is in charge of the caliphs harem yes my child he is nilak answered her obey him give him public respect and esteem and you can make him your friend if you are to succeed here you will need his good will without it you are doomed to obscurity and obscurity is a lonely place i do not intend to remain here rhonwyn said i shall escape and return to the coast where the crusaders are preparing to move on to acre my husband must be very worried and very angry by now nilaks face became sympathetic it was frequently this way with captives they always wanted to flee and that of course was not possible you cannot escape my child she began patiently it is very unlikely that you will ever again see the world outside this place except when you are taken for your burial besides would your husband now receive you back into his heart his house and his good graces after you have been captured by the infidels you are so fortunate my child you might have been raped and killed but instead you have been brought into paradise on earth for that is what cinnebar is the caliph is a strong ruler and a good man if you can win his favor if you bear him a son your fortune is made what better fate is there for a woman in this world but i have a husband rhonwyn repeated for the first time in her life she was beginning to be frightened why had fulk prevented her from escaping when they had the chance all they had had to do was get back to the coastline and follow it to carthage she had seen the walls surrounding this palace they were high and thick and now she was trapped behind them forever according to nilak it was a terrifying thought and rhonwyn began to shake with sudden fear seeing it nilak put her arms about the girl there child it is all right you will not be harmed i promise you here drink this she said offering rhonwyn a small cup of the steaming fragrant beverage she had earlier imbibed mint tea is very good for the nerves she held the cup to rhonwyns lips coaxing her gently then she turned to the slave girl who had brought the tea go to baba haroun and tell him the girl is succumbing to shock i will need a sleeping draught immediately if she is to be prevented from hysterics and ask him if they have named her yet nilak turned back to rhonwyn who was now even paler try one of these little gazellehorn pastries she said offering it they are made with honey raisins and chopped almonds i love them she picked up another and began to eat it ummm delicious struggling to gain control of herself rhonwyn took the pastry nilak had offered her and began to chew it it had no taste in her mouth she swallowed but put it back down upon the plate nilak reached out and took the girls cold hand in hers it will be all right my child i promise you this is a good life i am rhonwyn uerch llywelyn wife of edward de beaulieu lord of haven castle i do not belong here they must let me go nilak gathered rhonwyn into her arms and held her tightly it was at that moment baba haroun hurried over to the two women what is happening to her he demanded she must be ready to go to the caliph tonight she is in shock my lord haroun it is to be expected after all she may have come here as a warrior but she is in reality only a young woman nilak murmured softly if the caliph is already taken by her beauty we must treat her gently so our lord and master is not disappointed in either you or me your years have given you wisdom nilak he grudgingly agreed reaching into his voluminous red black and yellowstriped robe here is a gentle sleeping potion that will calm the girl he uncorked the little silver vial and poured it into rhonwyns cup nilak put the cup to rhonwyns lips drink my child we have put a mild dose of herbs into your tea to relax you you need to sleep so you may face life as bravely now as you have always faced it in the past drink rhonwyn didnt argue gulping down the fragrant brew as if she couldnt escape fast enough she hated this loss of control over her own life within minutes her eyes grew heavy she didnt protest as nilak led her to a couch where she lay down and promptly fell into a dreamless sleep what is she to be called nilak asked the chief eunuch noor he answered her how suitable nilak remarked will you help me get her out of these odd garments baba haroun i do not want to entrust her to the other women of the harem quite yet has the lady alia been informed of this girls arrival and the caliphs interest he nodded thinking as he did that nilak was perhaps a more valuable slave woman than he had previously considered the lady alia was the caliphs favorite wife she had been wed to him when she was thirteen and while he had two other wives and several favored concubines it was the lady alia who was his friend and his confidante now that the first flush of passion had passed them both it was her son who would follow his father as the next caliph she was well liked feared and respected by all in the harem i have warned my lady of this new threat baba haroun said she will come and see the girl as soon as we have gotten these clothes off of her they worked together removing rhonwyns leather boots her mail leg coverings the chausses her hauberk with its metal shoulder pads beneath the knights garb they unlaced her padded arming doublet and took off her braies her hose her chemise rhonwyn lay naked before them her slender frame sweating and dirty but lovely allah she is absolutely beautiful nilak said there has never been a woman here as fair baba haroun the chief eunuch stood silent for a long moment studying rhonwyn her body was utterly flawless but for that ugly bush of hair at the junction where her two thighs met that would be removed immediately the limbs however were shapely and firm the breasts small but nicely rounded with pert nipples bathed and properly garbed she would be truly worthy of his masters bed she is lovely a new voice interjected and they turned to find the lady alia had joined them what kind of a girl do you think she is warlike and difficult baba haroun said immediately alia laughed and patted his hand you are too protective of me haroun and most prejudiced where any other woman is concerned what think you lady nilak i am not certain yet my lady but this girl is i believe intelligent i do not sense any wickedness about her but she has been in my company only an hour or more however a woman who could convince her husband to allow her warlike pursuits is both clever and headstrong she has been very brave these past few days as you will come to see when i tell you her tale now she has only just realized her fate and it has put her into shock we will ascertain more of her character when she awakens in a few hours baba haroun the lady alia said see that noor is carefully guarded until i send the lady nilak back to watch over her she turned to the older woman come and you will tell me this girls story nilak followed the caliphs wife to her apartments and they sat together as nilak repeated what rhonwyn had told her alia was thoughtful for a few moments when nilak had finished and then she said noor has done me a great favor in slaying prince abdallah although she can hardly know it unless she sets herself up against me she will have my friendship for that alone if anything had happened to my lord rashid abdallah would have killed my son to gain the caliphate for himself praise allah he is now in paradise and not cinnebar then her usually serene face grew concerned he is eager to possess her they say will she be ready to go to his bed tonight nilak he does not like to be disappointed as you know nilak sighed i cannot say gracious lady she answered honestly i do not know what the girl will be like once she awakens from her slumbers rest may restore her urge to resist when she is bathed bring her to me the caliphs wife said nilak arose and bowed to the lady alia then she withdrew hurrying back to where her new charge lay in a restless sleep watched over by two armed eunuchs you may go now she told the two guards and sat down next to rhonwyn she beckoned to a slave girl and sent her for the embroidery she had been working on earlier receiving it she bent over her needle once again rhonwyn awoke confused as to where she was her mouth dry then nilaks lace came into her view and the girl fell back against her pillows i am thirsty she said weakly nilak poured her a goblet of liquid and held it to her lips it is fruit juice she said as rhonwyn greedily gulped down the contents of the goblet how do you feel now my child still tired came the wary reply then rhonwyn looked down and seeing she was naked gave a small cry what have you done with my garments lady she was blushing furiously and there was nothing nearby with which she might cover herself you could not sleep in those rough garments my child your lovely limbs were prickled with the mail of your leg and arm coverings only that padding about your breasts saved them from being so evilly marked can you stand up you must go to the baths and be washed you have slept almost the entire day away could you not have put another garment on me rhonwyn demanded a clean garment on a filthy body nilak sounded shocked i am going nowhere without something to cover me rhonwyn insisted stonily i realize you are not used to being naked my child but we are all females here nilak replied quietly come now do not be foolish the baths will restore you nilak arose and held out her hand no rhonwyn said nilak did not bother to argue further noor was going to have to learn obedience sooner than later she signaled to two eunuchs the lady noor is to be escorted to the baths and is having a moment of obstinacy see that she overcomes it i will meet you there then she moved off crossing the main room of the harem a small smile upon her pretty face as she heard the shriek of outrage behind her she did not bother to turn about the eunuchs had been given their orders and would carry them out nilak entered the baths and called for the bath mistress good day sarai she said as the bath mistress came good day to you nilak you are bringing me the warrior woman where is she i hear he wants her tonight and there will be a great deal to do with this one she is coming nilak said with a small laugh she objected to being naked and two eunuchs had to escort her i fear foolish creature sarai muttered these frankish women are so ridiculous in their fear of nudity ah here she is rhonwyn was pink with her outrage the two eunuchs had grasped her arms and hustled her through the harem practically lifting her off her feet when she resisted them when they put her down before the bath mistress and nilak she whirled and struck them both with her fists barbarians she shouted angrily the eunuchs were surprised by her ferocity but neither was hurt by the blows they laughed and then departed rhonwyn turned again and said to nilak how could you let them do that to me lady i do not argue with foolish girls nilak said sternly the rule in this world is obedience noor when you do not or will not obey you will be made to my child now you are not a stupid girl so this should be the only lesson you will need i will escape this place return to my old world rhonwyn said defiantly no you will not nilak said implacably even if by some miracle you managed to leave the palace you would not know where to go and you would be caught and brought back you would be whipped upon the soles of your feet until you could not walk for three days that is the punishment for disobedient slave girls we do not mar the beauty of harem women but unruly behavior must be punished cease your foolishness noor we have much to do before moonrise this is sarai the bath mistress you will obey her and i will be by your side to see that you do you remind me of my aunt rhonwyn said she is an abbess nilak laughed and did she have to speak so directly to you my child aye rhonwyn said and then followed the two older women into the balhs she had never thought herself a dirty woman but she had also never known what clean truly was she was rinsed and soaped a silver instrument was used to scrape the dirt from her body she was rinsed again a thick peachcolored paste with a heavy fragrance was smoothed over her arms her legs beneath her arms and atop her venus mons she was brought a cup of hot sweet mint tea when she had finished it she watched in utter amazement as the paste was rinsed from her body and her body hair with it rhonwyn looked down at her mons and blushed she had never noticed before how plump it was nor the deep rosy slash that bisected its twin halves there was an intense sensuality to her body now that made her very uncomfortable neither her nudity nor their own nudity seemed to disturb her two companions what an odd world she thought as she sat quietly while her fingernails and her toenails were pared almost to the quick and then smoothed and shaped neatly her giltcolored hair with its gold and silver lights was most thoroughly washed several times until she thought her scalp was going to be scrubbed raw then her hair was carefully dried by hands that toweled and brushed until her tresses almost floated like thistledown in a west wind they lay her upon a raised and padded bench and an old crone carrying a basket came from the shadows this will be the hardest thing for you to bear nilak said rafi will cleanse your love channel for you there is no prurience in her actions my child remain quiet and she will not hurt you rhonwyns eyes were wide and startled at nilaks words but by now she realized that resistance was indeed futile she tried not to tense as rafi pulled her nether lips apart bathing her gently in places rhonwyn never knew could be bathed the old ladys fingers pushed a soft cloth into her body cleansing and purifying the path the caliph would take this night rhonwyn was amazed that she could be stretched quite that wide he will enjoy this one for while she is not a virgin she is barely used rafi remarked to nilak and sarai her pleasure jewel has not yet grown greatly she cackled and looked down at rhonwyn i am done now my chick may you know only joy in your masters bed what did she say rhonwyn asked nilak she says you are beautiful and wishes you joy came the reply she is finished now and you are ready for your creaming remain where you are you will like this part she said with a small smile a young eunuch naked but for a loincloth came with a tray of lotions and creams looking rhonwyn over critically he selected a lotion from his tray poured it into his pink palm and began to massage her body rhonwyn was shocked but the young brown eunuch worked efficiently her naked body apparently quite boring to him his fingers dug into her shoulders and neck he massaged her chest and breasts her arms hands and fingers legs feet and toes then he turned her over as easily as if he were turning a flat bread over a fire and began to work her shoulders again her back her buttocks the backs of her legs and feet tense at first rhonwyn found herself relaxing in spite of herself and felt newly energized these baths were the most deliciously decadent experience she had had in all of her life she somehow thought that edward would have enjoyed them and the remembrance of her husband sobered her she was being prepared like a lamb for the slaughter for the caliphs bed another man she had not been able to make happy the one she was wed to in the matter of passion when she displeased this man would he order her killed perhaps if he were unhappy with her he would return her to the crusaders encampment and poor sir fulk as well it was a slim hope but one to which she would cling she would tell the caliph honestly that she was unable to give or receive pleasure and then he would send her back to edward there was nothing to be afraid of any longer and she had certainly enjoyed these baths in the meantime she would have to tell edward all about them when she returned to him haven could certainly benefit by such civility chapter the caliphs wife was a beautiful woman whose intelligence kindness and common sense had kept her close to her husbands heart for over fifteen years she was egyptian by birth a slender lady with pale goldencolored skin beautiful almondshaped brown eyes and long thick dark hair that she wore loose and dressed with strands of tiny pearls she wore a peachcolored silk kaftan trimmed with gold at the keyhole neck opening and the wide sleeves kneel to the caliphs wife noor nilak instructed her charge rhonwyn knelt but she did not bow her head a barely discernible smile touched the lips of the caliphs wife the girl had pride and properly channeled that was a good trait it was just possible that this beautiful creature might make her husband a fourth and final wife an ally against the two silly featherbrains who held the positions of second and third wives and who spent much time attempting ways to supplant her or cause trouble for her son mohammed and if her son had not been there to follow his father they would have fought with each other over whose son would and then cinnebar would have suffered the tortures of a civil war she is ready the caliphs wife asked nilak she seems to have come to an acceptance with herself my lady she has been bathed and purified properly and it is hoped that the reality of the possession will more than satisfy the caliphs anticipation nilak replied with a small smile she is lovely isnt she the lady alia nodded in agreement tell her i am pleased with both her beauty and her gentle manners nilak repeated the words spoken by alia to rhonwyn the girl looked to nilak and asked am i permitted to address this lady directly or must i speak to you you may address her and i will translate nilak responded i thank you my lady for your kindness i hope the caliph will see fit to release me back to my husband so i may cause you no distress by my presense rhonwyn said politely certainly the caliphs wife could not enjoy having all these women waiting for her husbands attentions she would undoubtedly be delighted to get rid of at least one and rhonwyn would surely be delighted to go nilak repeated rhonwyns words adding she does not yet understand our ways my lady and like most captives dreams of freedom he will certainly dissuade her of such notions alia said by morning she will be his devoted slave as so many others are i do not quite know what it is about rashid but he has great charm to go along with his insatiable appetites for passion tell noor i thank her for her kind wishes and that she pleases me if her gentle behavior continues she will have my favor fortunate girl nilak exclaimed to rhonwyn you have pleased her with your good manners if you continue to do so she says you will gain her favor the caliphs second and third wives have never even on their first nights with him had her favor the caliph has three wives rhonwyn was both surprised and shocked he is allowed four under the law of islam nilak answered her and as many concubines as please him the only stipulation is that under islamic law all his wives must be treated equally if you delight him you could easily become his wife noor and with her favor who knows what heights you might attain within this house your future at this moment is most golden my child do not forget me in your greatness i have no stature here rhonwyn said in practical tones nor do i wish any as you well know i do not go to the caliph to delight him but rather to plead for my release nilak do not be foolish my child i have told you there is no way back to your world from cinnebar make the most of the opportunity offered you in this time and this place nilak said what does noor say the caliphs wife asked she frets she will not be able to please him nilak lied with facile grace what else could she say she thought i am attempting to reassure her that she is a delight to the eye and will indeed please our lord and master the caliph the lady alia smiled warmly how can she not she said with generous spirit have her go and rest now nilak we are dismissed nilak told rhonwyn arise noor and bow again to the mistress of the harem who has favored you obedient to her mentor rhonwyn stood and bowed to the lady alia how pretty she is she thought how can she bear sharing her husband with all these women i should not want to share edward with another edward he had wanted a kiss from her before she went off to her sword practice with sir fulk and she had refused him how she wished now she had not they brought rhonwyn a tray upon which was a warm flat bread several slices of chicken breast an apricot and a dish of something creamy and white that nilak said was called yogurt and made from milk rhonwyn was hungry and ate it all an old woman came and following nilaks instructions rhonwyn opened her mouth for the servant who vigorously cleaned her teeth and mouth in a way she had never experienced using a minted ground pumice a rough cloth a small brush and minted water your breath should be fragrant nilak said rhonwyn slept when she awakened she was made to pee and was then bathed swiftly with rose water her mouth was once again rinsed and she was dressed in a loose creamcolored silk kaftan beneath which a narrow filigreed gold chain with a single jewel had been affixed low on her hips her feet were bare her golden gilt hair was loose and flowing baba haroun will bring you to the caliph nilak said will i see you again rhonwyn asked if you do not destroy your chances with your foolishness nilak responded you will see me come the morrow i know what you secretly think noor a final time i warn you to put all thoughts of escape from your mind this is your life now better to be at the top of the harem than at the bottom i know i never had your chance but if i had my child if i had she put her arms about rhonwyn and gave her a quick hug i think your aunt the abbess would advise you even as i do noor ah here is baba haroun to escort you co with him now and remember to bow to the caliph as i have told you i wish you joy my child he is said to be a magnificent lover it would make no difference rhonwyn thought as she followed the chief eunuch through the womens quarters and down a softly lit and scented corridor if i could feel nothing with my beloved edward what can i feel with this stranger who says that i am his slave now and subject to his whims if i cannot convince him to send me back to the crusaders encampment outside of carthage then i am doomed the eunuch stopped before a set of double doors overlaid with gold leaf he nodded to the two guards on either side of the entry and they flung open the doors rhonwyn and baba haroun passed through and the doors closed behind them the caliph stood awaiting them following nilaks instructions rhonwyn fell to her knees and then flattened herself to the floor before the caliph her forehead touching his bare foot she found such a position degrading but if she was to gain his cooperation she must not antagonize rashid al ahmet prettily done noor he said mockingly and not without a great cost to your pride i am certain arise baba haroun helped her to her feet and then to her surprise he quickly drew the kaftan off of her and as quickly withdrew from the chamber leaving them alone it was useless to attempt to cover herself rhonwyn realized she stood quietly her eyes unfocused struggling to conceal her shame put your hands behind your head he said to her surprised when she obeyed him had they drugged her into obedience no her milky skin was faintly flushed and she was deliberately avoiding his gaze he smiled slightly and allowed himself a leisurely examination of his new possession she was the most perfect woman he had ever seen in all his life her breasts were like little ripe peaches her limbs were nicely rounded but slender he particularly liked her feet they were small and slim with a high arch her narrow waistline flowed into shapely hips he walked slowly about her admiring her graceful long back and buttocks a bit plumper than he anticipated standing behind her he was unable to resist reaching around her to cup those sweet little breasts in the palms of his hands they were surprisingly weighty for such dainty fruits he buried his face in her hair sniffing then said what has happened to that delightful fragrance that earlier perfumed your locks my exquisite noor the scent is taken from the oil of a flower you do not have here in cinnebar my lord caliph rhonwyn answered his hands were warm on her flesh and very disturbing but if that was the worst of it she would bear it for the sake of her ultimate goal his thumbs stroked idly across her nipples what is the flower you shall have it my beauty it is called heather my lord caliph it will not thrive here in your climate she replied she wanted to pull away but if she did she would offend him and then what would become of her the plant may not grow here my beauty but we can import the oil for you i shall give orders tomorrow that it be done he released her breasts from his gentle grip and walked back around to face her once again his eyes went to the chain that hung low on her rounded hips from it hung a fat pearshaped pearl that just touched the tip of the rose slash dividing her nether lips atop her plump mons it was like a marker showing him the way to paradise he wondered who had thought of such a clever touch you may lower your arms now noor he said thank you my lord caliph she replied how mannerly you are my beauty from our first meeting this morning i would have suspected a tiny bit more resistance from you and yet here you are as meek as a lamb in one of my flocks now why is that wonder surely you have not so quickly reconciled yourself to your fate noor he cocked a dark eyebrow quizzically she was finally forced to focus her eyes upon him for she could hardly plead her case without doing so she swallowed hard realizing he was clothed only in a bit of white silk cloth wrapped about his loins he was almost as fair as she was but for his hands and face which were bronze with the sun his body was devoid of hair smooth and muscled yet slender as she had earlier noted he was by far the handsomest man she had ever seen nothing at all like her edward who while attractive could not match the perfect beauty of this man well he demanded i cannot give you pleasure my lord caliph rhonwyn burst out you mean you will resist my passion he said nervously she shook her head in the negative nay i mean yes i will but it does not matter if i do or i dont i cannot give you pleasure i loved my husband and he loved me yet i was incapable of giving him anything more than my body it was a terrible burden for us both i am sorry my lord but now that you know will you not send me back and poor sir fulk with me no he said i will not there is not a woman in this world incapable of giving and receiving pleasure noor with some it just takes longer or a different overture i am sorry that you and your former lord could not find that happiness together but i promise you that you will find it with me tonight perhaps or tomorrow but eventually i promise you my beautiful noor no she cried what was he saying to her the man was mad surely he could not possibly want her now not after she had told him the truth of how she was incapable of passion seeing the panic beginning to rise in her eyes rashid al ahmet reached out and pulled rhonwyn against him do not be afraid my beauty he crooned at her his hand stroking her head gently you do not understand she half sobbed but i do my exquisite beauty i do he said softly you have never been drowned in a surfeit of bodily pleasure nor have you ever been overcome with the delights of burning lust i will open these worlds to you noor i will not allow someone as beautiful as you to live in ignorance of pure hot passion and the delights that satisfying it can bring you you are mine now noor and i will never let you go he tipped her face up and kissed her hard his words confused her and worse they frightened her why would he not believe her then his lips covered hers demanding what she could not give him and rhonwyn to her horror began to weep rashid al ahmet picked up the sobbing girl and brought her to his bed gently laying her down then he held her in his arms as she gave vent to her sorrow he said nothing for he knew that nothing he said would comfort her she was slowly and reluctantly coming to the realization that he and not some christian knight was her fate if she had indeed loved this man despite their inability to pleasure each other then it would be a hard acceptance but the caliph believed this girl was strong and would sooner than later succumb to her fate edward she cried within her mind edward she could not believe that he was gone that that life was over and done with forever she could accept what the caliph was offering her or she could die dying however would not return her to edward except perhaps in spirit and what of him would he accept her loss easily their marriage after all had begun in political expediency she did not doubt that he had grown fond of her as she had of him but she was now gone from him when he returned to england to haven he would eventually have to remarry if he was to have heirs he would probably choose his cousin katherine this time katherine de beaulieu was the kind of girl edward should have had as a wife in the first place she knew how to be a good chatelaine and she was probably not frightened of passion and would quickly give edward the heirs he needed yes perhaps it was better this way she sighed deeply her tears ceasing it has been a long time since a woman felt free enough with me to weep against my chest rashid al ahmet said quietly being a foreigner probably do not have their fear and respect of you my lord caliph rhonwyn replied low she hid her face from him i always look awful on the rare occasions i weep i do not weep often i think i have cried three times in all my life i think you beautiful he said kissing her wet face rhonwyn smiled in spite of herself ah he said you are recovering from your anguish my heart aches my lord caliph she admitted why was it she could talk to this man as she never had talked to any other of course it does you have lost much my beautiful noor it is almost like a death isnt it she nodded aye it is why are you afraid of passion he asked her gently i am afraid of nothing she insisted you are afraid of passion he said why tell me who you are and what land creates such beautiful women he sat up now and drew her to his side i am rhonwyn uerch llywelynrhonwyn daughter of llywelyn my father is the prince of all the welsh my mother was his lover i have a younger brother when our mother died in childbirth my father took us to one of his castles to be raised unfortunately he did not think to put us where there were women i was raised among men and thus copied their behavior they taught you to fight the caliph said aye but only because i begged them to teach me i loved them and wanted to be like them then one day my father appeared after many years and said i was to be wed as part of a treaty between him and the english king he was horrified to find his daughter was more a lad than a lass i was sent to my aunt the abbess of a small abbey for six months i was instructed in womens things and then i was taken to england to be wed to edward de beaulieu the lord of haven castle when my lord decided to come on crusade i said i would accompany him and could not resist the call to arms so you thus ended up my captive the caliph said but where was your husband noor that he allowed you into such danger he was ill with fever and a running of the bowels she replied he was getting better and knew i suffered from a lack of exercise when i said i would practice my swordplay with sir fulk he agreed during the battle i was captured and poor sir fulk followed after me had he not he might be free i shall not sell your knight off for it would be a poor reward for his dutiful and faithful behavior toward his masters wife i will set him the task of teaching my son mohammed how your crusaders fight it could prove useful to the lad one day does my decision please you noor yes my lord and thank you rhonwyn said daring to look up into his handsome face i am said to be kind to those who please me he murmured and he bent to kiss her small ear then he let the tip of his tongue explore the delicate whorl of flesh what is he doing rhonwyn thought feeling the hot wetness in her ear she shivered edward had never done that oh his teeth gently worried the fleshy lobe he pushed the mass of her hair aside and began to kiss the soft nape of her neck intrigued by the tiny golden curls that sprang from it they had perfumed her body with a mixture of rose and lily it was an intoxicating fragrance that set his pulses racing he nipped tenderly at the back of her neck oh she started nervously did your husband ever taste you noor he asked her he took one of her hands and licked the palm slowly then he began to suck each of her lingers in turn finally taking three of the digits into his mouth at once murmuring his approval as he did so she was astounded by his behavior it was surely depraved why did he not simply use her and be done with it then he surprised her further by laying her flat his tongue licking at her body in long leisurely sweeps please she said he raised his dark head a moment please what dont do that my lord oh please dont do that his tongue was laving over her breasts now she could actually feel the flesh swelling her nipples puckered as if they had been touched with ice rhonwyn knew the panic was rising up in her and to her surprise he seemed to sense it too he said why are you afraid noor i am not hurting you i am merely tasting your flesh and i find it utterly delicious i intend to bath your entire body with my tongue there is nothing wrong in what i do it is strange to me she said weakly do you find no pleasure in it nay you will eventually my beauty when you stop fearing the unknown and start to enjoy the pleasure i can give you this way he told her then he continued onward rhonwyn closed her eyes and attempted to ease her fears he was right she was being foolish he wasnt hurting her at all the fleshy tongue was warm and she began to feel a tiny tingle when it swept over her skin leaving it wet and then cool he moved over her belly and then across her venus mons which caused her to cry out startled and not just a little nervous to be touched so intimately he raised his head and laughed softly you are not ready yet my exquisite noor he told her rready for what she quavered in time my precious he said mysteriously and then began to lick her right thigh his tongue moved down her leg to her feet which he kissed most passionately then he sucked each of her toes in turn before beginning on her left leg you are mad she managed to gasp your flesh is an opiate of which i cannot get enough he responded then he turned her over onto her belly and licked the soles of her feet until she giggled he bathed her legs and her buttocks running his tongue up the split between the twin moons of her bottom and raising another surprised cry from her he only laughed again and continued onward until her back and her shoulders were damp with his excesses he finished by giving her neck a final nip then turned her over again youre shivering he said low and brushed her lips with his lightly have i begun to melt the ice that surrounds your cold northern heart noor he ran his tongue along her lips tauntingly now my beauty it is time for you to begin your lessons in pleasing your lord and master he leapt from the bed pulling her up with him undo the wrapping about my loins he commanded her you will be naked she said foolishly he chuckled i will he reached out and undid the delicate chain about her hips laying it aside come now my beauty why do you demur you know what a mans body looks like there should be no surprises in store for you you are constantly surprising me my lord caliph she admitted to him blushing as she spoke the wrap he firmly pressed her with hesitant fingers rhonwyn loosened the cloth and then pulled it away from him laying it aside her eyes were carefully averted it pleases me to see how modest you are my noor but you may look upon the object of your defeat without fear come my beauty and touch it i want to feel your hands upon me she shrank back from his words her hands instinctively going behind her back what you have never touched a manhood allah allah you are practically a virgin noor come now reaching out the caliph drew the resisting hand forward and placed it upon his smooth groin he could feel her desperate to pull away and so he kept his own hand irmly on hers there now my beauty let your fingers explore and caress me she knew she should not but the temptation was simply too great she bad always been curious about edwards manhood but had never been brave enough to touch him now here was this man inviting her to do so and she couldnt resist particularly when he lifted his hand off hers she brushed her fingertips across his mound her hand closed gently about his manhood it pulsed within her palm and she could feel it swelling with each passing moment unable to stop herself she caressed its great length her breath coming a bit more quickly now he was warm and hard in her hand thats it my beauty he encouraged her now cup my twin jewels in your palm they are cool to your touch are they not she nodded slowly they are filled with the seeds of life noor when you are ready i will plant those seeds within you my beauty cease your sweet torture now in a moment or two i shall not be able to restrain my desire for you and you are far from ready to meet my passion her hand dropped away and she hid her head in his shoulder those last moments had been very exciting and she could feel her heart beating faster than it had previously your christian men put women into four categories noor wives mothers whores or saints they do not share the secrets of pleasure with their mates we men of islam do and we do not confine ourselves to only one woman such a thing is unnatural for a man no one woman can satisfy all a mans passions they tell me you have three wives my lord caliph i do although the two younger i may dismiss for they are quarrelsome creatures ever at odds with the lady alia and the other women of my harem indeed they may have been responsible for the death of a particularly lovely girl i had decided to favor baba haroun is still investigating and he will get to the bottom of the matter i promise you he is very protective of the lady alia lady alia is a gracious lady and was kind to me rhonwyn told him she has already spoken in your favor my noor which is why i will be patient with you he tilted her face to his again and began to kiss her with far more passion than he had previously her instinct was to fight him but something else overcame rhonwyn and she instead melted into his embrace her mouth softening beneath his why am i doing this she silently asked herself but she had no answer all she knew was that this man was strong and gentle and her will to resist was growing weaker what if all they told her was true that she could not escape cinnebar and what if edward would not have her back she had surely disobeyed him by involving herself in battle as he had forbade her oh god i do not know what i am to do what was the matter with her i cannot give you pleasure she whispered as she pulled away from his mouth you already have he told her softly i do not know how to receive pleasure she said desperately i will teach you he promised her then his mouth was hungrily seeking hers again his tongue pushing past her lips to do battle with her senses rhonwyn half sobbed her resistance dissolving as her curiosity aroused itself perhaps her inability to know pleasure was edwards fault their first mating had not been pleasant but this man was different mayhap he could teach her to relish passion she could not know ii she would not yield herself to him and if she was not to return to edward de beaulieu then what else was there for her but this life as nilak had told her life at the top of the harem was better than at the bottom she pulled away from him again teach me my lord caliph she told him teach me of passion he took her face between his two hands and gazed directly into her emerald green eyes his eyes she noted for the first time were a deep deep blue almost black my passion is a fierce thing noor he warned her and you are easily fearful and shy i want you with every fiber of my being but i want you to know great pleasure as well i can see you know little of the delights between a man and a woman will show you all those sweet enjoyments but you must know that will not harm you or hurt you or give you pain in any of these pursuits if you are afraid you will not be abashed and unable to tell me our pleasure can be approached in a variety of ways and all are equally delicious will you trust me my beauty she nodded her heart hammering with anticipation why had not her husband ever said these things to her for a moment she was angry at edward but then she realized that he probably knew as little as she did about passion although as a man he would assume he knew all the caliph began to kiss her face gently her lips each of her cheeks the tip of her nose her closed eyelids her forehead then releasing her face from their soft grip his hands began to caress her body smoothing down her neck over her shoulders sweeping along her long back to cup her buttocks in his hands he fondled the twin moons and some deep instinct made her arch her body with a soft cry he covered her straining throat her chest and her small swollen breasts with kisses he buried his lips in the hollow of her throat growling low how you intoxicate me my beautiful warrior woman he said in his deep voice then he gathered her up into his arms again and deposited her upon his bed rhonwyn felt her heart thudding rapidly as he stood looking down at her she did not love this man indeed he almost frightened her with his dark intensity but something deep within her wanted him to continue onward it would end in the terrifying act of coupling she knew but she still wanted to know everything he had to teach her wanted his lips on her wanted his hands that roused such feelings of utter roiling confusion inside of her he stared down on her for a moment before coming to lay by her side she could have no idea of how beautiful she was with her perfumed breath coming in little gasps from between her sweet ripe lips she did not know how exquisite her body was silently inviting almost wanton in her unrealized need to be loved by him he lay his dark head upon her breasts your heart beats so swiftly he said to her i am afraid yet not afraid she told him remember i will not harm you my lovely noor i will only love you and give you joy i trust you my lord caliph she said low he raised his head and leaned over to kiss her breast then his mouth closed over its nipple and he suckled upon her she started nervously but then she let herself enjoy the exciting sensation of his mouth and tongue upon her tender flesh her hand reached out to caress his dark hair it was surprisingly soft to her touch and slightly curly her slender fingers entwined themselves in and out of the curls even as he began to worship her other breast in the same manner as the first edward had loved her breasts in this manner too but it had not seemed quite so exciting more of a perfunctory thing or was it that this was so forbidden his hands and mouth began to roam over her quivering body as his tongue had earlier his hunger was building even if his instincts warned him to move slowly her belly was taut beneath his mouth the insides of her thighs were as soft as the finest cathay silk her own fragrance filled his nostrils unable to prevent himself from doing so he kissed her mons then slowly ran his tongue down the pouting slash that hid the gates to paradise and all of her most precious treasures rhonwyn shuddered at the touch of his tongue that now began to probe at her innermost secrets his fingers gently drew her nether lips apart holding them in a firm grip as his tongue caressed the flesh within she felt his tongue acutely particularly when it touched a most sensitive part of her the tongue worried and worried at her she felt a building of sensation within edward had touched her there but always with his finger the caliphs tongue was far more exciting rhonwyn gasped as the first distinct feeling of pleasure swept over her oh she cried and shuddered hard the tongue persisted and she again was overwhelmed crying out once more as she reveled in the sweetness that engulfed her you see his voice came to her through the mists you can feel pleasure my beautiful noor le slowly pushed two fingers into her love channel drawing them slowly back and forth arousing her so that she would be ready to receive him carefully he began to cover her body with his and then it happened rhonwyns eyes opened yet they were sightless no she cried out her voice filled with utter terror no he ceased in his actions quickly taking her back into his arms although his manhood felt as if it were going to burst what is it noor what is frightening you so tell me my beauty tell me he is hurting her oh please stop dont hurt my mam her words astounded him but rashid al ahmet knew that the mind was a powerful weapon that could be used for good or evil that could hide secrets and affect behavior in the most ordinary people who is hurting your mother noor he asked her in kindly tones i do not know him but his garb is rich he has come to our cottage mam is very afraid yet he will not let her be he calls her a whore and forces her to couple with him he is hurting her he is hurting her go away go away mam says our father must not know what has happened she is bleeding dont weep mam dont weep there were tears on rhonwyns face now mam says i mustnt let any man do to me what he has done to her i must fight them ill be a good girl mam ill be strong for us both the prince will never know tis our secret mam our secret the caliph rocked her in his arms no wonder she had not been able to feel any pleasure his poor beautiful noor but now it would all change for her who raped your mother noor he gently asked her you were very little werent you rhonwyns eyes opened and she shuddered hard i never knew who he was she said probably someone who knew my father and knew where our cottage was hidden my mother never knew if the third child she carried was his or the princes my father loved her and would have killed any man who touched her i think that is what frightened her she always said there was greatness in ap gruffydd and it should not be denied she would not have wanted to be the cause of his failure i was just four when it happened and my brother still at her breast do you understand now what she meant when she warned you not to allow any man to do to you what was done to her she did not mean you should not enjoy mutual pleasures noor only that you should not find yourself in her uniortunate position he stroked her hair tenderly poor lady how she must have suffered and what a terrible secret both you and she kept sleep now my beautiful one later when you awaken i shall make love to you as you should be loved she was puzzled she could see his manhood was still stiff with his desire for her reaching out she touched him saying i will not be afraid now my lord caliph you will be less fearful when you have slept my beauty he advised her you have faced terrible demons just now sleep the residue of them away and then i will take you to paradise as a reward for your bravery sweet noor he kissed her forehead i am no longer a child my lord caliph rhonwyn told him i am a warrior woman and now i have confronted that which has secretly terrified me all these years i need no rest but i do need your passion to prove to me that i have truly overcome my terrors she held out her arms to him rashid al ahmet covered her body with his own his manhood rampant and hungry for her slid easily into her love channel he watched her face carefully but there was no longer any fear in her eyes it had been replaced by a budding wonder and eager anticipation of what was to come she was wonderfully tight and hot you are indeed fearless my beautiful warrior woman he complimented her then he began to move upon her rhonwyn closed her eyes enjoying the incredible sensation of him as he pushed slowly within her she could feel the throb of his manhood as it delved into her depths she was acutely aware of every tiny sensation he elicited from her when he began to thrust and withdraw thrust and withdraw rhonwyn knew that her mother who had loved ap gruffydd so dearly would have never denied her this marvelous sense of utter delight she arched her body to match his rhythm crying out as a tiny sharp pulse of pleasure began to envelop her building until it crashed over her like a large wave leaving her weak and satisfied piercingly aware of his hot love juices that were discharged deep into her now wellplowed field when she was finally able to breathe normally again she said shyly that was wonderful my lord caliph rashid he said to her my name is rashid and i shall never let you go my beautiful noor you are mine forever she lay her golden head upon his smooth chest strangely happy and yet deep within her heart she whispered a single word edward it was her husband edward de beaulieu she loved and not this intense man yet it had been rashid al ahmet who had delved into her deepest secret and drawn it forth from the darkness in which she had kept it hidden all these years her husband to whom she had been wed a year had not been able to do that rashid al ahmet caliph of cinnebar into whose presence she had been brought as a prisoner only this morning and into whose bed she had been taken this nightit had been he who had touched her as no other man ever had why she had to admit that his passion was magical and she had obviously pleased him greatly if she continued in his favor who knew to what heights she could reach in cinnebar but it was not what she wanted she wanted to return to edward and share herself with him as she had never been able to share herself before she owed the caliph a great debt for that still what her heart desired was impossible but was it only time would tell and in the meantime she would continue to share herself with the caliph she sensed that she was just beginning to learn all that he had to teach her and she realized that she was now a most eager pupil what are you thinking he demanded raising her up so he might look into her beautiful face i am thinking that you have much to teach me my lord rashid rhonwyn answered him honestly the caliph laughed aloud aye he said we have only just begun my beautiful noor we have only just begun chapter awaken my child nilaks voice came to her through the mists rhonwyns eyes opened slowly focusing upon her surroundings at first confused as to where she was but then remembering oh noor how you have pleased the caliph he left you to sleep and gave orders that you should not be disturbed until the sun was at the midheavens the entire harem is talking they cannot ever remember a time when he left a woman to sleep in his bed after he had taken his pleasure come child get up now we must go to the baths and then to your new apartments which are next to the lady alias you are very much in favor and tis said the second and third wives are quite angry the gossip is that you will be made his fourth wife for he is besotted by you fortunate girl rhonwyn tried to absorb all of nilaks words she stretched her limbs gingerly and felt a slight soreness between her thighs he had coupled with her a second time last night and it had been even better than their first encounter she was confounded by it all although he had carefully explained to her that the memory of her mothers rape buried deep within her mind had been the cause of her inability to enjoy passion now released from that terrible pain she was free to let her passions take her where she would his words had disturbed her deeply and she again wondered why edward had not been able to find the answer to the riddle of her unresponsiveness nilak gently tugged on her arm my lady noor you must come with me now she insisted yes yes rhonwyn answered her arising at last but her attention was only partly focused on the older woman who was slipping a silken garment over her they say he returned from his morning meal to watch you in sleep for a short time nilak said what did you do child to entrance the caliph so she led rhonwyn from rashid al ahmets apartments and down the hall into the womens quarters rhonwyn was startled to note that slaves and harem women alike bowed to her politely as they passed by by the rood she thought nilak does not just babble uselessly rhonwyns wits were beginning to sharpen once again she had already divined from nilaks chatter that to survive in this place she needed power power came from several sources the caliph the lady alia and baba haroun she already had the caliphs favor and she could probably keep it if she were clever it was his first wife and the chief eunuch she needed to win to her side she had no quarrel with the lady alia indeed the caliphs wife had treated her with great kindness she wondered how that lady would feel now with all the gossip regarding the caliphs infatuation no matter rhonwyn told herself i will be polite and quiet spoken toward her as for baba laroun he is obviously devoted to the lady alia he will never really trust any other woman who might threaten his mistresss position rhonwyn realized still i will be respectful toward him and consider any advice he may give me if he will not be my friend at least i shall not have him as an enemy they entered the baths and as sarai hurried forward to greet the new favorite a silence fell among the other women there sarai greeted rhonwyn and then taking her single garment from her she personally took charge again of the bathing procedure the other women began to chatter softly once more but two who were seated together having their toenails pared stared hard at rhonwyn the one with the dark blond hair is fatinah the second wife nilak said softly the chestnuthaired woman is the third wife hasna how they glare at you she chuckled low their jealousy is plain can they harm me rhonwyn asked they might try nilak said honestly will baba haroun protect me from them nilak nodded he will but you must still be cautious my lady noor we will choose your servants carefully i want no one but you serving me rhonwyn replied your fate is now tied to mine and so i believe i can trust you nilak but should you ever betray me i will kill you with my own hands nilak looked startled but then she laughed you will have no cause to my lady noor being your confidante is a better position in my old age than caring for the children of harem women i will never betray you i swear it they bathed together and then when they had finished they entered the chamber where the women liked to gather afterward drinking mint tea and gossiping rhonwyn saw the lady alia surrounded by her women and immediately went to her kneeling before her rhonwyn placed her hands in those of the caliphs first wife her head bowed i greet you great lady she said quietly alia smiled wryly but then she said to nilak tell the lady noor that her gesture of respect shows me her good breeding i hope she will soon learn our tongue so we may converse together she remains in my favor for she has touched our lords heart yet even knowing it does not flaunt herself as others have in the past her graybrown glance flickered briefly to where the second and third wives sat the lady noor may sit by me and join me in a cup of tea nilak carefully repeated the first wifes words her trembling voice could scarcely mask her excitement she settled herself at rhonwyns feet translating for the two women as they spoke a tiny blue and white porcelain cup was placed in rhonwyns hand you have pleased my husband greatly alia said rashid is a good man although he has little tolerance for fools i did not know there was a kingdom here in the mountains behind carthage rhonwyn said cinnebar has been here since the beginnings or time alia responded it has never been conquered because it is so remote the wealth of our gold mines while comfortable is not so great that we attract undue attention we also mine alabaster and peridot you are not so distant that you escaped the sword of islam rhonwyn remarked alia laughed in the beginning cinnebar worshiped various gods as did most peoples then came a physician named luke who converted our people to christianity are you shocked noor yes i can see you are but many who were once christians in this region converted to islam when it came here in cinnebar it happened several hundred years ago when a princess from baghdad married the ruler of cinnebar it was she who converted the people of cinnebar there are still christians and jews among us and they are welcome as long as they obey our laws we have never had any difficulties as we respect each others manner of worship after all noor we all worship the same one god we all honor the ancient augurs abraham isaac moses you christians accept jesus of nazareth as the messiah we in islam believe he is a great prophet although wc hold that mohammed is the greater are these small differences a cause for warfare alia asked rhonwyn yet men war over them rhonwyn replied they are foolish arent they alia responded she lowered her voice men have not the inner strength of women which is why god made women the bearers of new life her eyes twinkled rhonwyn could not suppress a giggle how wise you are my lady alia she said quietly i think i can learn much from you we are going to be friends alia said i knew it when i first saw you noor ah here is baba haroun my lady alia he bowed i have come to escort the lady noor to her apartments i will come with you alia said rising and she will need servants of her own i want only nilak rhonwyn said quickly as she stood lady the chief eunuch protested you have become a favorite of the caliph you cannot be served by just one woman why not rhonwyn demanded it is not proper the eunuch said fussily you are the new favorite i have been here but a day rhonwyn said perhaps the caliph will decide be does not favor me nilak was almost dizzy with all the translation involved she is fearful of who to trust alia said to the chief eunuch i think she is very wise fatinah and hasna have been glaring at her ever since she entered the baths baba haroun i want her well protected do you understand me i like this girl she will be no threat to me even if she falls in love with the caliph this is the ally i have been seeking i will give noor two young slave girls from my own stall they are well trained and trustworthy tell her nilak nilak repealed alias oiler to rhonwyn adding you cannot refuse her my lady else you say without words that you do not trust the caliphs first wife i accept my lady alias most gracious offer and thank her for her understanding rhonwyn said sweetly nilak repeated rhonwyns honeyed reply again alia smiled wryly then she laughed you must teach her our tongue as quickly as she can learn nilak i really do want to be able to speak with her how can we two plot and plan if we cannot understand one another nilak chuckled and repeated what the caliphs first wife had said rhonwyn burst out laughing tell my lady alia i shall endeavor to learn her language as quickly as possible a small smile touched the lips of the chief eunuch he had had his doubts about the foreign warrior woman but it was obvious that she had a generous spirit and a good heart and his mistress who had always been a very intuitive woman liked her come baba haroun said and he led the women from the gathering room in the baths to the lady noors new apartments flinging open the doors he said enter my ladies the apartment was charming with its pale pink marble walls and painted ceilings there were two mediumsized rooms and a small room where the serving women could sleep both of the larger chambers opened onto a small garden with a spectacular view of sky and mountains it gave rhonwyn the illusion of freedom which it had been designed to do there was a small bubbling pool in the garden and a fountain in the dayroom the furnishings were rich with ebony and marble silks and diaphanous gauzes gold and silver thick carpets and colored glass lamps that burned fragrant oils the cushions in the seating area were velvet and brocade the bed in the bedchamber sat upon a gilded dais and was hung with green silk rhonwyn found herself at a loss for words it was the most beautiful place she had ever seen even haven had nothing like this within its stone walls she turned this way and that admiring something new that caught her eye each time she thought she had seen it all it is lovely she finally managed to say she turned to alia thank you i am glad you are pleased the caliphs first wife said then her eye lit upon a tray of plump apricot halves baba haroun what a lovely touch they look delicious sitting in their honey glaze she reached for a fruit but the chief eunuch slapped her hand away no lady he cried out i did not order that these fruits be placed in the lady noors apartments his black eyes grew opaque would you take the lady noor to your apartments please my lady alia alia nodded her golden skin was suddenly pale what is it rhonwyn asked nilak confused we are to go with lady alia nilak answered why rhonwyn persisted baba haroun did not order the apricots be brought to you i believe he thinks they are poisoned nilak said quietly poisoned rhonwyn was now pale herself who would want to poison me i have not been here long enough to make enemies you have found favor with the caliph nilak replied that is enough to give you enemies my child come now they followed lady alia to her apartments just down the corridor nilak told the caliphs first wife that she had explained the confusing situation to the lady noor who was understandably shocked do not be afraid noor alia said putting an arm about rhonwyn no harm will come to you i will see to it rhonwyn nodded smiling weakly at alia as nilak translated i shall now seek among my younger maidservants for two slave girls to serve you the caliphs wife said and nilak will of course remain your companion she left rhonwyn and nilak who were now sealed together in a quiet corner why is she so kind to me rhonwyn asked because in you she sees an ally against fatinah and hasna nilak said frankly when the caliph took fatinah as his second wife fatinah attempted to lord it over the lady alia it was a very foolish move because the first wife always has precedence over the other wives and the concubines or any woman in the harem except possibly the lords mother but the caliphs mother died when he was a child fatinah bore the caliph a son but by then he was tired of her vexatious behavior although it is not the lady alias way to complain baba haroun had kept the caliph fully informed of fatinahs behavior while our master was grateful for his second son omar the boys mother was no longer of any importance to him and then he fell in love with hasna rhonwyn was curious hasna was the daughter of one of the former caliphs most faithful counselors she was the child of his old age when he was on his deathbed he begged our caliph to take hasna as a wife he had no other children and hasnas mother had died giving birth to her rashid al ahmet agreed at first hasna was meek and respectful but then fatinah infected her with her venom and jealousy hasna gave birth to a daughter and before she lost her husbands love she had another daughter these two creatures spend most of their time scheming to overthrow the lady alia for they are too stupid to see it cannot be done even if that good lady died a natural death the caliph would not return them to his affections several months ago the caliphs eye lit upon a particularly lovely slave girl from the island of sicily his passions were engaged but the girl died suddenly after nibbling on a dish of pistachio nuts that had been left in her chamber no one knew from where the nuts had come although one of fatinahs servants had been seen by a harem woman near the dead girls chamber during that fatal day when questioned however the harem woman claimed she could not remember which servant or if indeed it had been one of fatinahs women at all rhonwyn laughed almost bitterly i am here against my will i dont want to infatuate the caliph but i have and now these two women want to murder me for it would that i had never left england it will be all right my child nilak assured her what will happen now rhonwyn wanted to know this time i believe fatinah and hasna have gone too far nilak said grimly and as if to give emphasis to her words terrified shrieks were now heard coming from the main gathering room of the harem her expression grim the lady alia rejoined rhonwyn and nilak there was the sound of pounding footsteps and the doors to the lady alias apartments burst open to admit a very young and frightened slave girl behind her came baba haroun the look on his face merciless the girl flung herself at alias feet sobbing and babbling she is begging the lady for mercy nilak said softly she says she had to do what she was told by her mistress that she herself would harm no one she begs lady alia to spare her life the slave girl clutched at alias hem and pleaded as nilak translated her words to rhonwyn lady gracious lady spare me i am the lowest of the low and could not refuse when my mistress commanded me did you know the truit was poisoned alia asked the slave girl shook her head in the negative she lies snapped baba haroun he grabbed the slave girl by her arm and shook her roughly the truth you spawn of a shecamel i did not know i did not know the girl insisted the chief eunuch slapped the slave girl brutally several times i shall whip the truth out of you girl he roared i did not know the girl sobbed brokenly but did you suspect your mistress and her friend might want to harm the lady noor alia gently probed the slave girl nodded adding but i am only a slave my lady and i could not be certain what they were doing they did not do it in my sight so how could i accuse them of perfidy you could have come to me alia said quietly they would have killed me if i did the slave girl half whispered now i will kill you baba haroun said fiercely and the hapless slave shrieked wrapping her arms about alias legs no baba haroun the caliphs first wife said the girl is correct and only sought to survive it is fatinah and hasna who must be punished severely for this attempt on noors life and i am certain the murder of poor guzel tell me girl she said softly caressing the slaves head comfortingly what do you know of guzels death did you bring her the pistachio nuts nay lady twas another the lady hasnas servant the slave said low were the nuts poisoned so it was rumored among the others was the reply take the apricots to fatinah and hasna baba haroun see that they eat them all lady alia said in a soft voice i grow weary of their misbehavior what of their children he asked omar is but four and the girls three and two we will raise them properly under our tutelage omar shall become his brothers right hand instead of his nemesis eh you are merciful my lady the chief eunuch said remove the children before the others she advised it shall be done my lady was the obedient answer she is going to kill them rhonwyn was surprised fatinah and hasna have crossed the line nilak said you are new here and so you do not know what they have done in their neverending attempts to harm the lady alia and her son mohammed there are none here who will mourn their passing what will the caliph say rhonwyn wondered what happens here in the harem is the province of the lady alia and baba haroun it is he who will explain to the caliph what happened it is unlikely that the caliph will have any objection rhonwyn suddenly saw the caliphs first wife in an entirely new light beautiful obviously intelligent and certainly kind alia was completely capable of being ruthless when she had to be rhonwyn shuddered are you chilled my child nilak asked anxiously nay rhonwyn said quietly you are surprised that the lady alia can be so unflinching arent you nilak said she is royalty noor her father was a prince of egypt she knows how to rule and what must be done when necessary she has never hesitated to do what she must and will protect the caliph and their son at whatever cost what shall i do with this girl baba haroun asked his mistress i shall take her into my own household alia said she is really a good girl who simply found herself with a bad mistress now go and do what must be done baba haroun as my lady commands the chief eunuch said bowing low and then backing from the chamber get up girl you are safe now alia said pulling the slave girl to her feet the slave kissed alias hands in gratitude what excitement let us have some mint tea and music to calm our nerves noor come and sit by my side the caliphs wife said within minutes slave women appeared bringing tiny cups of the sweetened mint tea and an engraved silver plate covered with stuffed dates and tiny crescentshaped pastries filled with chopped nuts raisins and honey a slave played upon a lute singing softly the air was suddenly fragrant with the scent of aloes the tiled fountain in alias gathering chamber cooled the room in the afternoon heat rhonwyn ate the treats eagerly as she had had nothing to eat since being awakened earlier when it is sale you will go to your own apartment noor alia said i imagine you will want to rest before rashid desires your presence tonight he is a most passionate lover isnt he rhonwyn blushed furiously at alias query the caliph s wife laughed and reached out to touch the younger womans warm cheek gently how old are you she asked seventeen i think rhonwyn answered a married woman and still so innocent until your night with rashid alia teased when was your age i had a threeyearold son do you want children noor i do not know rhonwyn said frankly our lord will give them to you noor for his seed is potent alia replied i hope you will learn to love him for all his manly strength he needs love to sustain him and make him stronger as do all men although certainly none of them will admit to it suddenly from another part of the harem muffled screams were heard rhonwyn paled and looked to nilak but her translator was silent her lips pressed together in a tight straight line she glanced to the lady alia but the face of the caliphs wife was serene as if she had not or could not hear the shrieks rhonwyn swallowed hard although she knew what was happening she had not imagined the executions of fatinah and hasna would be so public or so vocal neither of the two women could be very intuitive to have resisted the authority of the caliphs first wife it was not a mistake rhonwyn intended to make while she resided in cinnebar alias friendship was important to her survival and rhonwyn meant to keep it suddenly alia spoke and nilak said it is over now child do not look so stricken they deserved their fate the lady alia is extraordinarily patient and has borne their unforgivable behavior for several years todays attempt upon your life was but the final straw to break the camels back the harem will be a better place now i must accept your word for that rhonwyn said and sipped her mint tea which was now cool you have been giving her the elixir alia asked nilak until i can be certain of her character i do not want her belly swelling with rashids offspring her exceptional beauty has captivated my husband will she use her power over him for good or will she become like the others i want to avoid another incident like todays i have put the elixir in her tea each morning nilak answered as she does not speak our language there is no one to tell her of such things my lady i will do whatever you command me regarding this girl i like her alia said i think i have read her correctly and that there is no malice in her right now however i know she longs for her husband and her homeland rashids passion toward her will soon change that with fatinah and hasna gone he will take her for his wife i am certain two wives for the caliph of cinnebar are quite enough dont you think one seems rather paltry four is a bit ostentatious two is sensible and just right noor is healthy and young she will give our lord several children when the time is propitious begin tomorrow to teach her our language as i have previously commanded you i long to speak with her directly nilak baba haroun reentered alias apartments he went immediately to his mistress and bowed low it is done lady shall i have their bodies set out for the wild dogs no alia said they were my lords wives and the mothers of his children have them buried immediately in an unknown place but first escort the lady noor back to her apartments she is sensitive and not quite used to our ways yet she understands what happened had to happen but her heart is gentle she will need time to recover if she is to please our lord tonight baba haroun unless she proves unworthy of my friendship she has it do you understand me this girl is not my enemy nor do i expect her to be hasna and fatinah were common creatures noor like me is the daughter of a prince i understand my lady alia the chief eunuch said bowing again and then he turned to rhonwyn and bowed once more i will escort the lady noor to her quarters he said to nilak nilak gasped with her surprise never before had baba haroun bowed to any other woman in the harem but alia she imparted this information to her charge rhonwyn arose and taking alias hands in hers she kissed them then she followed the chief eunuch from the apartments of the caliphs wife without another word nilak scurrying in her wake when they were once again in rhonwyns chambers baba haroun said to nilak you will tell your mistress that i am her friend and mentor as long as she is true to the lady alia should she ever betray my mistress i will personally strangle her with my bare hands you will tell the chief eunuch rhonwyn replied when nilak had translated that i am a princes daughter and betrayal is not in my nature i am grateful for lady alias friendship and the wise counsel she has provided me with i will be grateful for the counsel and friendship of baba haroun as well the chief eunuch smiled slightly then asked are you truly reconciled to this life that it has been fated you will now lead noor rhonwyn shook her head not yet she told him your honesty is to be commended baba haroun said then he bowed to her again and departed the chamber oh fortunate girl nilak cried how can you fail to succeed now with the aid of both the lady alia and baba haroun you must rest for the caliph will desire your presence tonight surely i am hungry rhonwyn complained i have had nothing but sweets since i awoke i want a meal else i faint in the caliphs arms from starvation nilak how will you explain that if you faint in the caliphs arms noor he will think you are overcome with passion for him which is to the good nilak teased chicken rhonwyn said firmly i will go to the kitchens myself nilak said and hurried from the chamber she had been gone but a few moments when two young slave girls entered the apartments and bowed to rhonwyn halah said one pointing to herself sadirah said the other making the same gesture they then set about preparing a small table for rhonwyns meal chattering to each other as they did so rhonwyn realized these were the two serving girls alia had promised her they looked harmless enough although she knew everything she did would be reported back to the caliphs wife even as nilak reported her words she smiled to herself and sat next to the fountain in her gathering room to her surprise it had several water lilies and four small golden fish who swam busily about darting amid the lily pads she sighed everything about her was so peaceful and beautiful it was probably the most idyllic place in which she had ever been rising she walked out into her garden the mountains beyond and below the edge of the terrace were a hazy blue she suspected that on a clear day she might even sec the sea beyond she needed to get to the sea by the sea was carthageand the crusaders encampment how long now had she been gone from edward six days seven she had to find him again she had to get back to him what did he think happened to her would he have determined that the warrior who was captured was his wife had he looked for her would he indeed appear in cinnebar demanding her release oh edward she thought sadly what have i done i love you i love you but will i ever see you again she felt the tears coursing down her pale cheeks and struggled to regain control of herself she looked up startled at a touch on her shoulder halah stood by her side and the young slave girl pointed back inside then she made eating motions with her hands and mouth rhonwyn nodded giving the girl a weak smile brushing the evidence of tears from her cheeks she arose and reentered her apartments where nilak was busily setting out a meal with sadirahs aid rhonwyns nose twitched there was indeed chicken a small whole one stuffed with rice and raisins there was a dish of cooked grain with bits of onion in it flat bread a honeycomb and a bowl of fresh fruit bhonwyn sat down and began to eat eagerly tearing the fowl in half and biting into it delicious she pronounced scooping up some of the stuffing with her fingers and popping it into her mouth you eat like a ruffian nilak scolded where are your manners my child im hungry rhonwyn protested i cannot even remember the last time i was fed do you mean to keep me halfstarved all the time ii you eat loo quickly you will get pains nilak advised i am thirsty rhonwyn replied shaking her head in despair nilak poured fruit juice from a silver decanter into a silver goblet drink slowly she said do you approve of the two slave girls lady alia has given you they seem pleasant and efficient rhonwyn remarked they are tomorrow we will begin your lessons in arabic my child lady alia is most anxious that you learn i hope i have the facility for it rhonwyn said but then i learned the norman tongue readily enough my own language welsh is difficult for outsiders to learn rhonwyn turned her attention again to her meal eating almost everything that had been brought to her including a peach and a small bunch of grapes when she had finished her face and hands were bathed with scented water and halah cleaned her mouth and teeth now nilak said you must rest rhonwyn did not argue her belly was comfortably full now and it was hot there was not even the slightest breeze stirring sadirah took her garments from her and nilak brushed her long giltcolored hair rhonwyn was then content to lay naked upon the beautiful bed with its green silk gauze hangings and was quickly asleep her dark lashes brushing like small butterflies against her fair cheek she is so beautiful halah said softly they say the caliph fell in love with her at first sight sadirah murmured low do not be ridiculous nilak scolded them when the caliph first saw her she was garbed in mens clothing i know for i helped remove them she was dirty and smelled like a stable the gossip in lady alias apartments is that he will make the lady noor his wife now that fatinah and hasna are gone sadirah said that would mean our new mistress would be the second wife if that is indeed so nilak replied then you have lady alia to thank for raising you up you were merely two among many unimportant slave girls in her service now you are the serving women of the caliphs new favorite who may possibly become his wife she will be a wife i am certain of it halah said we are fortunate she would appear to be a kind lady like lady alia she is nilak assured them there is no meanness in her the three women went about the business of removing all evidence of rhonwyns meal and neatening up the apartment the afternoon slipped into evening eventually nilak sent the two younger servants to bed but she remained watching by her mistresss bed she was not surprised when the caliph entered the bedchamber garbed only in a loose white robe arising from rhonwyns side she bowed silently to him and departed the room closing the door quietly behind her rashid al ahmet looked down upon the woman he called noor and his heart contracted in his chest she had been in his possession two days and while he certainly lusted after her there was something more in his heart he liked the contradictions of her the fierceness and the vulnerability he would never he sensed have all of her there would always be a tiny something she would withhold from him and therein lay the challenge he removed his garment and lay down next to her she was in a very deep sleep and he was not surprised considering all that had happened to her in the last week she had been on her side but he gently drew her onto her back so he might look fully on her his fingertips caressed her breasts and she murmured contentedly he smiled last night he had only begun to plumb the depths of her passions he drew the back of his hand across her torso then bending began to kiss her lips with deep hungry kisses rhonwyn sighed and stretched lazily the lips on hers were warm and they grew more demanding with each passing moment she faintly protested this intrusion into her sleep but then she felt his lingers seeking between her nether lips two of the fingers pushed easily into her love channel while the ball of his thumb began to tease at the badge of her sex his kisses were bruising her lips but she didnt want him to stop her arms slipped up to embrace him his thumb played with her until the tension was almost painful she shuddered as it broke but rather than stopping he began anew arousing her again and this time to a greater height than before rhonwyn was now fully awake look at me you adorable little bitch he growled against her kissswollen mouth rhonwyns emerald green eyes opened and looked directly into those of rashid al ahmet as my lord wills she said softly the two fingers thrust deep and she cried out with undisguised pleasure his white teeth flashed a smile against his sundarkened skin are you beginning to know passion he said provocatively his thumb worried at her throbbing jewel yesss she hissed panting oh please please what his tongue licked at her nipples please she repeated tell me what you want my beauteous noor he replied you she half sobbed he laughed low and then rolling onto his back he lifted her up lowering her slowly on his raging manhood when she was settled he reached up and began to fondle her breasts rhonwyn was astounded his manhood was deep inside her she felt its length hot and throbbing yet it was she who would appear to be the dominant her eyes widened ride me my adorable noor i am your stallion rashid al ahmet told her surely you are not afraid she moved hesitantly at first and then at his smile of open encouragement she began to move more surely upon him as he gently drew her forward his hands slipping about to cup her buttocks thats it my beauty he said brace your hands noor thats right my precious ah what pleasure you give me rhonwyn had found the proper rhythm now and she rode the caliph enthusiastically for some minutes until he gently turned her onto her back delving deeper into her softness watching the change in expression on her lovely face amazed when they attained nirvana together crying out with utter satisfaction after some minutes rashid al ahmet laughed aloud what a woman you are becoming my lovely noor he said rhonwyn could feel that her cheeks were hot she had been so wickedly bold and she had liked it i never knew you could you are going to be astounded at what we can and will do together my adorable one he said his deep laughter rumbling up again from his chest you are i am pleased to note an eager pupil leaning over he kissed her again running a finger along her bruised lips do you like your apartments aye i do especially the garden with its sweeping views of the mountains my lord good he said are you hungry i am i have not eaten since morning i shall have my servants bring you food my lord rashid rhonwyn said arising from her bed and while we eat will you tell me of your day his dark blue eyes grew warm with approval the whole palace was gossiping that he intended to make noor his wife but until this moment he had not decided the matter it was a foolish man who thought only with his cock her newly unleashed passion was commendable but it was her care for his welfare and her interest in his doings that brought about his final decision he would indeed make noor his wife like alia she was a nurturing creature quite unlike the two who had been disposed of this day and two wives he thought was more than enough for any man even a caliph of cinnebar tomorrow he would speak with the imam aye noor he said to her i will indeed share my day with you as we eat chapter well edward de beaulieu prince edward said do you think you are strong enough to continue on or will you return to england you have been very ill and i will not count it against you particularly under the circumstances i will go on with you my liege came the answer but first i must seek my wife and sir fulk they are surely being held captive nearby and can be ransomed perhaps the prince responded but i wonder if that is so for we have received no ransom demand nor have we been attacked since that day when your wife so bravely led our men what a woman i should like to see her and her companion sir fulk safely returned i will follow you in seven days time my lord if i cannot find rhonwyn but i know that will de beaulieu said tersely the princes remarks about his wifes courage were somehow irritating i will pray god that you do my friend but if in seven days time you have found no trace of her then you must give up your search she will have been either sold into slavery in some nameless place or ravaged and killed i am very concerned that a week has gone by and we have had no word but you must search else you and your honor not be satisfied i know i surely would not be you know the road to acre the prince patted edward de beaulieus shoulder i have one favor to ask of you my liege will your good wife take rhonwyns maidservant into her train until i find rhonwyn i cannot keep enit safe among all these men and she is a good lass betrothed to one of my own people of course prince edward said have her gather her possessions and i will escort her to eleanor myself enit began to weep when she was told of her fate please my lord let me stay with you and wait for my mistress to return nay enit it is not safe de beaulieu told her you will be reunited with your mistress in acre but in the meanwhile i know you will be secure with the princesss train my search may be dangerous and cannot have you about to worry over now fetch your things and go with prince edward yes my lord enit sniffled but she did his bidding gathering up her lew possessions and following forlornly after prince edward as be departed de beaulieus tent there is one less worry edward muttered almost to himself he was still feeling weak but at least he was on his feet again in the morning he would take his two knights and they would seek rhonwyn and sir fulk rhonwyn his wild welsh wife he didnt know whether he would kill her or kiss her when he found her and fulk where was his common sense that he allowed his lords wife to run off into battle and then get them captured to his credit fulk had at least followed after rhonwyn de beaulieu understood that rhonwyn was different from other women by virtue of her upbringing but he had never liked it he could even understand her desire to bloody her sword for the first time in a real combat although most women he had known would have fainted at the mere thought of such a thing her mistake had been in becoming overconfident her passion for the battle should not have outweighed her caution but it had allowing her to be surrounded and then captured but why had they taken her off and not simply killed her he needed to know more than he already did he called sir hugo into his presence and asked him to seek out someone who had been in the heat of the battle sir hugo returned with a rather grizzled and gruff knight sir arthur sackville i had heard it was a woman sir arthur said shaking his head with disbelief but i could not quite fathom such a thing your wife you say aye edward answered she is the daughter of ap gruffydd the prince of the welsh magnificent creature sir arthur enthused admiringly she raced into the very center of it all rallying us furiously for the first time i felt our crusade was a truly holy and blessed thing my lord it was as if the angels were on her side did you see her capture why did they take her instead of simply killing her de beaulieu pressed they didnt really she had just killed the nobleman who led the infidels i think it was in coming to his defense they found themselves surrounding your wife although they certainly did not realize they had a woman but they raced off with her in their midst a single knight galloped after them but i do not know his name sir fulk edward said he was my man and should not have allowed rhonwyn into battle although even i know it would have been difficult to stop her once her mind was set on it who was the man she killed i have no idea my lord de beaulieu one of their nobles by his garb i am sorry i can help you no further sir arthur said can you tell me in which direction they went edward asked toward the mountains the knight said of that i am absolutely certain they rode to the mountains although why i do not understand there is nothing out there you know there must be something else why would they have gone that way edward replied nomads and their flocks perhaps but nothing else sir arthur paused as if considering his next words then he said my lord de beaulieu while the infidels could not have known at first that the knight who battled them so fiercely was a woman they would have eventually found her out they have surely ravaged her and killed her by now yours is a tragic loss i realize but you will have to accept it sooner or later i fear and if by some miracle your lady survived would you want her back after other men had used her forgive me de beaulieu for saying it but she is lost to you god help her she is gone he bowed to edward i am sorry i could be of no real help to you then he exited the tent be ready to ride at moonrise edward said quietly to his two knights see to the horses and water now hes mad sir hugo later said as he and the other knight did their lords bidding sir arthur is probably correct and the lady is dead or worse you knew her sir robert responded if she were your wife would you not at least attempt to find her i know i would it was alter midnight when the waning moon rose and they departed the crusaders encampment they rode toward the mountains dark shadowed mounds upon the horizon above them in the clear black sky the stars twinkled in lonely splendor their journey ceased when the sun became too hot for travel then they would water the horses from the supply they carried and shelter in the gray shadow of the rocks for four days they rode but they saw nothing no tents no livestock no people everything about them was wilderness there was absolutely no sign of any civilization even in the foothills of the mountains not a trace of human habitation was visible it was as if the earth had opened up and swallowed rhonwyn edwards heart grew heavier with each passing day he finally accepted what everyone had been telling him rhonwyn was gone his beautiful wild welsh wife was lost to him he would never see her again giving the word to his two grateful knights he turned their horses back to the sea directing their steps toward the acre road so they might join prince edward and his crusaders on the first night of their return journey as his two knights slept edward hid himself among the rocks and wept for the woman he believed he loved but in the days that followed his heart hardened toward her everything that had happened was her fault she had avoided her marital duties and given him no heir then she had insisted upon coming on crusade when a responsible woman would have remained at haven praying for his safe return and doing her duty as his chatelaine it was one thing for a queen or a princess to come on crusade but the wife of a simple lord had no business being in the midst of such an adventure his thoughts began to stray to his cousin katherine he would need a wife when he returned home to england his cousins family had always hoped he would marry katherine and now he would she was fair enough and obedient to boot there would be no nonsense over his possession of her body and katherine would gladly give him heirs as quicldy as his seed took root aye katherine would be the perfect wife for him arriving in acre he hired a scribe and dictated a letter to his cousin rafe rafe de beaulieu was surprised when in the spring of the next year he received his cousins missive from acre you are to be married he told his sister the welsh wife has died although i should not have thought a healthy girl like that would succumb easily but she has edward wants you for his wife when he returns home you will be wed sister this is just what the family has always wanted kate and yet while pleased for kate he grieved secretly for the beautiful rhonwyn if she had been his he would have kept her safe we must pray for the lady rhonwyns soul katherine said quietly i liked her for she was as good as she was beautiful all the servants have told me that pray for her then sister rafe said and seeing her stricken look continued i am rough spoken kate and well you know it forgive me in my happiness over your good fortune i did not consider the misfortune of the lady rhonwyn she was beautiful and we had no quarrel with her i will pray for her also it was father john who brought glynn the news of his sisters demise the boy was as was expected devastated by the news do you want to go home to wales the priest asked him to your father glynn swallowed hard nay he said rhonwyn wanted me to be educated and i will not disappoint her good father i will remain in school i thank you for coming to tell me for had i learned of this at haven on my next visit i should have given everything away in my grief how did my sister die edward did not say i expect it was too painful for him the priest replied we will learn the truth when he returns home to haven but not until then i fear i do not sense my sister dead glynn said thoughtfully i would have thought if she had died i should have known we were that close good father do not allow your celtic mysticism to overcome your christian sense my lad the priest warned him as he turned to depart glynn murmured as if in agreement but in his heart he did not acquiesce to the priests words until he learned from his brotherinlaw exactly how his sister had diedthat edward had seen it himselfglynn could not believe that rhonwyn was gone from this earth into the next not his sister she had too strong a will to die young alone in his dormitory glynn began to play upon his lute composing as he did so another ballad about a warrior woman called rhonwyn and he suddenly felt a sense of great comfort sweeping over him she is not dead he thought but what has happened to her it was then the thought entered his mind he would go to acre himself and find edward then having learned the truth he would find rhonwyn glynn ap llywelyn went into the town several days later to seek out oth and dewi his two guardians had been sent back from wales by his father when glynn entered the abbey school in order to maintain themselves they hired out as menatarms for local folk traveling the countryside but their base was in shrewsbury to which they always returned they boarded with an elderly widow who felt safer by their frequent presence glynn made his way through the towns narrow streets to the widows house by the river good morrow mistress ellen he greeted her cheerfully can you tell me if oth and dewi are in town today just back yesterday young master they are working my garden for me the old lady replied go along through jesu lad oth said catching sight of glynn you seem to grow bigger each day what is it the good brothers feed you the two welshmen embraced glynn father john has been to see me glynn said without any preamble he has had a letter from edward saying that rhonwyn has died i dont believe it oth burst out nor i dewi agreed glynn smiled with relief good because i do not feel the loss of my sisters presence at all he told the two edward must believe such a thing or he would not say it but until i learn for myself just what happened i cannot accept that rhonwyn is gone from us i mean to go to acre where the crusade is now settled will you two come with me aye they answered with one voice good glynn replied now i have considered this carefully neither rafe de beaulieu or his sister know my true identity they will wonder if i do not come to haven and they will worry for i am believed to be edwards bastard i shall visit them shortly and tell them that because i am considering the priesthood i am being sent to one of the orders other schools in france for a year as for the father abbott you two shall come to him in three days time for he knows my true identity and you will tell him that my father ap gruffydd desires me to join him for several months and you have been sent to escort me to him we will then go to haven and from there to the holy land what of father john oth asked will he believe your little tale of school in france he is no fool lad i will tell him the truth glynn said he cannot betray me lest he betray edwards subterfuge to his kin i do not believe he will do that oth looked at the boy who was now sixteen and practically a man he would not have expected such a daring plan from the gentle glynn but it was obvious that the lad meant to seek his sister out no matter what anyone else said what are we to do for traveling funds he asked in a pragmatic tone dewi and i have some coins put aside but well need more than what we have i have my allowance glynn said ive never spent it but for strings for my musical instruments i have almost everything edward gave me last year and i will ask rafe de beaulieu for more since i am going to france he chuckled and if we run out of funds i shall sing for our supper well then said oth there is nought to keep us from our travels glynn ap llywelyn we shall come for you in three days time and when they did the father was most sympathetic of course prince llywelyn would want his son with him under the tragic circumstances he said father john had told him of rhonwyns demise we have been praying for the ladys good soul ever since we learned the terrible news he turned to glynn we shall eagerly await your return glynn ap llywelyn go now and comfort your father youre a true welshman oth said approvingly as they rode through the city gates you played your part well and never once looked guilty over the lies we told that good priest glynn merely grinned at his companion at haven gastle the boy appeared alone and told his tale to rafe de beaulieu and his sister father john lifted a questioning eyebrow but said nothing so you are considering being a priest rafe said enthusiastically why should this make you happy glynn said because you are my cousin edwards get he will wed my sister katherine when he returns from crusade while you are a bastard if edward should die you might attempt to usurp my sisters children from their rightful inheritance as a priest i can trust you and your intentions glynn of thorley glynn felt a terrible fury welling up within him rhonwyn was barely dead according to edward and he was already planning a new marriage i will kill him glynn vowed silently to himself and then he caught father johns eye he swallowed his anger back down but it still burned within him as he said your devotion to your sister is commendable rafe what is this all about the priest demanded of glynn when they were finally alone i do not believe my sister is dead glynn replied you scoff at my celtic mysticism but there has always been a bond between my sister and me it is not that i am grieving or unable to accept the truth in this matter if rhonwyn were dead i should feel it i do not and if i do not she must be alive i am going to the holy land to find her and to find out from my treacherous brotherinlaw what has happened to her how quickly he plans his remarriage the priest sighed i see i cannot dissuade you glynn he said may i assume oth and dewi are nearby they are and will be my companions in this adventure the boys eyes twinkled you must see that rafe de beaulieu gives me a fat purse for my journey to france and my years stay there what did you tell the abbott the priest demanded that my father had called me back to wales glynn replied it seemed a plausible explanation aye the priest said if you must lie tis best to keep it simple he sighed again then advised go to dover glynn there are still ships sailing for the holy land with men who wish to join prince edward a young minstrel and two menatarms will easily find passage on one of these vessels this is a good time of year to go as the seas will be calmer than in winter you will pray for us father will you not i will pray hard for you glynn ap llywelyn you go i fear on a fools errand but if it will satisfy your heart and soul to make this journey then i cannot deny you if edward de beaulieu says your sister is dead god assoil her good soul then surely she must be for what reason would he have to lie he cared for the lady rhonwyn glynn shook his head like you i am puzzled but i also know in my heart that my sister lives why edward believes her dead i cannot say but i go to learn the truth of the matter i will see you well funded the priest promised the monies were handed over and glynn departed haven castle the following day a fat purse well hidden on his person and father johns blessing ringing in his ears joining oth and dewi down the road he turned to look back and wondered if he would ever see haven again while startling the feeling did not distress him his goal was to find rhonwyn and in that he would not be deterred he bad grown not just physically but intellectually during his time at the abbey school while he still preferred music and poetry to armaments and fighting he had found he was capable of being tough and hard when he must be so they spent the next few days riding across england to dover there as the priest had told them were vessels preparing to depart for the holy land and prince edwards crusade they took passage on a sturdy ship with a welsh captain who looking at oth claimed kinship with him through a female relation and welcomed them aboard after three days at sea the captain and oth had traced their family connection to the sister of oths grandsire who had been the captains grandmam oth explained to his kinsman that glynn was also their kinsman and a minstrel going to the holy land to entertain the soldiers during the seven weeks of their voyage glynn entertained the captain and the crew with his ballads his sweet voice rising above the roar of the sea once into the mediterranean the days and the nights grew warmer and then hot their vessel stopped at several ports to unload and take on cargo food and water finally they reached acre an ancient city reputed to have the finest port on the mediterranean once acre had belonged to the syrians but in the seventh century it had been captured by the arabs it had changed hands several times during the early crusades but was now firmly in the hands of the knights hospitalers who had held it for almost a hundred years as part of the kingdom of jerusalem glynn oth and dewi disembarked their ship and quickly found themselves in the crowded noisy and dusty streets of the city their ships captain had directed them to a small inn where they would not be cheated or robbed if they were careful reaching the inn they were relieved to find the innkeeper a large buxom woman of indeterminate age spoke the norman tongue i am glynn of thorley minstrel extraordinaire and sent to you by captain rhys mistress these two are my bodyguards who are quite capable of keeping the peace within your inn on the best of nights or the worst glynn told her with an elegant bow you are seeking employment she asked them her hands upon her ample hips we seek temporary shelter mistress glynn said but we are willing to work for it and for our supper why temporary the innkeeper demanded of him licking her lips provocatively as she looked at oth oth winked at her i have come to acre seeking my good overlord edward de beaulieu who is with prince edward glynn answered if he is in acre i will find him and if he is not i may at least learn where he is mistress i can accommodate you the innkeeper said you may have your days free but your nights you must give to me to entertaining my customers i mean and your men will be at my beck and call in the evenings as well is it agreed for the first time she looked directly at glynn surprised at his youth it is agreed mistress he said with a smile he thought her a pretty woman with skin as white as milk and black black hair my name is nada the innkeeper said it means giving in the language of the arabs and i am known to be a most generous woman her gaze was again on oth do your companions have names young minstrel they are oth and dewi glynn responded with a gesture toward the two men there is a nice room behind the kitchens mistress nada said come and i will show you then perhaps you would like to have a decent meal for from the look of you you havent had good food in over a month i like my men with more meat on their bones the better to eat you alive dewi murmured to his companions in their own tongue youre a lucky dog oth she looks like shell prove a right lusty fuck ill see if she has a sister oth returned softly the inn in a whitewashed dried mud building had a hardpacked dirt floor inside it was cool and dim the wooden tables were well scrubbed their benches tucked neatly beneath them they followed the innkeeper through the main room of her establishment into a bright kitchen at the rear of the building from the rafters there bung sheaves of dried herbs and fruits pots boiled merrily over the fire from the ovens came the delicious smell of baking the three women servants glanced briefly at them then returned to their chores the men could see a courtyard beyond the kitchen through its narrow windows your room is through there she pointed it has a door to the courtyard it is clean and dry i promise you glynn stepped into the chamber followed by dewi oth however remained in the kitchen with the innkeeper he backed the woman up into a wall alcove and fumbled her ample breasts nada smiled broadly showing strong white teeth and rubbed herself against him in a decidedly suggestive manner there is no time now she said and besides you will need a good meal first so you may be filled with strength what does oth mean her hand slipped into his breeches and she fondled him her black eyes widening as she felt him hard and large in her palm leave us she called to her three servants who immediately obeyed giant he said meaningfully dewi will keep the boy away then he turned her about pushing her down over her kitchen table even as his hands were raising up her skirts so he might have access to her his manhood found her love channel easily and oth thrust himself into the woman with a groan working himself back and forth as she eagerly pushed her plump rump into his groin ah thats good you devil she moaned dont stop he pleasured her for several minutes and then said sorry lass but tis just a taster i can give you now yer right i do need my dinner then he emptied his seed into her with a lusty sigh nada let out a long hiss of breath collapsing slightly upon her table as oth withdrew from her she slowly straightened herself up and turned about to face him my rooms are on the other side of the courtyard she told him pulling her skirts down and giving him a quick kiss i can use a lusty lover temporarily then she left the kitchen i thought a man rode atop the woman glynn said as he and dewi came forth from the chamber not always oth replied have you had a woman yet lad glynn nodded in shrewsbury theres a girl who spreads her legs for a hapenny my friends at the school took me ive been twice and you liked it oth questioned glynn aye tis why i went again the young man replied the two older men laughed well in that you are your fathers son they told him then oth said since youve made a beginning of it well teach you what you need to know young glynn acre is as good a place as any for a young fellow to sow his wild oats but first i must find edward glynn said all business again well find him oth promised and they did although it took almost a full week during the hot days they sought out de beaulieu while in the evenings glynns sweet voice filled mistress nadas inn and poured out into the streets word of the young minstrel spread quickly and the inn was packed with men of all lands listening to glynn as he sang ballads old and familiar and some that he had himself composed the inns guests quickly found a new favorite in the warrior woman which glynn had composed about his sister the serving maids had taken to practically tiptoeing when glynn was entertaining they had also taken to coming into his chamber at night to pleasure both him and dewi while oth was with mistress nada the womans insatiable oth complained to glynn and dewi the day they found edward de beaulieu edward immediately recognized oth and dewi but at first he did not recognize their companion glynn was no longer a young boy but a man what he demanded very surprised are you doing here where is my sister glynn demanded she is dead of her own foolishness edward replied bitterly come sit down out of the sun glynn how did you leave haven haven stands as it did the day you departed it with my sister your cousin rafe and your bridetobe katherine eagerly await your return glynn said rancorously tell me of my sister how did she die were you not there we were at carthage edward began signaling his servants to bring cool wine for his guests i was ill with fever and a terrible flux of the belly and bowels rhonwyn nursed me devotedly only allowing enit to sit with me a few hours each night so she might sleep all around us men were dying like flies but rhonwyn moved our tent away from the others and kept it and me scrupulously clean i owed her a debt for saving my life king louis died and charles of anjou made peace with the infidels prince edward would not have it and made plans to move on to acre rhonwyn had been penned up with me for weeks i suggested she go with sir fulk to play at sword practice i saw she was well garbed for it though she argued with me because of the heat but then properly dressed she and fulk went off to the practice field shortly after the infidels began one of their little attacks on the encampment it was routine they did it each day it was never more than a skirmish and nought ever came of it there were rarely any injuries and certainly no casualties rhonwyn obviously decided to bloody her sword in real combat and fulk it appears went with her her headpiece ensured that no one knew she was a woman they say she rallied the soldiers magnificently it became a serious battle and the infidel was beaten back unfortunately rhonwyn got cut off from the main body of soldiers she was captured and fulk riding after her was taken too i spent four days with sir hugo and sir robert seeking any trace of her there was none it is the opinion of those who know about such things that she was probably found out then raped and murdered she might have been sold into slavery somewhere but that it seems is unlikely for she was not a virgin edward de beaulieu finished my sister is not dead glynn ap llywelyn said if she were i should sense it in my heart glynn i am sorry edward said reaching out to the young man whom he genuinely liked she is not dead glynn shouted and i will find her edward if you find any trace of her it will be nought but her bones i have prayed for her each day since she was lost to me edward said angrily you have prayed tor her while seeking another bride glynn replied furiously and rafe de beaulieu lords it over haven even as his sister waits meekly for your return rhonwyn should have waited meekly for my return edward said if you had wanted rhonwyn to await your return then you should have forbidden her to accompany you edward i think it pleased your vanity to have her with you as the lady eleanor was with prince edward it was my sister i know who first expressed enthusiasm for the crusade and not you rhonwyn ap gruffydds daughter made the kings son look favorably upon you and edward plantagenet will be englands king far sooner than later we all know glynn said with devastating veracity am i to be condemned then by you a mere singer of ballads a welsh outlaws bastard get for considering the future of my family edward de beaulieu demanded hewould not be made to feel guilty glynn smiled scornfully when i find my sister i shall tell her the kind of man she is wed to although i already suspect rhonwyn knew for even i could see you were not a wellmatched pair had you been perhaps you might have mourned my sisters loss instead of hurrying to make a match with your cousin katherine your sister was a coldhearted bitch edward declared heatedly she would scarcely allow me my husbandly rights why do you think there were no children my seed is strong i have fathered my share of bastards glynn but rhonwyn would not let me near her at least katherine is eager for children and will give me legitimate heirs how convenient that my sister should suddenly disappear then glynn said or did you arrange her mysterious disappearance do you think me so without honor then edward demanded yes glynn ap llywelyn said deprecatingly then he smiled a silent challenge at his brotherinlaw edward de beaulieus hand went to where his sword would have been in battle his eyes flashed irately at the younger man my lord oths voice broke in amid the tension glynn has not the skill to fight you he is angry beyond reason as you well may understand you are the man in this matter get from my sight edward said to glynn i do not want to see yo u ever again i am not afraid to fight you glynn declared passionately come lad oth said softly he will certainly kill you and then who will there be to find our rhonwyn i place a welsh curse upon you edward de beaulieu the boy said may you have only daughters then he turned and left the courtyard edward laughed mockingly would that his sister had shown me such passion he said to oth take him home before he gets himself killed perhaps ap gruffydd can do something with his son he is no longer my responsibility nor do i want him oth nodded silently and then followed after his young master while he had managed to keep glynn from getting himself killed he was in total agreement with the lad the welshman had always thought de beaulieu coldhearted but now he was certain of it still what could they do now if the englishman was telling the truth and there really was no reason to think he wasnt then where had rhonwyn gotten to thinking about it hurt his brain and when they reached their inn he gladly followed nada to her chambers as was her custom in the afternoon heat she rubbed his head taking the ache away and he pleasured her into temporary repletion saying afterward i want to buy you a gift nada what would you like remembering i am a poor man she laughed her husky laugh a gold bangle will not harm your finances oth but you must remember i wear only gold ornaments that come from the caliphate of cinnebar their goldsmiths are truly without equal later this afternoon when it is cooler we shall shop together at the only merchant in all of acre who carries jewelry from cinnebar he will charge you little as it is for me cinnebar i have never heard of such a place where is it oth leaned over and kissed the fat nipple on her big breast it is a tiny kingdom fairly isolated in the mountains to the west and south of carthage nada told him they have famous gold mines and other wealth but it is small and so difficult to reach that no conqueror will bother with it she reached out to encourage his manhood to action again they were once a christian state but then converted to islam their rulers were allowed to take the most rare of titles caliph which means defender of the faith oh thats nice she purred as her lover sheathed himself inside her once again i shall truly miss you oth she told him he used her fiercely and roughly as she liked exhausting her into sleep at last oth then lay by his mistresss side considering what she had told him was it possible just possible that the lady rhonwyn had somehow ended up in cinnebar edward de beaulieu claimed to have sought for her for several days but he had gone only into the foothills of the mountains oth knew from the talk he had heard in acre that a fair woman virgin or not was most highly prized here in the slave markets by the arab lords whose own women were dark haired dark eyed and darker skinned what if the men who had captured her had taken her to cinnebar and sold her as a slave when nada finally awoke and they dressed he asked her if such a thing was possible of course was ihe firm answer even if she was not the most beautiful girl in the world her hair her eyes and her skin would make her most valuable you say she is beautiful then her captors would have treated her gently in order to gain the highest price for her most likely cinnebar is where they would have taken her any longer trip and your mistress might very well have died not being used to the climate ler captors would have known that and would have wanted to turn their profit as quickly as possible lest she sicken on them how can we get to cinnebar oth asked nada she smiled broadly at him how fortunate you are that i took you for my lover she said gold jewelry from cinnebar is for the wealthy not a mere innkeeper fortunately the shopkeeper i am taking you to meet is my cousin his sister is married to a merchant of cinnebar melek is a resourceful woman and she will help you the first thing we must do is find a caravan going to cinnebar if not from here then from carthage or alexandria or damascus you will probably not be able to travel directly for caravans to cinnebar are rare we could travel by sea to carthage could we not oth said yes nada said thoughtfully we will speak with my cousin the merchant about it he will know and perhaps you can act as his agent he would pay your passage then so your pretty young master would have only two passages to concern him she looked at him longingly oh i am indeed going to miss you oth it will be a long while if ever before i find another lover like you she patted his rump affectionately and then said let us go now i want my gold bangle so i may always remember you my little welshman then with a chuckle she was off and oth dutifully followed behind her there would be time enough this evening to tell glynn about this most interesting bit of news and they might as well begin looking in cinnebar as anywhere else it seemed most logical he would miss nada too oth thought she had indeed proved a lusty fuck but it was her good heart and easy laughter that had delighted him as well still they would surely have a few more hot afternoons before he and his companions departed if god was kind oth considered with a grin chapter you came to me practically a virgin and now you are probably the most wanton creature i have ever known rashid al ahmet teased bis beautiful second wife ah yes you witch she knelt belore him her bands and her mouth entertaining the various aspects of his manhood one hand gripped him keeping him steady within her month while her tongue encircled him tantalizing him expertly even as the fingers of her other hand bedeviled his pendulous jewels stroking them tickling them lightly as he grew harder and harder in the warm cave beyond her succulent lips he kneaded her giltcolored head as she continued to arouse him but finally he said in a thick voice enough witch rhonwyn looked up at him with a wicked smile then swinging her lithe body about she knelt upon all fours elevating her milky white bottom to him does it please my lord to play the stallion with his willing mare she taunted him turning her head she looked over her shoulder at him seductively she was burning for his passion yes he growled kneeling behind her and thrusting easily into her hot wet love channel pushing deep withdrawing and thrusting again i cannot get enough of you my exquisite noor it pleases me that you now feel the same way she whimpered her open pleasure as his fingers dug into her hips steadying her against his onslaught his lance probed her deeply sending ripples of shivers down her spine until the caliph she had never even dreamed of such pleasure and the thought struck her as it always did when rashid made such passionate love to her that she wished she might have shared this loveliness with edward de beaulieu her head spun and she half sobbed oh allah tis wonderful my lord do not cease do not cease she reached the apex of her delight shuddering violently as it shattered over her receded and left her weak her body collapsed onto the carpet but withdrawing he turned her onto her back and pushed his manhood into her again not yet he ordered her i am not ready my fair noor and you are too quick to grasp your pleasure just as a greedy child with a sweet i must teach you more selfcontrol his dark eyes mocked her as he moved slowly deliberately upon her arousing her once again to heights to which she did not think she could return so soon and when he was satisfied at last his love juices burst flooding her channel leaving them both but halfconscious as the pleasure drained slowly away he rolled onto his back drawing her onto his chest within his embrace ah noor my love you are magnificent his words comforted her as she fell into an exhausted sleep not even knowing when he arose and carried her to her own bed drawing a light coverlet over her beautiful body the caliph of cinnebar smiled softly upon his beautiful second wife his life it seemed had become so perfect since she had entered it over a year ago at first she had been but a beautiful possession but then he realized he had fallen in love with her he was a fortunate man rashid al ahmet thought to himself two beautiful wives both loving and compatible with one another could paradise be any better than this although he still occasionally took his pleasure with one of the concubines in his harem it was but a momentary diversion it was noor whom he loved with a young mans passion and now he wanted children by her he was more than well aware of the methods used within his household to prevent conception he even approved the two wives he had executed had given him three children between them his younger son omar and his two little daughters mohammed his heir who was fourteen was now allowed sterile harem damsels for his pleasure rashid al ahmet knew the dangers of too many sons and but one kingdom to inherit his younger brothers had always been difficult to control even before their father died kasim had quite fortunately died of a fever at age fifteen and bis own exquisite noor had slain abdallah in battle now he wanted a child from this wife he called his warrior woman he would speak with alia and with baba haroun for it was just possible they would know how he might be certain of fathering only a daughter on noor not a son to perhaps one day challenge mohammed and even omar he smiled down on noor and then left her sleeping peacefully in her own bed his first wile was sympathetic to his desires but his chief eunuch was fiercely against it your life is peaceful and perfect right now my lord you have a son who is just about a man you have a second son who should allah forfend anything happen to the first be there to succeed there is no certain way to guarantee the lady noor would bear you a daughter think my lord think lady noor is a fierce woman despite the passion you have for one another she has killed without regret she could kill again if the matter involved her own son do not put her in that position or yourself or lady alia my lord baba haroun said seriously i must think on it rashid al ahmet replied i do long for a daughter as beautiful as she is does she wish for a child my lord the chief eunuch asked she has not said so the caliph answered then let well enough alone my lord baba haroun pleaded the caliph turned to alia what are your thoughts on this my honored first wife you are remarkably silent in this matter as always rashid i want what will make you happy alia told him mohammed is fourteen now and little omar almost six if noor gave you a son i cannot see any danger to my son by the time this child was grown mohammed would have fathered his own sons and omar too besides i do not see that kind of ambition in noor and she might indeed give you a daughter not a son but if she has expressed no wish for a child you would be wise not to force the issue for now i must think on it the caliph repeated but both alia and baba haroun knew that he had already made up his mind he wanted a child from noor and would not be satisfied until he had one my lord of interest to you perhaps baba haroun said there is a young poet in the citythe foreigners call him a minstrel his songs are drawing many to the tavern of akram yasir i have gone myself and heard him he sings in both our language and the many languages of the world perhaps before he goes on his way we should have him to the palace to entertain he is pleasant to look upon and nicely spoken i believe the harem ladies and the children would enjoy him as i am certain would you my lord very well the caliph said you may issue my invitation the chief eunuch bowed low and hurried off the caliph left his first wife and alia sent one of her women to ask the lady noor if she would come and join her rhonwyn came willingly for she liked alia and enjoyed her company when the first wife dismissed all of her women so that they were alone rhonwyn knew that something important was about to happen what is it she asked alia do you love rashid alia said softly i respect him and i love his passion rhonwyn replied carefully but do you love him alia persisted rhonwyn shook her head no she said quietly my memories of edward de beaulieu are yet strong in my head perhaps one day they will not be and i will love rashid allah only knows he has been patient and kind you arouse guilt within me by asking such a question alia why is it you do so surely you do not think i mean rashid any harm no no alia replied i ask because of something he has said he wants a child from you noor do you want a child rhonwyn looked astounded a child i had not thought of having a child a child would bind me to rashid with edward she paused and then said you know how it was with edward my friend we were just beginning to explore our love when i was snatched away from him thinking on it i know now that i should have liked to have borne edwards children why does rashid want a child of my body he has children to follow him i am his plaything his latest passion i am certainly nothing more to him than that alia he loves you noor do you not realize it rashid is in love with you that is why he wants a child of your body the caliphs first wife looked deeply into the eyes of her beautiful companion oh my poor noor she said you have been awakened to passion but you know nought of love do you i love edward rhonwyn cried i wonder if you really did my dear i wonder if he truly loved you you did not know each other long enough and your relationship from what you have told me was quite adversarial most of the time you were together you were yet a child playing at your games of war with your weapons you were careless and heedless of what would happen to you else you would not have rushed off to join a battle and be captured you would have withdrawn to your sick husbands side at the first alarm of trouble noor but you did not you thought only of yourself not of edward de beaulieu didnt you i say these things not to distress you my friend but to waken you you are loved by a good and powerful man open yourself to that love passion shared between two people who love one another is far more potent than passion merely shared between a man and a woman my noor this i know from my own experience a child bom of such a love is a most fortunate child alia concluded rhonwyns hand had gone to her mouth in startled realization as alia had spoken to her she had been a child selfish and determined to have her own way in everything what a disservice she had done edward and ap gruffydd as well but despite alias words rhonwyn knew she could not love rashid al ahmet as alia did more than ever now she wished she could return to edward de beaulieu and tell him of all she had learned not just of passion but of herself she wanted them to begin again but it was impossible she would have to go through life bearing the guilt for thoughtlessly abandoning him for her own pleasure and she had an added guilt in the caliph who loved her you look so stricken alia said i did not mean to make you unhappy noor she reached out and patted her friends arm nay rhonwyn said you have but made me face myself for the first time in my life alia i am not certain i like what i see i wonder if i understand what love is at all let rashid teach you alia pleaded how can you say that to me when it is obvious that you love him with all your heart how can you so willingly share him alia because i love him and hecause it is our way the older woman said it is not possible for one woman to satisfy a man a man is like a honeybee and needs many flowers to keep him happy rhonwyn shook her head in despair four years ago she said i lived in a border fortress with my brother and a garrison of rough men who had raised me i knew nothing of being a woman i didnt even know god alia my brain aches with all i have learned in these last years she sighed i will try to love rashid i promise you but why would you encourage me to have a child what if it is another son my son could rival your son do you want that mohammed will follow his father and will be years older than any son you bear our lord alia said assuredly is it custom that the eldest son follows his father here in cinnebar rhonwyn asked alia no alia answered but everyone knows mohammed is to follow his father onto the throne of cinnebar what if i bear the caliph a son what if the caliph does not go to his reward in paradise until that son is twenty years of age what if he loves my son better than yours because of the love he has for me and loving my son better he names him the next caliph how would you feel about that alia rhonwyn asked her friend alias face was a mask of her conflicting emotions but then she answered honestly should not like that noor and therein lies the danger rhonwyn replied i would rather have your friendship alia than bear a son to rival yours but you might have a daughter alia said and he truly desires a daughter from you he has already fathered two sons and two daughters you could have a daughter noor his passion is hot and potent for me alia his seed is copious when he releases it into my hidden garden icould have a son i know what is clone to prevent conception here in the harem for nilak has explained it to me please give me a little more time before you withdraw that special brew from me i need to think so do you he need never know i care not if he thinks me barren alia he will not stop loving me or gaining pleasure from my body perhaps i can even learn to love him a little bit to add to his delight rhonwyn said she speaks more sense than i would have thought baba haroun said stepping from behind a wall hanging do not scold me lady for listening you know that my duty to you is paramount have i not been with you since you were but a child in your fathers house lady noor is wise to consider all the consequences of the caliphs desire what indeed if the caliph loved a son of her body more than prince mohammed she would not i believe encourage such a thing for there is no malice in her but we cannot control the caliphs feelings as you and i know a son of noors body could prove a catastrophe for cinnebar for us all my lady alia listen to the lady noor fate my dear baba haroun will take its course no matter what we do the jews have a saying man plans god laughs alia said quietly if rashid desires a child of noor then it is her duty to give him one i am willing however as head of my lords harem to let her wait a little more before she must fulfill that duty it will be as my lady wills the chief eunuch said rhonwyn bowed her head in obedience to the first wife but afterward told nilak of all that had happened a child nilak said excitedly that would be wonderful my dear lady i knew you were fortunate the day i first laid eyes upon you the lady alia is correct when she says the caliph loves you many in the harem are very jealous of you although you would not notice it having no acquaintance with the other women the others bore me rhonwyn said they seem to do nothing but lay about beautifying themselves and hoping that the caliph will notice them i far prefer lady alias company there is to be a special entertainment for the harem shortly nilak told her mistress a famous young musician who has been in the town entertaining at a tavern he is to come to the palace in a few days and sing for us it is said how is that possible since we are not allowed to be seen by others rhonwyn asked the harem but for the lady alia and you will be seated behind screens you two however are permitted to sit at the caliphs feet suitably veiled of course there are but a few invited guests the vizier the caliphs treasurer the imam no others it is an informal event my lady noor i always enjoyed music rhonwyn said although our music is different than yours these musicians are foreigners they sing and play in many languages i am told perhaps even yours nilak replied i doubt it rhonwyn said with a smile welsh is a difficult tongue almost as difficult as arabic which you now speak flawlessly and without even an accent nilak praised the younger woman when are we to hear these musicians rhonwyn asked baba haroun has not yet announced their coming was the reply it should be soon though the mere mention of an entertainment to which they were to be invited set the harem women abuzz with excitement the mistress of the wardrobe was besieged with requests for clothing and jewelry gossip ran rife about what the lady alia and the lady noor would wear the fact that they would be seated by the caliph and not behind the screens caused a great deal of jealousy the wives always have more privileges and why one girl whined as she braided pearls into her hair because they are wives and have children another more sensible and practical woman said the lady noor has no children the first replied but she is easily the most beautiful woman in the world the practical woman answered and besides the caliph loves her the other women nodded in agreement it was certainly no secret that rashid al ahmet was utterly besotted by the beautiful frankish woman the lady noor to give her credit however seemed modest despite their masters grand passion even the lady alia was her friend the date for the entertainment was announced and the excitement grew to a fever pitch the evening the musicians came the harem was shepherded by baba haroun and his minions into the great hall of the caliphs palace the veiled ladies sat behind the sheer fabric screens their view visible but faintly obscured rashid al ahmet sat upon a lowcushioned golden and bejeweled throne set upon a black marble dais on his right his eldest son mohammed was seated upon a low stool his head only reaching the height of his fathers hand on the caliphs left his other son omar was similarly ensconced the ruler of cinnebar was garbed in a black and gold brocaded silk robe there was a small gold turban upon his dark head with a large ruby in its center his two sons were dressed in simple white robes but their heads were bare the lady alia sat upon a scarlet silk cushion to the right of her husband and just one step below the dais she wore a scarlet kaftan decorated with gold which complemented her coloring the lady noor sat upon a clothofsilver cushion to the left of the caliph and two steps below the dais her simple kaftan was turquoise blue in color trimmed in silver both women wore sheer matching veils over their heads and drawn across their faces for modestys sake although anyone looking closely could have seen their features still no man in the room among the few guests would have been so rude a hush descended upon the hall as the three musicians entered and bowed low to the caliph they were swathed in the white robes and burnooses of the land the tallest of them stepped forward as the other two sat upon the floor their instruments at the ready my lord caliph i shall first begin with a song native to my own land and sung in my own tongue he said rhonwyn started that voice the musicians began and the tune was familiar to her my sister if you are among these women you must contrive to sing back to me now so i may know it sang glynn ap llywelyn i have sought long for you sing to me my sweet sister you must not start at the sound of my voice brother but i am indeed here rhonwyns voice rang out then she turned to look up to the caliph they sing a song native to my homeland in my own welsh tongue the singer invites all who understand him to join in my lord please allow me to do so or at least explain if i may not sing my beautiful golden bird the caliph said generously i was not aware of what a lovely voice you had you will sing for me alone in the future noor thank you my lord rhonwyn replied then turning back to the musicians she sang he says i may sing with you for he does not know who you are brother your song must be short else suspicions be aroused i have come to take you home sister glynn sang my musicians are oth and dewi tell us how we may accomplish the impossible remain in cinnebar brother use whatever excuse you must but remain i will find a way to contact you it will not be easy but i will succeed in time be patient and do not leave me now that you have found me tis best we end our song now sweet brother how i long to embrace you once again rhonwyns voice soared sweetly i shall do as you say dearest sister i shall not leave you i shall not leave you i shall not leave you glynn finished the song then he bowed to the caliph tell me the tale of your song my minstrel friend the caliph said it is a story about a widowed mother whose only son goes off to war she fears for him in the ensuing months as she hears nought of him finally when she has just about given up hope her son returns my lord he promises never to leave her again it is a simple tale you understand now however i shall sing to you a song that is currently quite popular in damascus but would you first tell me who the lady was who sang with me he bowed again my second wife the caliph answered she is a student of languages rhonwyn could scarcely conceal her excitement but she did glynn her little brother how had he come to this place it was a miracle and now she needed another miracle for the next few days she considered her course of action but finally had to admit to herself that only the chief eunuch baba haroun could help her but would he the tall black man held the power of life and death within the harem walls even rashid al ahmet did not have such total control as did his chief eunuch rhonwyn sent her serving woman sadirah to request an audience with baba haroun sadirah returned saying the eunuch would expect the lady noor in his chambers within the hour why do you wish to speak to him nilak probed none too subtly the caliph wishes me to have his child as you know but i have been reluctant as i would have no child of mine in competition with prince mohammed i love his mother too well still even the lady alia wants me to become a mother the three of us spoke on this several days ago i promised baba haroun that i should talk with him on it further after all does he not have the best interests of the caliph at heart if you had a son there is no guarantee that prince mohammed would be the next caliph of cinnebar nilak said craftily that is just the kind of thing i fear rhonwyn scolded the older woman prince mohammed is his fathers heir he must remain so for the safety and best interests of cinnebar nilak now i must go and see baba haroun she hurried from her apartments the chief eunuch sat awaiting her drawing upon his water pipe he was alone sit noor he gestured to a pile of colorful cushions across the tiled table how may i be of service to you it must be something very serious for you have never before sought me out his fine dark eyes viewed her curiously though i should never say this aloud to anyone else baba haroun i believe you always put your mistresss best interests above all she paused a moment then continuedeven the caliph he nodded silently a small smile upon his lips go on he said so low she could scarcely hear him i do not want to give the caliph a child do not believe you want me to yet how long may we continue to deceive my lord rashid or the lady alia and if i am forced to have a child and it is a son why even my serving woman nilak suggests that such a child could supplant prince mohammed in both his fathers heart and the succession it would seem i am about to become a great difficulty but what if i could solve this conundrum before it becomes a problem how he asked her rather intrigued by her astute grasp of the situation if i were no longer here the matter of another son would no longer be an issue would it rhonwyn said softly you are suggesting that i allow you to escape from cinnebar the chief eunuch said it was not a question yes she replied quietly and just how could such a thing be accomplished without the caliphs knowledge or my destruction noor baba haroun asked wryly first you must swear to me that you will not kill him rhonwyn said if thought was responsible for his death i could not live myself who the chief eunuch demanded suddenly very interested my younger brother rhonwyn told him but how baba haroun began first your promise you are a man of your word i know baba haroun ive me your promise and i will explain rhonwyn told him the chief eunuch considered a long moment then he said you have my promise noor i shall not kill your brother now please explain to me what it is you are talking about the young minstrel who entertained in the great hall of the palace several evenings ago is my brother glynn ap llywelyn he has been seeking me he began his entertainment by singing in our native tongue and asking if his sister were here i answered as you know it was not a song he sang but rather we communicated briefly using our native tongue and the music he remains in cinnebar awaiting my instructions astounding baba haroun said amazed he had never in all his years heard of such a coincidence if rashid is allowed to dwell too long on this child he desires of me rhonwyn said softly his heart will be broken doubly that must not happen baba haroun the caliph is a good man i do not want to harm him but i do not love him as alia does and i want to go home surely my brothers finding me is a portent he did not come on crusade with us i left him at the abbey school in shrewsbury in england near our home he was but a child now suddenly he is a man he has sought me out and found me is this not fate speaking the chief eunuch nodded thoughtfully he was a man who believed in signs and marvels how would you proceed noor if i were to agree to help you he asked the caliph will not simply release me rhonwyn said and her companion nodded again in agreement i must therefore appear to have died he will mourn me i know but eventually he will forget me not easily baba haroun admitted i know him well and he does not give his heart lightly but i believe i have a way to distract him from your loss prince mohammeds two harem damsels are kept sterile but that can be changed if one of them should conceive and the caliph were to be able to look forward to being a grandfather then he should have something to rejoice in rather than dwell upon his mourning it could even be said allah was replacing his love for you with another love now because i can see you have been thinking on it how will you die i shall accidentally fall from a cliff at the edge of my garden in the night rhonwyn said if bones and hanks of my hair were found there it would be assumed i fell and that the wild dogs had devoured me the hair will assure that the caliph believes in my death for you know how he loves my hair and its unusual color in reality however i shall smuggle you from the palace baba haroun said taking up the thread of her thought that i can do noor and easily it must all be done in a single night and you my clever beauty will be disguised as a boy your party will join a caravan headed for the coast and in just a few days you will be able to seek out a vessel bound for your native land then you will help me rhonwyn said excitedly i will help you baba haroun replied but i do so only to safeguard the happiness of my beloved mistress she does the noble thing in saying the caliph must have his way in order to be happy she has been raised to think of her lord first but you noor were raised to think of yourself first i contemplated the possibility of seeing you contract some disease sicken and die before you might give the caliph a child if my mistress cannot or will not protect herself and her son then i must it is my duty however i hold no malice against you you have been respectful and loving of my lady alia i will therefore aid you noor thank you baba haroun rhonwyn said her heart hammering against her ribs as she spoke that he would have stooped to her murder truly frightened her return now to your quarters noor i will contact your brother and we will make all the necessary arrangements you will be told when the time is come you are pale noor but you need have no fear of me you yourself have solved the problem we had and i will not betray you for the love we both bear the lady alia he smiled a quite kindly smile at rhonwyn go she got to her feet remembering to bow to this powerful man then she hurried from his quarters not quite certain whether she should rejoice or not she could not know until the moment came if she would really be free or if he would betray her living in the harem had taught her one thing and that was that you could trust no one completely still she knew she had not made an enemy of baba haroun surely he would keep his word what did he say nilak demanded as rhonwyn reentered her apartments i will wager he is in no hurry for you to bear the caliph a child he is loyal first to lady alia she made a disapproving face of course he is rhonwyn said and that is as it should be he has been with her since her childhood in her fathers house i am not certain in my own mind that i am ready to become a mother yet if you wait much longer you shall see gray in that gilt hair of yours nilak scolded and two other serving women giggled you are past eighteen my lady noor and not getting any younger if our lord rashid wants a child of you then you must give him a child it is your duty be silent rhonwyn suddenly snapped you overstep your bounds nilak my entire life i have done my duty and never once shirked if it is allahs will that i give the caliph a child then i shall now leave me all of you i would be alone with my thoughts the three serving women withdrew and rhonwyn walked out into her small garden the little fountain with its splashing water was soothing to her and she very much needed to calm herself after her meeting with baba haroun the heady scent of the damascus roses touched her nostrils lulling her into a more placid frame of mind she walked slowly down the crushed marble path to the carved stone bench that overlooked the mountains her vista faced west she knew for each evening she watched the sun set behind those forbidding dark peaks once with nilak and halah holding on to her tightly she had gone to the edge of her garden and peered down there had been nothing below but rocks and a graygreen scrub growth she had gotten dizzy and her servants had hauled her back anyone falling from this height would surely be killed nilak tells me you have spoken to baba haroun about having a child rashid al ahmet sat down beside his second wife nilak takes much upon herself rhonwyn replied irritated she but wants your happiness he said taking her hand in his and kissing her fingers one by one i am happy rhonwyn said she does not understand that being with you is my happiness rashid why do you want a child of me you have children so it cannot be your vanity for you could satisfy that urge on any of your women whenever it pleased you i want a child of you because i love you he said quietly and drawing her into his arms he began to kiss her passionately i love you noor i want our love to be complete and only a child can give us that completion do you understand ah yes i believe that you do he kissed the tears slipping from behind her closed eyelids you make me ashamed for being so selfish rhonwyn said honestly and he did she thought sadly he did love her but she did not love him not while edward de beaulieu still lingered in her memory he stroked her hair tenderly and then his hand slipped within the opening of her kaftan and he cupped one of her breasts in his palm he fondled her his thumb rubbing her nipple into a sharp point she murmured softly and reaching down he drew the kaftan up and off her body rendering her naked for his pleasure pulling her into his lap he bent her backward slightly his mouth closing over the sensitive peak he suckled hungrily on it rhonwyn whimpered as her deep arousal began he would not cease she knew until she had satisfied him and he her her hands reached out to caress him he nursed upon both her breasts until they were actually sore then his mouth moved across her torso and it was as if his lips were lire upon her skin when he kissed her hard upon her smooth venus mons a bolt of lightning seemed to penetrate her body and she shuddered his pointed tongue ran along the shadowed slash dividing her nether lips it teased her down and up and down again he lay her upon the stone bench and kneeling before her used his two thumbs to open her to his view you are like a pink shell from the sea he told her your little jewel is perfectly formed it but waits for my touch my beautiful my exquisite wife the point of his tongue touched her and rhonwyn gasped as a sensation more acute than any she had ever before felt slammed into her rashid she could say no more the wonder of his passion was too intense for her each day it seemed to increase he laughed as her love juices pearled upon her coral flesh can i not teach you patience my love he gently scolded her then opening his robes he revealed his engorged manhood and straddling the bench he lowered himself upon her he thrust deep smiling as she gasped aloud with his fierce entry then gathering her into his arms he murmured as he raised them both up into a seated position wrap your limbs about me noor as i stand then he arose and walked carrying her into her bedchamber where he pressed her up against a wall and began to move upon her rhonwyns eyes widened with surprise and he laughed here is something new for you he teased her as she clung to him her arms tight about his neck it is interesting she managed to say but i want you atop me my lord i want to feel your weight upon me please he laughed again how you have changed my precious one he told her but he complied moving to her bed and falling with her upon it yes she cried out yes oh that is good my lord do not cease this pleasure i beg you do not cease her legs still wrapped about him she tightened the muscles of her love channel around his plunging lance and smiled wickedly into his eyes when he groaned do i please you my rashid she demanded her nails dug into his shoulders alia swears you liked this she tightened herself again i do he groaned oh my love i do then she forced his passion from him and his love juices filled her as rhonwyn sighed her own deep pleasure once edward had told her that a shared passion was a better passion and it was she wondered how much greater her pleasure would be if she loved this man called rashid al ahmet who now lay upon her breasts gasping with his own exertions absently she stroked his dark head wondering as she did how long it would be before she could escape cinnebar and return to her husband edward de beaulieu to show him that her fears were gone and that she could love him completely and freely for that they owed the caliph of cinnebar a great debt but she suspected that she could not dwell too greatly upon that fact she was eager to learn the plans for her escape but baba haroun said nothing and some weeks went by before he finally called her into his private chamber rhonwyn went her heart hammering not knowing if he meant to kill her or give her her freedom her beautiful face however showed no hint of her fears you sent for me she said bowing politely to him the plan is completed he replied without any preamble she raised a questioning eyebrow tonight he said low your women will be given a bit of poppy in their mint tea to assure their deep slumber i will come for you myself noor the shattered bones are ready to place along with the kaftan in which your women see you last it will be shredded and scattered along with your unique hair it will be enough to convince all that you have fallen and perished how will you place all of the debris she questioned him he smiled enigmatically you cannot see it from your terrace of course but there is a small door just below it such entries are common in this palace they were placed there as a means of escape when the palace was built lew know where they are located not even the caliph but i do i will personally place these items on the rocks below before i aid you in your flight noor now no more questions if nilak queries you tell her we have decided the time is propitious for you to have a child the caliph wishes it and the lady alia wishes it then later i shall speak to her myself regarding the matter what if the caliph wants to visit my bed tonight rhonwyn said he will not baba haroun said with assurance how can you be certain she demanded the chief eunuch chuckled because he will be tasting the charms of a redhaired virgin from the basque region i recently purchased for him in the marketplace for just this occasion the caliph has a particular weakness for virgins her initiation into the amatory arts will keep him busy the entire night surely you understand his appetites for passion by now noor indeed rhonwyn said he claimed love for her yet he could be tempted by a virgin she thought irritably go now baba haroun said will come for you when the time is at hand my brother will be waiting along with those two rather disreputable fellows he travels with oth and dewi i believe they are called baba haroun said they are not disreputable she said softly they are the kindest and best of men baba haroun they helped to raise me so they told me and in the most execrable arabic i have ever heard spoken aloud baba haroun said dryly they love you even as i love my mistress noor that more than anything else convinced me that i was doing the right thing in helping you to escape cinnebar she caught up his two large brown hands and kissed them thank you thank you baba haroun he was startled by her generous gratitude he drew his hands from her light grip you know why i aid you noor and yet in doing so i must betray my master i do it gladly for the lady alia but i will bear the guilt all my days rashid al ahmet truly loves you your death will pain him greatly i do not know if i shall ever be able to compensate him for your loss but i will try do you censure me then baba haroun for my desire to leave cinnebar rhonwyn asked him you cannot help yourself noor in your heart you hold a memory of love for edward de beaulieu all my masters love cannot hope to overcome that other love so i will help you to go this night there was nothing left to say rhonwyn knew and so she bowed again to the chief eunuch his words made her feel sad and yet she could not change how she felt she hurried from baba haroun s private chamber swallowing back her excitement as she did she must not be stopped now not when her freedom was so close part iii rhonwyn chapter rhonwyn looked down upon nilak the older woman slept hard snoring softly in her drugged slumber reaching out rhonwyn gently touched the womans head in tender farewell nilak had been so good to her dont put her to minding the children she said softly to baba haroun she hated it i shall place her in the household of prince mohammeds favorite the girl is sweet natured but has no older woman to properly guide her nilak should do quite admirably he concluded wryly come now we havent much time my lady noor the evidence of your demise has already been placed below your terrace i am grieved you had to cut your hair but it will grow back he led her from her quarters through the dimly lit corridors of the palace to her surprise they passed no one not even the guards i want sir fulk rhonwyn said suddenly he will surely expose the life you have lived here the chief eunuch said even so i cannot in good conscience leave him behind she replied besides i intend to tell my husband everything he will either not believe you or spurn you noor but as your heart is good i anticipated your request the knight awaits you with your brother and his two men how are we to leave cinnebar she asked you are joining a caravan headed for the coast baba haroun told her you will be at carthage in a week from there you are on your own but you will manage quite well i suspect he stopped suddenly and began counting the tiles upon the wall then he pressed against one and a door sprang open in the wall the passage is straight baba haroun said it is just a few feet come i must light your way he disappeared into the dark passage and she followed starting as the door closed behind her within a minute or two however another door opened ahead of her she could see several dark figures she hesitated and then she heard glynns voice rhonwyn hurry she turned to face the chief eunuch thank you she said simply and then moved past him to join the others go with allah she heard him say and then the door closed again behind her come on glynn said he took her hand and they hurried off where are we she demanded of him a back alley outside the palace walls he said low now be silent sister else the guards on the heights hear us where are we going she whispered to our lodging to complete your disguise he told her and then she was quiet they finally reached a small house entering it quickly so as not to be seen by any in the street rhonwyn flung off her cloak and hugged her brother first then oth and dewi she turned to sir fulk who appeared to be in remarkably good health you were not mistreated she queried him nay my lady i was set to instructing the young prince in the arts of war i am treated very well i have even learned enough of their tonguetwisting language to get by quite nicely i am grateful for your help but i dont want to come with you what rhonwyn was very surprised why on earth not fulk in cinnebar my lady i hold a position of importance as the heirs military instructor i am a younger son and can never hope to attain such worth or influence in england as i have here the caliphs son likes me and i like him we are not so far apart in age i am his senior by only six years i believe i shall have greater chance for advancement here in cinnebar than if i go home to england my parents are both dead and i have but two elder brothers there is no lass who waits for me i came with you tonight because baba haroun said you would not believe him if he told you these things he did try to dissuade you from taking me didnt he but you he said would insist he likes your sense of duty and loyalty but how will you get back into the palace fulk you are a slave as i was rhonwyn said in a worried tone the young prince freed me months ago fulk explained he said a slave should not be teaching him the things he needed to know i can come and go in and out of the palace with impunity my lady what am i to tell your brothers rhonwyn asked him that i died bravely defending you my lady fulk said with a small smile the truth we both know would but bring them shame that a brother who went so nobly off on crusade to free the holy land from the infidel but then joined the infidel would be more than they could bear or understand but i must do what is best for me here in cinnebar i can practice my own faith without fear of reprisal which is more than any jew or man of islam can do in england i wish you godspeed my lady the young knight bowed to her as he kissed her hand then he turned and departed the chamber at least my conscience is clear said rhonwyn slowly she turned to her brother where is edward i saw him last in acre glynn responded but there is something i must tell you rhonwyn edward truly believes you are dead he is preparing to marry his cousin katherine de beaulieu when he returns to england then we must get to acre quickly she replied nay glynn said we must return to england so that you will be at haven awaiting your husband when he returns the lady katherine is a sweet woman but her brother rafe is a hard man they must be dispossessed and returned to their own manor you are perfectly capable of husbanding haven until edward returns to england and just how am i to force rafe to give up his hold on haven she demanded of her brother our tad will aid you if you ask him sister this is no time to be overproud rhonwyn glynn said bluntly better we go to acre so edward sees me and does not believe it is a hoax played upon him rhonwyn said nay for once sister do what is asked of you and do not be willful this is what has gotten you into difficulties all along doing what you wanted instead of what was right and expected of you edward is angry that you dashed into a battle he is angry that you were captured and lost him one of his knights he will believe nothing of you but the absolute truth but i fear his angerwhen he learns you have known another man it will take every bit of your strength and knowledge to convince him that he should not disown you glynn told her earnestly i love him rhonwyn said as if her love could solve the problem i know he loves me but having heard what her brother reported she was now not so certain of her husbands love how could he have given her up for lost so easily and made plans to marry katherine de beaulieu she was confused as to what to do and then oth spoke up better you be at home awaiting him like the wife he wants you to be than suddenly appearing before him in acre lady are you certain it would not be better for us to go to acre glynn glynn nodded his dark head we must go to england as quickly as we can sister he told her firmly now you need to get ready to travel our caravan leaves at first light there on the shelf is a bowl a rag and two pitchers the large pitcher contains a dye for your skin you must cover your entire body with it our hosts daughter will do your back for you but you will dye your hair black with the contents of the smaller pitcher your clothing is laid out on the chair pantaloons a shirt a vest and boots you already have your cloak be careful with it and do not lose it baba haroun has sewn a cache of gold coins in a secret pocket for you why must i be totally dyed she demanded sniffing at the pitcher the stuff smells foul it wont once its on you are too fair rhonwyn you have not the look of a young man used to the outdoors and you must if your pant leg rode up and your white skin were seen or if you squatted to pee and your bare white bottom were visible it would give the game away i know it must be difficult taking orders from your little brother but please for all our sakes do it dye your hair first so the girl who helps you afterward does not know your hairs true color it is for her safety glynn concluded they left her rhonwyn sighed she had cut her hair so that it now bobbed at the level of her chin hopefully it would grow quickly and by the time edward returned home it would be a respectable length once again rhonwyn stripped naked and finding the pitcher of black dye behind the larger pitcher she poured it into the basin mixing it with a tiny bit of water and then dipped her head her fingers moving rapidly through her scalp to completely cover her tresses she then rinsed her hair with clear water and hoped the transformation was complete for she had no glass or metal mirror in which to check her efforts she quickly began rubbing the brownish dye from the larger pitcher into her skin when only her shoulders and back remained white she called out and almost immediately a young girl entered the chamber here lady let me finish the task you have begun so well she took the rag and began smoothing the dye down rhonwyns back and across her shoulders it took a moment to sink in but rhonwyn suddenly realized that the girl was speaking in the norman tongue it had been many months since she had heard it and she wondered if she could still speak it herself she and fulk had spoken together in arabic and her brother and oth had spoken in the language of the welsh the words however came easily when she tried you speak the tongue of the franks she said my fatherthis is his house in which you are now standingis a merchant i am his only child and help him in his business sometimes i even travel to carthage i speak several languages you speak well rhonwyn noted and then said nothing more when the dye covered her skin completely and had dried she dressed the merchants daughter had departed the chamber with all the evidence of rhonwyns disguise she was pulling on her boots when her brother entered and looked her over with a critical eye youve bound up your breasts he asked she nodded and stood up for his final inspection have you found the secret pocket in your cape he asked her there are actually two she told him and both are well hidden and well filled will keep my cape with me at all times good now here is our story i am the minstrel and entertainer you are my brother and one of my musicians along with oth and dewi what instrument do i play she teased him the tambourine he said seriously that way if we must perform you cannot make any error any fool can play the tambourine thank you rhonwyn said dryly we are ready to go he told her you have become so serious glynn she said to him we are not yet out of cinnebar sister i will not rest until our feet are once again on good christian soil nor should you he explained i am angry that edward de beaulieu gave you up so easily he looked for you for only several days before following prince edward to acre i told him you were alive i felt it but none of them would listen to me rhonwyn now it is my duty to return you to haven castle and to your husband i will do what that fine knight of yours could not i will bring you home her eyes filled with tears you are a man she said softly aye he agreed now sister let us go do you know what today is it is the eve of christs mass with luck i shall have us home by midsummers eve possibly before come now they traveled by caravan to the coast taking a ship from tunis to the port of cagliari on the island of sardinia after several weeks in sardinia they found a vessel that was sailing for aiguesmortes in the kingdom of languedoc as it was winter the seas farther north were not safe and so they decided to travel overland to calais crossing over into england from there they purchased horses in aiguesmortes the beasts were serviceable but not so fine that they would be stolen by any except the most desperate glynn also purchased a sword for his sister and a dagger as well their arabic garb was bartered for the more conventional clothing of the region rhonwyn exchanged her pantaloons and vest for chausses and a tunic that came to her calf she retained her sherte her cloak and her boots the roads were never really safe and so they traveled with various trains paying their way with their songs it took many weeks to reach the french coast in the month of may however they finally arrived at calais there was no difficulty in obtaining passage aboard a vessel crossing the channel selling their horses they paid their passage reaching dover on the following day there they once again purchased mounts for their journey north and west across england to haven castle traveling still in their guise as musicians in worcester rhonwyn sent her brother into the market to see if he could find a fine gown even he understood that she could not arrive at haven with her skin brown and in chausses the dye had long since worn off her hair and her tresses were growing having reached her shoulders once again the walnut juice that had stained her skin had faded during their weeks on the road but rhonwyns skin still had a sallow look about it the night before they reached haven they stopped to camp by a stream and rhonwyn bathed for the first time in weeks scrubbing her skin with a rag and a small piece of soap she had had glynn purchase along with the gown while she was aware hot water would have done a better job rhonwyn was satisfied with the results besides tomorrow at haven she would have her hot bath in the morning she dressed herself in her gown of deep blue velvet and the overgown of a lighter blue silk with open side lacing and a center split there was a twisted blue silk rope girdle about her waist and she wore a simple white veil with a small circlet that matched her girdle before they even came in sight of haven glynn stopped their progress saying i leave you here sister oth and dewi will escort you home why will you not come she asked him because rafe de beaulieu does not know my true identity rhonwyn i told him i was going to france to contemplate the priesthood when i left the abbey school in shrewsbury i can hardly appear with you in tow and easily explain it away oth and dewi will go with you they will say your father sent them to see if they could find you and they did where you have been is not anyones business but edwards answer no questions from any others where are you going rhonwyn asked her brother nowhere i will be here and oth and dewi will keep me informed as to what is going on at haven there is a cave in the hillside in the woods that will shelter me they know the way go now and reclaim haven for yourself and your husband if you need our tads aid in ousting rafe de beaulieu sister i will ask him myself the guards at the portcullis gaped with surprise as rhonwyn rode through and into the courtyard of the castle with her escort she dismounted and the first person she saw was father john he paled and crossed himself be you a ghost lady he quavered nay it is i rhonwyn and i have at last come home she answered him god have mercy on us all the priest said lady you must come with me for i have much to tell you in time good father in time rhonwyn said i want to go into the hall she hurried into the castle the priest running after her in despair as she entered the hall she saw enit and called to her looking up and seeing the mistress she believed dead enit screamed and fainted as the other servants familiar to rhonwyn gasped with shock what is the matter with them rhonwyn said turning to the priest surely you know they all thought you dead the lord sent a message to me and to his cousin when you disappeared when he returned home from the holy land alone we believed it a truth my lady edward is here at haven when is he in our apartments rhonwyn ran from the hall and up the winding staircase the priest running after her once again lady lady wait there is something you must know his tone was so desperate that rhonwyn stopped and turned to him what must i know she said lord edward is married father john told her i know he is my husband rhonwyn said nay lady he is lady katherines husband the priest replied how can he be wed to katherine when he is wed to me she demanded angrily her heart was hammering furiously you were believed dead my lady rhonwyn the priest led her back into the hall he hardly mourned me did he she said bitterly you could not be found there was no trace of you at all what else could he think everyone said you were dead he finally joined the prince at acre but he had never really recovered from his illness prince edward sent the lord home last summer at the lords request both the church and the courts declared you dead leaving edward de beaulieu free to remarry which he did last september he is not a boy my lady he needed a wife to give him an heir father i am told we have a visitor katherine de beaulieu came into the hall indeed lady rhonwyn said turning to face her rival then she gasped with complete shock katherines belly was so distended that it was more than obvious she was with child a child that would be shortly born rhonwyns hand went to her mouth to stifle her cry of pain oh god katherine whispered her own hand going protectively to her belly they said you were dead perhaps it were better that i was rhonwyn replied harshly at that moment both edward and rafe de beaulieu ran into the hall edward rushed to katherines side his arm going about her protectively his eyes blazed angrily you bastard rhonwyn shouted at him so vixen you have returned have you well you are not welcome here lady get you gone he said coldly hospitality was gentler here in my day rhonwyn said dryly it touches me edward to see how deeply and truly you mourned my alleged death iid yon ever love me at all or was it simply the treaty between my lather and your king i shall go to the king edward for you have wronged me terribly by your actions i disappeared but there was no proof of my death was i to wait forever lady you were gone and no trace of you or fulk could be found no ransom was asked what could any of us think was i to mourn you for the rest of my days he demanded you did not mourn me at all she cried you wrote to your cousin asking for katherines hand within a month of my disappearance then you hurried home afterward to undoubtedly have both church and state declare me dead it is the only way you could take another wife oh edward i loved you and you betrayed me you do not know the meaning of love you coldhearted bitch he declared and now that you have magically reappeared in our midst just where were you all these months in the harem of the caliph of cinnebar rhonwyn said with devastating effect rashid al ahmet made me his second wife and he loved me but i could not love him for i kept a memory of our love within my heart how tragic that that love was nought but a deception on your part in our months of separation i hoped i dreamed i prayed that i might be able to return to you the very thought of you is what kept me alive then my brother came and i was able to escape i have ached to return to haven and to you edward de beaulieu tis a fine homecoming you have given me whore he hissed furiously at her you shared another mans bed and you dare to tell me rhonwyn shook her head sadly at him but her sorrow was for him she was not defeated by this turn of events poor edward she said pityingly did this caliph find your cold heart and resistant body a pleasure or did he actually wring a cry of passion from you edward said rancorously he taught me the true meaning of passion she said quietly and aye he wrung many a cry of pleasure from me edward he sought to learn the reason i felt such fear of being in a mans arms and finding it he freed me from my fears i came home to share with you all he taught me now instead i find myself homeless and husbandless i must decide what i am to do how dare you who have lain with others criticize me your actions have shamed us both but more important when my father learns of this turn of events he will be greatly offended edward your poor king will have to make amends to ap gruffydd for what you have done i have learned in my travels since i arrived in england that the king is not well at all they say he will die before christs mass but i shall have my justice of you before then i promise you then rhonwyn turned to katherine you may have him lady i think you perhaps better suited to edward de beaulieu than i ever was i would not harm you or the child you carry both my brother and i are more than well aware of the stigma of bastardy it is there even for a princes children where will you go katherine asked rhonwyn thought a moment and then said i do not know then you will remain here at haven until you do know katherine said generously and turning to her outraged husband she told him the house is mine to direct as i will whatever anger you may feel toward the lady rhonwyn you cannot throw her out into the cold after her long journey she must shelter here for the time being that is my wish as you please dearling he answered her then looking at rhonwyn he said where is glynn where you cannot harm him my lord did i ever contemplate such a thing he demanded outraged you were my husband then and i trusted you you are no longer my husband and i do not trust you she said icily then she said to katherine in a more kindly tone lady i thank you for your generous offer but i think it best i leave this place she bowed to them all and with oth and dewi in her wake she left the great hall rale de beaulieu watched her go his silvery blue eyes narrowed and contemplative she had been a beautiful girl but she was a far more beautiful woman he thought and clever to have realized that his sister was a better wile to edward than she could have been her instincts intrigued him as did her talk of passions unleashed he wondered where she would go now and just what she meant when she said that she would have justice of his cousin strangely he believed her when she said she meant katherine and her unborn child no harm but what was to happen to rhonwyn uerch llywelyn she departed haven castle her head high but her sight was blurred by the tears that filled her eyes he had not really loved her the shock of that knowledge burned into her heart and soul how could she have been so damned naive she would have been better off with the caliph but that door was tightly closed to her now she could not go back to cinnebar no more than she could come back to haven where are we going she finally asked her companions to your brother lady then we will decide upon how to kill edward de beaulieu oth said grimly you cannot kill him she said quietly surely you do not still love him oth said angrily nay i do not love him but you cannot kill him they would blame me i have had enough shocks today to last my lifetime oth i mean to go to king henry to complain of edwards treatment of me certainly the king will compensate me for what has happened then too i must be declared alive once more in the courts glynn as she had suspected was outraged by what had happened at haven he was ready to storm the castle himself and slay edward de beaulieu but rhonwyn dissuaded him as she had oth and dewi he must be made to pay somehow glynn said irately yes but how rhonwyn asked i am taking you to mercy abbey glynn said suddenly i am not of a mind to join a religious order his sister replied do you assume my life is over because my husband has disowned me little brother it is not i assure you im taking you to mercy because our aunt will certainly know how you may proceed our upbringing at cythraul did not prepare us for such deceit sister you surely have an honest grievance against edward de beaulieu and must be compensated by him i am a poet and a dreamer i do not know how to advance your cause but she will how can you be certain of that you never met her rhonwyn said to him the abbess gwynllian is well known in religious circles for her intellect and cleverness sister her fame extends even as far as shrewsbury it will take us several days to reach her house so we must begin now rhonwyn where else can you go to lick your wounds in safety and consider what you are to do next certainly not to our tad let us ride his sister replied tersely they rode hard resting the horses between dusk and dawn eating oatcakes and wild berries drinking from the streams of water that dotted the countryside they came to mercy abbey in late afternoon the cluster of stone buildings did not this time seem quite so forbidding as they had when she first saw it again the church bell was pealing for the office of none entering through the abbey gates they waited for their aunt to emerge from the church gwynllian had never met glynn but she recognized him immediately seeing rhonwyn by his side she said praise god youre alive what has happened why are you here unannounced her eyes mirrored her deep concern come into the chapter house and we will talk her glance flicked to oth and dewi you know where to put the horses she told them then go to the kitchens and they will feed you come she said turning back to her niece and her nephew she led them into her privy chamber and poured them each a small cup of wine she motioned them to seats as she took her own now she said why have you come to me does your father know you are here and alive and will it cause an incident with the english she demanded of them it is a long story rhonwyn began then she told her aunt of what had happened in the several years since they had last seen one another i did not know where else to go she finished i am too fine a lady now to live at cythraul aunt aye you are the abbess agreed what am i to do rhonwyn said edward de beaulieu has treated our family with great disdain surely he can be made to pay for that insult but i have no idea where to begin do you want him dead her aunt queried rhownyn shook her head that would be too easy she replied the lady katherine i hold blameless in the matter she is meek and was subject to her brothers will do you want him dead gwynllian asked half jesting rhonwyn actually laughed aloud nay i do not like rafe de beaulieu particularly for he is arrogant and obviously has a lofty opinion of himself however he loves his sister and did what he believed was best for her even as my own brother glynn did when he sought me out in cinnebar restoring you to life legally will not be difficult the abbess said thoughtfully your existence cannot be denied it is plain fact her long elegant fingers drummed lightly upon the long table before her as to the rest i must speak to the bishop at hereford edward de beaulieu discarded you without any real proof of your demise and quite hastily contracted another marriage without a decent period of mourning but your induction into an infidels harem as his second wife will surely stand against you rhonwyn you were a christian knights wife and yet you yielded to the lustful blandishments of another man there are many who will think you should have died rather than succumb then they are ignorant of the harem rhonwyn replied spiritedly i had not even a knife to cut my food i was constantly watched there was absolutely no way i might have ended my life even if i had wanted to do so but all i wanted was to escape and return to my husband not knowing that he had already betrayed me that attitude will assuredly gain you a certain amount of sympathy the abbess noted but it will not completely exonerate you i was faithful in my heart to edward de beaulieu he was not so faithful to me rhonwyn replied stonily her aunt smiled stoke the fires of your outrage my child and we shall gain some justice for you are you sure you wish to pursue this path i must else my honor and the honor of our family be compromised she said ap gruffydd is a proud man and this reflects upon him badly unless we can obtain some compensation for the slight upon our escutcheon aunt i am forced to agree with you my child the abbess said she turned to glynn have you nothing to say in this matter ap gruffydds son by the rood how much you look like your father in his youth at first glynn said i thought to slay de beaulieu but my sister dissuaded me she does not wish me to have a stain such as that upon my conscience especially as i intend to return to the abbey at shrewsbury and eventually take holy orders so you would become a monk glynn ap llywelyn the abbess said quietly how interesting that her brothers son leaned toward the church and not toward a kingdom of his own i have seen the world aunt and while i find it interesting i am not meant for such a life soon my music and my poetry shall be in praise of god alone the peace of the contemplative life is what i seek i prefer its discipline and order to the hurlyburly of the world at large does your lather know of your decision nephew her fine brown eyes scanned his face he will although i know he considered this would be my path long ago when he came to fetch rhonwyn tomorrow i will send oth and dewi to find him so he may be made aware of what has happened to my poor sister rhonwyn hit him a blow upon the arm that staggered glynn ouch he yelped i am not to be pitied brat she snapped at him it is my honor that has been besmirched but make no mistake glynn i need no man to make my life complete i never did and i certainly dont need your pity there are but two paths for a respectable woman glynn said either she enters into marriage or she enters a convent i am no longer respectable it would seem rhonwyn mocked him laughing therefore i may do what i please and plot my own course through life brother i am considering becoming a merchant and using the gold baba haroun so generously sewed into my cloak to set up a shop in shrewsbury i shall import silks and spices from the east and grow richer with each passing year i shall take young men for lovers and when i send them away because they have begun to bore me they shall go grieving but wiser for their time with me the abbess burst out laughing although her nephew looked shocked thank god and his blessed mother rhonwyn uerch llywelyn that you have not been broken by this experience she said my heart is broken aunt but only a little and it will heal i suspect i returned because i believed in my heart that edward loved me and would forgive my small sins i wanted to share all that the caliph taught me about passion and make up to my husband for the early months of our marriage when passion frightened me so greatly i could scarcely bear for him to touch me the loss is his i fear and he will never know the woman i truly am rhonwyn said softly i am very sorry for that the abbess nodded it would appear my child that you have more honor than edward de beaulieu for that you may be proud ap gruffydd appeared at mercy abbey five days later prepared to berate his daughter for leaving her marriage when however he heard the truth he erupted into a fit of rage rhonwyn to her own surprise calmed him at long last i am no longer unhappy over this but our familys honor must be assuaged my lord she told him are we back to my lord then he demanded tad she said with a small smile mollifying him ill have another husband for you from king henry else our treaty be broken for good and all ap gruffydd said and have you kept so assiduously to that treaty tad she gently taunted him he laughed aloud ive had little part in your life rhonwyn and yet you know me better than some of my closest associates why is that i wonder because i am like you tad i am proud and have always followed my own path and devil take the hindmost it seems to have gotten me into almost as much trouble as it has gotten you she smiled sweetly at him i think however that i may have learned my lesson both llywelyn ap gruffydd and his sister gwynllian burst into laughter rhonwyns assessment of the situation was absolutely correct finally the prince said there is much of your aunt in you too lass praise god and his blessed mother the abbess responded fervently and she crossed herself the prince grew serious once again king henry has not been well these past few years he will certainly be at his palace of westminster in london i will send him a letter rhonwyn explaining that you are alive and returned home to discover yourself declared dead and your husband with a new wife i will tell the english king that you do not desire to have edward de beaulieu back as his new wife is with child besides the betrayal and insult to you and your family make such a reunion impossible i will ask for justice for my daughter and tell him that you will come to westminster by lammastide to seek redress from the de beaulieus there is no viciousness in henry plantagenet but beware his queen eleanor of provence who is called behind her back the noble termagant she is and always has been ambitious for her family and she will destroy without hesitation anyone that she believes a threat to them your dower portion of course must be returned to you i cannot be expected to redower you for a new husband i dont want a husband rhonwyn said nonetheless you must have one her father said firmly we will not argue this point now lass he looked hard at her how is it possible that you have become more beautiful despite your adventures rhonwyn laughed you will not turn the subject that easily tad i want no husband then it is the convent daughter how old are you now nineteen this april first past she reminded him well be lucky to find you a husband at your age a widow with children is at least a proven breeder the prince noted do you want to enter your aunts house lass nay rhonwyn said then another marriage is your only path ap gruffydd said rhonwyn did not argue with him any further she was a realist the church would not accept her for she would be considered a woman of ill reputea disobedient wife who had run off to interfere in mens business and had been punished for it and what man of good family would have for his wife such a woman a woman who had given her body to an infidel she wanted her dower back and perhaps a bit of havens land for herself that she would consider recompense for edward de beaulieus behavior why argue with her father over something that would never be there would be no more husbands for rhonwyn uerch llywelyn chapter eleanor of provence queen of england had lived five and a half decades she was still a beautiful woman with silverstreaked auburn hair and amber eyes that missed little in her youth she and her equally comely sisters had been considered the most beautilul women in europe her eldest sister margaret had married king louis ix of france her younger sister sanchia was married to her brotherinlaw richard of cornwall king of the romans her youngest sister beatrice was the wife of charles of anjou the king of naples and sicily eleanors mother beatrice of savoy and her father raymond berenger v count of provence had reigned over a brilliant court renowned for its patronage of the troubadours the count himself was one of the last of the great provençal poets at the age of nineteen eleanor had traveled to her sisters court in france and from there across a winter sea to marry king henry iii of england from the moment the couple laid eyes upon one another it had been a love match the queen had borne her husband six sons and three daughters two sons and two daughters had reached adulthood while there were some who resented her savoyard kinsmenwho along with the kings french half brothers had come to england to seek their fortunesthe queens chief care was for her family now her husband was slowly dying she nursed him devotedly their kingdom was prosperous and secure england was not involved in any wars their life was peaceful and then there came from that rebellious welsh prince a letter that the queen knew was going to cause difficulties she sat with the king in their dayroom about them her ladies sat tending to various small tasks their sewing and mending the repair of a small tapestry the queens eyes scanned the letter and she swore ever so softly beneath her breath this caught the attention of her husband who lay upon his daybed resting from the exertions of his morning bowel movement what is it the king asked his wife weakly do you remember last year when edward de beaulieu returned home from acre his wife was alleged to have died and he requested that she be declared dead so he might remarry the king nodded well she isnt dead the prince of the welshs daughter appeared home this spring to find her husband no longer her husband and his new wife full with a child ap gruffydd is outraged that his daughter has been so insulted the prince requests justice for his child but says she will not have de beaulieu back now for she would not put the stain of bastardy upon his newborn son now isnt this a nice kettle of fish henry rhonwyn uerch llywelyn will come to westminster at lammastide for your justice what are we to do what does ap gruffydd want the king asked cannily his daughters dower back from de beaulieu a new husband for the girl and a penalty levied upon de beaulieu for the affront the welsh prince suggests that some of haven castles lands be given to his daughter to recompense her for the insult the queen replied it seems fair the king said slowly there is more to this than meets the eye henry the queen told him astutely for one thing what happened to the lady rhonwyn that she became separated from her husband and our sons forces we must send to haven edward de beaulieu should be allowed to speak for himself in this matter even if he believed his wife dead he did remarry again in a rather hasty manner agreed the king said according to the welsh prince his daughter was declared dead that oversight can be rectified immediately but the rest will have to wait until we can hear a fuller story from both sides in this dispute again the king nodded his agreement his wife took a cool cloth and wiped his forehead which was beaded with perspiration henry grew weaker each day and every small task he must perform was difficult for him now she had recently heard from their son edward he had only narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in acre and he was discouraged the crusade had literally fallen into disarray mounting an expedition to retake jerusalem was proving impossible he was edward wrote planning to return home with his wife shortly after eleanor recovered from the rigors of her recent childbirth the baby a little girl who had already been baptized joan was strong and healthy unlike the infant who had been born and died the year before they would come via sicily and provence visiting relatives along the way the queen was relieved for while she knew she could hold england for her son once henry died her life would have little meaning she was of a mind to retire to the benedictine convent in amesbury for the remainder of her life i will send off messages to both edward de beaulieu at haven castle and to the lady rhonwyn who is with her aunt the abbess of mercy abbey in wales the queen told her husband and again he nodded his assent edward de beaulieu was outraged to receive the royal summons to westminster how dare the vixen complain to the king he said angrily what did you expect his brotherinlaw rafe said while i am delighted that katherine is your wife and the mother of your heir you did marry her in some haste cousin i do not recall hearing you complain about my haste at the time edward replied dryly you could hardly wait for your sister to become the lady of haven castle our families have always hoped for the union rafe responded i was pleased that it was to be a reality at long last you did not say how the lady rhonwyn died edward i did not press the issue because i believed her loss pained you or that possibly you had killed her yourself for her high spiritedness only the fact that the lady is generous has prevented my sister from being burdened with a terrible shame what if lady rhonwyn demanded from the church that your marriage to kate be declared null and void under the circumstances your son would then have been declared a bastard a vindictive woman would have taken great delight in revenging herself on you for what you did she cannot appeal to the church under the circumstances of her adventures edward said in assured tones do you think the church would restore her to my side when she so merrily whored for another man an infidel when i expose her perfidy she will be lucky they do not burn her at the stake for her adultery rafe de beaulieu looked closely at his cousin do you love her then so much that you would destroy her cousin i do not love her edward said honestly do you love my sister rafe probed aye i do kate is the perfect wife for me i want no other he said she is sweet natured and obedient to my will as well as a good breeder look at our wee neddie what a fine lad he is if you are happy with kate her brother replied then why does your anger burn so hot toward the lady rhonwyn because she betrayed me he said coldly because she would destroy the happiness i now have she believes you betrayed her rafe countered tis an interesting conundrum edward i will go with you to westminster in order that you do not cost my sister and her child too much by your ire i will tell the king the truth de beaulieu said stonily you must tell the king the entire truth the abbess counseled her niece it will not be easy but it will save you from edwards outrage in the end it will all boil down to the fact that while you struggled to overcome great odds and return home to your husband your husband hurried home and contracted another marriage you cannot believe that my judges will overlook the fact i spent over a year in the harem of the caliph of cinnebar rhonwyn replied in practical tones nay they will not they will declare great shock and indignation that a good christian noblewoman a princes daughter could have found herself in such a position and not ended it all in the name of our dear lord jesus the abbess said dryly but you did not have to return home yet you did that will be what confounds them my child and that will be what gains you redress from edward de beaulieu i will be by your side speaking in your defense if necessary rhonwyn unless the archbishop of canterbury himself speaks for de beaulieu and as there is no profit in it boniface will not we will win you are so damned worldly for an abbess rhonwyn noted and then she laughed aunt should rather have you on my side than all of gods good angels the angels are in heaven my child the abbess answered her i am here they departed for westminster on a warm and hazy summers day the prince of the welsh had sent a fully mounted and armed troop to escort his sister and his daughter into england oth and dewi were by rhonwyns side as was glynn ap llywelyn who would testify to his part in the affair the trip had been carefully planned and each night they sheltered at either a convent or a monastery their progress was slow but steady and on the thirtyfirst of july they arrived in london where the two women were welcomed at the convent of st marysinthefields near the palace of westminster the men were invited to make their encampment in a meadow outside the convent walls rhonwyn and her aunt had in the weeks they were together at mercy abbey worked to sew a gown worthy of a princes daughter the gown or cotte fell gracefully to the floor it had long tight sleeves it was made of fine silk and was a spring green in color her overrobe which was sleeveless was fashioned from clothofgold on darker green silk brocade the gilt girdle which sat just below rhonwyns narrow waist was made of small rounds decorated with a swirl of celtic design rhonwyns hair had been parted in the center two delicate plaits braided with clothofgold ribbons and strands of tiny pearls and falling on either side of her face with the main mass of her hair flowing behind her amid strands of pearls atop her head a delicate filigreed circle held her sheer clothofgold gauze veil her only jewelry was a brooch of emeralds set in irish red gold her shoes did not show but they followed the shape of her foot and were of gilded leather you are magnificent her aunt said quietly as she looked over their handiwork you are every inch the prince of the welshs daughter my child i have never had anything quite this fine rhonwyn admitted you are regal but have not the look of a worldly woman said the abbess that is the effect we have been striving for rhonwyn some ladies of the court paint their faces and dye their hair you are fresh looking even though you will admit to your indiscretions your appearance is one of innocence the church will condemn you but they will find it impossible to believe you willingly betrayed your husband gwynllian smiled well pleased you must remember not to lose your temper with de beaulieu let him rant and rave you will weep and that will cause the hardest heart to soften toward you is that not dishonest aunt rhonwyn said mischievously this child is war the object of a battle is to win it the abbess advised with a twinkle in her brown eyes that is what your father would do will you allow yourself to be beaten by these english do not let it ever be said that ap gruffydds daughter was not as brave as he i should far rather challenge edward to trial by combat rhonwyn answered there i could absolutely beat him i am certain of it the abbess responded but it would certainly shock the king and give credence to de beaulieus charges come it is time for us to go now mother superior margaret joseph and a half a dozen of her sisters will escort us to the palace it is but a short walk i am to be surrounded by a bevy of nuns rhonwyn laughed oh aunt you are shameless the abbess chuckled but did not reply the kings hall in westminster palace was very beautiful the floor was set with wide square tiles the walls were painted in red blue and gold the windows soared high allowing in the light henry iii had made the effort to personally appear at the hearing he was a shell of the man he once was but his white hair and beard were neat his blue eyes looked interested though he slumped pale upon his throne his queen at his side on his right silling on a row of benches were the clergy the de beaulieus and rhonwyns party sat on the left carefully separated by several menatarms the hearing set for the hour immediately following the office of tierce began most promptly tell us your side of this dispute edward de beaulieu lord of haven castle the king said in a stronger voice than his appearance would have represented the woman given to me as a wife rhonwyn uerch llywelyn was never a true wife to me edward began the abbess squeezed her nieces hand hard she denied me my husbandly rights except on rare occasions she preferred the company of soldiers and playing with arms to being a good chatelaine at her insistence i allowed her to accompany me on crusade at carthage where we were encamped many including myself grew ill with fever and dysentery it was during my illness that my wife raced off into battle deserting me of course she was taken prisoner i sought for her for some days but found no trace at all of either her or my knight who had followed after her in a brave attempt at rescue i finally traveled to acre but the illness that had lain me low in carthage returned never having really been cured prince edward sent me home i am not a young man sire i had no legitimate heirs of my body when you chose me to husband the prince of the welshs daughter i had no previous commitments although my family had always hoped i would wed my cousin katherine now believing myself widowed wed her within ten months of our marriage katherine who is dutiful gave me a son just before he was born rhonwyn uerch llywelyn appeared at haven as if nothing was amiss she claimed to have been imprisoned within a harem and boasted of how another man had unleashed her passions as i never had when she saw how it was she threatened me and left haven i am outraged that she should demand redress from me for what tis she who should make amends to me for her desertion and her bold adultery edward de beaulieu bowed to the royal couple and then the clergy before sitting back down again there was a silence and then the king said rhonwyn uerch llywelyn come forward and tell us your side of this controversy rhonwyn arose slowly and stood before the king she bowed then turned to the clergy and bowed again thereupon she spoke in a voice so soft they all had to lean forward to hear sire my lords i come before you today to beg for justice in this unfortunate matter edward de beaulieu claims i was a bad wife to him and in part that is true when my mother died my father took me and my brother glynn to a fortress in the welshry where we were raised there were no women there to guide me when my father returned ten years later to announce i was to be wed he was horrified though why it was a surprise to him i do not know to discover his daughter was more a lad than a lass the king and the clergymen chuckled at her astute observation rhonwyn continued i was then taken to my aunts abbey where for the next six months i learned all i could about being a female my aunt of course had me baptized immediately and i was enlightened in our faith when i finally arrived at haven castle to be married i was enough of a lass to be presentable but i still had much to learn and i endeavored to do so i see that the castle priest father john is here at this assembly good father did i become an acceptable chatelaine for haven you did lady the priest answered honestly rhonwyn sighed deeply my lords where i failed my husband was in the bedchamber on our wedding night he cruelly forced me to his will claiming that you sire had said he must i did not believe such a thing then and i certainly do not now it was his lust that drove him to rape after that i was always afraid of his advances knew should not have been but i was there was no lady of my own station with whom i might speak in order to calm my fears then prince edward came to haven with his talk of a crusade i was enthusiastic his princess wife was going i saw no reason why i could not go perhaps if i fought for our good lord he would help me to overcome my fears in carthage i nursed my husband devotedly during his illness he is wrong to say i neglected him it is not true it was he himself who invited me to go off with his knight sir fulk to practice with my sword on that terrible day he even insisted i garb myself in protective gear and helped me to dress then the daily skirmish with the infidels began while we practiced foolishly oh how i regret iti ran off to join the fray sir fulk came after me my lords the battle was grand we won it in our lord christs name i however foolishly allowed myself to be cut off i am not after all really a soldier just a woman while i may have a talent for the sword i would it seems have none for tactics rafe de beaulieu seated by his cousins side almost laughed aloud she had more flare for tactics than any of them realized all present sat spellbound by rhonwyns tale the celtic witch had them in the palm of her hand and it was surely going to cost his cousin sir fulk rhonwyn continued god assoil his loyal soul she crossed herself rode after me he kept my captors from discovering that i was a female until we reached cinnebar in the battle i had killed the caliph of that places brother they brought me before this ruler for punishment when he discovered i was a woman he had me placed within his harem fair women are much prized among the arabs sir fulk was executed in my place she crossed herself again the caliph his name is rashid al ahmet took me as his second wife he taught me not to fear passion and he loved me my lords but all the while he held me in captivity i desired only one thing to return to my husband edward de beaulieu i hoped and i prayed and finally god answered my prayers my little brother glynn came to cinnebar seeking me his fame as a poet and a minstrel attracted the attention of the caliphs head eunuch a man called baba haroun my brother was invited to the palace to entertain the first song he sang was in the welsh tongue inquiring if i were in this place he had sung this tune many times over the months as he sought me out this night however his search was ended she sighed deeply tears filled her eyes and she swallowed them back bravely then continued at that point in time my lords the caliph decided he wanted a child of my body harem women are kept sterile by means of herbs unless children are desired of them baba haroun believed that any child of mine could compromise the position of the first wifes son prince mohammed he said so quite bluntly it was then i took the chance that he might help me to escape he did my lords we feigned my death and with baba harouns aid i left cinnebar over the next few months my brother and our two faithful menatarms oth and dewi traveled back to england it was a difficult journey as you well may imagine when i arrived at haven father john told me that my husband had had me declared dead and remarried then the lady katherine appeared i saw how far gone she was with child it was then i realized my lords that i had lost edward de beaulieu a line of tears ran down her pale cheeks my brother had told him in acre that he was certain i lived but edward alas had no faith he abandoned me and now i beg you sire to give me justice i seek the return of my dower and a forfeit from this man for the stain he has placed upon my father upon me and upon our family she bowed her head my lady the archbishop of canterbury said why is it you did not escape your shameful captivity in death my lord was taught it was wrong to take ones life but even if i had been of a mind to do so there was no way in which i might accomplish it the women of the harem are watched constantly by a band of eunuchs we are never alone our food is cut for us we were required to eat with our fingers as no implements were allowed our garments are few and there are no sashes or other loose girdles the bishop of winchester spoke did you tell your husband my lady that this caliph person had taught you passion i did my lord rhonwyn answered edward had been so unhappy with my coldness that i wanted him to know i had been freed of my irrational fears that i could love him at last and was eager to give him children i was too late another had taken my place i accept that it is my punishment for not being the proper kind of wife i have always liked the lady katherine and i wish her no harm i am glad that edward has a son and an heir but my lords what is to happen to me now i fought with all my might to come home i might have remained where i was in cinnebar beloved of another man a powerful man and a great ruler in my heart however was a memory of the love i had for edward de beaulieu i had to come back to england i expected his anger my lords and i expected his scorn to be sure i did not expect that he should have held me in so little esteem that he had replaced me within a year of my alleged demise i had hoped that i should be able to win back his love and his trust i obviously never had it and that my lords is my mistake but again i ask you for justice i was a faithful wife if not with my body in my heart and my soul edward de beaulieu was not a faithful husband her testimony concluded rhonwyn bowed once more to her judges and stepped back glynn ap llywelyn was then called before the court he described how he had learned of his sisters disappearance and his shock to discover edward had written a letter to rafe de beaulieu less than two months after rhonwyn had gone missing how he had left his studies and traveled with as much haste as possible to acre to plead with his brotherinlaw to wait before remarrying how edward had summarily dismissed him following the example of king richards minstrel blondell my lords i traveled the region singing my songs until as my sister has told you i found her he bowed to them and then stepped back to his place by rhonwyns side the lady rhonwyn her party and the de beaulieus will leave the chamber the king said we must discuss this matter in private accompanied by her brother and the nuns rhonwyn glided from the hall behind her she could hear the de beaulieus stamping along the kings steward came and led them to a small waiting chamber where wine and biscuits had been set out the men quaffed the wine thirstily rhonwyn sat silently a rosary in her hands how meek and forlorn you appear rafe de beaulieu said softly as he came to stand by her side she ignored him he chuckled you say you are no tactician lady but i think you would be a dangerous foe in battle despite your own behavior your splendid performance will cost poor edward dearly i am quite certain unable to help herself rhonwyn looked up you are despicable lady tis a compliment i offer you not a rebuke he replied i admire a clever woman and you are very clever although perhaps not very wise you should have remained in cinnebar did you not realize that it would be impossible for edward to take you back even if he had had no new wife by his side if he had loved me nothing would have been impossible rhonwyn burst out angrily she still found it difficult to accept the haste with which edward had acted love love is for children lady marriages should be made for more practical reasons your marriage to edward was part of a treaty between wales and england how could you have believed there was any love involved in it perhaps because i am not very wise rhonwyn replied mockingly you are wrong rafe de beaulieu love can exist between a married couple i thought it had begun to bloom with edward he had after all said he loved me was i to think he lied a man will say many things when he is between a womans legs was the harsh response rhonwyns head snapped up and she glared at him you really are despicable go away why do you find it necessary to torment me he smiled down at her and she was startled by the sudden realization that he was very handsome the silver blue eyes mocked her i dont want to torment you rhonwyn he said in a voice so low that only she could have heard him i want to make love to you she grew pale she could have sworn that her heart had stopped beating in her chest she could not speak for a long moment finally she said if you ever approach me again i will find a way to kill you i promise then she lowered her head again and began counting her rosary beads you are very bold the abbess said to rafe and she laughed when he flushed aye i heard you sir my hearing is acute it has to be if i am to keep strict order within my abbeys walls she will be like you when she is old he said probably the abbess answered dryly now go back with your cousin rafe de beaulieu and leave my niece be they waited finally the door to the room opened and the royal chamberlain stood beckoning them returning to the hall they saw that the king was gone the queen and the clergy remained the king queen eleanor said was exhausted by this mornings events he has left me to render his judgment you acted in haste edward de beaulieu when you remarried without truly knowing if your first wife was dead however by having her declared officially dead your marriage to lady katherine is declared legal by the church and your son legitimate it is not believed that you acted with any malice but rather from the honest conviction that rhonwyn uerch llywelyn was really dead when you learned she was not though you acted with total disregard for her honor and her familys honor for this you shall pay a forfeit and you shall return her dower portion to her is that understood my lord edward de beaulieu bowed and said grudgingly aye my lady as for you rhonwyn uerch llywelyn you have condemned yourself by your own words however you would appear truly repentant of your sins the church has taken into consideration the absence of god in your life during most of your life your future though presents us with a difficult problem your lascivious behavior makes you even penitent unfit for the church it will also make it difficult to find a husband for you and you must have a husband my dear you are a lady of noble family who is obviously in need of strong husbandly guidance but under the circumstances of your recent adventures who will have you the queen said troubled i will have her rhonwyn turned to stare surprised at rafe de beaulieu and then she lost her temper never she shouted at him never she held out her hands in appeal to the queen madame surely you will not take this man seriously besides there must be some consanguinity between us because of my marriage to edward de beaulieu queen eleanor looked to the assembled clergymen my lords the archbishop and bishops put their heads together and the hum of their voices could be heard murmuring in debate over the question finally the archbishop of canterbury spoke there is no blood tie between rhonwyn uerch llywelyn and rafe de beaulieu he said if the lady had given edward de beaulieu a child then the tie would be there but it is not he is free to take her as his wife it is our opinion that this is the best solution to the matter at hand my lady i will not have him rhonwyn said firmly the choice my dear the queen replied is not yours you must have a husband and he is willing to have you despite all your faults no unable to help herself and in utter frustration rhonwyn stamped her foot at eleanor of provence the queen ignored rhonwyns protest and turned to her aunt my lady abbess are you delegated by the prince of the welsh to act in the matter of your niece i am the abbess replied what say you the queen queried i would know first what kind of a home and hearth this man has to offer my niece tis not a castle i am certain and my niece is of noble blood even her mother god assoil her was lawfully born into a noble house we are anxious that rhonwyn be rewed but we will not act in haste and place our child in a difficult situation or one not suited to her station of course the queen agreed smoothing a wrinkle from her royal purple gown she looked at rafe de beaulieu sir what have you to say to the abbesss query through my maternal grandfather who had no other heirs i hold the title of baron bradburn of ardley rafe said my manor is small in land but i have a fine house servants and ten serfs to work my fields my cousin edward has a piece of land separate from his other holdings that matches with my land if you will give me the lady rhonwyn for a wife this land could serve as my cousins forfeit to the lady and my holdings would thereby be measurably increased i have cattle and i have sheep among my possessions as well i am not a very wealthy man but i am comfortable and my wife will not lack i am not a powerful man but my blood is as noble as hers i will not hold the past against her i will take her to wife despite her adventures and her bad temper rhonwyn threw her rosary beads at his head shouting you will have me in exchange for edwards land you bastard never would sooner spend the rest of my days in a windowless dungeon than have you for a husband the choice is not yours my child the abbess repeated quietly aunt listen to me rhonwyn the abbess spoke in the welsh they will marry you off whether you will or no at least you know this man you may not like him but you know him what other will have you perhaps some lecherous old lordling who will use you and beat you and squander your dower portion rafe de beaulieu is young he will give you children and i suspect in time you will come to an arrangement that pleases you both i have the power to make this match and i intend to do so i would prefer however that you agree to it also not willingly i know but i beg you to agree rhonwyn i feel like an animal caught in a trap rhonwyn said in her childhood tongue i hate it i know the abbess sympathized and i do understand my child why must i wed again rhonwyn demanded angrily but even as she asked the question she knew she was beaten how in hell could she hope to prevail against the queen and the church she couldnt no one was going to come to her aid her brother stood silently his gaze averted she could see oth and dewi at the end of the hall but she knew as much as they loved her they would not act against what they knew her father and her aunt would want for her rhonwyn her aunts voice gently pressed her i will marry him but not willingly she said once more using the norman tongue excellent queen eleanor replied well pleased i shall marry them myself here and now the archbishop of canterbury announced beneficently a broad smile upon his face you honor our family my lord archbishop the abbess said smoothly but i know i should feel more comfortable if all the legalities were tended to first an excellent suggestion the queen agreed they shall be wed late this afternoon and if the king is better he will come and give our beautiful bride away my dear i did not mention it before but green becomes you well i shall take my niece back to the convent gracious queen until the documents are ready for signature the abbess replied the queen nodded i shall send my own page to fetch you the abbess and her escort turned to shepherd their charge from the hall rhonwyn was seething with anger edward de beaulieu would not look at her but rafe stepped forward taking her hand up and kissing it his eyes met hers mockingly you will regret your impetuosity my lord she snarled at him i think not rhonwyn mine he answered her i will never be yours she cried heatedly and the abbess took her nieces arm and hustled her off before the now affianced pair came to blows do not cause a scene the abbess snapped i hate him i hate him rhonwyn said heatedly her pale skin was flushed with her ire and the color made her features even more attractive than they usually were you are fortunate her brother said coming to her side what are you on his side too rhonwyn complained you had to have another husband glynn said why does everyone keep saying that she demanded look on the brighter side of the situation glynn said ardley is far nearer to shrewsbury than haven we shall see each other often i dont know why he wants to wed me rhonwyn replied ignoring her brothers comforting words he lusts after you glynn said with a chuckle a man who is devoting his life to god should not say such things she scolded him roundly had i not had as full a life as i have and known my share of women sister i should not be able to give up my life to god so easily her brother told her with a smile chasing after you and my time in acre proved quite enlightening the abbess chuckled you are much your fathers son glynn i find it amazing that you can speak of giving up the world so cheerfully the religious life is a hard life nephew i know he said in my time in the abbey school i saw how difficult it could be sometimes but it is also joyous and meaningful as well my lady abbess i will be happy at shrewsbury then god bless you glynn ap llywelyn she said the abbess turned to her niece you must rest rhonwyn for you are certainly exhausted in body and spirit after these last few weeks rhonwyn didnt argue with the older woman as they reentered the convent allowing her aunt to help her from her beautiful gown so she might lay down in her chemise now listen to me my child the abbess said after the marriage ceremony i shall announce that we are all leaving immediately that your fathers menatarms will want to escort you to your new home and as we yet have several hours of daylight we shall leave right away no one not even your new husband will gainsay me i promise you we can travel at least five miles tonight before darkness sets in there is a small religious house just that distance away it is there we shall shelter tonight as you know there will be no accommodations for a newly wed couple you and your husband will be forced to sleep in separate quarters tomorrow we can retrace our route exactly sheltering at the various convents and monasteries that we sheltered in on our way to westminster until we reach your new home i can protect you from rafe de beaulieus eagerness use that time rhonwyn to know him better you are not the frightened girl who married his cousin you are a woman and you know what is expected of you i have never known a man but i have heard it said the experience is pleasanter if the couple at least likes each other there must be something you can learn to like in him rhonwyn shook her head but she was smiling slightly aunt i wish i had a predilection for the religious life for i should enjoy being with you for the rest of my days i do not think i shall enjoy that same pleasure with rafe de beaulieu i am certainly being punished for my foolish ways tell me something the abbess said turning the subject how exactly did sir fulk die you have never been particularly forthcoming in that matter do you feel such guilt for his death he did not die rhonwyn said i wanted him to return home with me but he would not he had been put in charge of prince mohammeds military training the prince is but two years younger than glynn and just a few years younger than sir fulk they liked one another and fulk felt his opportunities would be greater in cinnebar he did not believe however that his family would understand his remaining with the infidels could he give up his faith so easily the abbess looked disturbed nay he did not give up his faith aunt in cinnebar all faiths are permitted to worship freely rhonwyn told her indeed the abbess said it must have been a very odd place when her aunt had left the tiny cell where she was housed rhonwyn slept when she was awakened in the early part of the late afternoon a bowl of lavenderscented water and a cloth were brought to her she washed herself and dressed again in her lovely green gown her hair was unbraided and then replaited as it had been earlier the mass in the rear of her head being brushed until it shone a cup of wine and some biscuits were offered and she ate with a good appetite for she had had nothing since early morning are the documents ready for signature she asked the abbess when the older woman came to escort her aye we are to go back to the palace now glynn and the others are awaiting us outside the convent walls i have made our goodbyes to the mother superior and given her one of your gold marks niece in thanksgiving for your marriage a waste of a good coin although i do not begrudge this convent my gold the chapel roof i noted leaks escorted by the queens page they walked the brief distance from st marys to westminster palace the kings chamberlain led them to a small room where rafe de beaulieu and edward awaited them the documents were laid out upon a large oak table the de beaulieus have already signed my ladies the chamberlain said will you now sign my lady abbess here and here and here again the abbess scanned the parchments before her and then she said my niece is quite capable of signing herself my lords rhonwyn traitor rhonwyn whispered you will thank me one day my child the abbess said calmly i think not aunt rhonwyn countered but she took up the quill and signed her name in the places designated you can write rafe observed she glared at him and he could not help but laugh her look was so deliciously outraged her beauty had overwhelmed all other considerations when he had so boldly proclaimed he would have her to wife if she had been outraged by his offer his cousin edward had been equally so he had calmed edward by telling him it was better to keep the welsh girl in the family where they could control her than to let her marry another man who might be cajoled by her beauty into an act of revenge against the de beaulieus edward had reluctantly acquiesced the chamberlain stamped the royal seal into the wax that his assistant had dripped onto each document then rolling them up he handed them to rafe de beaulieu the archbishop is waiting he said for a brief moment rhonwyn looked as if she were going to bolt from the chamber then rafe de beaulieu took her arm murmuring low certainly ap gruffydds daughter is no coward lady fury blazed in rhonwyns emerald green eyes you shall soon learn just what ap gruffydds daughter is capable of my lord lady have mercy my appetite for you is already well honed he said i should like to hone my sword against your head she replied angrily i should far rather lodge my sword within your sheath he teased her her cheeks flamed pink at the randy reference what no sharp retort he taunted her she raised her hand to hit him he caught the hand and turning it kissed her palm their eyes met and she was almost staggered physically by the lightning she felt shoot between them rhonwyn snatched her hand back her heart hammering with shock how long has it been he murmured softly his fingers brushed over her lips go to hell she hissed as softly as they entered the royal chapel where the king and queen awaited them the king was wan his left eyelid drooping but his look was a kind one he smiled at rhonwyn coming slowly to her side as she and rafe reached the altar where archbishop boniface awaited them rhonwyn noted the queens worried expression as the king stood on shaky legs beside the reluctant bride poor man she thought and gave him a dazzling smile you truly honor me sire and i thank you for it she told the monarch taking his arm to steady him you will be happy i promise the king said to her and he patted her hand a woman is happiest when she is well wed i will remember your words my lord she promised him then in his elegant latin archbishop boniface began the ancient words to the marriage sacrament chapter rafe de beaulieu was more amused than angry when he realized he would not be able to consummate his marriage until they reached his estates while he enjoyed female flesh he had never been a man to casually bed a woman the abbess made certain her niece rode by his side each day of their journey he knew that she was attempting to foster some sort of a rapport between bride and bridegroom but rhonwyn was not feeling particularly cooperative each day he would attempt to engage her in conversation she answered him in monosyllables he gained far more out of her when he taunted her she would erupt and excoriate him angrily until she realized just what it was he was doing then she would grow grimly silent her lips pressed together tightly in a narrow line finally one day he asked her bluntly why is it that you are angry with me rhonwyn i am not the one who betrayed you you are a de beaulieu she answered him so are you he replied a strange look passed over her features and then she laughed bitterly so i am twice by marriage i vow then she asked him why did you wed me rafe for the land of course lady he answered and because anyone else who might have you would have mistreated you was the surprising reply you felt sorry for me her tone bordered on outrage aye he readily agreed but i also lusted after you you know how very beautiful you are i think one reason edward was angry at me for offering for you is that he too sees how lush and ripe you have become you are no longer the avid little lass who so eagerly sought to go on crusade rhonwyn you are a very desirable woman and now you are mine edward thinks i am desirable she said a small smile on her lips her green eyes were thoughtful could you not see the hunger for you in his eyes rafe replied he loves my sister make no mistake rhonwyn but desire you even briefly he did and the secret knowledge of it rendered him full of guilty rage he directed that anger at you you will recall i did not see it she said i was too busy defending myself from his cruel charges and half truths my lord and what do you feel for him rafe asked attempting to keep the jealousy in his voice from her what should i feel for him she countered he closed his eyes a moment and then opening them said you will drive me to murder one day lady but i suspect not my lord before you have plundered my body and gained the pleasures that i can give you she taunted him what of the pleasures i can give you he returned can you she replied coolly we shall see my lord it is to be hoped you are more skilled in the amatory arts than edward was there was very little he aroused in me but a desire to have it over and done with as quickly as possible that rhonwyn knew even as she spoke the words was not entirely true but her heart still hurt from the brutal rejection you will find i am an entirely different man than my cousin rafe promised her you will long for more in my arms and not less tis to be hoped your actions match or even exceed your boasting my lord rhonwyn mocked him gently as your aunt has so skillfully arranged our daily accommodations lady it will be a while longer before i may make good my gasconade he said with an amused chuckle rhonwyn was forced to laugh passion is the better for the waiting she advised him her emerald eyes twinkling perhaps this marriage would not be as bad as she thought to her surprise rafe de beaulieu was a humorous man and she certainly admired his loyalty and devotion to his sister katherine shall i tell you how intend to make love to you the first time i bed your he said his silvery blue eyes making contact with hers rhonwyn felt her cheeks grow warm you are indelicate my lord was her voice shaking her knees suddenly felt weak as she bestrode her horse she gripped her reins more tightly and hoped he didnt notice his laughter was low and insinuating i shall have you naked he began sollly i want to see the candlelight and the firelight flickering over your body rhonwyn will kiss you not just upon the lips but each tiny bit of your flesh will feel the touch of my mouth you will be warm and yielding in my arms rhonwyn how certain you are she laughed aye i am certain he said with a smile what will you do when you have finished kissing me she demanded now he laughed he liked her boldness as long as it was reserved only for him i shall fondle those sweet breasts of yours and suckle upon their nipples until the flesh is swollen and aching with desire i shall caress you until you are weak with longing rhonwyn felt a small tingling beginning in her nether regions she shifted nervously in her saddle he saw the motion and grinned wickedly at her i shall find your sweet jewel and torture it until you are creamy with your own sweet essence then i shall cover you with my body and enter you slowly slowly slowly you shall feel me hard and throbbing my desire inside your sweet sheath rhonwyn you will melt with pleasure within my arms my beautiful bride because rhonwyn you are a woman who was meant to be loved and there is no man on this earth who will love you as i do and i will not be satisfied until you love me not make love but love do you understand what it is i am saying to you her eyes were closed her breathing was shallow his words aroused her in a way no man ever had the tingle mushroomed until it shattered itself and she sighed deeply then hearing his words her eyes flew open her look startled her cheeks blushing guiltily by the rood he swore softly realizing what had happened to her lady it is all i can do not to stop this caravan and take you into the woods my god how you whet my appetites others might call you shameless i will not provided you keep your passion for me in the future praise god we shall reach ardley tomorrow so soon she whispered she was both astounded and distressed by the effect he had had on her with his wicked words not soon enough lady he told her frankly she kicked her horse into a loping canter and rode ahead of their train the cool wind soothing the heat in her face what had just happened was truly disturbing and such a thing had certainly never happened to her before i do not understand she thought confused why should this man have such an effect upon me how can my body desire him when i do not she shook her head suddenly irritated i am tired rhonwyn thought of being controlled by men first my father then edward then the caliph and now rafe de beaulieu why can a woman not live her own life without the interference of men she had surely asked the question over and over again but had never received a proper answer to it glynn had said respectable women didnt run their own lives but he had not explained why that had to be only women like her aunt had a certain measure of autonomy it seemed but then even gwynllian was answerable to her bishop a man of course a queen could rule in her husbands absence or in her own right in certain cases but her counselors were always men why not women why just men suddenly she laughed aloud at herself she was asking questions to which there were obviously no answers men ruled the world and that was all there was to it she was married to rafe de beaulieu and for better or for worse she was going to have to make the best of it but she didnt intend to be a docile and gentle creature like her sisterinlaw katherine as rafe was now stuck with her he would have to accept that rhonwyn uerch llywelyn was who she was and there would be no changing her early the following afternoon they reached ardley rhonwyn had to admit she was impressed by the house rafe always referred to his branch of the family as poor relations but his house was hardly a humble dwelling it was constructed of stone with a slate root and to her surprise fortified with a small moat that encircled the main building they got royal permission for that somewhere along the line the abbess gwynllian noted undoubtedly it is because we are so close to wales here the land looks prosperous niece you should be happy here and it is more manageable than haven you will remain the night rafe de beaulieu asked politely the abbess chuckled alas sir we cannot i will of course want to satisfy my curiosity and see the inside afterward however we must be on our way they are expecting us at st hildas tonight there was a small wooden bridge that led across the narrow watercourse to a gravel path they entered the house by means of a stone porch carved wooden screens were set on either side of the opening into the hall which was to their left the kitchen the buttery the pantry are on the right rafe said i have a library behind the hall where i do the estate business at the far end of the hall the abbess noted two oriels one on either side of the room that allowed much light into the room there was a fine large fireplace on the right the high board was set on a low but elevated dais the table was of wellpolished oak there were herbs sprinkled upon the floor the house had a wellkept look about it the staircase to the bedchambers and the solar come down by the left oriel window he explained would you like to see the upstairs my lady abbess aye i will admit to being curious she smiled at him at that moment however katherine de beaulieu came down the stairs and entered into the hall rafe she called her voice sweet and welcoming edward came home several days ago and told me you had taken the lady rhonwyn for your wife i hope you will both be very happy she hugged her brother and the abbess saw her look was loving she turned to rhonwyn welcome to ardley rhonwyn may you be content within these walls my mother was and the women who came before her she embraced her somewhat startled sisterinlaw behaving as if the marriage between her brother and rhonwyn was a wonderful thing i have brought you a gift rhonwyn she is waiting upstairs for you for a moment rhonwyn looked puzzled and then suddenly she said enit and when katherine nodded with a smile rhonwyn could not keep herself from hugging edwards wife oh thank you katherine her loyalty is to you alone once she knew you were alive i knew i could not keep her from you katherine said would you like me to give you a tour of the house i know it far better than my brother who only knows where to go to sleep to eat and to pee katherine laughed please rhonwyn said then she and the abbess followed after katherine as she led them upstairs rafe watched them go and when he knew he would not be observed he smiled when he had first seen his sister he feared that rhonwyn would be unkind but before she could even get her bearings kate had won her over with her natural sweetness the abbess he had noted was equally relieved he took the cup of wine offered by an attentive servant and sat down by his fire upstairs katherine showed her new sisterinlaw the master chamber with its sunny solar and garderobe there were also two smaller chambers each of the rooms katherine proudly pointed out had its own fireplace the house is very tight she said and the windows face south and west even in our awful shropshire winters these rooms arc toasty warm my mother far preferred her solar on a winters day to the hall below at the sound of the voices enit hurried from the master chamber oh my lady my lady then she burst into tears touched rhonwyn embraced her serving woman its all right now enit im here and we have a fine new home dont we yes my lady the young woman sniffed my lady abbess katherine said will you allow me to travel with you as far as haven at this hour i cannot hope to reach home by sunset but i should be grateful to be somewhat nearer there by evening will your husband worry my dear the abbess inquired nay i told him i should travel with you and he would probably not see me until the morrow sometime i have half a dozen menatarms with me and your road is but a mile away from haven of course child you are welcome to travel with me the abbess said suddenly there was the sound of a child crying and rhonwyn realized that there was a cradle by the solar fireplace walking over she saw a swaddled infant lying in it the baby looked up at her and rhonwyn jumped back the child had edward de beaulieus eyes and looked at rhonwyn in the same way oh katherine said neddie has startled you i am so sorry he is just two months old and i certainly couldnt leave him behind at haven why not rhonwyn demanded had katherine brought the child to torture her he would have starved katherine said softly i do not believe in wet nurses there was no danger in bringing him to my brothers house come and meet your nephew now he will grow up with the children that you and rafe have is that not wonderful she picked up the infant and handed him to rhonwyn before her sisterinlaw might demur the abbess almost laughed aloud at the look of terror on her nieces face cuddle him child she said in her welsh tongue he will not bite you you do not smell of milk as his mother does rhonwyn nestled the baby boy in her arms her terror replaced by a feeling of amazement and wonder he really looks just like edward she finally said doesnt he katherine crowed proudly i hope your first son is his fathers mirror image men are so vain over these things and rafe in particular perhaps my first child will be a daughter rhonwyn ventured then i hope she looks like you sister was the sweet reply you are truly the most beautiful woman i ever saw my brother is a fortunate man i hope you will eventually learn to love him as i love edward do not think me insensitive rhonwyn for i am not i suspect you cared deeply for edward he is a difficult man but i have known him my whole life long and i know i am the better wife for him you are impulsive and slightly reckless like rafe you do not realize it yet but you are strangely well matched though you i think are the stronger be kind to my brother she took her son from rhonwyn you will want to refresh yourself my lady abbess before we are on the road again i will leave you and go down to visit with my brother for a few minutes i am ready when you are her son in her arms katherine de beaulieu hurried from the solar rhonwyn sat down heavily joining her her aunt said i have never known you to be this quiet my child what is it rhonwyn was silent for a long moment and then she said i really am remarried aunt i have a new husband a new house a sisterinlaw whom i should hate but cannot and i am expected to have babies you are no longer a child rhonwyn the abbess said gently you are a grown and experienced woman of noble birth it is indeed past time you had children this is the life you will live now make your peace with it my child you are very fortunate to have been rescued by rafe de beaulieu he is i believe a far better man than his cousin rhonwyn nodded know she agreed but he is just so annoying aunt part of me wants to accept my new life another part of me wants to fight with rafe for daring to marry me what am i to do my dear niece in the neverending battle between men and women i have absolutely no experience but i very much believe that you and that handsome husband of yours will eventually come to an understanding before one of you kills the other she arose now call enit and show me to the garderobe before i must be on my way i will join you downstairs my child in the hall rhonwyn found her brother had joined rafe and katherine they were laughing as they shared wine and biscuits what is your cause for such humor she asked as she came to glynns side rafe and i are comparing stories of growing up with a sister glynn said with a chuckle and what have you discovered she asked him with a smile that girls are all alike he laughed you will miss me when you are in your cold cell subsisting on salt fish bread and bad wine rhonwyn predicted aye glynn agreed i will miss you rhonwyn tears sprang to her eyes damn you little brother she said softly you are the only person i know who can make me cry he embraced her tenderly be content sister and be happy with this new life this other chance you have been given i know that i am glad to be returning to shrewsbury abbey where my life awaits me and what will poor oth and dewi do without you brother she asked him they want to remain with you rhonwyn i have already gained rafes permission in the matter he is glad to have them he knows it will make you happy glynn lowered his voice he is a good man sister do not take him lightly i wont she promised the abbess came downstairs accompanied by enit give me a sip of wine nephew rafe and then i shall be on my way she said when the wine had been consumed the abbess katherine de beaulieu her infant and glynn ap llywelyn took their leave of rafe and rhonwyn rhonwyn watched them go even though her brother had promised to visit when the abbott permitted him to come she was already lonely and only god knew if she would ever see her aunt again when rafes arm went about her shoulder she did not shrug it off come he said when their guests had at last disappeared from sight you have not met your servants wife do you like the house she nodded it is a fine house she told him but not a castle he remarked i was not raised in a castle my lord nor is it a caliphs luxurious palace he noted i was not raised in a palace either she replied why do you seek to quarrel with me my lord what rhonwyn will you not fight with me he teased her pray god you do not turn into a meek and mild creature like my sweet sister kate such decorum in a sister is fine but tis deadly dull in a wife i fear how would you know sir have you ever had a wife before she snapped back at him he chortled that is better and in answer to your question nay i have never had a wife before but i think i may enjoy one the silver blue eyes danced wickedly at her you are impossible she fumed tis true lady but are you yet sad over the departure of your aunt and your brother now he queried suddenly rhonwyn laughed you are clever my lord perhaps too clever i fear for a simple lass raised in a fortress in the welshry she murmured now her eyes were dancing wickedly simple lass he scoffed disbelieving your simplicity has gained me over three hundred acres rhonwyn my father tried his whole life to get that land from his brother edwards father but to no avail now at last thanks to you we have it he gave her a hug as they entered the house again did it belong to ardley originally she asked him my grandfather and edwards purchased ardley for my father so he would have his own lands but our grandsire retained the acreage in question because he felt it added to havens prestige to have more land when edwards father inherited it my father attempted to purchase it from him but my uncle would not sell it it always galled my lather that his own brother would not give him back the land that rightfully belonged to ardley when the queens counselors asked what forfeit i would have for you i chose this land it was not so great a parcel that would make us appear greedy and it matched my lands it was to all the obvious choice edward dared not refuse me although i know he was angered rafe chuckled it truly pained him to release those acres to me fortunately he had no other option so you really did marry me for the land she said almost irritably of course he replied you are the first woman that i ever considered who had a respectable dower portion beast she hit him on the arm and he laughed surely you are not a romantic rhonwyn you know as well as i do that marriage is an arrangement between families mutually acceptable to them both you were married to edward to seal a treaty between england and wales you have been married to me because i saw an opportunity to regain what was mine you have profited as well wife shameless hussy that you are you have made a second respectable marriage and saved both your honor and your fathers good name rafe surveyed her curious as to how she would react to his speech rhonwyns look however was carefully masked she had not forgotten the words he had spoken to her the day before and i will not be satisfied until you love me then she smiled a wicked smile you have done quite well for yourself rafe not only have you gained back the land your family lost but you have wed above your station by marrying the prince of the welshs daughter he chuckled you will not be easy to live with i can see it even now come wife the servants await kate was so busy being house proud that she did not introduce you as she should have he took her hand leading her back into the house where she met browne the steward albert and his wife albertina who divided the cooking and baking chores between them and the three maidservants dilys mavis and annie there was a kitchen boy tarn who scrubbed pots turned the spit and edged the knives lizzie and her sister rosie were in charge of the laundry there was peterman the bailiff several grooms for the stables and a hayward who kept the hedges trimmed rafe rhonwyn learned kept his own accounts and ordered what supplies the estate could not grow or manufacture the servants were friendly but polite they seemed to be pleased to have a new mistress she thanked them for their greeting and then said you have met my enit and will welcome her as warmly i hope then rhonwyn smiled at them aye my lady browne replied a good worker your enit is we already know she has prepared your chamber for you and earlier unpacked your possessions that she and lady katherine brought from haven for a moment rhonwyn was tempted to say she wanted nothing from haven but she swallowed back the urge she wasnt a wealthy woman nor was her husband a rich man she needed everything she had and her pride would have to accept that fact come rafe said softly to her i will take you to our chamber wife his fingers closed about her arm our chamber tis a small house he murmured low the custom here is that the master and the mistress share a bed tis not like my cousins fine castle where the lady has her own apartments and the lord his he half dragged her up the narrow staircase and into the solar go down to the hall girl he told enit who scurried out at his command now wife we will talk rafe de beaulieu said rhonwyn sat herself in a highbacked oak chair by the fire what shall we talk about my lord she asked him sweetly you realize that i positively lust after you rhonwyn dont you i have said it before he remarked frankly as he stood before her aye she managed to respond looking directly up at him why did he have to be so damned handsome she thought admitting to herself that she could feel her own lust being engaged it had been almost a year since she had lain in a mans arms felt a mans weight on her sighed with pleasure at a lovers eager entrance into her body he smiled and she flushed knowing he somehow read her randy thoughts do you want me as much as i want you he asked her i do not want you at all she snapped knowing it was a lie and knowing that he knew it was a lie i have never forced a woman rhonwyn he told her seriously i will not force you you are my wife between us there will be respect and consideration until that time you wish us to enter into a true spousal state we will of course share the bed in our chamber for i am certain you do not wish the servants to know of our agreement it would distress them to learn we were not doing all we could to make an heir for ardley you dont want me she was astounded nay wife as i have already said i want you very much but i will have no woman who does not want me rafe replied that is ridiculous do you enjoy being forced then he demanded his look leering he tipped her face up to his pulling away rhonwyn cried nay but you are my husband and you have certain rights whether i will or no edward certainly never hesitated to claim his prerogatives edward was a fool who might have discovered the real reason for your fears had he not been so busy with his claims rafe said bluntly your caliph obviously took the time to learn what it was that frightened you rhonwyn will you tell me rashid al ahmet said that the mind was a dangerous thing rhonwyn began he was patient and clever together we discovered that i hid a secret within the darkest recesses of my soul once when i was a small girl and my brother barely out of infancy a richly clad stranger came to our cottage and violated my mam she never told ap gruffydd and warned me not to either glynn was too young to remember the incident my mam told me i should never let a man do to me what the stranger had done to her it somehow left the impression on my childs mind that i should not couple with a man once i was able to remember what had happened my fears dissolved ah rafe said and then he grinned at her and being fearless wife you went on to taste and experience all the pleasures of the flesh did you not i hope the caliph taught you well for i am a man with a prodigious appetite for carnal delights but you will not force me rhonwyn taunted him you have said it yourself my lord that until i desire you you will not have me her fingers reached up and caressed his cheek sliding down the curve of his visage and trailing across his lips he caught her hand and shoved her fingers into his mouth sucking upon them vigorously his eyes meeting hers in a silent challenge you said you would not force me she quickly reminded him he licked her fingers dry and kissed the tips of the digits before releasing them i said lady that i should not force you i did not say i should not tease you fondle you caress you or kiss you i said i would not force you is what you have said not coercion she demanded her fingers were tingling you are proud rhonwyn and you are a poor liar you lust for me every bit as much as i lust after you but you refuse to admit to it yanking her up his arms closed about her their lips were dangerously close tell me now that you do not want me i do not want you she cried liar he mocked her and then he kissed her lips they trembled beneath his soft and yielding despite her protest tell me you do not want me he said once more bastard she hissed at him fiercely say the words rhonwyn he pressed her but you dont believe me she half sobbed her heart was pounding wildly her legs felt like straw nay wife dont edward was foisted upon you as was your caliph i am the first the only man whom you have ever truly desired with ever fiber of your being rhonwyn why do you deny so desperately what is so plain to me his mouth brushed hers again so proud so fierce so damnably sweet he crooned low to her do not fight it lovely i beg of you she struggled against his grip you claim i am proud she cried your pride is far worse than mine rafe de beaulieu let me be you have promised not to force me and i will not have you can you not understand me he kissed her brow you will come to me sooner than later wife he told her as his grip loosened suddenly and she almost fell recovering she stood facing him her cheeks pink her green eyes wide what makes you think i want you she demanded i see it in your emerald eyes he told her you trembled in my arms and i felt the little nipples of your breasts hardening against my chest your mouth was sweet and did not deny me rhonwyn i cannot remain here she said desperately you are a devil rafe de beaulieu you confuse me with your wicked tongue oh my darling he said laughing you havent begun to know the impact of my wicked tongue upon you but you soon will she turned away from him he was right damn him for the first time in her life she actually desired a man she had almost desired edward and the caliphs passion had opened her eyes to the pleasures that could exist between a man and a woman but she had never truly wanted a man as she wanted this one but it was wrong to give in to his wicked cajolery before they knew more about one another was not right this was the man she would be married to until death she wanted his respect and if she was to have it she must not yield to his taunts like some common whore of the streets drawing a deep breath rhonwyn turned herself about and looked directly at her husband aye i do desire you she admitted but i am not being coy when i ask you for a bit of time so we may know one another better because i have lived in a harem does not make me a loose woman rafe do you understand how i feel he sighed aye he told her i do but waiting will not make me want you any less lovey rhonwyn laughed dont want you to desire me less husband she said i just want to know the man i am wed to better than i knew the last one perhaps we can learn to love one another in the romantic sense but i seek your respect as well neither of us are children rafe and we have both known passion there is little that can surprise us my lord so let us be patient for now you surprise me rhonwyn he told her sometimes i surprise myself she returned if you had been eve and i adam he said i believe we should still be within the garden of eden wife rhonwyn was unable to restrain her chuckle perhaps she said they stood awkwardly for a long moment staring at one another and then he said it is almost time for the meal wife let us go down into the hall together tomorrow you must begin to learn the ways of this household browne will help you i promise he is a good man it is he who trained kate properly after our parents died the meal was simple there was a broiled trout and a venison stew along with bread and cheese they both ate with good appetites afterward they sat together by the fire in highbacked wooden chairs with tapestried cushions a huge gray wolfhound with a rough coat came and put his large head in rhonwyns lap delighted she stroked the beast until his dark eyes closed in obvious pleasure his name is flint rafe said i have never before seen him take to anyone he has always been very aloof he was but waiting for me rhonwyn told her husband and as if to agree flints eyes opened and he barked they both laughed so you like dogs do you rale said cythraul had a small pack of them she replied and there were animals at haven although none ever attached itself to me as this charming fellow has flint was now lying at her feet having done so hell guard you with his own life rafe told her seriously that is the way wolfhounds are if they attach themselves to any one person flint ambled upstairs after them and rafe allowed him to sleep before the fire in the solar not our bedchamber rhonwyn teased him first hed be on the floor and then hed push me right out of our bed rafe said dont think i dont understand his tactics wife enit helped her mistress to wash and disrobe then sought her bedspace in the solar rhonwyn climbed into the big bed with the dark green hangings turning on her side she waited nervously for rafe to join her wondering if he would keep his promise she found herself a little disappointed when he did and when she awoke in the morning he had already gone browne began guiding her through the business of being ardleys new mistress the household was small and practically ran itself but there were certain things done in season that were rhonwyns responsibility as mistress of the household most have been done for the year browne told his mistress for even though lady katherine is now at haven she would not allow her brothers household to falter it will soon be time for the making of the october ale the apples and pears are being harvested now and must be made into conserves or dried for winter use and of course the pigs will need to be slaughtered for winter ive never done such work rhonwyn admitted when i lived at haven these things were done by others and so they will be here my lady browne said in kindly tones but ardley being a small manor it will be up to its lady to oversee all these tasks do you know how to make salves and other medicines aye i was taught at the convent rhonwyn replied it is a good time to seek out the berries roots and leaves you will need for that endeavor browne remarked shall i call enit and fetch a basket for you my lady yes she told him by the rood she had missed what it was like to be a lady of the manor her time at haven had been short and in the harem she had done nothing more strenuous than gossip in the baths with alia and the other women while beautifying herself for the caliphs visits she had almost forgotten that a good english chatelaines days were scheduled to match the march of the seasons if they were to survive the winter there was a great deal that would have to be done having lived at haven rhonwyn remembered that shropshire had the worst winters in all of england september and october flew by the ale was made and sealed in barrels the fruit was preserved by either drying or enclosing in jugs of honey and wine rhonwyn was delighted when her husband invited her to go hunting over the next few weeks they brought back several deer and a number of water fowl which were hung in the larder rhonwyn purchased a barrel of cod and directed her servants to salt the fish in order to preserve it over the coming winter months at martinmas they had goose and edward came in his wifes company to ardley for the family feast he could hardly wait to tell his brotherinlaw and his former wife that katherine was once again with child it would be born next summer you must not allow him to wear you out with childbearing rhonwyn scolded kate this child will be born only thirteen months after its sibling go to enits mother afterward she will help you to avoid conceiving again too soon such a thing is forbidden katherine said piously edward would be very angry should he ever learn of such a thing he will be angrier if you die too soon do you want your babes raised by an uncaring stepmother he sensible kate rafe would certainly agree with me i know rhonwyn told her sisterinlaw i do not need rafe telling me what to do as he always did before i wed with edward kate said heatedly doesnt edward tell you what to do rhonwyn asked edward is my husband kate answered with what she considerd perfect logic what were you and my sister discussing so hotly rafe asked her afterward when their guests had departed kate is sweet but she is a dolt rhonwyn said bluntly and told him of their conversation rafes visage grew concerned i will talk to her he said firmly dont rhonwyn warned she will not listen i will have enits mother conspire with her other daughter who is kates maidservant they will see kate is protected from her foolishness you are a good wife rafe said not yet my lord but soon promise rhonwyn told him soon i will be the best wife you could ever have rafe chapter the hall was practically silent the fire crackled and flint snored contentedly his massive head on his paws the servants had disappeared the meal having been cleared away an hour ago outside the windows a winter storm howled unrelentingly the snow and ice beating against the windows as the shutters rattled with each windy blast rhonwyn and rafe sat before the blazing fire a chess table between them they were well matched in skill and the nightly battle between them was indicative of the other silent battle they fought her fingers toyed with the carved ashwood chess piece as she contemplated her next move do you think the storm will be over by morning she wondered aloud not even looking up as she finally moved her queen rafe studied the outline of the chessboard now nay wife this is a bad storm even for shropshire it may end by tomorrows nightfall but certainly not before he checked her queen by the rood rhonwyn swore surprised she had not considered his clever move and felt a slight tingle of irritation as he removed her piece from the board he laughed are you ready to concede this match wife rhonwyn searched the chessboard for a way out but finding none she said i surmise i must what forfeit will you have my lord a kiss he told her on the lips wife now it was rhonwyn who laughed i did not expect you to kiss my hand my lord she told him and standing said come and receive your prize then rising he moved around the table and took her into his arms his silver blue eyes searched her face and to her chagrin rhonwyn blushed his eyes asked her the one question that until now she was not ready to answer she initiated the kiss quickly pulling down his head to give him the answer he had been waiting for for the past five months as their lips met tenderly in a sweet but brief kiss you are certain wife his look challenged her rhonwyn nodded there is only one way i may come to know you better rafe she said softly we have waited long enough aye he agreed and then he swept her up into his arms and carried her from the hall up the narrow staircase through the solar past a startled enit and into their bedchamber he shut the door firmly behind them and set her on her feet taking both her hands in his he turned them over and placed a hot kiss in the center of each palm not a word was spoken between them retrieving her hands from his light grasp she undid her girdle and lay it aside her eyes locked onto his as she drew her gown off and placed it with the cincture sitting upon the single chair in the chamber she held out a leg to him kneeling rafe drew the soft house shoe from her foot and slipped the garter holding her stocking up off her slowly slowly he rolled the stocking down her slender leg tossing it aside as his dark head bent to kiss first her slim foot and then to run a succession of kisses up her leg stopping at the soft flesh of her inner thigh ummmmm rhonwyn murmured as a shiver ran down her back that is nice husband she offered him her other leg his fingers brushed the inside of her thigh teasingly and then he repeated his previous actions with her second leg this time however when he had finished his reverence he pushed her chemise up as far as it would go and parted her legs he stared for a long moment at her plump pink venus mons the shadowed slash between her nether lips beckoned him and unable to contain himself he ran a finger lightly down it smiling as he felt her shiver opening her lips to his deeper view he gazed upon the badge of her womanhood it seemed to shimmer to his sight jesu he murmured low you are so beautiful there leaning forward he kissed the moist flesh lightly oh god rhonwyn whispered her voice ragged and she shuddered at the touch of his tongue as it swept over her sensitive jewel straightening he closed her legs to his view taking her by the shoulders he kissed her lips his tongue plunging into the deep recess of her mouth to make contact with hers she could taste her own salty muskiness as he teased at her she almost swooned in his arms to her great surprise for his desire was the most deeply sensual thing she had ever known hungrily she kissed him back realizing very clearly how much she wanted to be loved by this man who was her husband not simply made love to but loved surprised by the intensity of her kiss he released his grip on her shoulders and looked deeply into her eyes by the rood wife he exlaimed seeing the truth if you gloat rafe i swear i will slice your ears off she threatened him i should be an odd sight then he teased back gently taking her hand in his and kissing the palm softly you are so damned proud rhonwyn uerch llywelyn and so i shall say it first i love you wife for how long she demanded but her heart was hammering with the incredible joy overtaking her entire being he loved her from the first moment i saw you and you were my cousins wife and he did not really appreciate the magnificent creature he had in you edward didnt deserve you i could plainly see that you were not the woman for him you were mine oh rafe she said her heart overflowing with her happiness when they said you were dead i did what i had to do for my sister but in the darkness of the night i cursed the fates that i had lost you and then by some miracle you were restored to me my darling i can still remember all those pompous clerics sitting about with their pursed lips and disapproving looks wondering who would have this fallen womanthis magdalen who had lain in an infidels arms and then had the temerity to return to england and admit it i can still hear the angry sound my cousin made when i said that i should have you it was a cross between a gasp and a curse for while edward knows katherine is a better wife for him he yet lusts after you you delight in that knowledge she accused him aye i do he freely admitted my cousin is a fool but his witlessness has allowed me to have my hearts desire his fingers began to unlace her chemise pulling it down off her shoulders so that it finally puddled about her hips he stared entranced at her breasts shaking his head and murmuring so beautiful rhonwyn took his face between her hands and looked into it i love you rale she told him i love you she kissed his mouth hard i said those words only once to edward when he was ill but never did i say them to rashid al ahmet you hear this declaration from me because it is the truth i love you i shall not be the fool that edward was he promised her i know she told him now take your clothes off rafe because i am hot to couple with you my husband she pushed him from her and stood up from the chair allowing the chemise to fall to her ankles she stepped from the material and began undoing his sherte her nimble fingers pulling the laces free as if by magic she yanked the garment from him and then bent to cover his torso in kisses with a groan he pulled her up drawing her against his bare chest with one hand while the other hand fumbled with his chausses both of them were breathing quickly in their eagerness he cursed his awkwardness and laughing softly rhonwyn aided him with sure hands until he was as naked as she stepping back she viewed him as god had made him and smacked her lips in open approval he laughed aloud shameless wench he said but his own eyes were sweeping over her admiringly taking his hand she led him to their bed and drew him down atop her make love to me husband she said softly have we both not waited long enough for this night then rhonwyn kissed him eagerly the warmth of her lips sent his senses reeling he was already hard for her but he had wanted more than a quick coupling the first time now he realized how desperate they both were for this first encounter there would be more than enough timeyears for the tender passion that he believed should precede the event slowly carefully he entered her body knowing how long it had been since she had last had a man she was wet and hot and she sighed deeply at his ingress he groaned with the delight he felt at just possessing her leaning back slightly he caressed her breasts rhonwyn put her arms about his neck and drew him back down against her i am ashamed to be so eager she confessed but please he smiled into her eyes his lips gently kissing her face and began to move upon her her eyes closed as she wrapped her slender limbs about him her lithe body moving with his rhythm encouraging him onward his breath began to come in hot pants as his tempo quickened she half sobbed as she felt his great thick length fill her neither of her previous lovers had been quite as well endowed as was rafe the beast throbbed within her love sheath then it began to thrust and withdraw thrust and withdraw until she was mindless and wild with her passion she clung hungrily to him her nails digging into the muscles of his back and raking down the smooth flesh as her lust swelled finally they exploded in a starburst of satisfaction that they shared together before collapsing replete with their shared pleasure oh husband rhonwyn breathed gustily wife you should unman a satyr he groaned happily what is a satyr she demanded to know he laughed a creature that is half man half goat and incredibly lustful she smiled as she lay contented upon his smooth damp chest next time i shall make you feel like the randiest of satyrs she promised will you he half taunted her i will rhonwyn raised her head and began to lick his nipples suggestively he closed his eyes for a long moment very much enjoying her attentions then he gently bid her cease while i should like you to believe i can be aroused almost immediately wife it is not possible as we both realize i bow to your husbandly wisdom she said sweetly arising from their bed and walking across the floor to the fireplace there she took a pitcher of water from the coals and poured some into the small earthenware ewer that was set on the hearth along with a soft cloth returning to the bed she set the ewer on the side table and began to bathe his masculine parts he was very surprised but she explained they do this in cinnebar so that no pleasure has to be foregone the second or third or fourth time third or fourth time he queried her swallowing hard aye she replied bathing her own female parts carefully before his eager eyes when this night is over my lord husband you will have even more reason to feel sorry for your cousin edward and so saying she went to the window opened the shutter and threw out the water in the basin laughing as the wind and snow blew into their chamber and the fire blazed higher for a minute closing the shutter she replaced the ewer and its cloth on the hearth and returned to the comfort of his arms i know something edward never knew about you he told her you are a sorceress my welsh wife and i am under your spell then he kissed her softly at first his lips tracing a path over her eyelids cheeks and nose then more fiercely their mouths fused together their tongues playful and teasing he was caught by surprise when she pushed him upon his back and bestrode him her thighs holding him firmly reaching up she undid her hair which was already half undone by their earlier love play tossing the pins carelessly aside she let her tresses fall like a rich golden mantle about her then her hands reached out for him and she began to smooth her palms in circles over his chest we must have scented oils in a basket by our bed she told him i will rub them into your skin husband and it will give you great pleasure her center fingers began rubbing themselves over his sensitive nipples leaning forward briefly she kissed him even as she pinched his nipples hard catching his cry of surprise within her mouth then leaning back again she nibbled thoughtfully upon a finger for a moment suddenly a wicked smile suffused her features and rhonwyn turned her body about upon his torso her fingers reached out for his manhood which was showing definite signs of awakening learned this in the harem she told him as she reached beneath him to press a finger against a sensitive spot that he had never even known existed jesu mary he groaned as fire began to pour through his veins and her hand tortured his twin jewels with teasing caresses rhonwyn inclined her body forward her fingers running up and down his stiffening manhood her pointed little tongue encircled the fiery head of his weapon several times and then she took him into her mouth suckling upon as much of his length as she could rousing him into such a frenzy that he began to groan when she determined that he had had as much as he could stand without spilling his seed she ceased the sweet torment and turned her body back to face him his big hands fastened themselves about her narrow waist and lifting her up he lowered her again delving deep into her hot softness his hands fastened themselves about her round breasts and he began to fondle them their eyes met suddenly and she smiled at him her hands bracing themselves as she began to ride him slowly at first and then with increasing vigor his eyes closed and he almost wept with the pleasure she was giving him seeing him lost in his passion rhownyns green eyes closed too and she gave herself to the moment he was hard and strong he filled her so completely that she sensed he was touching her womb she tightened the muscles of her love sheath about him and he cried out with his delight then without warning he released her breasts took her by the shoulders and rolled her beneath him his hard thighs imprisoned her as he pushed himself deeper and deeper within her body her legs wrapped themselves about him and she whimpered with the pleasure they were sharing there seemed to be no real beginning or end to their heated encounter she felt herself soaring higher and higher and higher she knew he was with her and clung hard to him i cant stop he whispered desperately in her ear i dont want you to she responded oh rafe i have never known a lover like you my darling nor i he answered he wanted to go on and on forever with her but then his body betrayed them and his love juices gushed forth he cried out in his anguish but then the sound of her own pleasure reached his ears she had released her own passion with his his arms enfolded her tightly half in comfort half with his deep love for her they fell asleep their bodies still locked together and intertwined when they woke an hour or more later his manhood was hard once again as it rested within her lush body you are amazing she said softly moving with him in the cadence of passionate lust only for you he declared only for you my wife his hard body pinioned her beneath him as he once again brought them to a sweet fulfillment demanding to know afterward was your caliph as passionate wife aye and sometimes more so but he did not really love me rafe he only desired me i was told passion is better shared by two people who love one another until now i did not know the wonder of it all only with you husband only with you from that moment on they were as one during the snowiest winter in memory they spent a great deal of time making love to one another there was after all little else to do until the spring rhonwyn realized she was happier than she had ever been in all of her life rafe found a peace unlike any he had ever known since he had found himself responsible for ardley and his sister katherine it was so different with rhonwyn his beautiful wife with her exciting erotic erudition and her independent spirit she had taken up her weapons again practicing with her two grizzled welsh retainers oth and dewi in the snowy stableyards he remembered edwards complaints about such activities but rafe found his wifes skills fascinating he didnt bother to ask where the alborium she used with such proficiency had come from for he knew the answer would have really been no answer at all he had absolutely no fear for her as she wielded her sword and a main gauche she was to his eyes one hell of a fighter and certainly far better than he had ever been with weapons fortunately this knowledge did not disturb him at all edward of course had been less certain of himself and rhonwyns nontraditional skills had been a great source of irritation to him despite his fondness for her i am the better husband for rhonwyn rafe thought the winter slowly disappeared and there was a great deal of new life at ardley the ewe sheep had lambed well and there were a goodly number of his cows who had calved the offspring dotted the green hillsides as the spring progressed the fields were plowed and the seed distributed for planting rhonwyn actually found herself busy with housewifely duties such as airing the featherbeds and picking violets to candy they rode together and hunted rabbits one day glynn appeared in the brown robes of a benedictine to tell them he had indeed joined the order at shrewsbury abbey and while it would be a year or more before he took his final vows he was happy and your music little brother what of your music rhonwyn asked him are you allowed to sing and play aye he replied with a smile and the music i make now is to gods glory it is the very best i have ever done reaching out he took his sisters hand in his you are happy rhonwyn really happy and i am glad to see it i love him she said simply he loves you glynn responded and that is another cause for my happiness now i expect nephews and nieces in good order sister she laughed if you do not get them it shall not be from want of trying on our part then she grew more serious you have not just come for the reasons you gave brother what is the truth our kith and kin in wales are causing difficulties once again sister we hear things more often in the abbey than outsiders would tad it is said attempts to wriggle out of his oaths to king edward tads enemies seek to unseat him but this time they may have english aid in their endeavors there are many who seek the kings favor and will do whatever they must to gain it you are llywelyn ap gruffydds daughter and therefore you are vulnerable once the king has solidified his position he will turn an eye to wales and the problems our father is causing if i am recalled i will be considered little threat in my abbey but you sister may find yourself a pawn in this matter how so glynn rafe de beaulieu asked his brotherinlaw it is not the english you need fear glynn answered rhonwyn is your wife and they will expect you to keep her in order he smiled at them both and there was a twinkle in his eye not knowing my sister of course it is our welsh brethren who could prove dangerous pray god you have no children right now tads enemies will do whatever they must to harm him be vigilant rafe nodded what of oth and dewi he asked glynn they are loyal to my sister and therefore to you as well even against their welsh brothers rafe said we are their family first glynn responded they would not betray us to tads enemies we will be watchful rafe assured glynn and i thank you for your warning when will i see you again rhonwyn asked her brother when you come to shrewsbury sister he told her the abbot allowed me to come to ardley only because he knows the truth of my identity and understood the seriousness of the situation now you see what marrying ap gruffydds daughter has gained you rhonwyn teased her husband later that night as they lay abed he took up a lock of her golden hair and kissed it aye he drawled softly you are a dangerous woman wife our connection makes your position potentially hazardous rafe she said seriously the welsh are fierce fighters and you know what is said of them that they pray on their knees and their neighbors i would not want to see ardley destroyed because of me or my father you worry too much he told her and let his fingers caress the nape of her neck do not fret dearling i will protect you hah i may very well have to protect you she laughed and he chuckled at her sly observation not in the least offended if it comes to that i will welcome your fighting skills wife but for now it is your other skills i prefer his hand tightened on her neck and tilting her head back he kissed her hungrily his mouth was hard his lips scorched her lips wet and hot and eager devil she murmured when he finally took his mouth from hers she twisted her body subtly rubbing against him teasingly witch he returned attempting to hold her still but she was quicker than he was and squirmed from his grip turning her body and steadying herself as she straddled his torso her tempting little bottom facing him revealing her sex to him with its little jewel that peeped from beneath the coral flesh he groaned with pleasure as she leaned forward and took his manhood into her mouth bending he offered her the same service his tongue finding her sensitivity and working her fiercely until she cried out releasing his aching member that now longed to bury itself within her oh rafe she sighed as she rolled herself onto her back and held out her arms to him sliding between her legs he entered her hot wet love channel filling her completely and then he lay still for a moment atop her her breasts were soft beneath his chest her torso was silken he could feel her fingers tangling in his dark hair kneading at his scalp with her anticipation raising himself slightly on one hand he pushed a finger into her mouth and she sucked at it so hard he thought she would swallow it he withdrew slightly and then thrust hard into her again and she whimpered with her desire how often in the months since she had given herself to him had she controlled their passion with her wonderful and varied sexual games tonight however he wanted to be in charge pushing himself up he sat upon her thighs his throbbing member deep within her body please she whispered i am not ready he said softly his hands reaching out to fondle her sweet round breasts you are as hard as rock within me she half sobbed aye and i would remain that way for now was your master the caliph always in such a hurry wife he moved subtly on her old men are frequently in haste lest they lose their ardor he gently squeezed the soft twin mounds he ccomplained as do yyou oh god i want it she cried desperately he reached out and took her little jewel between his thumb and his forefinger pinching the sensitive flesh until she was half mad with the pleasure he was arousing within her there wife you see what delights can be attained when you are not so damnably eager he covered her body again with his and began to piston her in earnest his torso meeting hers with a fierce force until they were both mindless with their shared lust and moaning with their fulfillment when his love juices had filled her however he remained within her body his lips met hers with gentle passion and they kissed and kissed until he was once again hard with his desire for her she had always held a little bit of herself back but this night rhonwyn could not restrain her own passions and yielded every bit of her love to him without question she felt both weak and strong at the same time he overwhelmed her with his hunger for her and yet she felt freer than she had ever felt in all of her life and she was not afraid wrapping her legs about him she encouraged his ardor until they were both weak again and replete with pleasure then she wept in his arms with her happiness and rafe de beaulieu understood what it was that rhonwyn had finally given him his arms tightened about her and his big hand smoothed the tangle of her golden hair as he made unintelligible soothing noises to comfort her finally he whispered to her wife do you not know how much i love you i have told you often enough there has never been a love as sweet as ours she sobbed i wish i had been a virgin for you my darling oh i do rafe laughed thank god you were not rhonwyn mine i far prefer your skills and expertise in the arts of love to artless innocence truly she looked into his face anxiously and her lashes were spikey wet clumps truly he nodded edward i suspect did little for you but your caliph was obviously a man of sophistication he overcame your fears and taught you well how to please a husband i am grateful to him my love but i am also very jealous should you ever turn a lustful eye on any man but me i will kill you with my bare hands truly she teased her look wideeyed and ingenuous he swiftly turned her over and spanked her bottom a loving smack truly you provocative witch he told her as she squealed with her surprise then he gave her another spank for emphasis rhonwyn rolled over oh i think i like that she said wickedly would you like to spank me again husband i can be very naughty you know he laughed and gave her a quick kiss woman you are quite wicked enough as it is now let us get some rest if i am to be alert to your wild welsh kin then i must sleep he yanked the coverlet over them wrapping his arms about her and falling asleep almost immediately rhonwyn snuggled against him breathing in the male scent of him a small smile touched her lips i wonder she thought if it is right to be so damned happy then she closed her eyes and slept the summer came and with it a messenger from haven castle telling them that the lady katherine had been safely delivered of a second son rafe and rhonwyn were asked to come to haven to stand as henry de beaulieus godparents bless your sister rhonwyn chuckled she will have peace within the de beaulieu family in spite of edward for all his bluster she rules him with a firm hand i wonder that we were chosen wee henrys godparents it was certainly not edwards choice but we will go and please kate rafe said and you and edward will not snipe at one another do not be jealous husband she replied stroking his cheek with her hand how could i feel anything for edward when i am so madly in love with you then standing on tiptoes she gave him a quick kiss do not think to cajole me so easily wife he said i am wise to your clever ways rhonwyn he shook a warning finger at her and you love them all as you do me she taunted him do you not rafe she gave him another quick kiss he laughed you are impossible wife he told her would you have me any other way husband nay i would not he admitted haven castle was a two days ride from ardley how odd it was to be returning there rhonwyn thought as they approached it she remembered the first time she had seen haven as she came with her father to marry edward de beaulieu how impressed she had been by the beauty of the castle how frightened and yet how hopeful her innocent heart had been when she met edward she had never been like other girls by the very nature of her upbringing when he had demanded his marital rights and she had bargained with him to gain custody of glynn edward had been angry she suspected he had never forgiven her how shocked he had been by her skill with weapons why could he not like rafe have appreciated her expertise with the alborium and the sword perhaps that was why he had been so ready to declare her dead when she had been captured by the infidels rhonwyn smiled wryly to herself poor edward kate was the better wife for him and rhonwyn was certainly the best wife for rafe this would be the second time since her marriage to rafe that they had come together as a family it had not been a successful meeting last martinmas kate greeted them joyously coming slowly across the hall to meet them you have come mab bring the baby so his godparents may view him come and sit with me brother rhonwyn where is the wine for our guests you are pale her brother said a note of concern in his voice he took her little hand in his and kissed it the baby was brought and he looked exactly as his older brother had looked the previous year he is your spit rhonwyn remarked cheerfully to the castles lord aye edward replied proudly two fine sons in two years and more to come i promise you perhaps you will wait a bit before you make another rhonwyn said quietly kate looks tired and should have a rest are you jealous then lady that i can get sons on katherine so easily when i could not get them on you he said belligerently rhonwyn swallowed hard i think of kate and so should you edward it is not easy i am told to conceive and bear new life if you love your wife you will give her time to recover from this birth two sons in two years is hard on a woman if on the other hand your pride in your randy cock and kates fertile womb are greater than your love for her you will kill your wife sooner than later but then you would take another wife as quickly as you could find one would you not that it would seem is your custom she smiled sweetly rafe held back his laughter instead saying rhonwyn in a warning tone secretly he agreed with his fiery wife outspoken as ever edward said meanly rafe should beat you he finds loving me works better rhonwyn snapped what you actually allow him between your legs lady as often as he desires me and that is quite often she snarled enough rafe said in a harsh voice oh yes please kate said let there be peace between you two we are a family and must be united i apologize kate rhonwyn said softly i shall try and behave for your sake when is the baptism tomorrow her sisterinlaw said then we shall be able to return to ardley afterward oh will you not remain longer kate pleaded we cannot rafe spoke up quickly rhonwyn is in the midst of making soap and conserves and i must supervise the building of a new granary we must have before the harvest next month do you not have a bailiff to do such work edward asked why should i hire a bailiff to do what i am capable of rafe replied i am not the master of a castle edward i have but a small manor greatly enriched by additional lands since your marriage his cousin said sourly which reminds me rafe continued you have not yet repaid rhonwyns dower and we will be wed a year next month you will have to wait until i sell some cattle edward replied i will take the cattle in exchange for the coin rafe said this is not a debt you want outstanding edward what an excellent solution katherine de beaulieu quickly spoke up is it not my lord now you may avoid all that fuss of driving the cattle to market and the haggling that goes with it indeed my love you are correct edward said with a smile at his pretty wife kate smiled back secretly relieved to have avoided any further argument she was very tired and had not the strength to mediate between her husband her brother and rhonwyn who was so damned prickly although she was trying not to be kate had had to give her elder son to a wet nurse as she could not nurse both children but even so the new child had a healthy appetite that exhausted her he persisted in nursing every two hours henry john de beaulieu was baptized the following day at midmorning afterward his family drank a toast to him in the great hall of haven castle the baby had howled loudly as father john had poured the holy water upon his fuzzy head and everyone in the church had smiled the infants cries were an assurance that the devil was leaving him rhonwyn held her godson and when he turned and nuzzled at her breast she felt an odd sensation surge through her body she continued to cradle henry in the hall until finally his nurse took him away but not before she had kissed his little downy head then and there she realized with surprise that she wanted a child of her own so rafe said coming to stand by her side i see in your eyes that you have decided to stop drinking that brew of yours each morning you knew she was amazed and quick tears filled her eyes he had known she was preventing conception yet he had not forbid her even though it went against him and the church you have been forced your whole life why would i make you have a child until you were ready i know i am capable of making babies for i have two bastards at ardley besides i am a selfish man wife and have been enjoying our shared passion if you now want a babe then we shall work very hard at making one he kissed her forehead and brushed away the tears that slipped down her cheek i do love you she said softly to him i know he replied devil she smiled at him witch he rejoined seeing them a shadow crossed edward de beaulieus handsome features why had rhonwyn not loved him the way she obviously loved his cousin rafe he would never understand it but he had at least been fortunate in his katherine he had no doubts regarding his sweet wife and he knew he never would still he could not help but envy the fire that so obviously burned hotly between rhonwyn and rafe why had not such a fire burned between him and rhonwyn over katherines gentle protests her brother and his wife departed for their own home but not before rafe had taken edward aside rhonwyn is right he told his cousin kate is fragile and she is now well worn with giving you two sons in so short a time if you cannot contain your lust find a willing serf upon which to slake your desires you do not want to kill my sister with your loving cousin i know you are right though it galls me to be chided by you edward replied still i do love katherine and i would not harm her i will do as you advise if i cannot contain my lust rafe grinned good he said then i shall not have to kill you cousin edward laughed and the tension was broken between them tell me he said do you truly love rhonwyn aye rafe said not in the least offended and she loves you aye his cousin drawled do not fret yourself wondering about all that has happened between us edward kate is the perfect wife for you and rhonwyn is the perfect wife for me what came before doesnt matter let us both be content with what we have and thank god chapter they had been wed a year and they celebrated the occasion on lammastide as the early harvest began it had been a good year and the manor prospered as it never before had you are good luck for ardley rafe told his wife the weather has been particularly favorable this summer the more practical rhonwyn said with a smile the grain was reaped and stored in the new stone granary the apples and the pears were gathered cider was made from some of the fruit the rest was stored in a cool stone cellar like the good chatelaine she was rhonwyn sat with the female serfs on the late summer days picking straw and other bits of dirt from the wool that had been sheared from the sheep earlier in the summer it would have to be washed before it was carded and then spun into cloth it was a timeconsuming labor but it allowed her to get to know the women on the manor and it permitted them to know her it was soon decided that the masters wife was not just a pretty face but a hard worker with no fancy pretentions this decision having been made the women were rhonwyns own from that moment on no matter she played with weapons or was welsh she was a good lady the world about them seemed peaceful enough they had had no visitors since glynn had come earlier in summer to warn them of ap gruffydds disobedience and that his enemies were plotting with the english against him king henry had died the previous november and king edward trusting in his mothers ability to maintain order in england was slowly wending his way back there he was not expected to return before next year but when he came he would exert his authority over prince llywelyn and the welsh rhonwyn knew but perhaps she thought her father just pressed the english while the the king was out of the country surely ap gruffydd was wise enough to know that when edward returned he must give sway to the man to whom he had pledged his fealty it was his duty and the honorable thing to do duty and honor were something that rhonwyn knew her father understood september passed and then october rhonwyn loved the autumn it had always been her favorite time of year now she and rafe spent the daylight hours each day out hunting with their men as they prepared for the long winter to come the deer were wonderfully fat that year and soon the winters supply of meat was more than ample although rafe would see his people were fed during the cold months he still allowed them to glean in the fields hunt for rabbits twice a month in his woods and fish in his streams one day a week he was a generous master and his people were loyal to him because of it it was enit who noticed that her mistresss link with the moon had not been broken now in seven weeks she had also noticed that rhonwyns appetite was peckish lady she said one morning as the two women were in the garderobe going over rhonwyns gowns to see what needed mending i think you may be with child you have had no show of blood in many weeks now and your food does not seem to agree with you these are all signs of a breeding woman i know this from my mother is it possible rhonwyn wondered aloud there is a midwife on the manor lady she is maybel the millers wife perhaps you should go and see her well go today and you will come with me rhonwyn said if i am seen going alone there will be gossip there will be gossip anyway enit replied dryly but no matter if you are with child all will be joyous for you and the master they went to visit the millers wife she took one look at her mistress and nodded saying aye you are with child lady god be praised then she beamed a sweet smile at them how can you tell by just looking at me rhonwyn demanded surely there was more to it than that why i can see it in your eyes my lady the millers wife said and in your face it glows with an inner radiance that only a breeding woman has still i will listen to your symptoms she aint had a show of blood in seven and a half weeks now and her food dont agree even her favorite blankmanger enit said before her mistress might even open her mouth breasts tender maybel asked bluntly rhonwyn nodded belly feels swollen but dont look it oh yes rhonwyn said last show of blood last week in august enit spoke up again the child will be born in the beginning of june maybel pronounced and i will be here to deliver it for you my lady you need have no fears for you are a healthy lass but no galloping about the countryside from now on a nice gentle walk or the cart for you my lady and no more battling with your sword with those two welshmen of yours until after the birth what if you had an accident my lady i am too skilled for accidents rhonwyn said proudly i shall tell the master maybel replied calmly oh very well rhonwyn muttered irritably both maybel and enit hid a smile not a word of this until i have told rafe rhonwyn told them both i dont want it all over the manor until he knows he will want time to crow and swagger she chuckled and her two companions laughed heartily for they fully understood that their lord would behave as if he were the first man to father a child on his wife wrapping her cloak about her rhonwyn left enit and maybel and walked out across the meadow the sun was shining today but the air was cool the trees bereft of their leaves a baby within her a new life was growing at this very moment as she walked was it a son she carried or a daughter a baby they were going to have a baby and it had happened so quickly she had ceased taking her secret brew only a few months ago a baby a new life to nurture but what did she know about being a mother and would what happened to her mother happen to her would she die in childbirth nay she shook the frightening thought off vala had birthed both her daughter and her son easily it had only been with that last child she had suffered but then she had been so frightened that it was the child of her rape and not ap gruffydds and in retrospect rhonwyn was never certain that her mother hadnt in a moment of pure madness tried to force that last child from her womb before its time and in doing so caused her own demise f will pray she thought and i will ask my aunt to pray along with her entire abbey their prayers will surely keep me safe a baby rafe and i are having a baby rafe she had to find her husband and tell him this marvelous news before he heard it elsewhere for rhonwyn had no doubt that the entire manor would know before long turning she ran back across the meadow the sheep scattering before her her cloak flying in the breeze rafe rafe rafe he heard his name being called called with great urgency it was rhonwyns voice my god was it the welsh he dashed from the stables where he had been discussing several matters with the leathersmith and saw her racing toward him he caught her in his arms looking anxiously into her face what is it rhonwyn i am with child she cried and then burst into tears his arms tightened about her a huge delighted grin split his handsome face a baby we are having a baby wife she nodded sniffling happily aye husband we are since i took you for my wife he said i did not think i could be any happier but you have proved me wrong rhonwyn my heart is so full that it is in danger of bursting with the joy your news has given me how i love you rhonwyn my wife howi love you he kissed her hard upon the lips and then kissed away the tears on her cheeks but what if it is a girl and not a son she fretted we shall call her anghard and she will look just like her beautiful mother he replied gallantly i dont care if its a girl wife my two bastards are daughters when they are grown they shall serve their half sister eh you would give a daughter a welsh name she was surprised her mother is a welsh princess he replied her mother was raised up in a fortress of men and treated no differently than any young lad princess indeed rhonwyn laughed her palms rested flat against his chest i am nought but a simple lass she told him teasingly he smiled down at her his silver blue eyes warm with his love nay dearling you are no simple lass and well you know it but i love you nonetheless now when is this child of ours due maybel says the beginning of june rhonwyn told him no more swordplay with oth and dewi wife he said sternly yes my lord she replied and no more hunting until after the child is born he continued yes my lord im glad to see that being with child has at last rendered you a sensible woman he mocked her then ducked as she pulled away from him and hit his shoulder with her fist i have always been sensible she said indignantly rafe de beaulieu laughed heartily and happily taking the little hand that assaulted him and kissing it he was going to have a legitimate heir at last you rhonwyn my wife are wonderful he told her with another smile and then picked her up and carried her to the house while she laughed he had never lived with a breeding woman and the experience was certainly unique to say the least rhonwyn at first raced between great euphoria when everything was simply perfect and deep sorrow when she would for no visible reason weep great sobs and tears the tiniest thing could set her off and it was usually when they made love for maybel had explained how they might without injuring the child but most times she would shed tears as he entered her ripening bodytears of happiness she always assured him but it was extremely unnerving finally in january she became peaceful and serene her breasts and her belly swelled with the evidence of the new life she was carrying and would nurture come the summer she loved to have him stroke her expanding belly with his hands for it seemed to soothe her greatly he rubbed her back and elicited purrs of contentment her breasts however were so sensitive that she could not bear to have them touched for too long a time it frustrated him for he loved those sweet orbs but he respected her wishes a breeding woman must be catered to his sister assured him and to his surprise his brotherinlaw agreed there had been no deep snow at candlemas and so kate and edward had come for a visit almost at once the two women seated themselves by the fire talking and laughing together edward smiled a superior smile they get like that when they are with child he said congratulations i did not think you would get a child on her rafe she is not the woman you were wed to cousin rafe replied her caliph taught her to revel in and appreciate passion how can you bear that another man knew her edward demanded in a tight voice it is as if she were a widow rafe responded why are you so angry with her edward she was faithful to you and she is faithful to me what more can a man want she was not faithful to me edward de beaulieu said angrily she lay with this infidel and was shameless in admitting it she was a captive edward would you have had her die rather than yield herself to this other man you gave her up without even knowing if she were really dead within two months of her disappearance you wrote and asked to have kate for your wife at least rhonwyn was faithful in her heart to you edward you were certainly not faithful in your heart to her you hurried home wed my sister and got her with child as quickly as you could rhonwyn plotted to avoid giving the caliph a child and planned her escape so she might return to you do not be angry because you lost the opportunity to know what she is really like i shall tell you cousin she is warm and passionate and loving to me asmy sister is to you the spring finally came and with it rhonwyns moods turned again this time she was waspish and shrewish as her body swelled and it became difficult to both sit and walk i am no better than an old sow she grumbled you are beautiful he assured her a beautiful fat sow about to litter she groused it will be all right wife he tried to soothe her she glared at him pityingly what on earth can a man know about having a baby inside of him squirming and kicking i can barely stand want to pee constantly my navel has turned itself inside out and you think its going to be all right rafe that is the stupidest thing i have ever heard any man say he didnt know whether to laugh or scold her either one he realized would meet with the sharp edge of her tongue he wisely remained silent and then on the first of june rhonwyn went into labor maybel and enit by her side if you ever do this to me again his wife shrieked at him i will kill you ahhhh ohhhh god i hate you rafe de beaulieu fled the solar and wisely retreated outside away from what was very obviously womans work from the open windows he could hear rhonwyn cursing with her efforts finally as the sun was near to setting and the day was prepared to melt into a long summers twilight rafe de beaulieu heard the cry of a child the sound was strong and angry he raced into the house and up the staircase bursting into the solar to find rhonwyn smiling and cradling an infant you have a son my lord she told him cheerfully she held out the baby still bloody with the birth and his father took him into his hands welcome justin de beaulieu rafe said softly and then looking at rhonwyn he said thank you wife give him to enit she commanded a maternal tone in her voice why justin today tis st justins feast day wife he told her i like it rhonwyn told him tis a strong name and he will not be like every edward or henry or john i suppose we shall have to name the others with those names you said you didnt want any others he said surprised what when did i ever say such a thing rhonwyn said indignantly ot course we are going to have more children rafe we must have at least two more sons and a daughter or two for me i promised a daughter to my aunt the other must make a fine marriage what foolishness who ever heard of just one child she laughed just take her at her word my lord maybel murmured softly women are strange in the last weeks of childbirth but all is well once they have given birth to their babe katherine and edward were called from haven to stand as justins godparents father john came with them kate cooed over the baby and said he was quite the handsomest little fellow she had ever seen excluding her own two boys have you sent word to your father she asked rhonwyn aye rhonwyn said shortly and brother glynn rhonwyn smiled broadly i know he is excited for us kate i only wish he might have been here but he is not allowed to travel until next year even to see us when the next child comes he shall be its godparent perhaps we shall go to shrewsbury before next winter and visit him at the abbey i know that will be permitted they say king edward has come home soon we will have a coronation although edward and i shall not be invited only the great lords and those attempting to curry favor will go let them rhonwyn said i prefer my simple life here at ardley as you prefer your life at haven we are through with the powerful at least until it comes time to marry off our children i was hoping you would have a daughter for our little ned kate said but he is only two and there is plenty of time for you to have a little girl i would like a daughter rhonwyn admitted i am so glad you finally had a child kate told her sisterinlaw i was so afraid that you were barren edward said you probably were because of your boyish activities and you will be wed two years this lammastide i prayed to saint anne rhonwyn said piously silently furious that her former husband that betrayer should have spoken of her so if he werent married to rafes sister she thought i would slice his ears off for that insult barren indeed in early september they took justin to meet his uncle in shrewsbury glynn was delighted by their visit and the abbot freed him from his duties to spend time with his sister and her family justin was a fat and goodnatured infant with his fathers gray blue eyes and a fuzz of gold upon his mostly bald pate he cooed smiled and drooled for his uncle who was mightily impressed and said so as justin grabbed glynns finger and attempted to put it in his mouthexcept he could not quite find his mouth to match the finger with it they returned to ardley prepared to finish the harvest and ready the manor for the coming winter in shrewsbury they had learned that the king had been crowned at westminster on august nineteenth they planned to share their gossip with edward and kate and were surprised to find edward awaiting them where the hell have you been the lord of haven demanded of his cousin ignoring rhonwyn completely i have been here for several hours your servants said you were due back today but they did not know when you would come we have been in shrewsbury to see glynn and show him his nephew rafe replied what is the matter with you edward katherine has been kidnapped what both rafe and rhonwyn spoke at once my wife has been kidnapped he turned his gaze upon rhonwyn and it is all your fault damn you my fault rhonwyn was astounded why should it be my fault edward i bear you and kate no ill will the welsh have taken her he half shouted they thought she was you me why would the welsh want to kidnap me not you ap gruffydds daughter he roared jesu rafe exploded of course rhonwyn exclaimed what is it both men asked her at once it could be any of several reasons rhonwyn explained it is possible someone wishes to curry favor with king edward and thinks to hold me hostage in exchange for my fathers good behavior or it could be that someone simply wants to topple prince llywelyn and means to do it by threatening him with his daughters life i would not expect my father to bargain for my life and he knows that i comprehend him well enough to understand that had i been kidnapped i should have attempted escape but failing that i would fling myself from a battlement before i would allow my fathers fate to be directed by such a dishonorable act either way they have the wrong woman and we must find out where poor kate is and mount a rescue what a pity you did not think this same way when you were captured by the infidels edward said bitterly then he staggered back as rhonwyn slapped him as hard as she might how dare you preach to me you pompous bastard she shouted this is an entirely different situation that kate finds herself in than the one in which i found myself i stayed alive to come home to you edward but you did not care enough for me to wait this however is not about you or about me it is kate we have to think of now agreed rafe said quietly putting an arm about his wife swallow your bruised pride edward and finally accept that by acting in haste you lost rhonwyn but a merciful god allowed you to gain a good wife in my sister put her first and let us decide how we are to proceed wine rhonwyn called to her servants and then she led them to the fireplace and motioned the two men to sit down even as she took the tapestried chair we must find out who has taken kate and where they are to this end i will send a messenger to my father telling him what has happened to her so he may be on his guard against any other betrayal where was kate when she was taken edward and where were you when it happened word had come from my village of ainslea that fever had broken out among the children katherine good chatelaine she is packed up her medicines and herbs and rode off with her serving woman to minister to the sick when she did not return by late the next day nor had sent any message i went with a half dozen menatarms to learn why i found the village burnt and looted the women and children had been taken off as slaves and the men slain but for one elderly man they left alive to tell me of what had happened he said they told him to tell the lord of haven castle that the welsh had stolen his wife and that they wanted no ransom they merely wanted possession of ap gruffydds daughter for a bit she would be returned alive eventually if i made no effort to follow them edward swallowed down the entire contents of his goblet then flung the cup aside his head in his hands jesu jesu what am i to do my sweet kate is not used to a rough life as you are rhonwyn she will die for certain i should have been able to protect her kate is strong rafe said they believe she is ap gruffydds daughter and so she will be safe for they only want her person for leverage against the prince for one reason or another but what if they learn she is not ap gruffydds daughter they are unlikely to rhonwyn said none but the men at cythraul and the nuns at my aunts abbey knew who i was nor what i looked like few of you english do either daughters of great men particularly bastard daughters are of no importance but for the marriages they make these men who stole kate away did not know that our marriage had been dissolved edward and that you had remarried another they thought kate was me and kate is clever enough to keep them believing it in this part of the world the english if they cannot speak our tongue at least undersand enough of it to get by she looked to her husband did kate aye actually she used to converse fairly well in your tonguetwisting language wife rafe said with a small smile we had a welsh nurse as children then having understood them from the first kate will continue to make them believe she is ap gruffydds daughter and be safe rhonwyn said now we must learn just who has stolen her and for that i will go into wales and meet with my father the messenger who finds him will tell him to come to cythraul it is the obvious place why should you go edward demanded angrily i should go hah rhonwyn said mockingly do you think my father will speak with you edward de beaulieu or give you his full cooperation after what you did to me llywelyn ap gruffydd is just as apt to kill you as speak with you you mean nought to him you have no blood tie with him go home and find a wet nurse for my godson who will die without his mother if you do not rafe and i will go into wales and retrieve kate for you there is no shame in your remaining with your sons my lord what of your son my milk was not rich enough for justin and he already has a wet nurse rhonwyn said sadly go home edward and wait for us to send word she patted his hand in a kindly fashion for the first time realizing that her bitterness toward him was now entirely gone then she said and edward please i beg of you do not attempt to follow us or join us at cythraul it is likely that kates captors know you by sight they will not know who rafe and i are however trust us i always trusted you rhonwyn he said quietly she shook her head nay you did not but that is water beneath the bridge long past edward my anger is gone and i only wish to bring kate home safely to you go now and watch over your sons kate would want that he nodded and then took up her gloved hand kissing it thank you he said she nodded not yet my friend when edward de beaulieu had gone and they sat at their high board eating venison stew rafe said well need a good nights sleep if we are to start off tomorrow he tore a chunk of bread from the cottage loaf and sopped up some of the stews winey gravy before popping it into his mouth nay well go the day after tomorrow rhonwyn answered him i want to send oth off in the morning to find my father hell need a days start then you dewi and i will go to cythraul just the three of us he was surprised i have a fortress of menatarms who are loyal to my father we will only attract attention if we ride out to wales with a large party rafe this is a battle that will be won with subtlety not blunt force i did not think your father was a man of subtlety he said he can be when necessary you have never met ap gruffydd do not prejudge him by the gossip you have heard he is a great man for all our differences he has welded together a country of petty princelings and lords and held firm aye he has enemies do not all powerful men husband will you tell me that our own king edward has no enemies among his subjects that there are not those eager to do him a mischief given the opportunity how did a little lass raised in a hill fort learn so much about the powerful he asked her men claim that women gossip but they talk more i listened she replied with a smile no one paid attention to a small child by the fireside rafe they chattered and bragged and boasted and i harvested their words for the truth i did not learn how to weave or cook or sew at cythraul i did not learn manners or about god or how to play a musical instrument i learned how to wield my alborium and my sword i learned how men rule and what drives them to rule for a woman it was a mostly useless education now however i will dredge up all the knowledge i gained at cythraul and it will help me to win your sisters freedom i think he said slowly that i should be afraid of you rhonwyn uerch llywelyn of your mother there is nought said but much is spoken of your father and you are obviously very much llywelyns daughter i know she answered him it is something i have fought against my whole life rafe but the truth is i very much like who i am there is they say no escaping blood then she took his hand up and began to lick the gravy from his fingers we will be on the road for several nights and then at cythraul where there is i promise you no privacy she began to suck on his forefinger their eyes met and then he pulled his hand from her sensual embrace taking up his goblet he drew the potent wine into his mouth while pulling her head to him as their lips met he transferred the liquid from his mouth into hers his tongue sliding past her teeth to meet with her tongue among the heady hot fumes of the wine as he broke the long sweet kiss rafe murmured to her you are far too conventional wife there are places other than a bed where a man and a woman may take their pleasure come he stood and took her by the hand leading her before the hall fire rhonwyns green eyes widened the servants she managed to gasp as he pulled her down to the sheepskin before the hearth i see no servants he murmured his hand sliding beneath her skirts to caress her legs flint her head motioned to the dog sleeping near them will understand perfectly rafe said softly kissing her his lean body pinioning her down thank god we have no priest here she said oh his fingers had found what they sought and began to tease at her sensitive flesh rafe we cant not here oh holy mary this was so damnably exciting and dangerous what if they were discovered tis our house and we are the master and the mistress here he said divining her thoughts with accuracy she was he knew despite her protests enjoying every minute of their liaison for she was already creamy with her love juices he pushed her skirts above her waist and in a single smooth motion entered her body tis wicked she avowed but faintly oh god he felt so good inside of her with a deep sigh she let herself be carried away her emerald eyes closing slowly in blissful anticipation of what was to come next oh rafe her arms tightened about him he grinned down at her she was a wicked welsh hussy and he adored her with every fiber of his being vixen he said softly his buttocks contracting and releasing as he pleasured them both devil she murmured back wrapping her legs about him so he might delve deeper into her eager flesh he could feel her body quivering as she reached the pinnacle of satisfaction and as she shuddered over and over again with her release he loosed his own passions with a gusty sigh after several minutes he rolled away from her drawing her skirts down as he pulled his tunic into a semblance of neatness that was deliciously wicked and depraved she said happily her eyes were still closed savoring the remaining bits and pieces of their pleasure before it faded away entirely but we couldnt possibly do that at cythraul husband before we go he promised her i shall showyou what we can do at cythraul or anywhere else for that matter wife then rising to his feet he drew her up come on my love and let us find our bed now ive plenty of energy yet left for you and you wont have to fret about the servants i saw how your concern prevented you from fully enjoying our little interlude rhonwyn she laughed unable to contain herself you are a devil rafe de beaulieu the following morning oth was dispatched to find prince llywelyn tell him what has happened and that i will meet him at cythraul this threat must be contained immediately and the lady katherine rescued he will argue with you of course and say that having little love for edward de beaulieu he does not care what happens to his wife then you will tell him that i am begging this boon of him for the lady katherine is my husbands sister and i love her right well niggle at him until he yields oth you know him as i do hell come oth said then he added send dewi into cythraul first to make certain that it is still your tads and has not been taken over by strangers or enemies lady tis good advice i will follow it rhonwyn told him i do not believe tad would allow cythraul out of his control but if the worst has happened we will wait for you by the ruin on the river near cythraul said to belong to the fair folk i will be safe there for my mams sake i know now go oth and god watch over you he kissed her hand and was gone from the hall rhonwyn and rafe spent the day as if nothing were amiss each going about their duties browne the steward and peterman the bailiff were both called into the hall so that rafe might explain the situation to them i will send word when we are to return he assured his servants rhonwyn told enit of the venture you cannot come with me she said i need you here to be certain justin is well cared for in my absence bess is a good nurse to him but sometimes she is absentminded watch her carefully and see my son is safe do not allow the child or his nurse from the house except into the gardens with menatarms guarding them she instructed both enit and browne if those holding lady katherine should learn of their mistake while i am gone justin could be in danger allow no stranger into the house even a religious they nodded with luck and prince llywelyns aid we shall not be gone for too long a time and will return in triumph with kate rafe said amen my lord browne said fervently rafe and rhonwyn would take little but the clothing they wore and their weapons they ate their evening meal early and as they wanted to start just before dawn they departed the hall almost immediately after eating as they reached the landing of the second floor rafe pulled his wife aside and pushed her against the stone wall of the corridor fondle me he growled in her ear licking it and the side of her face i promised you i would show you that a man can take and give pleasure in almost any setting then he groaned as her hands pushed through the fabric of his garments and began to stroke and play amid the badges of his sex ah witch he groaned as her skillful toying had the desired result his hands were beneath her skirts in a trice cupping her buttocks and raising her up to impale her upon his manhood ah he sighed as he entered her wet hot sheath you are always ready for me wife and how i love you for it she gave herself over to the passion of the moment and when they were both most thoroughly sated they stumbled to their bedchamber where enit was awaiting them in the solar with a large bath ready and steaming wonderful rhonwyn enthused we shall not see such luxury for many a day my lord we must take advantage of it while we may she began to pull her garments off as did he enit not in the least disturbed picked up the clothing as it was tossed clucking and scolding them both at their haste well wash each other enit rhonwyn said and taking up the boarsbristle brush she began to scrub her husbands back vigorously then ill take these wretched garments you have both worn to death to the laundress enit said take your time rafe called to her as the door shut they heard enit laugh as she hurried down the stairs how long do you think we have he asked rhonwyn at least half an hour she chuckled good he turned and cupped her full breasts in his two big hands ah i love these sweet fruits he purred in her ear as he fondled them gently he pressed his body against her suggestively im as randy as a billy goat tonight wife he warned she wiggled her bottom into his groin then we shall be randy together rafe my husband the tiny interlude in the hallway was but a taste of what i want from you tonight oh yes so you like that he whispered in her ear as he rubbed his stiffening lance between the twin moons of her bottom ummmm she answered him you are so quickly roused husband because you are so damnably tempting wife he responded she turned about and kissed him slowly what a nice compliment husband she purred then she began licking his face and throat with broad hot sweeps of her little tongue you are salty she said you are sweet he countered his tongue licking at her face her chest and after he lifted her slightly her full breasts they coupled once again the water sloshing about them as their passion rose when they had pleasured each other they washed and exited the tub rhonwyn shaking her head at the puddles thank heavens the floor is stone she remarked as she first dried him with a rough cloth and then herself what will enit think that her master and her mistress were as randy as two billy goats tonight he chuckled and took her hand come wife to bed with you lest we both catch a chill we are off on serious business come the morrow pray god my sister is yet safe she will be safe rafe rhonwyn assured him even if they learned she was not ap gruffydds child they will ransom her to edward the welsh have been called many things by you english but never have we been called foolish we know how to make a groat kate will be safe they climbed naked into their bed and he cradled her in his arms i trust you wife he told her i know rhonwyn said with a small smile that is one of the reasons i love you rafe de beaulieu you really do trust me i love you he said simply now sleep wife rhonwyn smiled again to herself and closed her eyes chapter it had been many years since lady katherine de beaulieu had heard the welsh tongue spoken now however she silently thanked god for her old welsh nurse and her own linguistic abilities at first it was all garble but then gradually her mind focused and she understood the men who held her captive believed she was rhonwyn her first instinct was to tell them they were wrong but then she thought that they might kill her as they had so many in ainslea village reaching out she gently tugged the skirt of her servant mab the woman turned a frightened face to her mistress and kate put a finger to her lips warning mab to silence they believe she whispered softly that i am rhonwyn address me as such else they kill us for their own error what is it you say in that barbaric tongue rhonwyn uerch llywelyn one of her captors asked roughly i am calming my servant kate replied she is frightened by you and by what she has seen this day these english are not strong strong enough when they choose the man laughed who are you and why have you done this kate asked him in time rhonwyn uerch llywelyn was the answer almost all the male inhabitants of ainslea had been slaughtered but for those who had managed to flee the women and the children however were herded together to be driven into wales where they would be sold as slaves one old man was left to tell the tale to any who came seeking the lady of haven castle the village was then fired and the welsh rode off with their captives and their lootfor they had sacked whatever had value including several milk cows the poultry a team of oxen and a small herd of sheep late in the afternoon kate and her servant were taken in a separate direction by four of their captors mab began to whimper again with fright moaning that they were going to be ravaged and killed for certain be silent kate said sharply if they intended such villainy they would not have brought us this distance it is something else and i am interested to learn what they will kill us when they learn the truth mab sobbed you should have told them back in ainslea and surely they would have released us lady nay kate said they would have killed us then for they could not allow me to alert my sisterinlaw to their perfidy whatever it may be i must maintain this masquerade for the time being until i can learn what is afoot then perhaps i may speak the truth or mayhap not mab now pull yourself together lass we will not show these welsh that we are afraid are you lady mab quavered aye i am kate replied i should be a fool not to be fearful mab then she reached out and patted her servants hand in a gesture of comfort giving her a small smile my name is ifan ap daffydd the leader of her captors said we will overnight at a small convent lady if you attempt to escape or try to tell the nuns who you are or that you are captive my men and i will kill the holy women do you understand me aye kate said i do tell your servant what i have said and tell her if she continues to whimper and whine as she has been i will personally slit her throat there are good welsh women at my brothers castle who can serve you you do not need this english cow nonetheless ifan ap daffydd i will have her kate answered him she has been loyal to me since i arrived at haven perhaps you do not value such traits in a servant but i do she is not used to seeing such slaughter as she has viewed this day you will leave her be for she is my responsibility your welsh is odd he said to her i have been living among the english for several years now and have not spoken my own tongue i am surprised that i can recall it at all kate told him blithely besides each end of wales speaks a different dialect ifan ap daffydd yet we all manage to understand each other aye we do especially when it comes to your tad rhonwyn uerch llywelyn he replied and then he laughed when he had ridden ahead again kate explained to mab what had been said couching the welshmans threats in gentler language you must not carry on any longer mab for you are irritating these men and they could punish us both for your behavior i will try mab said you must succeed kate said firmly where are they taking us to the castle of ifan ap daffydds brother whoever he may be kate said from what this ifan has said i suspect it has something to do with the welsh prince but what i do not yet know when they reached the small convent where they were to overnight ifan ap daffydd explained to the porteress that he was escorting his sister to the castle of their brother rhys ap daffydd lord of aberforth they were welcomed and fed and then offered pallets in the guest house the nun apologized that they had but one space for guests and could not separate the sexes i will sleep outside the guesthouse door with my men so my sister may have her privacy ifan ap daffydd said gallantly we are used to sleeping beneath the night sky good sister having seen the interior of the place ifan ap daffydd felt secure for it had but one door and the two windows were too high for his captives to use for escape in the morning they attended prime and then they were given brown bread a snip of cheese and cider before they departed kate took a coin from her purse and pressed it into the hand of the porteress thank you good sister she said will you pray for my sisterinlaw katherine i will my child the nun said what was that all about ifan ap daffydd demanded to know as they rode off i gave the nun a coin from my purse i doubt you thought to do it ifan ap daffydd then i asked her to pray for my sisterinlaw katherine there was no harm in it i spoke our tongue and you were free to hear it it is customary to pay for ones lodging if you can and what with your boasting about taking your sister to your brothers castle it would have been expected that you offer the nuns who sheltered us a small donation for our food and accommodation you men have no sense of propriety he laughed i had heard that you were a firebrand had you she remarked dryly they rode all day and sheltered the second night in a dry cave for there were no religious houses or villages along their route their supper and their breakfast the following morning was roasted rabbit hot in the evening and cold in the morning they slept wrapped in their cloaks on the dirt floor of the cave a fire at its entrance to discourage any wildlife from entering they rode all of the third day finally coming to aberforth castle shortly after the early sunset of that autumn day the castle before them was small but dark and forbidding kate shivered nervously but then pulled herself together as they passed beneath the portcullis into the courtyard when they had dismounted they were led into the castles great hall there were no fireplaces but rather a large stone fire pit in the center of the hall that blazed heating the entire room to kates surprise the stone walls were hung with beautiful tapestries and there were fragrant herbs scattered upon the stone floor that gave off a sweet odor when stepped upon upon the dais was a high board and seated there eating was a richly dressed blackbearded man with piercing dark brown eyes and black hair ifan ap daffydd hurried forth bringing his prisoners with him he bowed low and then straightening he said i have brought rhonwyn uerch llywelyn as you requested my lord brother the lord of aberforth looked up and perused kate you do not look like your mother he said in a rough voice nor do you favor your tad particularly lady however i see ap gruffydds mother in you she had hair your color your mother had hair like gilt thistledown kate was curious and she realized she was expected to reply you knew my mother she said briefly though intimately he chuckled why my lord have you kidnapped me and had me brought here kate demanded to know my husband will be most vexed he is not a wealthy man and cannot be expected to pay you too exorbitant a ransom rhys ap daffydd laughed you have your fathers overweening pride and your mothers spirit he replied i want no ransom from your husband lady it is your father i have occasion to deal with and as he will not listen to reason i thought perhaps if i had custody of his daughter he might be more amenable to ah negotiation you have a quarrel with prince llywelyn and so you have kidnapped me kate was both astounded and outraged you are a coward my lord if you cannot deal with ap gruffydd without threatening a woman of his family i will not help you you do not understand rhonwyn uerch llywelyn rhys said your father has gained his title from the english but nonetheless we have honored that title because it meant that wales was left in peace by the english now your sire refuses to do fealty to king edward thus breaking his bond with england edward longshanks is not an easy man and will not bear this insult when he comes into wales to punish your father we will all suffer for our princes misbehavior i have friends in england who have requested that i reason with your father for all our sakes since he has refused to grant me an audience i must gain his attention in the only way i can by bringing you here to aberforth your father will not allow you to be harmed kate remembered what rhonwyn had said the few rare times she had spoken of her father it was very unlikely that ap gruffydd would come to his daughters aid if it did not serve some good purpose for him kate could see that rhys ap daffydd was no true patriot what he did he was doing for his own gain she suspected he meant to attempt an assassination of llywelyn ap gruffydd when he came to rescue his daughter she saw her own countrys hand in such a plot it was absolutely disgraceful and dishonorable well my lord you can but try to reason with my tad she told him but he never really cared greatly for me as i was not a son what happened to the lad rhys demanded what lad she countered your little brother was the reply glynn oh he died when he was twelve of the pox kate said easily she knew that if she said glynn was a religious in the abbey at shrewsbury glynn might very well find himself in danger too so rhys crowed triumphantly you are llywelyn ap gruffydds only living heir he will come for you female or not if you say so my lord kate told him now i am hungry and i am chilled to the bone as is my servant have me shown to my chamber and have hot food brought to me i should not want to tell my tad that you were a poor host rhys ap daffydd the lord of aberforth laughed heartily they say you were raised roughly in the welshry lady but you speak as if you were truly a princess born i am kate replied loftily then she followed a servant who led her to her chamber when the door had closed behind them she breathed a deep sigh of relief and said in her own english tongue it is obvious that none of these people have ever seen rhonwyn mab and i fooled them i actually convinced them i was she i couldnt understand a word you spoke lady but your manner was fearless and proud what will happen to us now our captor is rhys ap dafydd and he is in league with some of our countrymen i think he means to use the princes daughter to lure ap gruffydd here then i believe he will assassinate him if he can this is to be done to curry favor with king edward and afterward mab ventured i dont know kate answered her servant honestly i dont think they will kill us we are just the bait in the trap and the princes daughter is supposed to be wed to an english lord and the marriage was part of a treaty between our two lands i suspect they will return us back to england when they have accomplished their nefarious purposes how do you know he means to kill the prince mab asked i do not for certain kate replied but instinct tells me he lies mab but when the prince comes and sees you are not his child mab fretted what will they do by then it will be too late kate said oh mistress i am so afraid mab said kate put comforting arms about her servant i know she said and i am too but we cannot let these men see we are afraid edward and rafe are already on our trail i know it they will find us and rescue us before long mab how mab now sobbed totally unnerved how will they get into this fortress and how will they get us out it is hopeless my lady it is hopeless she began to weep nay tis not hopeless kate reassured her although she was not certain at all that mab wasnt right mab think what is the worst that can happen to us we will be killed but if our mortal bodies die do we not live on in the spirit to be with our blessed mother would not be such a terrible fate mab but i havent ever lived lady mab hiccuped i am still a virgin you at least know the joy of marriage and children and so will you mab kate said firmly the door to their chamber opened and she continued look here is a nice hot supper for us things will seem much brighter after you have eaten if it aint poisoned mab said darkly i dont think they brought us all the way from haven just for the pleasure of poisoning us kate remarked then she turned to the servant who had brought the meal tell your master i will require a hot bath tonight i was nursing an infant when i was taken and my bodice is soaked through with my milk i shall also require a clean chemise and a gown are there women of rank here lord rhyss leman the servant answered then my requirements can be satisfied certainly kate said yes lady the servant replied and hurried out you would wear the clothes of that bandits whore mab demanded aye kate admitted they are surely cleaner than what i am now wearing both my chemise and gown are sticking to my breasts the smell on my clothing is not particularly pleasant oh i hope edward was wise enough to get wee henry a wet nurse mab if he wasnt the other women will see to it mab her courage now restored comforted her mistress her eye went to the tray of food as she realized that she was very hungry let us eat lady you sit and i shall serve you she began to ladle rabbit stew onto the trencher of bread how long do you think it will take lord edward to find us my lady he is probably on his way now kate said spooning the hot stew into her mouth ummm this is good at least the cook is competent here mab we shall not be starved aye edward is more than likely very near us and my brother with him listen do you hear rain well at least we were spared riding in a downpour outside the rain fell heavily and at the convent where kates captors had stopped that first night rhonwyn was in earnest conversation with the mother superior having introduced herself as the niece of the abbess gwynllian of mercy abbey the convents porteress was with them waiting to be given permission to speak we do not have many guests being in such a distant locale the mother superior said but several nights ago four men and two women sheltered with us sister margaret can tell you more she nodded to the porteress giving her permission to add what she could did they tell you who they were rhonwyn asked the one who appeared to be their leader said the lady was his sister and the other her servant he was taking them to his brothers castle but he did not give his name or that of his brother the two women were quiet except the next morning when they were leaving the lady asked me to pray for her sisterinlaw katherine she gave me a coin which is more than the man did do you remember what she looked like rhonwyn gently probed the elderly nuns memory young and pretty sister margaret replied she had beautiful light blue eyes and although she wore a head covering i could see a bit of her hair it was a nice nut brown she was well spoken although her welsh sounded a bit strange to my ear as if it were not her native tongue her servant was ordinary and appeared frightened did the lady perhaps favor this gentleman with me rhonwyn asked she drew rafe forward she did sister margaret cried indeed she did why my lord you could be sister and brother we are rafe replied my sister katherine was being kidnapped good sister are you certain you cannot recall hearing a place or a name we must find her i am sorry my lord sister margaret said but then she brightened i can tell you that when they departed the following morning they went north straight due north what is in that direction he asked her but she shrugged there is only one place to the north the mother superior told them it is a two days ride and there is nothing in between aberforth castle would be the next inhabited place there is nothing before it and nothing in any other direction at all my lord who is the lord of the castle rhonwyn asked the nun rhys ap daffydd lady was the response they sheltered the night in the convent guest house and then the following morning they departed we must go to cythraul rhonwyn said as they turned west i want to speak to my father before we beard this rhys ap daffydd how far are we rafe asked her and dewi answered we should be there by nightfall he said do you know this rhys rhonwyn asked dewi only by reputation lady he is an ambitious man they say dewi replied and never your fathers friend they rode that bright november day over the green hills of wales seeing no one finally as the sun was setting the ramparts of cythraul appeared ahead of them i will go ahead to be certain it is safe dewi said and kicked his mount forward while rhonwyn and rafe drew their horses aside in a thicket to await dewis signal when it came they rode quickly into the fortress looking about her rhonwyn wondered that she had been raised in such a rough place rhonwyn welcome home morgan ap owen lifted her from her saddle why have you come is my father here yet she answered his question with a question oth went for him some days ago he hasnt come but then neither has oth come into the hall lass and who is this fellow who accompanies you this is my husband rafe de beaulieu she answered i thought you wed edward de beaulieu morgan replied i did but then our marriage was dissolved and i wed his cousin rafe rafes sister married edward that is why i am here morgan ap owen several days ago some welsh came over the border and kidnapped lady katherine believing she was me it obviously has something to do with my father we have to find kate before she is harmed and she will be when they learn she isnt me i needed to meet with ap gruffydd in a location where we wouldnt be observed so i could learn from him just what is going on old friend i understand her old mentor said well there is nothing for you to do but sit down with us in the hall until he comes the evening meal was served and they sat at table with morgan ap owen as bread venison and trout were placed before them at first the men who had raised her were shy of rhonwyn but gradually they realized that while her manner had softened and she was a grown woman she was still their lass the hall soon became noisy as they told rafe tales of her childhood and he joined in their uproarious laughter at her many adventures and misadventures i suppose said lug ap barris that youre no longer the fine soldier you once were after all youre a mam now would you like to go handtohand with me lug she asked him in a deceptively innocent voice he saw the look in her eye and chuckled nay rhonwyn tis obvious i am mistaken and who do you think will teach my son how to use the alborium lug is there anyone in your memory who can shoot as well as i nay rhonwyn he replied you taught me well she said softly and he flushed with pleasure that she would remember him now that she was a lady brenin the ancient wolfhound came and lay by her side he is my first dog she told rafe as she leaned over to stroke the old animals head tell me of the laddie gwilym the cook said he has joined the benedictines in shrewsbury rhonwyn said and is at the abbey you would have been proud of him when he learned i had disappeared while on crusade he came to palestine and sought me out by doing what king richards minstrel blondell once did he went about entertaining with song singing his first song always in our welsh tongue waiting for an answer and when he finally received it he helped rescue me then she told them of her adventures and the reason for the dissolution of her marriage to edward when she had concluded her tale morgan op owen spoke up for them all the englishman was wrong to remarry so hastily he was fearful of dying without heirs rhonwyn said shrugging and he could hardly expect i would return to him it was a miracle but the other miracle was that i have found real love with rafe my friends i hold no bitterness any longer toward edward and i love his wife katherine i must find her morgan she is a gentle woman and she has two sons at haven one is yet new and at the breast well help you rhonwyn morgan said you know you can count on the men of cythraul they slept that night in the hall cuddling in her old bedspace rafe fondled his wifes breasts but after a purr of pleasure she warned him off we cannot she told him why not he murmured in her ear licking softly at it would you embarrass the men who raised me by letting them hear the sounds of our passion rafe in response he took her hand and placed it on his manhood which was now rock hard you will owe me greatly for this enforced abstinence lady he told her and then kissed her mouth sweetly i always meet my debts my lord she responded with a smile in the late afternoon of the following day llywelyn ap gruffydd appeared in the company of oth how is my grandson he asked thriving and with your chin my lord she told him the prince turned and looked at rafe sharply is this the one they married you to after edward de beaulieu betrayed you aye and i love him so there is no harm done rhonwyn quickly replied rafe come and give your hand in friendship to my sire rafe held out his hand to llywelyn ap gruffydd my lord the prince grasped the hand and said if she is happy then i will accept you rafe de beaulieu you look a better man than edward i am rafe replied without a moments hesitation ap gruffydd stared hard at him a moment and then he burst out laughing by the rood rhonwyn here indeed is your match and i thank god for it for certainly i have done little enough for you daughter you are a great man tad and have great things to do she answered him with a small smile your mam always said that to me he said a cloud briefly flitting over his features i know rhonwyn responded wine my lord gwilym was at his side with a large goblet aye the prince said taking it and gulping down a swallow come daughter and let us sit by the fire while you tell me what it is you desire of me i will grant it if it is in my power they sat and she explained the unfortunate situation to him as he drank his wine and listened closely when she had finished he spoke it will be rhys ap daffydd without a doubt who holds the lady katherine hostage he is a weasel of a man and a coward to boot long ago i caught him in a treacherous plot with the english few would have anything to do with him after i exposed him you were just a wee lass then rhonwyn he always said he would have his revenge upon me for it now he seeks to take advantage of my dispute with king edward i think he means to kill you rhonwyn said quietly aye that would be his way then he would gain more favor with his english masters and wales would fall to them i will not have it we cannot of course storm aberforth for he might kill the lady katherine yet we still might make him believe i am coming to the aid of my daughter without endangering her first we must be certain kate is there rhonwyn said let us send oth into aberforth as your messenger with a date for your meeting with rhys oth will insist upon seeing the hostage so he may return to you and tell you your daughter is being well cared for at aberforth then rafe dewi and i shall enter the stronghold disguised as wandering entertainers such people are always welcome and i have had experience enough as i worked my way back from palestine with glynn once inside aberforth we shall rescue kate how the prince demanded i shall kill rhys rhonwyn said quietly how the prince asked as quietly with my alborium tad i can do it never fear rhonwyn told him this man has taken kate from her family and means you harm i have no qualms about killing him so daughter you would do this for me would you the prince said rather surprised by her words i was raised here my lord and i was taught duty to family and to wales i have an english husband whom i love and i am content to recognize the english king as my overlord but this business has little to do with england it is welsh business my lord and it must be concluded by the welsh this rhys ap daffydd is a man of guile and dishonor both he and his vile actions shame our race and you englishman you are content to allow your wife to do this thing ap gruffydd asked rafe aye rafe said then he continued my wife is not some delicate flower in need of my protection she is a strong woman and frankly at times i have been glad for her protection if she believes she can do this then i am content to let her but know that if she should fail i will myself see to this mans death for the temerity he has shown in taking my sister as his hostage the prince of the welsh smiled slowly this time daughter he said you have married a real man i do like you rafe de beaulieu he clapped his soninlaw upon the back in a friendly gesture it was decided that the prince along with a troop of menatarms from cythraul would travel several hours behind the others they would not enter aberforth until signaled rhonwyn rafe and dewi would come to rhys ap daffydds castle in their guise as traveling entertainers rhonwyn had decided to dress herself as a female in boys garb the better to entice the castles master oth would leave cythraul in the morning rhonwyn and her party would come two hours behind him and the prince and his men would be four hours behind them the evening meal was served and afterward gwilym sang several ballads of ancient times but he told them as he so often did my laddie glynn has sung and played them better now he sings and plays for god rhonwyn said my only son a priest the prince muttered disgusted hes happy rhonwyn said quietly besides when you can celebrate your marriage to de montforts daughter get yourself a son on her that child will be your legitimate heir ive been betrothed to the wench for long enough but she is hidden in a convent in france and the english will not give her permission to travel through their lands so we may marry ap gruffydd groused edward longshanks is in fear of de montforts daughter the fool king edward is scarcely a fool my lord rhonwyn told her father it is you im thinking who is foolish why will you not pledge your fealty to him if you did perhaps your bride could come to wales and you would have many sons but nay you will niggle and haggle to gain an advantage you will never obtain from this king he is a hard man like his grandfather king john although he can be quite charming nonetheless tad he will have his own way and you and your allies will eventually cost wales her freedom i have not a doubt the prince looked extremely disgruntled by her words you still speak your own mind rhonwyn i see he said the english shall not have wales as long as i live i swear it on the true cross words come easy to you my lord but tis actions that count rhonwyn said scathingly rafe was fascinated by the combative relationship between lather and daughter he knew that ap gruffydd had had next to nothing to do with her upbringing but he had not realized before just how bitter rhonwyn was toward the prince of the welsh absently rafe took her hand in his and raising it to his lips kissed each fingertip let us retire wife he said low we will have a long day tomorrow ap gruffydd sipped on his wine thoughtfully but when his daughter and her husband had crawled into their bedspace he said to morgan ap owen he manages her well and she does not even realize it she must indeed love him morgan the captain of cythraul smiled his reply oth was gone before the dawn and rhonwyn and her party followed him two hours later they had borrowed several of gwilyms old instruments for it was likely they would have to perform dewi and rhonwyn were skilled in such arts but rafe was not when they camped that night she taught him how to keep time with a tambourine and cymbalum which were a type of bells dewi was adept on the pibau or bagpipes and the pibgorn a reed instrument rhonwyn would play the telyna celtic harpas well as the lute and sing they traveled from dawn till dusk for two days on the morning of the third day they reached aberforth castle meeting oth but an hour after they sighted the castle and they drew their mounts into a wooded area off the road to await him seeing them he stopped shes there he said and in the dirty stained gown they took her in for the leman of the master will not loan her a clean garment these are wicked people my lady be careful i shall ride on to meet with your father and tell him what i have learned into the lions den rhonwyn said and kicked her mount forward they rode down the road across the heavy wooden drawbridge beneath the portcullis and into the castle courtyard asking for the steward when they stopped you must go into the hall the stable boy said he will not come out here for who are you but a ragtag and itinerant bunch will you watch our horses you handsome fellow rhonwyn said favoring the lad with a broad smile and chucking him beneath the chin she bent allowing him a generous view of her breasts well make it worth your while she purred the boy swallowed hard scarcely able to look away from her bosom without a word he took the reins and nodded blushing beet red when rhonwyn pinched his cheek and blew him a kiss must you be so damned bold rafe muttered as they mounted the steps to the porch and went through the door of the castle men like bold women for they always assume that bold women are bad women rhonwyn told him i may have to do things that i would certainly not do otherwise rafe but you must trust me aye my lord follow her lead dewi said shes a clever lass and more than once got us out of a scrape as we made our way home through france in the great hall they asked for the steward and were directed to his chamber knocking they entered and rhonwyn immediately spoke up greetings my lord steward i am anghard and these are my two companions dewi and rafe we are musicians and thought perhaps that you might have a need of a nights entertainment it is not often we get travelers in this place the steward said a hint of suspicion in his voice where are you from and where are you bound for anghard we have no real home my lord steward but we have at last been in shrewsbury and now make our way to prince llywelyns stronghold for we hear he is a lover of music and generous to boot we have spent the last two nights outofdoors and would welcome a night beneath a strong roof with a fire and some hot food she smiled at him i can save you a long trip the steward said for the prince will be here in a few days time he is coming to visit my master rhys ap daffydd lord of this castle we will give you a week or more of shelter anghard and you and your companions will entertain us eh with pleasure my lord steward and i thank you for your generosity rhonwyn said go into the hall the steward told them you may sleep there and eat at the lords tables below the salt if you play well there may be a little something else for you as well thank you my lord steward rhonwyn said bowing as she backed from the room you are a devious woman rafe said as they returned to the hall i should have believed you myself did i not know you we must find the perfect place rhonwyn said to dewi and then you must make certain my alborium is ready to be used well watch for servants while you prepare it for if it is learned we have brought weapons into this lords hall we may be killed for our daring they found a niche in a dark corner and drawing a bench before it shielded dewi as he prepared rhonwyns bow for use when the proper time came when all was in readiness they rested waiting for the main meal of the day when they would certainly be asked to entertain in midafternoon the servants began to come into the hall with platters and bowls rhys ap daffydd his leman his captain his brother ifan and katherine came into the great hall and took their places at the high board the tables below the salt began to fill and rhonwyn and her companions found seats at the very last table at the high board a plethora of dishes was served but below the salt there was bread a pottage and some hard cheese with only beer to drink rhonwyn looked toward the dais seeing that katherine while pale was hardly cowed by her captors she has more courage and strength than i believed rhonwyn thought proudly she found though that she was angered by the fact that rhys ap daffydd had not had the decency to find his captive clean clothing katherine wore as oth had told them the milkstained gown she had been taken in you shall soon pay for all your wickedness and deceit rhonwyn silently thought when the meal was over the steward came forward and said to his master my lord three traveling musicians have asked leave to entertain you in exchange for shelter and food anghard and troupe come forward at once he waved his hand in their direction rhonwyn and her companions arose and came before the high board playing and singing as they gamboled along the men were dressed in spring green tunics that came to just above their knees and chausses striped in blue and green rhonwyn was garbed in a darker green tunic that was extraordinarily short coming to just below the tops of her thighs her chausses were also striped but in gold and green she had loosed her hair and it flowed down her back hiding her alborium that was affixed there the string of the bow hidden by the tunics dark colors as it rode across her chest in her hair were silk flowers of many hues her tunic had a bateau neckline and she wore nothing beneath it when she bobbed low her breasts were quite visible to all and the length of the garment or rather lack of it offered a bold view of her tight round buttocks she was every bit the picture of an entertainer with an easy and loose virtue rhys ap daffydd leaned forwardmuch to his lemans annoyancevery interested in the beautiful musician who smiled most seductively at him bowing low with her two companions and then standing once again my lord will you allow us to entertain you rhonwyn purred in a smoky seductive voice i am certain that we can please you if you will but let us she smiled again at him their eyes making contact and rhonwyn was appalled by the cruelty and the lust she saw in his gaze this was indeed an evil man you have my permission rhys said grandly he had already decided to bed the wench later before we begin rhonwyn said may i know for whom we are performing i enjoy making little personal songs for all if i but know their names my lord this is my brother ifan my captain llwyd ap nudd my mistress iola and my guest rhonwyn uerch llywelyn whose father is the prince of all the welsh or so say the english and many of the welsh as well rhonwyn replied or so i am told rhys ap daffydd at first he wasnt certain if she had insulted him but then he laughed you are bold my pretty one and you my lord are a fool she replied easily there was an audible gasp in the great hall boldness is only amusing for a brief time wench rhys said threateningly if you offend me again i shall have your tongue torn out and then how will you earn your living but upon your back rhonwyn laughed loudly you say your guest is the daughter of prince llywelyn my lord but i tell you she is not it you wish to use ap gruffydds daughter against him you will have no chance with this woman she is lady katherine de beaulieu of haven castle wife of lord edward his first marriage to ap gruffydds daughter was dissolved several years ago did you not know and how you audacious and brazen wench do you know rhys ap daffydd demanded angrily because my lord i am rhonwyn uerch llywelyn rhonwyn replied rhys ap daffydd stared hard at rhonwyn and then a cruel smile touched his mouth yes he said slowly of course why did i not see it before when you first stood before me you have her coloring rhonwyn uerch llywelyn while you are more ap gruffydds daughter in your features you have valas coloring do you remember me my pretty do you remember that night i visited your cottage and had my way with your mother ah how she wept and pleaded with me and you stood wideeyed clutching your baby brother in your arms how i enjoyed that night and how i will enjoy this one will you give me as much pleasure as your mother gave me so long ago rhownyn uerch llywelyn he grinned at her all in the silent hall heard the whining sound but until the arrow buried itself deep into rhys ap daffydds chest they did not connect it with a weapon as the lord of aberforth fell face first into the remains of his meal rhonwyn loosed the two arrows that rafe quickly handed her one killing ifan ap daffydd and the other rhyss captain llywd ap nudd rhyss mistress began to scream in terror as the trio made their way to the high board it was very necessary to gain control of the castles inhabitants before they fully comprehended what had just happened do not be afraid dewi shouted to them all prince llywelyn is even now marching into aberforth our quarrel was with your master and his ilk it is not with you welcome the prince as loyal welshmen and you will be left in peace now go and open your gates for my master the hall virtually emptied at his words ill go and make certain they obey me dewi said be careful rhonwyn cautioned him she turned to rhyss mistress stop howling you silly woman you are not hurt nor will you be unless of course you dont cease that unpleasant caterwauling oh rhonwyn you are so brave katherine said breathlessly hugging her sisterinlaw when i saw you all come before the high board i could not believe my eyes gracious brother you do have a wellturned leg she teased him as she released rhonwyn thank god you are safe kate he said hugging her hard i didnt know what was going to happen kate admitted but thank heavens for our old nurse wynnifred after a few minutes the language began to come back to me and i quickly realized they thought i was you rhonwyn i was afraid to say i wasnt for fear they would kill me and i decided that since you had grown up in such an isolated location it was unlikely they would know i wasnt you it was cleverly done kate and edward will be proud when he learns how bravely you have conducted yourself she turned in the woman iola selfish cow you will regret your mean spirit lady katherines servant will pick a gown from among your possessions for her mistress and come the morning you will go from aberforth with only what you can carry i am certain you will find another lordling to whore for soon enough leave us now iola scurried from the great hall when she had gone rhonwyn turned to her husband and sisterinlaw you heard rhys ap daffydds words until he spoke i did not know him many years ago when i was a child he came in the dark of night to our cottage and raped my mother she never told my father and i do not want her memory fouled by the tale now dewi i know will say nothing i understand katherine said you have my word that i will not repeat what i have heard this night rafe put his arm about his wife and as their eyes met he gave her his silent promise people were beginning to stream back into the great hall of aberforth castle they could hear cheering i he sound of booted feet came marching toward them and into the chamber llywelyn ap gruffydd at the soldiers head upon his stallion which he rode up to the dais looking dispassionately at the three bodies draped across the high board well done daughter he praised her well done and now my lord tad she replied you will thank morgan ap owen for raising me as he did i do indeed thank him the prince said a small smile upon his lips but you get your eye for marksmanship from me daughter his look went next to katherine de beaulieu lady katherine i apologize that one of my subjects should have mistreated you so you are free to return to haven with your brother and rhonwyn i thank you my lord prince for your timely rescue kate answered him graciously and then she curtsied prettily remove the bodies and put them outside for the dogs the prince said dismounting his beast and ascending the dais to stand before the hall which now erupted into cheers how inconstant and capricious are mens loyalties rhonwyn murmured sardonically not mine for you rafe said softly you are certain she was smiling at him very certain he assured her she sighed happily laying her head upon his shoulder whatever memories she had once hadof love or evilhad been replaced in her heart and her mind by the reality of this man and his love for her there could surely be no more than that in life looking up at rafe she smiled once again saying let us go home my lord and he nodded in agreement as he took her hand and they walked from the hall together ap gruffydd watched them go and then he said oth dewi you belong to her as you always have but before you return to ardley will you bring lady katherine home to her husband aye my lord the two chorused grinning he acknowledged them absently his eyes taking in a last glimpse of his daughter farewell rhonwyn uerch llywelyn he said silently to himself farewell and then to his surprise she turned giving him a brilliant smile and raising her hand to him in salute farewell tad he heard her call and then she was gone the prince of the welsh felt his eyes moisten with tears he blinked them back quickly lest anyone see his weakness now what the hell was he going to do with another castle he thought an afterword the year between and was not a good one for the prince of the welsh llywelyn ap gruffydd had badly misjudged the new king and edward reacted fiercely to the man who would not fulfill his obligations as a vassal he immediately declared war on the welsh which was concluded by an english victory at aberconwy in as punishment edward took most of ap gruffydds lands leaving him with only lesser gwynedd and the overlordship of five lords finally chastened ap gruffydd was at last allowed to marry the daughter of simon de montfort to whom he had been betrothed since it was hoped the marriage would settle ap gruffydd down the marriage took place in disputes did arise regarding the use of english or welsh law in the princes lands but the peace held until when ap gruffydds younger brother daffydd attacked harwarden the prince bound first by family loyalty was forced to go to his brothers aid and was killed at builth he was buried at cwm hir a cistercian monastery he favored his wife was already dead in childbirth and his only legitimate heir was a sickly daughter named for his sister gwynllian she was put into a convent where she lived out her life daffydd ap gruffydd was finally captured and executed in when the welsh told king edward that they would only accept a prince who spoke no english he cleverly presented them with his infant son edward who had been recently born at llywelyn ap gruffydds former stronghold of caernavon thus ended waless last attempt at political independence until the year bertrice small
