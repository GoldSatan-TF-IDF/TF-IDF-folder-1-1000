anne perry bedford square pitt leaned out of the bedroom window in his nightshirt and looked down into the street below the police constable was standing on the pavement staring up at him the constables face yellow in the gaslight from the street lamps was tense and unhappy and it was for more reason than simply having woken the commander of the bow street police station at four oclock in the morning dead sir he answered pitts question an i cant see as ow it could a bin an accident not ow e is an were i found im an i oughta be gettin back sir i darsent leave im there by isself sir someone might move im like mess wif evidence yes of course pitt agreed go back constable you did the right thing ill get dressed and ill be there i presume you havent had a chance to call the surgeon or the mortuary van no sir i come straight ere seein as were e is ill call them you go back and stand guard yes sir im sorry sir dont be you did the right thing pitt repeated pulling his head in and shivering involuntarily it was juneat least nominally summerbut in london the nights were still chilly and there was a faint mist hanging over the city what is it charlotte sat up in bed and fumbled for a match he heard it scrape and then saw the flame as it caught the wick of the candle it lit her face softly gleaming on the warm dark color of her hair which was falling out of its long braid she looked worried theyve found a body in bedford square he answered it seems as if he was murdered do they really need you for that she protested is it somebody important since his promotion pitt had been asked to concentrate on those cases which were of political significance or threatened scandal maybe not he replied closing the window and walking over to where his clothes were hanging across the back of the chair he took off his nightshirt and began to dress not bothering with collar or cravat there was water in the ewer and he poured it into the basin it was cold but there was certainly no time to light the kitchen stove and heat it so he could shave unfortunately there was also no time for a cup of tea which he would have liked even more he splashed his face and felt the sharp tingle of coldness then with his eyes shut felt for the towel thank you he took it from charlottes outstretched hand he rubbed his face vigorously feeling the rough cotton stir the blood and warm him because apparently he was on the front doorstep of one of the big houses he replied oh she understood the implications london was peculiarly sensitive to scandal just now in the previous year a scandal had occurred at tranby croft now the trial was rocking the entire country it was all very regrettable a matter of gambling at a country house party an accusation of cheating at baccarat an illegal game and of course an indignant denial but what could not be hidden or excused was that the prince of wales had been involved and was now to be called to the witness stand to give evidence half of london opened the daily newspapers with bated breath pitt finished dressing he put his arms around charlotte and kissed her feeling the warmth of her skin and pushing back the heavy hair with his fingers enjoying its softness with an alltoofleeting pleasure go back to bed he said gently ill be home when i can but i doubt itll be for breakfast he tiptoed across the floor and opened the door quietly not to waken the children and gracie the maid asleep up on the top floor the landing gaslight was always left on very low and it was sufficient for him to see his way downstairs in the hall he picked up the telephonea fairly recent acquisition in his homeand asked the operator to connect him with the bow street station when the sergeant answered pitt instructed him to send the police surgeon and mortuary van to bedford square he replaced the receiver put on his boots and took his jacket from the hook by the front door he slid back the latch and stepped outside the air was damp and chilly but it was already beginning to get light and he walked quickly along the glistening pavement towards the corner of gower street and turned left it was only a few yards into bedford square and even from that distance he saw the unhappy figure of the constable standing alone about halfway along the pavement he looked immensely relieved to see pitt striding towards him out of the gloom his expression brightened visibly and he waved his bullseye lantern over ere sir he called out pitt neared him and glanced where he was pointing the dark figure was easy to see lying sprawled on the front steps of the large house immediately to their left it seemed almost as if he must have been reaching for the doorbell when he fell the cause of death was apparent there was a deep and bloody wound on the side of his head it was difficult to imagine how he could have come by it in any accident nothing that could have occurred in the roadway would have thrown him so far nor was there another wound visible hold the light for me pitt requested kneeling down beside the body and looking at it more closely he touched his hand gently to the mans throat there was no pulse but the flesh was still just warm what time did you find him he asked sixteen minutes afore four sir pitt glanced at his pocket watch it was now thirteen minutes past what time did you come this way before that abaht quarter afore three sir e werent ere then pitt turned around to look up at the street lamps they were off find the lamplighter he ordered he cant have been here long ago theyre still lit on keppel street and its barely daylight enough to see anywhere hes a bit sharp as it is yessir the constable agreed with alacrity anyone else pitt asked as the constable took a step away no sir too early for deliveries they don start till five at the soonest no maids up yet nother alf hour at least bit late fer partyers most o thems orne by three though yer never know yer chances like yer could ask pitt smiled wryly he noticed that the constable had abandoned doing it himself and considered pitt the one to work the gentry of bedford square and ask them if they had happened to notice a corpse on the doorstep or even a fight in the street as they returned from their revels if i have to pitt said dourly did you look in his pockets no sir i left that fer you sir i dont suppose you have any idea who he is not a local servant or tradesman suitor to one of the maids around here no sir i int never seen im afore i dont reckon as e belongs ere shall i go an find the lamplighter sir afore e goes too far yes go and find him bring him back here yessir and before pitt could think of any more questions for him he put his bullseye down on the step turned on his heel and strode off into the broadening dawn light pitt picked up the lantern and examined the dead man his face was lean the skin weathered as if he spent much of his time outside there was a faint stubble of beard across his cheeks his hair had little color a dark mousy brown that had probably been fair in his youth his features were pleasant enough a trifle pinched upper lip too short eyebrows wispy the left one with a pronounced break in it as if from an old scar it was a face easy to see and forget like thousands of others pitt used his finger to ease the collarless shirt back an inch or two the skin under it was fair almost white next he looked at the mans hands they were strong lean with fingernails chipped and far from clean but they did not look like the hands of a manual worker there were no calluses the knuckles were torn as if he had been in a hard fight very recently perhaps only moments before his death the bleeding was slight in spite of the ripped skin and there had not been time for bruising pitt slipped his hand into a jacket pocket and was startled to close his fingers over a small metal box he pulled it out and turned it over under the light it was exquisite he could not tell at a glance whether it was goldplated or solid or possibly even pinchbeck that brilliant imitation of gold but it was intricately modeled like a tiny cathedral reliquary the sort used to house the bones of saints the top was decorated with a tiny reclining figure relaxed in death and wearing long clerical robes and a bishops mitre pitt opened the box and sniffed gently yes it was what he had supposed a snuffbox it could hardly have belonged to the man who lay dead at his feet even if it were pinchbeck it would be worth more than he had seen in a month perhaps in a year but if he had been caught stealing it why was he left here on the doorstep and above all why had whoever killed him not retrieved the box pitt felt to see if there was anything else in the pocket and found only a short length of string and a pair of bootlaces apparently unused in the mans other pockets he found a key a piece of rag for a handkerchief three shillings and four pence in small change and several pieces of paper one of which was a receipt for three pairs of socks purchased only two days before from a shop in red lion square that if diligently followed might possibly tell them who he was there was nothing else to indicate his name or where he lived of course there were thousands of people who had no homes and simply slept in doorways or under railway arches and bridges or at this time of the year in the open if tolerant police did not disturb them but looking at this man pitt deduced that if such misfortune had happened to him it must have been recent his clothes were all hard worn there were holes in his socksthese were not the new ones the soles of his boots were paperthin in places but he was dry he had not the inlaid grime or the musty moldy smell of someone who lived outside pitt stood up as he heard footsteps along the pavement and saw the familiar awkward angular figure of sergeant tellman approaching him from the charlotte street direction he would not have mistaken tellman even in the lamplight but the dawn was now whitening the eastern sky tellman reached him and stopped he was hastily dressed but it was noticeable only in his jacket buttoned one hole crooked his collar was as tight and straight as usual his cravat as plain and neat his hair wet combed back from his lanternjawed face he looked dour also as usual some gentleman too drunk to avoid being run down by a hansom he asked pitt was used to tellmans opinion of the privileged if he was a gentleman he was on extremely hard times he replied glancing down at the body and he wasnt hit by a vehicle there isnt a mark on his clothes other than where he fell but his knuckles are grazed as if he put up quite a fight look at him yourself tellman eyed pitt sharply then bent as he was told and examined the dead man when he stood up again pitt held out his hand with the snuffbox in it tellmans eyebrows shot up he had that yes then he was a thief so who killed him and why here on the front doorstep he didnt go in or out that way dont reckon as he was killed here either tellman said with a hint of satisfaction that wound on his head must have bled a good bit heads do cut yourself and youll soon see but theres not much on the step around him id say he was killed somewhere else and put here because he was a thief seems a good reason then why leave the snuffbox apart from its value its the one thing that could trace him back to the house he stole it from there cant be many like it dont know tellman admitted biting his lips doesnt make sense i suppose well have to start asking all round the square his face reflected vividly his distaste at the prospect they both heard the clatter of hooves at the same time as a hansom came from the caroline street corner of the square at a brisk clip followed immediately by the mortuary van the van stopped a dozen yards along the curb and the hansom drew level with them the frockcoated figure of the surgeon climbed out straightened his collar and walked over to them he nodded greeting then regarded the dead man with resignation he hitched the knees of his trousers slightly to avoid stretching the fabric and squatted down to begin his examination pitt turned as he heard more footsteps and saw the constable coming with a highly nervous lamplighter a thin fairhaired man dwarfed by his pole in the dawn light through the trees he looked like some outlandish knightatarms with a jousting lance beyond his strength to wield i dint see nuffink he said before pitt could ask him you passed this way pitt reaffirmed this is your patch there was no escaping that yeah when smornin he replied as if it should have been obvious bout first light like i always do do you know what time that was pitt said patiently first light like i said he sent a nervous sideways look at the body half obscured by the surgeon as he bent over it e werent ere then i dint see im do you have a watch pitt pursued with little hope wofor gets light different time every day the lamplighter said reasonably pitt realized he was not going to get more exact than that the answer from the lamplighters point of view was sensible enough did you see anyone else in the square he said instead not this side the lamplighter shook his head there were an ansom on tother side takin a gennelman ome bit the worse fer wear e were but not fallin down like dint come round ere no one else no too late fer most folks from parties an too early fer maids an deliveries an like that was true at least it narrowed it down a little more it had been dark when the constable had been on his previous round and barely light when he had found the body the lamplighter could not have been around long before which meant the body had been put there within the space of fifteen or twenty minutes it was just possible if they were very lucky that someone had awoken in one of the houses on this side and heard footsteps or shouting even a single cry it was a forlorn hope thank you pitt accepted the sky was pale now beyond the heavy trees in the center of the square the light shining on the far rooftops and reflecting mirrorlike in the topstory windows above them he turned to the surgeon who seemed to have completed at least his superficial examination a fight he pronounced short one id guess know more when i see him without his clothes could be other abrasions but his coat isnt torn or stained ground was dry if he fell over or was knocked wasnt on the street anyway theres no mud on him that i can see no trace of manure or anything else and the gutters are pretty wet he glanced around rained yesterday evening i know pitt retorted looking at the glistening cobbles course you do the surgeon agreed nodding at him dont suppose i can tell you anything you dont have to try what im paid for one very heavy blow to the side of the head killed him probably a length of lead pipe or a candlestick or a poker something of that sort id guess metal rather than wood to do that much damage heavy likely to be marks on the person who did it pitt asked the surgeon pursed his lips thoughtfully a few bruises perhaps where the fist connected judging by the splits on his knuckles most likely a jaw or head clothes or soft flesh wouldnt do that face would be bruised hand wouldnt show other fellow had a weapon this one didnt or he wouldnt have had to use his fists nasty im not arguing pitt said dryly he shivered he was getting cold can you say anything about time nothing you cant deduce for yourself the surgeon replied or about the poor devil here he added if i can improve on that ill send you a message bow street good enough certainly thank you the surgeon shrugged slightly inclined his head in a salute and went back to the mortuary wagon to instruct his men in the removal of the body pitt looked at his pocket watch again it was just after quarter to five i suppose it is time we started waking people he said to tellman come on tellman sighed heavily but he had no option but to obey together they walked up the steps of the house where the body had been found and pitt pulled the brass doorbell tellman rather liked pitts refusal to go to the tradesmens entrance as someone of the social order of policemen should do but while he approved the principle he also loathed the practice let pitt do it when tellman was not with him it was several long uncomfortable minutes before they heard the bolts slide and the lock turn the door swung inward and an extremely hastily dressed footman not in livery but in ordinary dark trousers and jacket stood blinking at them yes sir he said with alarm he was not yet practiced enough to have the really superior footmans supercilious air good morning pitt replied i am sorry to disturb the household so early but i am afraid there has been an incident which necessitates my making enquiries of both the staff and the family he held out his card superintendent pitt of the bow street station would you present it to your master and ask him if he will spare me a few moments of his time i am afraid it concerns a very serious crime and i cannot afford the pleasantries of waiting until a more civilized hour a crime the footman looked startled we havent been burgled sir theres been no crime here you must have made a mistake he started to close the door again relieved to shut the whole matter outside on the street it was somebody elses problem after all tellman moved forward as if to put his foot in the doorway then resisted it was undignified he hated this give him ordinary people to deal with any day the whole notion of being in service to someone else was abomination to him it was no way for a decent man or woman to make a living the burglary is incidental if indeed there was one pitt said firmly the murder is my concern that stopped the footman as if frozen the blood fled from his face the the what murder pitt repeated quietly unfortunately we found the body of a man on your doorstep about an hour ago now would you please be good enough to waken your master and inform him that i need to speak to everyone in the house and i would like his permission to do so the footman swallowed his throat jerking yes yes sir if i mean his voice trailed off he had no idea where one left policemen to wait at five oclock in the morning normally one would not permit them on the premises at all if one had to it would be the local constable perhaps for a hot cup of tea on a cold day and that in the kitchen where such people belonged ill wait in the morning room pitt said to assist him and because he had no intention of being left shivering on the step yes sir ill tell the general the footman backed in and pitt and tellman followed him general pitt asked yes sir this is general brandon balantynes home the name was familiar it took pitt a moment to place it it must be the same general balantyne who had previously lived in callander square when pitt was investigating the deaths of the babies nearly a decade before and who had also been involved in the tragedies in the devils acre three to four years later i didnt know that it was a foolish remark and he realized it the moment it had crossed his lips he saw tellman turn to look at him with surprise he would have preferred not to discuss the past with tellman if he did not have to he would let it lie he walked smartly across the hall after the footman and followed him into the morning room leaving the door open for tellman inside was so exactly what pitt expected it jerked him back sharply and for a moment the intervening years disappeared the shelf of books was the same as in the previous house the dark brown and greenleather furniture polished with use on the mellow wood of the small table was the brass replica of the cannon at waterloo gleaming in the gaslight the footman had lit and turned up for them on the wall over the mantelpiece hung the picture pitt remembered of the charge of the royal scots greys again from waterloo the zulu assegai was on the wall next to the fireplace and the paintings of the african veld pale colors bleached by sun red earth flattopped acacia trees he had not meant to look at tellman but he turned and caught the sergeants eye accidentally tellman was staring his face a mask of disapproval tellman had not even met the man but he knew he was a general he knew that at the time of his service officers had purchased their commissions rather than earned them they came from a few wealthy military families all educated at the best schools eton rugby harrow and then possibly a year or two at oxford or cambridge more probably straight into the armyand at a rank no workingclass man could hope to achieve even after a lifetimes service risking his life on the battlefield and his health in foreign climes for no more recompense than the kings shilling pitt knew balantyne and liked him but there was no point in saying that to tellman tellman had seen too much injustice and had felt it too keenly among his own people to hear anything pitt would say so he kept silence and waited standing by the window watching the light broaden across the square outside and the shade deepen under the trees in the center the birds were loud starlings and sparrows a delivery cart rattled by stopping regularly an errand boy on a bicycle came around the corner rather too sharply and steadied himself with an effort his cap falling over his ears the morning room door opened and pitt and tellman both turned to face it in the entranceway stood a tall man with broad shoulders his fair brown hair was graying at the temples and beginning to thin his features were powerful with an aquiline nose high cheekbones and a broad mouth he was leaner than when pitt had last seen him as if time and grief had worn down the reserves of his strength but he still stood very uprightin fact stiffly his shoulders squared he was wearing a white shirt and a plain dark smoking jacket but it was easy for the minds eye to see him in uniform good morning pitt he said quietly should i congratulate you on your promotion my footman said you are now in charge of the bow street station thank you general balantyne pitt acknowledged feeling a faintly selfconscious flush in his cheeks this is sergeant tellman i am sorry to disturb you so early sir but i am afraid the beat constable found a dead body in the square at about quarter to four this morning he was on the doorstep just outside this house he saw the distaste on balantynes face and perhaps shock although of course the footman had told him so he was not taken by surprise now who is it balantyne asked closing the door behind him we dont know yet pitt replied but he had papers and other belongings on him so we shall almost certainly be able to identify him quite soon he watched balantynes face but saw no discernible change certainly no tightening of lips or shadow across the eyes do you know how he died balantyne asked he waved one hand at the chairs to invite pitt to be seated and included tellman in a general way thank you sir pitt accepted but i should like your permission for sergeant tellman to speak to your household staff someone may have heard an altercation or disturbance balantynes face was bleak i understand that the man did not meet a natural death i am afraid so he was struck across the head most likely after a fight not long but very fierce balantynes eyes widened and you think it happened on my doorstep that i dont yet know by all means have the sergeant speak to my staff pitt nodded at tellman who left eagerly closing the door behind him pitt sat down in one of the large greenleathercovered armchairs and balantyne sat a little stiffly in the one opposite there is nothing i can tell you balantyne went on my bedroom is at the front of the house but i heard nothing a street robbery of such violence would be extraordinary in this area a fleeting anxiety puckered his face a sadness he wasnt robbed pitt answered disliking what he must do next at least not in any usual sense he still had money he saw balantynes surprise and this he pulled the snuffbox out of his pocket and held it out in the palm of his hand balantynes expression did not change his face was unnaturally motionless there was no admiration for the beauty of the piece no amazement that a murdered man involved in a fight should be in possession of such a thing but all the selfmastery in the world could not control the blood draining from his skin and leaving him ashen extraordinary he breathed out very slowly one would think he swallowed one would think a thief could hardly miss such a thing pitt knew he was speaking to fill the emptiness of the moments between them while he decided whether to admit owning it or not what explanation could he give pitt stared at him holding his eyes in an unwavering gaze it raises many questions he agreed aloud have you seen it before general balantynes voice was a little husky as if his mouth were dry yes yes it is mine he seemed to be about to add something then changed his mind pitt asked the question he had to when did you last see it i dont think i remember one gets used to seeing things im not sure i would have noticed its absence he looked profoundly uncomfortable but he did not evade pitts eyes he anticipated the next question its kept in a cabinet in the library was there any point in pursuing it not yet have you missed anything else general balantyne not so far as i am aware perhaps you would be good enough to check sir and ill see if any of the servants have noticed anything moved signs of a burglar in the house of course it sometimes happens that burglars have called at the house earlier to make an assessment or to i understand balantyne cut across him you think one of us may recognize him yes if you and perhaps your butler and one of your footmen would come to the mortuary and see if he is known to you it may help if you wish balantyne agreed he obviously disliked the idea but he accepted the inevitability of it there was a sharp knock on the door and before balantyne could answer it opened and a woman came in pitt remembered her immediately lady augusta balantyne was handsome in a dark cold way there was strength in her face but it was inward selfcontained she too must have remembered him because there was instantly a chill in her when she saw him more than could be accounted for by the fact that he had disturbed the household so early in the morning but then after their two previous encounters she could hardly think of him with any memory except that of pain she was dressed in a dark silk gown of formal cut suitable for making morning calls fashionable but subdued as befitted her age and dignity her dark hair was streaked with white at the temples and grief had faded her skin but not the intelligence or the iron will in her eyes pitt rose to his feet i apologize for waking you so early lady augusta he said quietly unfortunately there has been a death in the street outside your home and it is necessary that i enquire if anyone here was aware of the disturbance he wished to spare her feelings as much as possible he did not like her and it made him even more careful than he would have been otherwise i assumed it was some such duty that brought you inspector she answered at once dismissing any possible social contact between them this was her home he could only have come in the course of his trade ridiculously he found himself clenching inside as aware of an insult as if she had slapped him and he should have expected it after all that had passed between them the tragedy and the guilt what would he have presumed differently he tried to make himself relax his body and failed balantyne was on his feet also looking from one to the other of them as if he too should apologizeto pitt for his wifes condescension to her for pitts presence and for another tragedy some unfortunate man was attacked and killed he said bluntly she took a deep breath but her composure did not crack was it someone we knew no balantyne said immediately at least he turned to pitt it is most unlikely pitt looked at augusta he appeared to have fallen on hard times and to have been involved in a fight he was not apparently robbed the tension slipped away from her then i suggest inspector that you question the servants to see if they heard anything and if they did not then i regret we cannot assist you good day she did not move she was dismissing him not herself leaving balantyne looked uncomfortable he had no desire whatever to prolong the interview but then neither did he wish to avail himself of a rescue by his wife he had never retreated from battle he was not about to do so now he stood his ground painfully if you would inform me when it would be convenient to go to the mortuary i shall do so he said to pitt in the meantime blisset will show you whatever you wish to see and no doubt he will know if anything has been moved or is missing missing augusta queried balantynes face tightened the man may have been a thief he said curtly without explaining further i suppose so she lifted one shoulder slightly it would account for his presence in the square she stood back into the hallway to allow pitt to leave and waited silently until he should pass the butler blisset a middleaged man of stiffbacked military bearing was standing at the foot of the stairs very probably he was an old soldier balantyne had employed knowing his service indeed when he moved he did so with a pronounced limp and pitt guessed it was a battle injury which had caused it if you will come with me sir he said gravely and as soon as he was sure pitt was behind him he went across the hallway to the baize door and through to the servants quarters tellman was standing by the long table in the dining hall where the servants took their meals it was laid for breakfast but obviously no one had yet eaten a housemaid was standing in a gray stuff dress white apron crisp and clean lace cap a trifle crooked on her head as if she had placed it there hastily she was looking at tellman with considerable dislike a footman of about nineteen or twenty was standing by the door to the kitchen and the bootboy was staring roundeyed at pitt nothing so far tellman said biting his lip he had a pencil and an open notebook in his hands but there was very little written on the page lot of very sound sleepers here his tone was bordering on the sarcastic pitt thought that if he had to get up at five in the morning as a matter of habit and work with little respite until nine or ten in the evening he would probably be tired enough to sleep soundly too but he did not bother to say so id like to speak to the housemaids he said to blisset may i use the housekeepers sitting room the butler agreed reluctantly and insisted on remaining present to protect his staff as was his responsibility but two hours diligent enquiry and a thorough search of the main part of the house produced nothing of value the housemaids had both seen the snuffbox but could not remember how recently nothing else was missing there was quite definitely no sign whatever of a breakin or of any unauthorized person in any room upstairs or downstairs no one had heard anything in the street outside there had been no caller or tradesman other than those who had dealt with the household for years no vagrants no followers after the female servants that anyone would acknowledge no beggars peddlers or new deliverymen pitt and tellman left bedford square at half past nine and caught a hansom back towards the bow street station stopping just short of it to buy a hot cup of tea and a ham sandwich from a stall on the pavement separate bedrooms tellman said with his mouth full people of that social status usually have pitt replied sipping his tea and finding it too hot hardly seems worth it tellmans face was eloquent of his opinion of them but it means no one in the house is accounted for could have been any of them if the fellow did get in and was caught stealing he took another mouthful of his sandwich one of the maids could have let him in it happens anyone could have heard him and got into a fight even the general himself come to that pitt would have liked to dismiss that suggestion but the expression in balantynes eyes when he had seen the snuffbox was too sharp in his mind to allow it tellman was watching him waiting early to speculate pitt answered get a little more evidence first go round the rest of the square see if any of the other houses were broken into anything moved any disturbance why would he move something rather than take it tellman argued he wouldnt pitt looked at him coolly if he were caught in the act and killed presumably whoever killed him would take back what belonged to that house but not the snuffbox because it wasnt theirs and would require some explanation and well see what the surgeon can tell us when hes looked more closely and theres the bill for the socks he sipped his tea now it was cooler although putting a name to him may not help a great deal but diligent enquiry all around bedford square and the immediate neighborhood elicited nothing whatever of use no one had heard anything nothing was moved or missing everyone claimed to have slept through the night in the late afternoon general balantyne and his butler blisset fulfilled their duty by going to the mortuary to look at the dead man but neither knew him pitt watched balantynes expression as the face was uncovered and saw the momentary flicker of surprise almost as if balantyne had expected to see someone else possibly someone familiar no he said quietly i have not seen him before pitt arrived home late and a small domestic crisis kept charlotte too occupied for there to be time to discuss the case with her more than briefly he did not yet want to tell her of general balantynes involvement he remembered that she had liked him she had actually spent some time in his house helping him with something or other better to see if a simpler explanation appeared before he distressed her perhaps unnecessarily last thing at night was not an appropriate time in the morning pitt went to inform assistant commissioner cornwallis of the case simply because it had occurred in a part of the city where such an event was remarkable the crime itself might not have concerned any of the residents or their households but they would certainly be inconvenienced by it cornwallis was fairly new to his position he had spent most of his career in the navy and was well accustomed to command but the natures of crime and of politics were both new to him and politics in particular he found at times beyond his comprehension there was no deviousness to his mind he was unaccustomed to vanity and circular thinking the sea did not permit such indulgences it sorted the skilled from the clumsy the coward from the brave with a ruthlessness quite different from the impulses of ambition in the worlds of government and society cornwallis was of no more than average height lean as if physical occupation were more natural to him than sitting behind a desk when he moved it was with grace and control he was not handsomehis nose was too long too prominentbut there was balance in his face and an honesty the fact that he was entirely bald became him pitt found it difficult to think of him any other way what is it he looked up from his desk as pitt came into his room it was a sultry day outside and the windows were open allowing in the noise of traffic from the street below the rattle of carriage wheels the occasional cry of a coachman or hansom driver the heavy rumble of brewers drays the sharper treble of crossing sweepers hoping for a penny peddlers calling their wares bootlaces flowers sandwaches matches pitt closed the door behind him found a body in bedford square early yesterday morning he answered hoped it might be nothing to do with any of the houses there but he had a snuffbox in his hand which belonged to general brandon balantyne and it was actually on balantynes doorstep that he was lying burglary cornwallis asked the assumption in his voice there was a slight pucker between his brows as if he were waiting for pitt to explain why he had bothered to mention it let alone to come in person possibly he was burgling one of the houses and was caught in the act by a servant or the owner there was a fight and the thief was killed pitt said then in fear of the consequences they put him outside balantynes door instead of leaving him where he was and sending for the police all right cornwallis bit his lip i take your point pitt not the actions of innocent people even in panic how was he killed a blow to the head with a poker or something like it but there was a fight beforehand to judge by his knuckles pitt sat down in the chair opposite cornwalliss desk he was comfortable in this room with its watercolor seascapes on the walls the polished brass sextant on the shelf next to the books not only on police matters but also a jane austen novel and a copy of the bible and several volumes of poetry shelley keats and tennyson do you know who he is cornwallis asked placing his elbows on the desk and making a steeple of his fingers not yet but tellman is working on it pitt answered there was a receipt for three pair of socks in his pocket theres a chance it might help they were bought only two days before he was killed good cornwallis seemed to be unconcerned over the matter or perhaps he was occupied with something else the snuffbox in his pocket belonged to general balantyne pitt repeated cornwallis frowned presumably he stole it doesnt mean he met his death in balantynes home i imagine he stopped yes i see what you mean unpleasant and puzzling i know balantyne slightly a good man cant imagine him doing anything so stupid pitt had a strong sense of cornwalliss anxiety but it seemed to have been present since before pitt had come in as if something else held his attention so strongly he was unable to put his mind fully to what pitt was saying nor i pitt agreed cornwallis jerked his head up what i cant imagine general balantyne doing anything so stupid as putting a corpse outside his own front door rather than simply calling the police pitt said patiently do you know him cornwallis looked at pitt as if he had walked into the middle of a conversation and was aware he had missed the beginning yes i investigated two previous cases in which he was concerned indirectly as a witness oh i didnt know that is there something troubling you pitt liked cornwallis and while aware of his lack of political knowledge he had a profound respect for his honesty and his moral courage its not this tranby croft business is it what good heavens no for the first time since pitt had come in cornwallis relaxed on the verge of outright laughter im sorry for them all ive no idea whether gordoncumming was cheating or not but the poor devil will be ruined now either way and my opinion of the prince of wales or anyone else who spends his time drifting from one house party to another doing nothing more useful than playing cards is better unexpressed even in private pitt was uncertain whether to ask again or if that had been a polite way of evading the issue yet he was certain that cornwallis was worried to a degree that it intruded into his thoughts even when he wished to put his entire mind to a present issue cornwallis pushed back his chair and stood up he walked over to the window and pulled it closed sharply terrible noise out there he said with irritation keep me informed how you progress with this bedford square case it was dismissal pitt stood up yes sir he walked towards the door cornwallis cleared his throat pitt stopped i cornwallis began then hesitated pitt turned around to look at him there was a faint flush of color in cornwalliss lean cheeks he was profoundly unhappy he made the decision ive ive received a blackmail letter pitt was astonished of all the possibilities that had come to his mind this seemed the most outlandish words cut out from the times cornwallis went on in the prickling silence pasted on a piece of paper pitt scrambled his thoughts together with difficulty what do they want thats it cornwalliss body was rigid his muscles locked he stared at pitt nothing they dont ask for anything at all just the threat pitt loathed asking but not to would be to walk away from a man whose friendship he valued and who was obviously in profound need of uncritical help do you have the letter cornwallis took it out of his pocket and passed it over pitt read the pastedon letters most of them cut out singly some in twos and threes or where a whole word had been found as the writer wished to use it i know all about you captain cornwallis others think you are a hero but i know differently it was not you who was so brave on the hms venture it was able seaman beckwith but you took the credit hes dead now and he cannot tell the truth that is all wrong people should know i know pitt read it again there was no explicit threat no request for money or any other form of payment and yet the sense of power was so strong it leapt off the creased paper as if the thing had a malign life of its own he looked across at cornwalliss pale face and saw the muscles clenched in his jaw and the faint visible pulse in his temple i suppose you have no idea who it is none at all cornwallis replied i lay awake half last night trying to think his voice was dry as if he had held himself rigid so long his throat ached he breathed in deeply his eyes did not waver from pitts ive gone over and over the incident i think hes referring to to remember who was there who could have misinterpreted it to believe it that way and i dont know the answer he hesitated acute embarrassment naked in his face he was a private man who found emotion difficult to express he vastly preferred the tacit understanding of action he bit his lip he wanted to look away so he forced himself not to he was obviously sensitive to pitts discomfort and unintentionally made it worse he was aware of foundering of being indecisive the very sorts of things he had meant to avoid perhaps you had better tell me about the incident pitt said quietly he moved to sit down indicating his intention to stay yes cornwallis agreed oh yes of course he turned away at last his face towards the window the sharp daylight emphasized the depth of the lines about his eyes and mouth it happened eighteen years ago eighteen and a half it was winter bay of biscay weather was appalling i was a second lieutenant then man went up to shorten the mizzen royal the what pitt interrupted he needed to understand cornwallis glanced at him oh threemasted ship he moved his arms to illustrate what he was saying middle mast middle sail squarerigger of course injured by a loose rope his hand got it jammed somehow he frowned turning towards the window again away from pitt i went up after him should have sent a seaman of course but the only man near me was beckwith and he froze happens sometimes he spoke jerkily no time to look for someone else weather was getting worse ship pitching around afraid the injured man up on the mast would lose his grasp tear his arm out of its socket heights never bothered me in particular didnt really think about it been up often enough as a midshipman his mouth tightened got him free had to cut the line he was almost dead weight managed to get him back along the yard as far as the mast but he was damn heavy and the wind was rising all the time ship pitching around like a mad thing pitt tried to imagine it cornwallis desperate frozen trying to hang on to a swaying mast forty or fifty feet over a wild sea one minute above the heaving deck the next as the ship keeled out over the water and carrying another mans helpless body he found his own hands were knotted and he was holding his breath i was trying to readjust his weight to start down the mast cornwallis went on when beckwith must have unfrozen and i found him just below me he helped take the mans weight and we got down together by that time there were half a dozen other men on deck including the captain and it must have looked to them as if beckwith had rescued me the captain said as much but beckwith was an honest man and he told the truth he turned back to meet pitts eyes the light behind him now but i cant prove it beckwith died a few years after that and the man up the mast hadnt the faintest idea who else was there let alone what happened i see pitt said quietly cornwallis was staring at him and in the misery that was in his face pitt glimpsed some perception of fear that he was trying to hold inside himself he had lived a life of discipline against an element that gave no quarter no mercy to man or ship he had obeyed its rules and seen the deaths of those who had not or whom misfortune had overtaken he knew as few men can who spend their lives in the safety of the land the value of loyalty honor and sheer overwhelming physical courage instant and absolute obedience and total trust in those with whom you serve the hierarchy within a ship was absolute to have taken credit for another mans act of courage was unforgivable in what pitt knew of cornwallis it was also unthinkable he smiled at him meeting his gaze frankly ill look into it we need to know who is doing this and most of all what he wants once there is a specific demand then theres a crime cornwallis hesitated still keeping his hand on the letter as if already he feared the result of any action then suddenly he realized what he was doing he thrust the paper at pitt pitt took it and put it in his pocket without looking at it again ill be discreet he promised yes cornwallis said with an effort yes of course pitt took his leave and went out of the room along the corridor downstairs and out onto the pavement he had gone barely a dozen yards his mind consumed with cornwalliss distress when he was forcibly stopped by almost colliding with a man who moved across in front of him mr pitt sir he said looking up at him but although his words were framed as a question there was a certainty in his face yes pitt replied a trifle sharply he did not like being accosted so physically and he was too concerned about the ugliness of cornwalliss situation to wish interruption in his thought he felt frustrated and helpless to protect a man he cared about from a danger he feared was very real my name is lyndon remus from the times the man said quickly still standing directly in front of pitt he produced a card out of his inside coat pocket and held it out pitt ignored it what is it mr remus what can you tell me about the dead man found in bedford square yesterday morning nothing except what you already know pitt replied then you are baffled remus concluded without hesitation that is not what i said pitt was annoyed the man presumed without justification and pitt hated trickery with words i said i can tell you nothing beyond what you know that he is dead and where he was found on the front doorstep of general brandon balantynes house remus said then there is something you know but cannot tell us is general balantyne involved or someone in his household pitt realized now with considerable anger that he must be a good deal more careful how he phrased his replies mr remus a body was found in bedford square he said grimly we do not yet know who he was or how he died except that it seems extremely unlikely it was an accident speculation would be irresponsible and might severely damage the reputation of an innocent person when we know something for certain the press will be told now will you please get out of my way sir and allow me to go about my business remus did not move will you be investigating general balantyne mr pitt he was caught he could not say no without both lying and appearing to be prejudiced or inefficient and if he said yes then remus would take it to imply suspicion of balantyne if he evaded the question remus could put any complexion on it that he wished remus smiled mr pitt i shall begin by investigating the dead man pitt replied awkwardly aware of inadequacy in the face of questions he should have foreseen he took a breath then of course i shall follow that lead wherever it takes me remus smiled bleakly isnt this the same general balantyne whose daughter christina was involved in the murders in the devils acre in about dont expect me to do your work for you mr remus pitt snapped and slipped around him smartly good day he strode off leaving remus looking satisfied pitt arrived home at the end of the day tired and unhappy they had the full information about the death of the man in bedford square the written report added nothing to what the surgeon had told him in the beginning tellman was busy pursuing the bill for the socks and further questioning all the residents around the square nobody had seen or heard anything of value actually pitt was more troubled over the letter cornwallis had received although the two matters were not dissimilar insofar as each could cause harm to the reputation of a good man by whisper suspicion and innuendo before any facts were known suggestions could ruin a person if they were believed even by a few both men were vulnerable but pitt knew and liked cornwallis and he believed him totally innocent it was odd that he had received what was clearly a threatening letter yet with no request or demand presumably it would follow soon he went in through the front door hung up his coat then bent and unlaced his boots and took them off he walked in stocking feet along to the kitchen where he guessed charlotte would be they had an excellent maid gracie but charlotte still did most of the cooking herself a maidofallwork came in four days a week to do the heavy linen laundry scrubbing and so on at least that was what he thought it was not his concern charlotte was at the stove as he had expected and there was a savory aroma coming from the oven everything was clean smelling of scrubbed wood and fresh linen he glanced up and saw sheets hanging on the airing rail across the ceiling ropes to the winch that held it up on the wall blueandwhite china on the dresser gleamed in the sun from the windows charlotte had flour on the front of her dress her apron was caught up at the corner and her hair was coming out of its pins he put his arms around her and kissed her ignoring the long spoon in her hand which trailed egg yolk across the top of the stove and onto the floor she kissed him back with considerable enthusiasm then told him off look what you have made me do she indicated the egg its all over the place she went to the sink wrung out a cloth and came back and wiped it up on the stove it was burnt and smelling slightly he stood still cornwalliss face sharp in his minds eye cornwallis had none of pitts safety protecting him no one cornwallis knew would believe in him regardless of what anyone said not even someone with whom he could share the tension of waiting for the next letter to come or explain why it mattered so much what is it charlotte asked watching him more closely now automatically she pulled the dish with the egg away from the heat is it the body in bedford square is it going to involve one of the houses there i dont know he answered sitting down on one of the hardbacked chairs by the kitchen table its possible i was stopped by a newspaper writer this afternoon he wanted to know if i was going to investigate general balantyne she stiffened balantyne he lives in callander square why would you investigate him he must have moved he replied still unable to rid himself of his fear for cornwallis im sorry it was on his doorstep that the body was found i dont suppose it was more than mischance it was only towards the end of dinner when he was eating the baked egg custard that he even thought of the snuffbox and realized that he had told her a good deal less than the truth but there was no point in distressing her by adding that now it would worry her for nothing she could not help he was too absorbed in his own thoughts to notice her silence as anything but companionable where should he begin with cornwalliss letter how could he protect him charlotte had been distressed to learn that the tragedy of murder had again overtaken general balantyne even if only in that the dead man had been found on his doorstep but it was a public place certainly anyone at all might have come to it without his knowledge or any acquaintance with him the following morning when pitt had gone she left gracie to clean away the breakfast dishes while she saw nineyearold jemima and sevenyearold daniel off to school then returned to the kitchen with the daily newspaper brought to the step as a kindness by mr williamson along the street the first thing that leapt to her eye was the latest report on the tranby croft affair speculation was running riot as to whether the prince of wales would actually be called to the witness standand of course what he would say having the heir to the throne appearing in court like a common man had never even been imagined before much less had it happened the room would be jammed with people curious just to stare at him to hear him speak and have to answer questions put to him by counsel admission to the court was by ticket only sir william gordoncumming was represented by sir edward clarke for the other side sir charles russell present according to the newspaper were lord edward somerset the earl of coventry and mrs lycettgreen among many others baccarat was an illegal game gambling in any form was upon by many cards were viewed as a waste of precious time everyone knew that thousands of people played of course but there was a world of difference between knowing and seeing it was said that the queen was beside herself with anger but then she was rather a straitlaced and forbidding woman even at the best of times ever since prince albert had died of typhoid fever nearly thirty years before she seemed to have lost all pleasure in life and was fairly well determined to see that everyone else did too at least that was what charlotte had heard said and the queens rare public appearances did nothing to disprove it the prince of wales was a spendthrift selfindulgent gluttonous and wildly and regularly unfaithful to his wife the longsuffering princess alexandra most particularly with lady frances brooke who was also intimately admired by sir william gordoncumming until this point charlotte had had a very slight sympathy with him facing the court sir ediward clarke and the public would be nothing compared with facing his mother then farther down on the same page she saw an article by one lyndon remus about the corpse found in bedford square the identity of the dead man on the front doorstep of the house of general brandon balantyne two mornings ago remains a mystery superintendent thomas pitt of bow street informs this writer that as yet the police have no idea as to his identity indeed he went so far as to say that he knew no more of it than any member of the general public when pressed he refused to say whether or not he intended to investigate general balantyne who as readers will remember was the father of the infamous christina balantyne of what came to be known as the devils acre murders which scandalised london in there then followed a brief but lurid outline of that terrible and tragic case with which charlotte was all too familiar remembering it now with a profound sense of sorrow she could see balantynes face as it had been when he had learned the truth and everyone was powerless to help or comfort now another wretchedness threatened him and all the misery and grief of the past were resurrected again she was furious with lyndon remus whoever he might be and her mind was filled with anxiety for balantyne yer all right maam gracies voice cut across charlottes thoughts the little maid picked up the smoothing iron and automatically shooed archie the marmaladeandwhite cat from his nest on top of the laundry he uncurled and moved away lazily knowing full well that she would not hurt him charlotte looked up no she replied the body that mr pitt found the other night was on the doorstep of an old friend of mine and the newspapers are suggesting that he may be somehow involved there was an appalling crime in his family a few years ago and they have raked that up again as well reminding everybody of it just when he and his wife might be beginning to forget a little and feel normal again some o them people wot writes for the newspapers is downright wicked gracie said angrily gripping the iron like a weapon she knew precisely where her loyalties lay with friends with the hurt the weak the underdog whoever he was sometimes with a lot of reason and persuasion she could change her mind but not often and not easily yer goin ter elp she said looking narrowly at charlotte int nuffin yer needs ter do ere i can manage evrythink charlotte smiled in spite of herself gracie was a born crusader she had come to the pitts nearly seven years before small and thin in clothes too big for her and boots with holes in them she had filled out only a little all her dresses still had to be taken in and taken up but she was not only an accomplished maid who knew all the duties in the house with charlottes help she had learned to read and write she had always been able to count above all from being a waif that nobody wanted she had turned into a young woman who was very proud of working for quite the best policeman in london which meant anywhere she would tell everyone so if they appeared to be ignorant of that fact thank you charlotte said with sudden decision she closed the newspaper and stood up she jammed it savagely into the coal scuttle and went to the door i shall go and visit the general and see if i can be of any help even if it is only to let him know that i am still his friend good gracie agreed mebbe we can do summink as can elp she included herself with both pride and determination she regarded herself as part of the detective work she had contributed significantly in the past and had every hope and intention of doing so in the future charlotte went upstairs and changed out of her plain summer day dress of blue muslin and put on a very flattering gown of soft yellow which complemented her complexion and the auburn tones of her hair it was also cut to a very becoming shape tightwaisted fullsleeved at the shoulder with a sweeping skirt and a very small bustle as was the current fashion it had been her one recent extravagance mostly she had to make do with what was serviceable and could last several seasons with minor changes of course her sister emily who had married very well indeed the first time and then been widowed and was now married again was generous with castoffs and mistakes but charlotte was loath to accept too much in case it made thomas feel more acutely aware of her step down in circumstances by marrying a policeman and anyway parliament was in recess at the moment and emily and jack were away in the country on this occasion taking grandmama with them even caroline charlottes mother was away in edinburgh with her husband joshuas new play but there was no questioning that this particular gown was as successful as anything she had ever worn either owned or borrowed she left the house and went out into the sunshine of keppel street there was no need to think of transport as she had no more than a few hundred yards to go it was odd to think of general balantynes having moved to live so close by and she had never encountered him but then there must be scores of her neighbors she had not seen and in spite of their proxfrowned imity to each other bedford square and keppel street were socially of a very considerable difference she nodded to two young ladies walking side by side and they nodded back to her politely then immediately fell into animated conversation an open brougham clattered past its occupants surveying the world with superior interest a man walked by swiftly looking to neither side of him charlotte did not know which house was the balantynes pitt had simply said in the center of the north side she gritted her teeth and rang the bell of the one that seemed most likely it was answered by a handsome parlormaid who informed her that she was mistaken and that general balantyne lived two doors farther along charlotte thanked her with as much aplomb as possible and retreated she would have liked to abandon the whole thing at this point she had not even any coherent plan as to what she would say if he were in and would receive her she had come entirely on impulse he might have changed completely since they had last met it had been four years tragedy did change people this was a ridiculous idea quixotic and open to the ugliest misinterpretations why was she still walking forward instead of turning on her heel and going home because she had told gracie she was going to see a friend who had been visited by misfortune and assure him of her loyalty she could hardly go back home and admit that her nerve had failed her and she was afraid of making a fool of herself gracie would despise her for that she would despise herself she strode up the steps seized the doorbell and pulled it firmly before she could have time to think better of it she stood with her heart pounding as if when the door opened she could be facing mortal danger she had visions of max the footman the balantynes had had years before and all the tragedy and violence that had followed and christina how that would have hurt the general she had been his only daughter this was absurd she was grossly intrusive why on earth should she imagine he wished to see her now after all that pitt had been forced to do to their family and charlotte had helped she was practically the last person on earth he would have any kindness for he certainly would not care for her friendship it was tasteless of her to have come and hopelessly conceited she stepped back and had half turned away to leave when the door opened and a footman asked her very distinctly good morning maam may i help you oh good morning she could ask for directions somewhere pretend to be looking for some fictitious person she did not have to say she had called here i i wonder if miss ellison i mean i beg your pardon maam mrs pitt isnt it she stared at him she could not remember him how could he possibly have remembered her yes if youd like to come in mrs pitt i shall see if lady augusta or general balantyne is at home he stepped back to allow her to accept she had no choice thank you she found she was shaking if lady augusta was in what could charlotte possibly say to her they had disliked each other before christina now it would be even worse what on earth could she say what excuse was there for her presence she was shown into the morning room and recognized the model of the brass gun carriage from waterloo on the table it was as if the years had telescoped into each other and vanished she felt the horror of the devils acre murders as if they were still happening all the pain and injustice raw she paced back and forth once she actually went as far as the door into the hall and opened it but there was a housemaid on the stairs if she left now she would be seen she would look even more absurd than if she stayed she closed the door again and waited facing it as if she expected an attack it opened and general balantyne stood there he was older tragedy had marked his face there was a knowledge of pain in his eyes and his mouth which had not been there when they had first met but his back was as straight his shoulders as square and he looked as directly as he always had mrs pitt there was surprise in his face and a softness which was almost certainly pleasure she remembered how very much she had liked him general balantyne without thinking she stepped forward i really dont know why i have come except to say how sorry i am that you should have the misfortune of some miserable man choosing your doorstep on which to die i hope they can clear it up rapidly and you she stopped he did not deserve platitudes lyndon remus had already done the harm by resurrecting the devils acre case no solution to this new murder would undo that im sorry she said sincerely i suppose that was all i wanted to say i could have written a letter couldnt i he smiled very slightly a beautifully phrased most tactful one which would not have meant much and not sounded like you at all he answered and i should think you had changed which i should regret then he colored faintly as if he were aware of having been too outspoken i hope ive learned a little she said even if i sometimes fail to put it into practice she wanted to remain at least a few minutes longer perhaps there was something she could do to help if only she could think of it but it would be horribly intrusive to ask questions and pitt would already have done so anyway why did she imagine she could do anything more he broke the silence how are you how is your family very well my children are growing up jemima is quite tall ah yes jemima a smile touched his mouth again no doubt like her he was thinking of jemima waggoner who had married his only son and after whom charlotte had named her daughter they returned the compliment you know the compliment she asked yes they called their second son thomas oh she smiled back no i didnt know i shall tell him hell be very pleased are they well very brandy is posted in madrid now we dont see them very often you must miss them yes there was a moment of deep loneliness in his eyes he looked away staring out of the window into the quiet summer garden roses lush and heavy in the morning sun the dew already evaporated from them the clock ticked on the mantelshelf my mother remarried charlotte said awkwardly he dragged himself to the present and turned back to face her oh i hope she is happy it was not a question one did not ask about such things it was far too personal and intrusive one did not even speak about happiness or unhappiness it would be indelicate she smiled at him meeting his eyes oh yes she married an actor he looked mystified i beg your pardon had she gone too far she had meant to lighten the tension and perhaps he had taken it for levity she could not go back so she plunged on she married an actor rather younger than she is would he be scandalized she felt the heat burn up her cheeks he has a great deal of courage and charm moral courage i mean to remain loyal to friends in difficulty and to fight for what he believes to be right his expression eased the lines around his mouth softening i am glad for an instant almost too short to be certain she saw it there was passionate regret in his eyes then he took a breath i gather that you like him yes i do and mama is very happy although she has changed a good deal she has the acquaintance now of people she would never have imagined knowing a few years ago and i am afraid some of her earlier friends no longer call and even turn the other way if they encounter her in the street a flicker of amusement touched his mouth i can imagine it the door opened and lady augusta balantyne stood in the entrance she looked magnificent her dark hair piled in a great swirl on her head the silver streaks making it look even more dramatic she was dressed in lilac and gray in the height of fashion and wore a very fine amethyst necklace and earrings she regarded charlotte with cold distaste good morning mrs pitt i assume i am addressing you correctly this was a sarcastic reminder that when charlotte had first entered their house it had been ostensibly to assist the general with some clerical work on his memoirs and she had used her maiden name to disguise her connection with pitt and the police again charlotte felt the blush warm her cheeks good morning lady augusta how are you i am perfectly well thank you augusta replied coming farther into the room i presume it is not mere civility which brings you here to enquire after our wellbeing this was an icy impasse there was nothing to do but brazen it out there was little room to make it any worse charlotte smiled brightly yes it is everyone would know that was a lie but no one could call it so it was only yesterday i realized that we were near neighbors ah the newspapers augusta said with immeasurable contempt ladies of breeding or gentility did not read the newspapers except for the society pages and the advertisements and charlotte might once have had an element of breeding but she had married a policeman and that had disposed of any pretensions to gentility now charlotte raised her eyebrows very high was your address in the newspapers she said innocently of course it was augusta said as you know perfectly well some unfortunate wretch was murdered on our doorstep dont be disingenuous mrs pitt it ill becomes you balantyne flushed hotly like most men he loathed emotional confrontations and those between women most of all but he had never flinched from his duty augusta mrs pitt came to express her sympathy for our misfortune in that issue he said critically i assume she knew of it from superintendent pitt not from the newspapers do you augusta retorted with equal chill towards him then you are very naive brandon but that is your own affair i am going to call upon lady evesham she turned to charlotte i am sure you will be gone when i return so i shall wish you good day mrs pitt and she turned with a swirl of skirts and went out of the door leaving it open behind her balantyne went over and closed it with a sharp snap to the obvious surprise of the footman standing in the foyer and holding augustas cape im sorry balantyne said with profound embarrassment he did not offer any explanation or attempt to make better of it any candor between them would be shattered by such a denial of the truth it was probably well deserved she finished for him ruefully it was rather clumsy of me to have come at all and i had no idea what i was going to say except that i feel for you and i hope you will consider me as your friend regardless of what should transpire he looked thoroughly taken aback by such frankness and acutely pleased thank you of course i shall he seemed about to add something more then changed his mind he was still deeply troubled and there was another emotion more powerful beneath the surface anger or shame for augustas behavior or for his own discomfort in the face of candor actually i did read the newspaper she admitted i assumed you did he said with the ghost of a smile it was a shameful piece completely irresponsible that was what prompted me to comeoutrage and to let you know i am on your side he looked away from her you speak blindly mrs pitt you cannot have any idea what may transpire he was not uttering some platitude she was quite surefrom the stiffness in his body the unhappiness in his face and the way he glanced away from herthat he feared something specific and the anxiety of it underlay everything else he was able to think of it frightened her for him and her response was to defend him instantly and without thought of course not she agreed what kind of friend makes their support conditional upon knowing everything that will happen and that there will be no unpleasant surprises and absolutely no inconvenience embarrassment or cost a great many friends he said quietly but none of the best but this loyalty must run both ways one does not allow friends to walk unknowingly into danger or unpleasantness nor require of them a pledge even unspoken whose costs you know and they do not he realized he had overstated what she had offered and looked deeply uncomfortable i mean she walked to the door then turned and met his eyes there is no need to explain time has passed since we last met but not so much as all that we do not misunderstand one another my friendship is yours for what that may be worth good day good day mrs pitt charlotte went straight home walking so briskly she passed by two people she knew without even noticing them she went in her own front door and straight through to the kitchen without bothering to take off her hat the ironing was finished and archie was asleep in the empty basket gracie looked up from the potatoes she was peeling the knife still in her hand her face full of anxiety put on the kettle charlotte requested sitting down in the nearest chair she would have done it herself but one did not go near even the cleanest stove when wearing a yellow gown gracie obeyed instantly then got out the teapot and the cups and saucers she fetched milk from the larder she set the blueandwhite jug on the table and removed the muslin cover weighted down all around with glass beads to keep it from blowing off ow was the general she asked getting the tin of biscuits off the dresser she still had to stretch to do it standing on tiptoe but she refused to put them on a lower shelf that would be acknowledging defeat very distressed charlotte answered did e know the man wot was killed gracie asked putting the biscuits on the kitchen table i didnt ask him charlotte sighed but i am afraid that he might he was extremely worried about something but e dint say i suppose no the kettle began to hiss as steam blew out of the spout and gracie took the holder for it to pick it up poured a little hot water into the teapot swilled it out and threw it away down the sink she put three spoonfuls of tea leaves into the pot and carried it back to the stove then poured the rest of the water on she filled up the kettle again as a matter of habit one should always have a kettle of hot water even in june are we goin ter do summink about it she asked carrying the teapot over and sitting down opposite charlotte the potatoes could wait this was important i dont know what we can do charlotte looked across at her absentmindedly she took off her hat are you scared as mebbe e did do summink gracie screwed up her face no gracie bit her lip arent yer charlotte hesitated what was balantyne afraid of he was certainly afraid of something was it simply more pain more public exposure of his personal and family affairs every family has grief embarrassments quarrels or mistakes they prefer to keep unknown from the public in general and from their own circle of acquaintances in particular just as one does not undress in the street im not really sure she said aloud setting the hat on the table i believe he is a totally honorable man but all of us can make errors of judgment and many of us do foolish or rash things to protect those we love or feel responsible for gracie poured the tea oos e responsible fer the general i dont know his wife maybe any of the servants perhaps a friend gracie thought for several minutes wots is wife like she said at length charlotte sipped her tea and tried to be fair very handsome very cold wouldnt a bin er lover would e this corpse no charlotte could not imagine augusta dissembling sufficiently to have a lover let alone one who would be found dead on a doorstep gracie was watching her anxiously you don like er a lot do yer charlotte sighed no not a lot but i dont think she would attack anyone without extraordinarily good reason and i cant think of anything that would make her kill someone and then not be perfectly prepared to call the police and explain herselfif for example she had caught him in the house attempting to steal and he had turned on her wot if the general caught im gracie asked taking a biscuit the same why not call the police i dunno gracie sipped her tea also yer sure e were upset about the body not summink else i think so then i spose as wed better keep up wif everythink as the master finds out gracie said seriously yes charlotte agreed wishing they could know at least some of it before pitt found out gracie was watching her waiting for her to take the lead with some practical and clever plan there were only two things in her mind the sense of fear she had drawn from general balantyne as he stood by the window in his morning room and her sharp awareness that sergeant tellman very much against his will and judgment was attracted to gracie it was against his judgment because they disagreed about almost everything gracie considered herself to be very fortunate to work in pitts house to have a roof over her head a warm bed every night and good food every day she had not always had these things or expected to she also considered that she was doing a very important and useful job and was appropriately proud of it tellman had profound feelings regarding the innate social evil of any persons being servant to another from that basic difference sprang a host of others on every subject of social justice and personal judgment and gracie was cheerful and outgoing by nature while he was dour and pessimistic they had neither of them yet realized that they shared a passionate sense of justice a hatred of hypocrisy and a willingness to work and to risk their own safety to fight for what they believed in sergeant tellman is on the case charlotte said aloud i dont see as avin im elps gracie replied wrinkling her nose a little i spose es quite clever in is own fashion this last was added half grudgingly but e wont old no favors for generals an the like i know he wont charlotte admitted thinking of tellmans opinion of all inherited privilege no doubt he was fully aware that in balantynes time of office commissions were purchased but at least we have him yer mean like ter speak to gracie was puzzled yes a plan was rapidly forming in charlottes mind not a very good one so far he might be persuaded to tell us what information he has learned gracie brightened yer reckon if yer asked im like i was thinking more if you asked him me e wouldnt tell me nuffink ed say sharpish as it were none o my business i can see is face now if i started meddlin wif questions about is work tell me right were to put meself e would charlotte took a deep breath and plunged in i had in mind more if he were to make his reports to mr pitt at home instead of at bow street and perhaps when mr pitt happened to be out ow are we goin ter manage that gracie was nonplussed charlotte thought of tellmans face as he had looked at gracie the last time she had observed them together i think that could be arranged if you were to be very nice to him gracie opened her mouth to argue then colored very pink i spose i could be if it was important charlotte beamed at her thank you i should be very grateful mind i do appreciate it will take a great deal of careful planning and it may not work every time a little subterfuge may be necessary a little what gracie frowned a little more or less than the truth now and again oh yeah i see o course gracie smiled back and took another sip of her tea reaching for a second biscuit in the laundry basket archie woke up stretched and started to purr when sergeant tellman had begun to work on identifying the body found on general balantynes step he had naturally started at the mortuary looking at corpses was part of his duty but something he disliked intensely for a start they were naked and it was an intrusion into a mans decent privacy he was helpless to prevent tellman found it offensive even though he completely understood the necessity secondly the smell of dead flesh formaldehyde and carbolic turned his stomach and no matter what time of the year it was the place always seemed cold he found himself both sweating and shivering but he was conscientious the more he disliked a job the less would he stint in doing it however even the most diligent examination taught him nothing he had not observed in the first few moments by lantern light in bedford square the dead man was lean to thin wiry pale skinned where his clothes covered him weathered where they did not as if he spent much time in the open his hands were not those of a laborer he had several scrapes as if he had fought hard to save himself especially across his knuckles he had been hit extremely hard on the head killed with one blow he looked as nearly as tellman could judge to be in his fifties there were half a dozen old scars of varying sizes none of them looked to be from major injuries just the sort of thing any man might collect if he had been involved in dangerous work or lived largely on the streets there was one exception a long thin scar across the left side of his ribs as though from a knife slash tellman replaced the sheet gratefully and moved to the clothes they were well worn rather grubby and uncared for the soles of the boots were in need of repair they were exactly what he would have expected of a poor man who had spent the day outside and possibly the night before as well they told him nothing but the contents of the pockets were a different matter of course the most interesting thing was the snuffbox now in pitts keeping he was puzzled as to its meaning it could be any of a dozen things all more or less implicating general balantyne but pitt had said he would look into that himself a year before tellman would not have believed him expecting him to protect the gentry from the just desserts for their own deeds now he knew better but it still rankled the only other thing that seemed relevant to the search for either his identity or that of the person who had killed him seemed to be the receipt for the three pairs of socks actually he was surprised that a man in such circumstances should purchase socks from a shop which had its name on the paper he would have expected him to buy them from a peddler or market stall still the receipt was there so he should follow it he was relieved to be able to go out into the sun again and the relatively fresh air of the street with its smell of smoke horse dung and dry gutters and the sound of hooves on the cobbles peddlers cries the clatter of wheels and somewhere in the distance a barrel organ and an errand boy whistling offkey he caught a horsedrawn omnibus running after it the last few paces as it drew away from the curb and swinging himself onto the step to the great disapproval of a fat woman in gray bombazine yerll get yerself killed like that young man she said critically i hope not but thank you for the warning he replied with politeness which surprised both of them he paid his fare to the conductor and looked without success for a seat being obliged to remain standing holding on to the post in the center of the aisle he got off again at high holborn and walked the two blocks to red lion square he found the haberdashers shop easily and went inside with the receipt in his hand mornin sir the young man behind the counter said helpfully can i show you anything we have excellent gentlemens shirts at very agreeable prices socks tellman answered wondering if he could afford a new shirt those on display looked very clean and crisp yes sir what color sir we have em all tellman remembered the socks the dead man had been wearing gray he answered certainly sir what size would you be requiring nine if the dead man could afford socks so could he the young man bent to a drawer behind him and produced three different pairs of gray socks in size nine tellman selected the pair he liked best glanced quickly at the price and produced the money leaving himself sufficient for his bus fare back to bow street but unfortunately not enough for lunch thank you sir will that be all no tellman held out the receipt im a policeman can you tell me who bought these gray socks five days ago the man took the receipt oh dear we sell a lot of socks sir and gray is a popular color this time o year lighter than black you see and better looking than brown always look a bit country brown if you know what i mean yes think hard if you please its very important done something wrong has he they were paid for that i can swear to i can see that dont know what he did but hes dead the young man paled perhaps it had been a tactical error to have told him that gray socks tellman repeated grimly yes sir what did he look like do you know about my height tellman said thinking with an unpleasant chill how much he resembled the man on the step thin wiry fairish hair receding a little that at least was different tellman had dark hair straight and still thick and midfifties i would guess lived or worked outdoors but not with his hands sounds like two or three what come here often enough the young man said thoughtfully could be george mason or willie strong or could be someone as never came but the once dont know everybodys name cant you tell me anything else about him tellman thought hard this might be their only chance to identify him he had a long knife or bayonet scar on his chest he indicated on himself the place where it had been then realized the futility of telling the salesman such a thing could have been a soldier he added more to defend his remark than anything else the salesmans face brightened there was one gentleman come in and i think he did buy several pairs thinking on it had a bit of a conversation cos he spoke about being a soldier and how important it was to keep your feet right i remember he said soldier with sore feet is use to neither man nor beast thats why he sold bootlaces himself now hes fallen on hard times but i cant tell you his name or where he lives dont recall as i ever saw him before an didnt see him that well this time it were a fine evenin but he was muffled up said he had a chill but he was thinnish and about your height couldnt say dark or fair where did he sell his bootlaces tellman asked quickly did he say yes yes he did corner of lincolns inn and great queen street thank you it took tellman the rest of the day but he found george mason and willie strong the two men the salesclerk had named and they were both quite definitely alive then he made enquiries about the peddlers in lincolns inn fields and learned that there was normally an old soldier named albert cole on the northwest corner near great queen street however no one recalled seeing him for five or six days several barristers from the inns of court habitually bought their bootlaces from him and described him passably well one of them offered to come to the mortuary the next day and identify the body if he could yes the barrister said unhappily i am afraid that looks very much like cole can you say for sure that its him tellman pressed dont say if you arent happy about it im not exactly happy about it the barrister snapped but yes i am quite certain poor devil he fished in his pocket and brought out four guineas he put them on the table put this towards a decent burial for him he used to be a soldier served his queen and country he shouldnt end up in a paupers grave thank you tellman said with surprise he had not expected such generosity towards a stranger and a peddler at that from a class of man for whom he had an innate contempt the barrister gave him a chilly look and turned to leave do you know anything else about him sir tellman said as he followed him into the street its extremely important the barrister slowed unwillingly but his training in the law was deeply implanted he was a soldier invalided out i think i dont know what regiment i never asked i can probably find that out tellman said keeping step anything else sir dont know where he lived or if he had any other place except lincolns inn fields i dont think so he was usually there any weather ever mention where he got his bootlaces the barrister looked at him with surprise no i merely purchased the odd pair from him sergeant i did not indulge in long conversations i am sorry this man is dead but i cannot be of further assistance he pulled his gold watch out of his pocket and opened it now i have spared as much time as i can affordin fact rather more i must take a cab back to my office i wish you godspeed in finding his killer good day to you tellman watched him disappear into the crowd at least he now knew the identity of the dead man and from as good a witness as he was likely to findcertainly one who would stand up in court but what had albert cole exsoldier present seller of bootlaces been doing in the middle of the night in bedford square it was less than a mile away but peddlers rarely moved even a couple of blocks if they did they were on somebody elses patch and that was a mortal offense and likely to bring them considerable unpleasantness peddlers were very seldom violent people but even if they were it would be cause for a severe fight but not murder except by accident but one did not peddle bootlaces at midnight obviously something quite different had taken him to general balantynes front doorstep he could not have been courting a maid that would have taken him to the back the last thing he would want would be to go to the front door exposed to the street the beat constable any passerby and certainly no maid keeping an assignation would let him in at the front for that matter why would anyone intending burglary be a moment longer at the front than necessary surely he would slip from one back alley to another through the mews if possible backyards and tradesmens entrances where coal and kitchen goods were delivered and rubbish was taken away so why was he at the front door and with balantynes snuffbox in his pocket tellman walked along the footpath with his head down deep in thought he could not formulate a satisfactory answer but he felt sure that somehow the balantyne house had something to do with it it was not chance there was a reason he needed to know more about general brandon balantyne and also about lady augusta he did not really suspect her of anything certainly not alone and he had very little idea of how to go about investigating her he was not a cowardly man and held no innate respect for anyone because of their position or wealth but he still quaked at the thought of addressing augusta the general was different tellman understood men far better and it would be a relatively easy business to check the generals military career much of that would be public knowledge through the army similarly he could find and check albert coles record of service albert cole the military clerk repeated middle name sergeant no idea where was e born dont know dont know much do you he was a middleaged man who was bored by his job and made as much of it as possible particularly in this instance of its complication and its inconvenience tellman was civil only with difficulty but he needed the information only that hes been murdered he replied ill see what i can do the mans face tightened and he went away to search leaving tellman sitting on a wooden bench in the outer office it was the best part of an hour before he returned but he had the information albert milton cole he said with great importance thisll be your man born may in battersea served in the rd foot it says here he looked up at tellman thats the duke of wellingtons regiment got a bullet wound in left leg igh up broke the bone sent orne and pensioned off nothing after that nothing against him though never married according ter this any elp not yet what can you tell me about general brandon balantyne the mans eyebrows shot up generals now is it thats a different kettle o fish altogether you got some authority for that yes im investigating the murder of a soldier who was found with his skull broken on general balantynes doorstep the clerk hesitated then decided he was curious himself he had no particular love for generals if he had to do this and he thought he probably did then he would look less unimportant if he did it willingly he went away again and came back fifteen minutes later with several sheets of paper and presented them to tellman tellman took them and read brandon peverell balantyne had been born on march the eldest son of brandon ellwood balantyne of bishop auckland county durham educated at addiscombe graduated at sixteen when he was eighteen his father had purchased him a commission and he had sailed for india as a lieutenant in the bengal engineers and was immediately involved in the second sikh war where he was present at the siege of multan and served with distinction although wounded at the battle of gujrat in he had led a column in the first black mountain hazara expedition on the northwest frontier and the year after he was with an expedition against the jowaki afridis in peshawar during the indian mutiny he had been with outram and havelock in the first relief of lucknow and then in its final capture there he had served brilliantly chasing rebel bands in oudh and gwalior in and he had gone on to command a division in the china war of where he had been decorated for valor he was in the bombay army with general robert napier when napier had been ordered to command the expedition to abyssinia in balantyne had gone with him after that balantyne had been promoted to command himself and remained in africa fighting with continued distinction in ashantiland in and then in the zulu wars of and after that he retired and returned home to england permanently it was a career of apparent distinction and honor and undeserved privilege paid for in the first place by his father that was a deep offense to tellman an injustice inherent in a social system he despised on the surface he was more angered that apparently balantynes path had never crossed that of albert cole he thanked the clerk for his assistance and left the following morning tellman began the task of learning about balantyne in earnest he waited outside the house in bedford square standing across from it on the pavement under the trees alternatively kicking his heels or pacing back and forth always swinging around to look at the front door or the main entrance he had little hope that any of the servants would talk in that sort of establishment he knew they had loyalties and it was more than a servants job was worth to gossip about his or her employers no one could afford to be dismissed without a reference it was ruin general balantyne emerged from the front door a little after half past ten and walked uprightly along the pavement along bayley street and turned left into the tottenham court road down towards oxford street where he turned right and walked westward he was dressed formally in dark trousers and a beautifully tailored coat tellman had vivid opinions about anyone who required a servant to dress him satisfactorily the general spoke to no one and appeared not to look either to right or left as he went marched would have been the appropriate word he looked stiff as if he were going into battle a cold rigid man tellman thought as he walked behind him probably proud as lucifer what was he thinking about the crowds he passed through that they were the civilian equivalent of foot soldiers people it was not necessary to make way for even to regard at all certainly he barely seemed to be aware of them and he spoke to no one nor raised his hat he passed two or three soldiers actually in uniform but ignored them and they him at argyll street he turned sharply right and tellman almost missed him climbing the steps of a handsome house and going inside tellman went to the door after him and saw the brass plate on which was engraved the words the jessop club for gentlemen he hesitated there would be a steward of some sort in the vestibule he would no doubt know all the members he would therefore be an excellent source of information but again one whose livelihood depended upon his discretion he must be inventive he was serving no purpose standing in the street people would think him a peddler he jerked his lapels straighter squared his shoulders and pulled the doorbell it was answered by a middleaged steward in wellcut slightly faded livery yes sir he regarded tellman blankly summing up his social status in a glance tellman felt the blood burn in his face he would have liked to tell the man his opinion of gentlemen who spent their days with their feet up or playing games of cards or billiards with each other parasites on decent people the lot of them he could also have added his contempt for those who earned their living by pandering to such leeches good morning he said stiffly im sergeant tellman of the bow street police station he held out his card as proof of it the steward looked at it without touching it as if it had been unclean indeed he said expressionlessly tellman gritted his teeth we are looking for a man who is pretending to be a retired army officer of distinguished service in order to defraud people out of considerable sums of money the stewards face darkened with disapproval tellman had his attention at least i hope you catch him he said vehemently doing everything we can tellman replied with feeling this man is tall broadshouldered very upright military looking in his bearing dresses well the steward frowned that describes a few that i can think of can you tell me anything else about him i know all our members of course but sometimes gentlemen bring in guests so far as we know hes clean shaven tellman went on although of course that can change fairish hair thinning a bit gray at the temples aquiline features blue eyes cant say as ive seen him i followed a man here just this moment the stewards face cleared oh thats general balantyne known him for years his expression suggested something close to amusement are you certain tellman persisted this devil uses other peoples names pretty freely was general balantyne yes did general balantyne seem his usual self to you well hard to say the steward hesitated tellman had a stroke of genius you see sir he said confidentially leaning forward a little i think this bounder may be using general balantynes name running up bills even borrowing money the stewards face blanched i must warn the general no no sir that would not be a good idea just yet tellman swallowed hard he would be extremely angry he might unintentionally warn this man and we need to catch him before he does the same thing to someone else if you would be so good as to tell me a little about the real general then i can make sure that the other places he frequents are not taken in by the impostor oh the steward nodded his understanding yes i see well he belongs to one or two services clubs i believe and whites although i dont think he goes there so often as here this last was added with pride a slight straightening of the shoulders not a very social sort of man tellman suggested well always very civil but not not overfriendly if you get my meaning sir yes i do tellman thought of balantynes rigid back his rapid stride along oxford street speaking to no one does he gamble at all do you know i believe not sir nor drink very much either does he go to the theater or the music hall i dont think so sir the steward shook his head never heard him refer to it but i think he has been to the opera quite often and to the symphony tellman grunted and museums no doubt he said sarcastically yes sir i believe so rather solitary sort of occupations doesnt he have any friends hes always very agreeable the steward said thoughtfully never heard anyone speak ill of him but he doesnt sit around talking a lot doesnt gossip if you know what i mean doesnt gamble you see no sports interests not that i ever heard of he sounded surprised as he said it as if it had not occurred to him before pretty careful with money tellman concluded not extravagant the steward conceded but not mean either reads a lot and i overheard him once say he liked to sketch of course hes traveled a lotindia africa china too so i heard yes but always to do with war soldiers life the steward said a trifle sententiously and with considerable respect tellman wondered if he had the same respect for the foot soldiers who actually did the fighting he went on talking to the steward for several minutes more but little was added to the picture he was forming of a stiff cold man whose career had been purchased by his family and who had made few friends learned little of comradeship and nothing of the arts of pleasure except those he considered socially admirable like the opera which was all foreign anyway so tellman had heard none of it appeared to have anything whatever to do with albert cole and yet there was a connection there must be otherwise how had cole got the snuffbox and why was that the only thing taken general brandon balantyne was a lonely unbending man who followed solitary pursuits he had been privileged all his life working for none of the advantages he possessed money rank position in society his beautiful house in bedford square his titled wife but he was also a troubled man tellman was a good enough judge of character to know that and he intended to find out what that trouble was most especially if it had cost ordinary poor underfed and illclothed albert cole his life honest men reported thieves they did not murder them what could albert cole poor devil have seen in that house in bedford square for which he had been killed pitt was concerned with the murdered man who had been found in bedford square but cornwalliss problem preyed more urgently upon his mind for the time being there was not a great deal he could accomplish that could not be done equally as well by tellman as far as discovering who the man was and if possible what had taken him to bedford square in the middle of the night he still thought it most likely to be a burglary which had in some disastrous way gone wrong he hoped profoundly that balantyne was not involved that the man had burgled balantyne first taking the snuffbox and then gone on elsewhere and been caught in the act and killed perhaps accidentally the killer had removed his own belongings but had not taken the snuffbox in case the possession of it incriminated him it was probably a footman or butler in one of the other houses when it was discovered which then great tact would be necessary but all the discretion in the world would not much alter the final outcome and he had confidence in tellmans ability to pursue the trail quite as well as he would have himself meanwhile he would do all he could to help cornwallis he set out from home in the morning as usual but instead of going either to bow street or to bedford square he caught a hansom and requested the driver to take him to the admiralty it took considerable argument and persuasion to obtain the naval records of hms venture without explaining why he wanted them with much use of words like tact reputation and honor but mentioning no names by midmorning he finally sat alone in a small sunlit room and read what he had asked for the record was simple lieutenant john cornwallis had been on duty when a seaman had been injured attempting to reef the mizzen royal in rising bad weather according to his own account cornwallis had gone up to help the man and had brought him down half conscious the last few yards assisted by able seaman samuel beckwith beckwith was illiterate but his verbal account taken down by someone else was largely the same certainly he had not contradicted any part of the official version the words recorded were bare just a few sentences on white paper there was no sense of the people behind it none of the roaring wind and sea the pitching deck the terror of the man trapped up the mast one minute over the wooden boards which would break his bones if he were to fall on them the next over the howling cavernous depths of water which would swallow him beyond any human power to rescue any man who fell into that would be gone forever as completely as if he had never existed never had life or laughter or hope there was no sense of what manner of men they had been brave or cowardly wise or foolish honest or lying pitt knew cornwallis at least knew him as he was now an assistant commissioner in the police force taciturn painfully honest out of his depth with politicians having no conception of their deviousness but he did not know how he had been fifteen years before as a lieutenant faced with physical danger the chance of admiration and promotion had this been an otherwise honorable mans one mistake he did not believe that such deceit would surely have left a deeper mark if cornwallis had profited from stealing another mans reward praise for someone elses act of courage would it not have stained everything else he touched would he not have spent the rest of his career looking backward over his shoulder fearing beckwiths telling of the truth would he not have built guards for himself against just this eventuality knowing there was always a chance and would that not have shown in all else that he did would he have allowed pitt to know of it or was he so arrogant he thought he could use pitt and pitt would never realize that was such a distortion of the man pitt perceived that he discarded the notion as close to impossible that left the question did the blackmailer believe it was true or did he simply know that cornwallis could not prove its untruth beckwith was dead according to cornwallis but had he relatives alive someone to whom he had told the story perhaps boasting a little elaborating on his own part until he appeared the hero and this person had taken him at his word as perhaps a son or a nephew might do or for that matter a daughter why not a woman was as capable as any man of cutting out letters from newspapers and framing a threat while he was there pitt decided he should find all he could of the rest of cornwalliss naval career and all there was available on samuel beckwith as well particularly if he had a family still alive and where they might be now more argument and more persuasion were necessary before he was given a very abbreviated summary of cornwalliss career only those things which were largely a matter of public knowledge anyway such as any other naval personnel might know from their own observation he had been promoted and changed ship within two years in and he had been in the china seas involved with distinction in the bombardment of borneo against the pirates within a year after that he had had his own command he had sailed in the caribbean and been involved in several actions of a minor nature largely skirmishes to do with slavers still operating out of west africa he had retired from the sea in with distinction and an unblemished record there was a list of ships on which he had served and the ranks he had held nothing more pitt compared it with samuel beckwiths career which had been cut short by death at sea carried overboard by a spar broken loose in a gale he had never married and left behind a sister living in bristol at the time of his death his effects and his back pay had been sent to her she was listed as a mrs sarah tregarth her address was given but beckwith had been unable to read or write the letter sent to cornwallis was quite articulate and contained several complex words had sarah beckwith learned such an art in spite of her brothers inability a discreet letter to the bristol police would confirm that now pitt looked at the names of the ships on which cornwallis had served and copied down a dozen or so names of other men who had served at the same times including the captain of the venture and the first lieutenant next he showed his list to the man who had so far assisted him and asked for the addresses of all those who were not currently at sea the man looked at pitt narrowly then read through them well he was killed in action about ten years ago he said biting his lip he moved to the next one hes retired and gone to live in portugal or somewhere hes in liverpool hes here in london he looked up what do you want all these men for superintendant information pitt replied with a tight smile i need to know the truth about an incident in order to avert a considerable wrong a crime he added in case the man should miss the urgency of it or doubt his right to involve himself oh oh yes sir itll take me a little while if youd come back in an hour or so pitt was hungry and even more he was thirsty he was delighted to accept the suggestion and go out and buy himself a ham sandwich from a stall and a cup of strong tea he stood in the sun on the street corner enjoying them watching the passersby nursemaids in starched aprons wheeled perambulators their older charges rolled hoops or pretended to ride sticks with horses heads a small boy played with a spinning top and would not come when he was told little girls in frilly pinafores mimicked their elders walking daintily with heads high he thought with a wave of tenderness of jemima and how quickly she had grown up already she was beginning to be selfconscious aware of coming womanhood it felt like only months ago she had been struggling to walk and yet it was years when he had first met balantyne she had not even been born and she had been stumbling with speech often unintelligible to anyone but charlotte when balantyne had lost his only daughter in the most fearful way possible memory of that turned the sandwich in his mouth to sawdust how could a man bear such grief and survive he wanted to rush home and make doubly triply sure jemima was all right even hold her in his arms watch her all the time make any decisions for her decide where she should go and who befriend which was ridiculous it would make her hate himrightly so how did anyone endure having children and watching them grow up make mistakes get hurt perhaps even destroyed suffer pain worse more inexplicable than death had augusta been any help to balantyne any comfort at all had their common grief brought them closer together at last or merely driven them each into greater isolation even more alone in their grief what was this new tragedy perhaps he shouldnt have left it to tellman to investigate and yet he could not abandon cornwallis he threw away the rest of his sandwich drank the last of his tea and strode back to the admiralty there was no time for standing around he began with lieutenant black who had served as first officer with cornwallis in the china seas he was home on shore leave and might be called back to sea quite soon he lived in south lambeth and pitt took a hansom over the river he was fortunate to find lieutenant black at home and willing to speak with him but unfortunate in that what black had to say was so punctiliously honorable it conveyed very little at all his professional loyalty to a brother officer was so great as to rob his comments even his memories of any individuality or meaning it conveyed much of black himself his perception of events his fierce patriotism and allegiance to the service in which he had spent all his adult life but cornwallis remained only a name a rank and a series of duties well performed he never became a man good or bad pitt thanked him and looked for the next name on his list he took another hansom and went north over the victoria bridge to chelsea watching the pleasure boats in the river full of women in pale dresses with bright hats and scarves and men with bare heads in the sun children in sailor suits eating toffee apples and striped peppermint sticks the music of a hurdygurdy drifted loudly on the air along with shouts laughter and the swish of water he found lieutenant durand a very different man lean sharp featured roughly the same age as cornwallis but still a serving officer of course i remember him he said sharply leading pitt into a very pleasant room filled with naval memorabilia probably from several generations and overlooking a garden full of summer flowers it was obviously a family home and judging from the portraits pitt had glimpsed in the hall he came from a long and distinguished line of naval officers going back long before trafalgar and the days of nelson sit down durand indicated a wellworn chair and sat in one opposite it himself what do you want to know pitt had already explained his reasons but this time he must phrase it more skillfully and learn something of the man what qualities made him a good commanding officer durand was obviously surprised whatever he had been expecting it was not this you assume i thought he was a good commander he said with raised eyebrows looking at pitt very directly and with amusement his face was burned by wind his eyebrows fair and sparse i assumed you would say so pitt replied i was wanting something a little less dry was i mistaken loyalty before honesty is that no use to you the faint thread of humor was still there he sat with his back to the window leaving pitt to face the garden and the sunlight none at all pitt sat back in the chair it was very comfortable sometimes it is all i can find a naval failing at times durand observed a flicker of bitterness in his voice and the sea has no such sentimentality she forgives nothing shell find the measure of a man faster than anything else in the end the only honor is the truth pitt watched him carefully already aware of strong undercurrents of emotion perhaps of anger or a belief of injustice or tragedy somewhere and was cornwallis a good commander lieutenant he was a good sailor durand answered he had a feeling for the sea in a way i would say he loved it insofar as he loved anything it was an odd remark said without affection his face was shadowed difficult to read did his men trust him pitt pursued have confidence in his ability ability to do what durand was not going to answer anything lightly he had decided to be frank and that meant no evasions simply to satisfy pitt was obliged to think harder more clearly what did he mean to make the right judgments in bad weather to know the tides the wind the durand smiled you are not a seaman are you it was a statement not a question and made with patience even condescension the amusement returned i think the questions you want to ask are for example was he thorough yes extremely was he competent to read a chart take a ships position and judge the weather yes to all of those did he think ahead and plan accordingly as much as any man occasionally he made mistakes when he did could he think quickly adapt get out of the danger always but sometimes more successfully than at other times he had his share of losses his voice was dry the emotion carefully controlled of ships pitt was horrified men no mr pitt if he had done that hed have been retired ashore a long time before he was he wasnt retired for loss pitt demanded too quickly not so far as i know durand said leaning back a little still staring at pitt i think he simply realized his career was going no further and he got tired of it wanted to come ashore and somebody offered him a comfortable option so he took it a tart response about the reality of cornwalliss present job was on pitts lips but he could not afford to alienate durand if he were to gain any useful information strong as his impulse was to do so and durand obviously had not liked cornwallis perhaps the fact that cornwallis had reached captaincy while durand was still serving and only a lieutenant had much to do with it what other questions would i ask if i knew something of the sea pitt said a little stiffly trying to mask his own feelings durand seemed quite unaware of it there was a concentration apparent in the angle of his head and shoulders against the light he was eager to talk was he a good leader he started did he care for his men know them individually he gave a slight shrug no he never gave that impression if he did they did not believe it did his officers like him they barely knew him he was private withdrawn he had a captains dignity but he had a cold mans isolation and there is a difference he was studying pitts face as he spoke watching his reaction did he have the art to communicate to the crew his belief in them in the mission the ship was bound on he continued no he had no humor no common touch and no visible humanity that was what lifted nelson above all the rest you know his mixture of genius and humanity sublime courage and foresight with a complete vulnerability to the ordinary aches and losses of other men his voice hardened cornwallis had none of that the men respected his naval ability but they did not love him he drew in his breath and to be a really good commander you must be loved that is what inspires a crew of men to go beyond their duty beyond even what can be expected of them to dare to sacrifice and to achieve what to a lesser crew with the same ship would be impossible it was a masterly summary and pitt was obliged to admit it to himself whether it was true or not it was not how he saw cornwallis or how he wished to honesty and fear both forced him to stay and listen he was afraid they showed in his face and he resented the thought that durand could read them there you mentioned courage pitt said clearing his throat trying to keep his voice from betraying his dislike of the man and his own loyalties was cornwallis brave durands body stiffened oh yes undoubtedly he conceded i never saw him show fear thats not quite the same thing pitt pointed out noof course it isnt in fact i suppose its almost the opposite durand agreed i imagine he must have been afraid at times only a fool would not be but he had the sort of icy selfcontrol which hides all emotion one never saw the humanity in him he repeated but no he was not a coward physically morally certainly not physically he hesitated morally i cannot say there are few great moral decisions at sea such judgments of command as he made were not in the time that i knew him i think he is too orthodox in his thinking too unimaginative to be a moral adventurer if you are asking if he ever got drunk and behaved with abandon no i dont think he ever even behaved with indiscretion there was a curious contempt in that remark rethinking your question yes perhaps he was a moral coward afraid to take life by the horns and he lost his metaphor and shrugged a gesture of inner satisfaction he had painted the picture he wanted and he knew it not a man to take risks pitt summed it up durands judgment had been cruel intended to injure but perhaps in his ignorance of the issues he had said precisely what pitt wanted to hearnot that cornwallis was too honest to take credit for another mans act of courage but that he was too much the moral coward to take the chance the fear of discovery would have crippled him durand sat comfortably with the sunlight at his back pitt stayed for another fifteen minutes then thanked him and left glad to escape the claustrophobic feeling of envy that permeated the comfortable house with its family portraits of men who had succeeded and who had expected future generations to follow in their steps and provide even more glittering pictures with their gold braid and proud faces the following day pitt found two able seamen and a naval surgeon the first was macmunn retired after a pirate raid on borneo having lost a leg he lived with his daughter in a small neat house in putney where the carpet was patched and the furniture gleamed and smelled of wax he was more than willing to talk oh yeah i member mr cornwallis well strict e were but fair always very fair he nodded several times ated a bully e did couldnt stand em punish em summink orrible werent free wi the cat but ed see a man wot bullied them wot was beneath im flogged raw e would a hard man pitt asked afraid of the answer macmunn laughed a rich happy sound nah not im you int seen nuffink mr farjeon now e were wot yerd call ard he pulled a face turning his mouth down at the corners i reckon as ed ave keelauled yer if e could hed a liked the days o floggin through the fleet what was that pitts naval history was shallow macmunn squinted at him put a man in a longboat an ave im rowed round an flogged on the deck o every ship in the fleet wot yer think it would kill him pitt protested yeah macmunn agreed mind yer a good ships surgeond see a man numbed ter the point ed not know die pretty quick so me grandpa told me e were a gunner at waterloo e were unconsciously he straightened up as he said it and pitt found himself smiling at him without knowing quite why except a heritage shared and a knowledge of courage and sacrifice so cornwallis wasnt hard or unjust pitt said quietly gawd no macmunn waved the idea away e were just quiet i never fancied bein an officer meself lonely kind o way o doing things i reckon he slurped his tea everybody got their place an wen theres dangers o yer in one rank all the same yer got companions like but wen theres only one o yer yer cant talk ter them above an they cant talk ter you an yer cant talk ter them below cant make a fool o yerself if yer an officer cos people expect yer ter be right all the time an mr cornwallis took isself very serious didnt know ow ter unbend isself if yer know wot i mean yes i think i know pitt recalled a dozen times when cornwallis had hovered on the brink of candor and at the last moment retreated selfconsciously a very private man yeah well i suppose if yer want ter be captain yer gotta be make a mistake show a weakness an the seall ave yer makes men ard but makes em loyal too an yer could always rely on mr cornwallis bit stuck kind o by the book e were but honest to a fault he shook his head i member one time wen e ad ter punish a feller wot done summink wrong dont rightly recall wot now but it werent much but regulations said e ad ter be lashed wi the cat answered back the bosun or summink yer could tell mr cornwallis dint wanna do it bosun were a right bastard but yer cant break ships discipline or yere all lost he twisted up his face thinking back to the incident but mr cornwallis e made ard work of it paced the quarterdeck all by isself fer days e did mad as ell then suffered like e were the one wot ad bin beat he took a deep breath bosun got lost overboard an mr cornwallis bust a gut tryin ter find if e were pushed he grimaced never did find out though and was he pitt asked macmunn grinned at pitt over the top of his mug yeah course e were but we all reckoned as mr cornwallis dint really wanter know that so you didnt tell him sright good man mr cornwallis wouldnt wanter make things ard fer im an if ed a knowd ed a ad the poor sod anged from the yardarm no matter ow much ed a felt fer im an like ter ave pushed the bosun over isself he shook his head got is imagination all in the wrong places feels for folk summink terrible but takes everythin too exact if you know wot i mean yes i think i do pitt answered would he ever take credit for another mans act of bravery do you think macmunn looked at him incredulously more likely ang for another mans crime e would ooever said thats both a liar and a fool oo is e i dont know but i intend to find out can you help me mr macmunn oo me if you will for example did captain cornwallis have any personal enemies people who were envious or who cherished a grudge macmunn screwed up his face his tea forgotten ard ter say if yere honest like nothin as i knows of but oo can say wot goes on in a mans mind wen es passed over in the ranks or wen e as ter be told orff fer summink honest man knows its is owndoin but he shrugged expressively but no matter how hard pitt pressed macmunn had few practical suggestions to make and pitt thanked him again and left him feeling considerably lighter in spirits as if he had met with something essentially clean which had washed away the sense of oppression which had weighed him down after speaking with durand a fear inside him had eased the early afternoon found him in rotherhithe with able seaman lockhart a taciturn man rather the worse for drink who gave him no information of value and seemed to remember cornwallis as a man to be feared but respected for his seamanship he disliked all senior officers and said so it was the only subject upon which he would offer more than singleword replies by late afternoon when the air was hot and still and a haze had settled over the city the river winding below in a glittering ribbon pitt walked up the hill from the landing stage towards the greenwich naval hospital to see the onetime ships surgeon mr rawlinson rawlinson was busy and pitt had to wait in an anteroom for over half an hour but he was reasonably comfortable and the unaccustomed sights and sounds held his interest when rawlinson came he was dressed in a white shirt with the neck open and the sleeves rolled up as if he had been hard at work and there were bloodstains on his arms and several places on his body he was a big man well muscled with a broad amiable face bow street police station he said curiously eyeing pitt up and down not one of our people in trouble surely not over the river and on your patch anyway not at all pitt turned from the window where he had been watching the water and the traffic going up to the port of london i wanted to ask you about an officer who served with you in the past john cornwallis rawlinson was incredulous cornwallis you cant mean hes come to your attention i thought he was in the police himself or was it the home office no police it seemed explanations were unavoidable he had promised discretion how could he honor that and still be of any use this is an incident in the past that has been misinterpreted pitt replied tentatively i am looking into it on captain cornwalliss behalf rawlinson pursed his lips i was a ships surgeon mr pitt i spent a great deal of my time in the orlop the what the orlop the lower deck aft where the wounded are taken and we do our operating below them on the river a clipper with canvas full set was drifting up tide towards the surrey docks its magnificent sails white in the sun there was something sad about it as if its age were already dying oh but you did know cornwallis pitt insisted dragging his mind back certainly rawlinson agreed sailed under his command but being the captain of a ship is not a very sociable position if you havent been at sea you probably havent much of an idea of the power a captain has and the necessary isolation that requires unthinkingly he wiped his hands on the sides of his trousers unaware of smearing them with traces of blood you cant be a good commander without keeping a certain distance between yourself and the men even the other officers he turned and led the way into a wide gallery through a glasspaned door and down the steps to the grass the panorama of the river beyond the sloping ground pitt followed listening the whole structure of the crew is built on a very tight hierarchy rawlinson waved his hands as he spoke too much familiarity and men lose that edge of respect for the captain he has to be more than human to them close to infallible if they see his vulnerability his doubt ordinary weaknesses or fears something of the power is lost he glanced at pitt every good captain knows that and cornwallis did i think much of it came naturally to him he was a quiet man solitary by choice he took his position very seriously was he good rawlinson smiled leading the way across the grass in the sun the breeze from the river smelled of salt the tide was running sharply overhead gulls circled crying loudly yes he answered actually he was very good why did he come ashore pitt asked hes comparatively young rawlinson stopped his expression guarded defensive for the first time forgive me mr pitt but why does that concern you pitt struggled for the right reply surely only some element of the truth would serve cornwallis now someone is endeavoring to hurt him he replied watching rawlinsons face damage his reputation i need to know the truth in order to defend him you want to know the worst they could say with any honesty yes rawlinson grunted and why should i not suspect that the enemy you speak of is you yourself ask cornwallis pitt responded in that case why dont you ask him what the worst or the best is of his career it was said with wry amusement no ill will at all he stood in the sun with his bloodstained arms folded a smile on his face because we dont always see ourselves as others do mr rawlinson pitt replied does that need explaining rawlinson relaxed no it doesnt he began to walk again waving his hand in invitation to pitt to accompany him cornwallis was a brave man he answered both physically and morally perhaps a trifle short in imagination he had a sense of humor but it didnt show very often he took his pleasures quietly he liked to read all manner of things he was a surprisingly good artist with watercolors painted light on water with a sensitivity that astounded me showed a completely different side of the man made one understand that sometimes genius is not in what you put in but what you leave out he managed to conveyhe circled his hands in a sweeping motionair light he laughed would never have thought he had such daring in him was he ambitious pitt tried to phrase it to earn an honest answer not one motivated primarily by loyalty rawlinson considered for a moment before he replied in his own way yes i think so but it wasnt readily observable not as it was in many men he did not want to seem excellent so much as actually to be so the pride in him the hunger was not for appearances but for reality he looked at pitt quickly to see if he understood it made him he searched for a way to express what he was looking for it made him seem remote at times some people even thought him evasive where i think he was only complex and different from them he was his own hardest taskmaster he was driven but not in order to please or impress anyone else pitt walked beside him in silence thinking that if he did not speak then the other man would continue he was right you see rawlinson went on he lost his father when he was quite young eleven or twelve i think old enough to know him from a boys eye not old enough to be disillusioned or challenge him in any way was his father in the navy oh no rawlinson said swiftly he was a nonconformist minister a man of profound and simple belief and the courage both to practice and to preach it you knew him better than you intimated rawlinson shrugged perhaps it was only one night really wed had a bad skirmish with a slaver boarded them and took the ship all right but it was teak and burned he glanced at pitt i see that means nothing to you how could it teak splinters are poison not like oak he explained we had a few men hurt but our first officer a good manmr cornwallis had a great affection for himwas in a bad way he helped me remove the splinters and do all we could for him but he went into a fever and we sat up all night spelled each other the next day and the next night he reached the gravel path and turned to walk back up the slope pitt keeping pace with him not a captains job youll say and neither was it but we were well away from the coast by then and the slaver was dealt with he took one watch on deck the other with me his mouth pulled tight god knows when he slept but we saved lansfield lost a finger thats all i suppose we talked a bit then men do in the watches of the night when theyre desperate and theres nothing they can do to help didnt see much of him after that except as duty required i suppose i always think of him as he was then the lamplight yellow in his face gaunt with worry angry and helpless and so tired he could hardly keep his head up pitt did not bother to ask if he would have taken credit for another mans act of courage there was no need he thanked rawlinson and left him to go back to his patients he walked in the bright lateafternoon light down towards the river and the landing stage where he could catch a ferry back up past deptford limehouse wapping the tower of london under london bridge southward bridge and probably get off at last at blackfriars he knew far more of cornwallis and if anything he was even more determined to defend him from the blackmailer but he had little more idea of who that might be except that it was even harder to think it was anyone who had served with him and genuinely believed the charge to be true he remembered the way the letter was written the grammatical correctness not to mention the spelling and the choice of words it was not an ordinary seaman nor was it likely to be one of their dependents such as a wife or sister if it was the son of a seaman then he had definitely improved his position in the world since childhood as he reached the rivers edge the smells of salt and weed sharp in his nostrils the slap of water the damp air the cry of gulls light on their wings he knew he still had a very long way to go that morning charlotte opened the first delivery of mail and found a letter addressed to her in handwriting which swept away the years like leaves on the wind even before she opened it she was certain it was from general balantyne what was written inside was very brief my dear mrs pitt it was most generous of you to be concerned for my welfare and to offer your renewed friendship in this present unpleasantness i thought of taking a brief walk around the british museum this morning i shall be in the egyptian exhibit at about half past eleven if you should find yourself free and passing that way i should be delighted to see you i remain your obedient servant brandon balantyne it was a stiff and very formal way of saying that he very much needed the friendship she had offered but the fact that he had written at all made his feelings most plain she folded the paper with a quick movement and rose from the kitchen table to lift the lid from the stove and put it in the flames consumed it with an instant flare and it was gone i shall be going out this morning she told gracie i have a desire to look at the egyptian exhibit in the british museum i cannot say when i shall be back gracie shot her a look of fierce curiosity but she forbore from asking any questions yes maam she said with wide eyes ill see ter everythink charlotte went upstairs and took out her secondbest summer morning dress not the pale yellow which was her bestshe had worn that the first timebut a pinkandwhite muslin she had been given by emily whom it had not become as she had hoped the british museum was in comfortable walking distance which was presumably why he had selected it and she set out at ten past eleven in order to be at the exhibit by half past this was a meeting of friendship not a romantic or society appointment where lateness could be considered fashionable or a suitably modest reluctance she was there by twentyfive minutes past and saw him immediately standing upright shoulders straight hands behind his back the light on his head catching the fair hair turning to gray he looked extraordinarily lonely as if the other people passing by were all part of some great unity which excluded him perhaps it was his stillness that marked him apart he was very obviously waiting for someone because his gaze did not appear to move as it would were he actually looking at the mummified figures in front of him or at the intricate carving and gold of the sarcophagus she walked over to him but for a moment he was unaware of her general balantyne he turned quickly and his face filled with delight and then embarrassment at his betrayal of emotion mrs pitt how kind of you to have come i hope i do not presume i she smiled of course not she assured him the egyptian exhibit is something i have always wished to see but no one else i know has the least interest in it and if i came down and stood around looking at it alone i might be taken for a most undesirable kind of woman and attract attention i do not wish oh he obviously had not thought of that being a man gave him a freedom he had taken for granted yes indeed well let us look at it he had misunderstood she could have seen it any timewith emily or greataunt vespasia or gracie for that matter she was trying to make him feel a little less ill at ease by making a joke of it have you ever been to egypt she asked staring at the sarcophagus no well only to pass through he hesitated then as if making a great decision he continued i have been to abyssinia she glanced at him have you why i mean was it to do with interest in the country or were you sent there i didnt know we had ever fought abyssinia he smiled my dear we have fought just about everywhere you would be hard put to name a place on the face of the earth where we have not meddled at some time or other why did we meddle in abyssinia she asked with genuine interest as well as a desire to make him speak of something in which he was comfortable it is a preposterous story he was still smiling good she encouraged i love preposterous stories the more so the better tell me he offered her his arm and she took it as they walked slowly around the exhibits one after another without seeing any of them it was in january of he began that it really came to a head but it started long before the emperor of abyssinia whose name was theodore theodore she said with disbelief that doesnt sound like an abyssinian name it should be i dont know african at least foreign im sorryplease go on he was born of very humble family he resumed his first calling was as a scribe but he earned very little at it so he took to banditry instead at which he did so well that by the time he was thirtyseven he was crowned emperor of abyssinia king of kings and chosen of god i have obviously underrated banditry she giggled not only its social acceptability but its religious significance he was smiling broadly now unfortunately he was quite mad he wrote a letter to the queen our queen or his own queen she interrupted our queen victoria he wished to send a delegation to england to see her in order to let her know that his muslim neighbors were oppressing him and other good christians in abyssinia he asked her to form an alliance with him to deal with them and she wouldnt she asked they were now in front of a magnificent stone carved with hieroglyphics we will never know he answered because the letter reached london in but someone in the foreign office mislaid it or else they could not think what to say in reply so theodore became very angry indeed and imprisoned the british consul in abyssinia one captain charles cameron they stretched him on a rack and flogged him with a hippopotamus hide whip she stared at him uncertain if he was absolutely serious she saw from his eyes that he was so what happened then did they send the army to rescue him no the foreign office looked very hastily for the letter and found it he answered they wrote a reply requesting camerons release and gave it to a turkish assyriologist named rassam and asked him to deliver it the letter was written in may of but it did not reach the emperor in abyssinia until january nearly two years later when theodore welcomed rassam warmly and then threw the poor man into prison with cameron then we sent in the army she said no theodore wrote to the queen again this time asking for workmen machinery and a munitions manufacturer the corners of his lips twitched with wry humor and we sent the army she concluded he glanced sideways at her no we sent a civil engineer and six workmen in spite of herself her voice rose i dont believe it he nodded they got as far as massawa waited there for half a year and were finally sent home again then his expression became serious again but in july of that year the secretary of state for india telegraphed the governor of bombay asking how long it would take to mount an expedition and in august the cabinet decided on war in september they sent theodore an ultimatum and we set sail i came from india and joined general napiers forces bengal cavalry madras sappers and miners bombay native infantry and a regiment of sind horse we were joined by a british regiment the rd foot although actually half of them were irish and there were almost a hundred germans and when we landed near zula there were turks and arabs and all kinds of africans i remember a young war correspondent named henry stanley writing about it he loved africa fascinated by it he stopped he was looking at the exhibit in front of them now an alabaster carving of a cat it was exquisite but there was no pleasure in balantynes face only embarrassment and pain you fought in abyssinia she asked quietly yes was it very bad he moved slightly with just a flinch of the body a gesture of denial no worse than any fighting there is always fear mutilation death you care about people and see them reduced to the leastand rise to the mosta man can be terror and courage selfishness in some nobility in others hunger thirst pain fearful pain he kept his face away from her as if to meet her eyes would make him incapable of saying what he felt it strips away all pretense from others and from yourself she was not sure whether to interrupt or not she tightened her fingers on his arm a little he stood silently she waited people moved past them some of them turning to stare for a moment she wondered fleetingly what they thought and did not care he took a deep breath and let it out silently i did not wish to talk about battle im sorry what did you wish to say she asked gently i perhaps he faltered again i can forget it afterwards if you would rather i did she promised he smiled a harsh curling of the lips he remained facing forward not looking at her there was one action in that campaign where we were ambushed thirty men were injured my commanding officer among them it was something of a fiasco i was shot in the arm but not badly she waited for him to continue without prompting him i have received a letter he said it with great difficulty his words coming as if forced out of him his face stiff it accuses me of being the cause of that rout ofof cowardice in the face of the enemy of being responsible for the injuries of those men it says that i panicked and was rescued by a private soldier but that that fact was covered up to save the honor of the regiment and for morale it is not true but i cannot prove that he did not tell her that such a charge if known would ruin him he expected her to know and she did anyone would especially just at the moment with the tranby croft affair all over the newspapers and on everyones tongue even those who would not normally take the slightest interest in such people were now talking about them and awaiting the next development eager for disaster she must answer with intelligence sympathy was fine but it was of no practical use and he needed help what did they ask for she said quietly a snuffbox he answered just as a token of good faith she was surprised a snuffbox is it valuable he gave a sharp bark of laughter raw selfmocking no a few guineas its pinchbeck but it is beautiful highly individual anyone would know it was mine it is a token of my willingness to pay some would say it is a sign of guilt his hands clenched and she could feel the muscles of his arm hard under her fingers but its only a mark of my panic exactly what he accused me of the bitterness in his voice was close to despair but i never turned my back on the enemy of the body only of the mind odd i had not imagined i lacked moral courage you dont she said without a moments hesitation it is a delaying tactic until we know the strength of the enemy and a little more of his nature blackmail is a cowardly thing perhaps the most cowardly her anger was so burning hot she had not even been aware of using a plural that included herself he moved his other hand and very gently just for a moment touched her fingers where they lay on his arm then turned away and began to walk towards the next exhibit several pieces of ancient glass in a case she followed after him swiftly you cannot become involved in this he said i told you simply because because i needed to share it with someone and i knew i could trust you you can trust me she said urgently but not to stand by and watch you tortured for something you did not do not that i would stand by even if you had we all make mistakes are weak or frightened or stupid sometimes and that in itself is usually punishment enough she stood next to him but did not link her arm in his this time he was not looking at her we are going to fight now he did face her how i have no idea who he is then we must find out she retorted or else we must contact someone who was there and can disprove what this person is saying make a list of everyone who even knows about it the army he said with the ghost of a smile she was determined come now it was a skirmish in abyssinia it was hardly waterloo and it was twentythree years ago they will not all even be alive twentyfive he corrected with a sudden softness in his eyes shall we begin over luncheon this is not the most convenient place for writing anything certainly she agreed thank you she took his arm again that would be an excellent beginning they ate together at a most agreeable small restaurant and were she less preoccupied with the problem she would have luxuriated in delicious food in whose preparation she had taken no part but the matter in hand was far too serious and it had her entire attention balantyne struggled to remember the names of all the men he knew who had been involved in the action in abyssinia with a little effort he managed all the officers but when it came to the private soldiers he could bring to mind only about half there will be military records he said somewhat glumly although i doubt they will be able to help it was so long ago somebody remembers she pointed out whoever sent that letter is connected one way or another well find these people she looked down the page from the small notebook he had purchased before coming to dine there were fifteen names the army will know where they live wont it he looked deeply unhappy after this length of time they may well have settled anywhere in the countryor the world for that matter or as you pointed out they may no longer be alive she felt his misery and understood his fear she had certainly felt it herself several times not the sharp sick terror of physical pain or destruction but the cold creeping fear of loss hurt to the mind and the heart loneliness shame guilt the desert of being unloved she was not threatened by this she must be strong for both of them well the person we are looking for is definitely alive and i imagine living here in london she said firmly where did you send the snuffbox to his eyes widened a messenger called for it a boy on a bicycle i spoke to him but he had no idea where it was going except that a gentleman had paid him and would meet him in the park at dusk he couldnt describe this gentleman at all except that he was wearing a checked coat and a cloth cap also with checks it is presumably a disguise no one would dress like that for any other reason whether he was the blackmailer or not i dont know he might have been passing it on again he took a deep breath but you are quite right he is here in london there is something i did not tell you the man who was found dead on my doorstep had my snuffbox in his pocket oh she realized with a drenching coldness how that could be read by any investigating police even pitt oh i see now balantynes fear was better explained he was watching her waiting for the anger the blame the changed perception do you know who he is she asked meeting his eyes no i expected to when i went to the mortuary to look at him for pitt but so far as i know i have never seen him before could he have been a soldier certainly could he have been the blackmailer i dont know i half wish he were and then he would be dead his fingers on the tablecloth were stiff it took him a deliberate effort of will not to clench them she could see it in the knotting and then relaxing of his hand but i did not kill him and who else would on my doorstep except the real blackmailerto draw police attention to me he was shaking now very slightly i watch every delivery of the post for another letter telling me what he wants i shall not give it to him and then he will spread the storyperhaps to the police as well then we must find someone who was there and can disprove the story she said with more anger and hope than conviction you must have friends connections who can tell you where to find these people she indicated the list let us begin now he did not argue but the misery in his face and the weariness in the angles of his body betrayed the fact that he did not hope to succeed he was doing it simply because it was not in his nature to surrender even when he knew he was beaten tellman was convinced that in some way albert cole was connected with general balantyne and he was determined that he would discover what it was having exhausted the immediate avenues of knowledge regarding balantyne he returned to coles military career that was the most obvious possibility it was in reviewing the history of coles regiment the rd foot that he saw that it had served in the abyssinian campaign of that was where it crossed balantynes indian service when he too had been briefly sent to africa that was it suddenly it made sense they had served together it was something in that campaign which had brought cole to bedford square and led to his murder he could feel his pulse quicken and a thin thread of excitement stir inside him he must go to keppel street to report this vital piece of news to pitt he took the omnibus and got off at tottenham court road and walked across the few hundred yards to pitts house he rang the bell and stepped back of course it would be gracie who would answer unconsciously he ran his fingers around inside his collar as if it were too tight then ran his hands over his hair pushing it back quite unnecessarily his mouth was a little dry the door opened gracie looked surprised she smoothed her apron over her hips while looking at him very directly ive come to report to mr pitt he said rather too abruptly i spose yerd better come in she said before he had a chance to explain himself more graciously she moved to allow him past her he accepted hearing his boots clattering over the linoleum all along the corridor to the kitchen gracies feet behind him sounded light tapping feminine but she was as small as a child he went into the kitchen expecting to see pitt sitting at the table then realized his mistake he would be in the parlor naturally gracie would fetch him in here to see tellman not at the front of the house it was not a social call he stood stiffly in the middle of the room smelling the warmth the flour from baking the clean linen the steam from the kettle on the stove the faint grit of coal the earlyevening sun shone through the window onto the blueandwhiteringed china on the dresser two cats lay by the fire one ginger and white one black as the coal in the scuttle dont just stand there like a lamppost gracie said sharply sit down she pointed to one of the wooden chairs dyer want a cup otea ive come to report some very important information to mr pitt he said stiffly not to sit in your kitchen drinking cups of tea youd better go and tell him im here he did not sit e int ere she told him moving the kettle onto the center of the hob if its that important then yerd best leave a message wif me ill see as e gets it as soon as e comes in he hesitated it was important the kettle was steaming nicely it was a long time since he had sat down let alone had anything to eat or drink his feet were hot and aching the black cat stretched yawned and went back to sleep i made some cake if yer like gracie offered moving quickly around the kitchen fetching the teapot down and then trying hard to reach the tea caddy which had been pushed to the back of the shelf she stretched then tried jumping she really was very small he went over reaching it effortlessly he handed it to her i can get it meself she said tartly taking it from him wot dyer fink i do wen yer int ere drink water he replied she shot him a razorsharp look but took the caddy in her hand and went over to the stove yerd best get some plates down too then she instructed t want some cake whether you do or not he obeyed he might as well leave the message with her it would get to pitt the fastest way they sat on opposite sides of the kitchen table stiff and very formal sipping tea that was too hot and eating the cake which was excellent he told her about albert cole and the rd foot regiment and the abyssinian expedition and that balantyne had been there too seconded from india she looked very serious indeed as if the news upset her ill tell im she promised dyer think as general balantyne did this feller in then could have he would not commit himself too far if he said yes and was then proved mistaken she would lose respect for him wotll yer do next she asked gravely her eyes steady on his face learn everything else i can about cole he told her he must have had a reason for finding balantyne again after all this time its nearly a quarter of a century since then she leaned forward it must be summink terrible important if yer find it yerll ave ter tell mr pitt werever e is or whatever es doin yerd best come ere an leave a message wif mrs pitt or me it can get real serious wen its quality like generals dont you go doin nothin by yerself she looked at him with deep anxiety in fact yerd better let mrs pitt know afore yer tell anyone else cos shes quality erself so she can elp shed stop you an the master from goin about it wrong jus cos yer int the same kind o persons she looked at him with deep concern that he should understand she was just a maid she had only very recently learned to read and write and she came from the back street of he did not know where probably the same sort of place as he had himself somewhere like wandsworth or billingsgate or any of a hundred other downtrodden overcrowded warrens of the poor but she was a girl and therefore not given even the rudiments of an education tellman on the other hand had definitely bettered himself but her suggestion did make a certain amount of sense she refilled his cup and cut him another slice of cake he accepted both with pleasure she was a good cook which surprised him she looked too small and thin to know anything about food you come an tell me she repeated an ill make sure the mistress keeps the master from gettin inter trouble cos o folks wot ave influence an could urt im if it int done right he was getting more and more comfortable in the kitchen he disagreed with gracie about all sorts of things she had a great deal to learn especially about social issues and fairness and justice for people but she was wellmeaning and no one could say she wasnt brave and prepared to fight for her beliefs i suppose that would be quite a good idea he conceded he did not want pitt to get into political trouble if it could be avoided not necessarily entirely from loyalty to pitt about whom he told himself he was still ambivalent but there was the matter of justice if general balantyne thought himself above the law it would take skill as well as good detective work to catch him and prove it good gracie said with satisfaction taking a large piece of cake so yerll come ere an tell me or the mistress wot yer know an shell tell the master an at the same time elp im ter not go chargin in an mebbe the real truthll never get told back stairs and front stairs is different yer know she watched him carefully to make sure he understood of course i know he said but they shouldnt be rich men dont make any better soldiers than poor men in fact worse she squinted at him wot yer talkin about general balantyne is only a general because his father bought his commission for him he explained patiently perhaps he was expecting her to grasp too much he probably never did any real fighting only ordering others around gracie jiggled in her seat as if she were making such a mighty effort at selfcontrol that she could not keep still if es got enough money ter do that then we gotta be very careful she said crossly and without looking at him then she raised her head her eyes blazing are yer sure yer can buy bein a general an if anybody were that rich whyd e buy bein a soldier thats daft you wouldnt understand he said loftily people like that are different from us theyre not any different if they get shot she said instantly bloods blood ooevers it is i know that and you know that he agreed but they think theirs is different and better she sighed very patiently as she did with daniel when he was obstructive and deliberately disobedient just to see how far he could push her i daresay yer know more about it than i do mr tellman i spec mr pitts very lucky ter ave someone like you ter elp keep im straight an out o mistakes i do my best he agreed accepting a third piece of cake and allowing her to refill his cup yet again thank you gracie she grunted but when he left half an hour later without having seen either pitt or charlotte he was overtaken by acute anxiety as to exactly what he had promised it had been a long and very busy day it was hot his feet ached he had walked miles and not had more to eat than a cheeseandpickle sandwich and gracies cake she had made him welcome and without realizing it he had given his word that he would tell her what he uncovered in the albert cole case before he told pitt he must be losing his wits he had never done anything so totally foolish in his life before it was contrary to everything he had been taught not that that was normally a reason he was not a man to follow anyones commands against his own judgment he was too tired to think clearly he just had a terrible feeling of being out of his depth of following impulse more than his own nature and habit all the path he was used to but he had given his word and to gracie phipps of all people pitt had heard tellmans news from gracie when he finally came home and he was deeply saddened that the evidence seemed to be connecting albert cole more closely with balantyne he must instruct tellman to learn all he could about cole most particularly if he had any pattern of burglary or attempts at extortion not that he could imagine anything in balantynes life that would offer an opportunity for such a thing the poor mans tragedies had been forced into public knowledge years ago every shred of misery ripped open he was reminded of the circumstances again as he passed a newspaper boy and heard him calling the headlines dead body on generals doorstep police baffled by murder of old soldier in bedford square read all about it an see if you can do any better so wanna paper sir ta there yare pitt took it from him and opened it up he read it with mounting anger and dismay nothing was said directly enough to be actionable but all the implications were plain balantyne was a general and the dead man must have served with him at some time there was some bond between them of love or hate knowledge revenge or conspiracy even treason was hinted atso subtly that some might have missed it but not all any of it could conceivably have been true and any of it would ruin balantyne he closed the newspaper and ramming it under his arm he strode along the pavement to the steps of the bow street station as soon as he was inside a constable came in to tell him that there was a message to say assistant commissioner cornwallis wished to see him immediately there was no reason given pitt stood up again without even glancing at anything on his desk the first fear that took him was that cornwallis had received another letter this time stating the terms for which the blackmailer would keep silent all sorts of things entered his mind from simple money through information on criminal cases even to actual corruption of evidence he did not bother to leave any message for tellman the sergeant could proceed perfectly well alone he did not need pitt or anyone else to instruct him in the pursuit of the recent life and habits of albert cole back in the street pitt walked around to drury lane and almost immediately found a hansom he was aware of nothing as the cab turned and went south not the other traffic the fine blustery morning two brewers draymen shouting at each other or the traffic stopping for a magnificent hearse with four perfectly matched black horses their black plumes waving nor did he notice three blocks farther on an open brougham with six pretty girls giggling and showing off waving parasols to the imminent peril of all other horsedrawn vehicles within striking distance of them he was admitted to cornwalliss office immediately and found him standing as so often by the window overlooking the street cornwallis turned as pitt came in he looked pale and there were dark shadows around his eyes and a thin tenseness in his lips good morning he said quickly as pitt closed the door come in he waved in a very general way towards the chairs in front of the desk but remained standing balanced as if he would begin to pace back and forth the moment he had pitts total attention do you know of sigmund tannifer no cornwallis was staring at him his body was rigid his hands behind his back hes a banker very prominent in the city very powerful man in financial circles pitt waited as if driven by compulsion cornwallis began to pace five strides one way turn smartly five strides the other the office could have been the quarterdeck sailing before the wind into battle he called me last night he began speaking jerkily he sounded distressed he reached the end and turned again glancing at pitt wouldnt say what it was but asked me about the bedford square business asked me who was in charge of the case he swiveled around and came back when i told him you were he asked if he could see you privately as soon as possiblein fact this morning he started back again hands still locked behind him i asked him if he had any information regarding it thought he might have been burgled or know someone who had someone in bedford square he stopped his eyes puzzled his face almost bruised looking he said he didnt know anything about it it was another matter private and very grave he reached over to the desk and passed pitt a slip of paper this is his address he is at home waiting for you pitt took the paper and glanced at it tannifer lived in chelsea yes sir ill go now good thank you cornwallis stood still at last let me know what it is ill be back by the time you are i daresay back pitt asked ah yes cornwallis let out his breath slowly have to go to my club the jessop club dont really want to cant spare the time he smiled fleetingly an effort to hide his reluctance he was dreading it as if already his friends and colleagues would somehow know what was in the letter and believe it or at best wonder have to he went on explaining on a committee for charity too important not to go for children he looked vaguely embarrassed as he said it and turned quickly to pick up his hat and follow pitt out of the door pitt took a hansom and rode again deep in thought to queen street just off the chelsea embankment it was a beautiful neighborhood near the botanical gardens just past the facade of the chelsea hospital and the wide space of burtons court the end of the street opened directly onto the river which was blue and gray sparkling in the sun he knocked on the door of the number he had been given and when the footman answered he presented his card he was shown across the stoneflagged hall with scattered persian rugs the walls were hung with an array of historical weapons from a crusaders twohanded sword through a napoleonic saber to two pairs of dueling pistols and two rapiers within moments he was taken into an oakpaneled study where he was left for no more than five minutes before the door opened and a tall man with receding dark hair came in he was of striking appearance although there was too much power in his features for handsomeness too much flesh pitt guessed him to be in his middle fifties and extremely prosperous his clothes were perfectly cut and of fabric which draped as if there could be silk in it there was a sheen to his cravat as if it too were silk thank you for coming superintendent i am much obliged please be comfortable he indicated the wellworn dark chairs and as soon as pitt was seated he sank into the opposite one but did not relax he remained upright his hands joined together he was not openly nervous but he was apparently deeply worried over something several questions came to pitts mind but he did not speak them aloud he would leave tannifer to say what he wished without prompting i understand that you are investigating this miserable business in bedford square tannifer began tentatively yes pitt agreed my sergeant is presently looking into the life of the dead man to see if we can learn what he was doing there his usual area was holborn he sold bootlaces on the corner of lincolns inn fields yes tannifer nodded i read in the newspapers that he was an old soldier is that true it is do you know something about him mr tannifer tannifer smiled no im afraid i know nothing at all the smile vanished it was only the suggestion in the press regarding poor balantynes possible involvement which made me wish to see you you are obviously a man of sensitivity and discretion in whom cornwallis has the greatest trust or he would not have assigned you to such a matter he was regarding pitt narrowly weighing him in his own judgment pitt did not feel any response was required a denial dictated by modesty would be inappropriate now obviously tannifer had looked into the subject tannifer pursed his lips mr pitt i have received a most disturbing letter one might call it blackmail except that nothing is asked for as yet pitt felt almost winded with shock it was the last thing he had expected this affluent banker in front of him had none of the haunted look that cornwallis had but perhaps that was because he had not yet realized the full import of what the letter meant the strain the fear the sleepless nights would come when did you receive it mr tannifer he asked last post yesterday evening tannifer replied quietly i informed cornwallis straightaway i know him slightly and i felt i could take the liberty of going to him directly even to troubling him at his home he took a very deep breath and let it out consciously easing his shoulders you see mr pitt i am in a very delicate position my entire ability to follow my career to be of service to anyone depends upon trust he watched pitts face to see if he understood a look of doubt flashed across his eyes perhaps he was expecting too much may i see the letter pitt asked tannifer bit his lip moving uncomfortably in his chair but he did not argue of course it is there on the corner of the desk he indicated it with his hand as if he were reluctant even to touch the thing again himself pitt rose and picked the envelope off the polished surface where it was lying the name and address were cut out of letters from newspapers but with such painstaking precision and glued so carefully that at a glance it seemed to be printed as if by amachine the postmark was central london the previous evening he opened it up and read the single sheet he found inside mr tannifer you have grown rich and respected by exercising your financial skills all with the money of others it is based upon their trust in you in your unquestioned honesty would they feel the same if they were to know that once you were far less scrupulous and prospered your own fortune using funds embezzled from your clients warburton and pryce i believe i do not know the sum perhaps you no longer even know it yourself perhaps you never did why count what you will never repay have you a sense of the absurd you must have or you would not allow other men to trust you with their money i would not perhaps one day no one will and that was all the meaning was perfectly plain as it had been in cornwalliss letter and like his nothing was asked for no precise explicit threat was made but the ugliness the malice and the danger were extremely clear pitt looked across at tannifer who was watching him almost unblinkingly you see tannifers voice was harsh rising a little as if the veneer were thin he doesnt ask for anything but the threat is there he leaned forward across the desk pulling his jacket out of shape it is completely untrue i have never stolen a halfpenny in my life i daresay with sufficient time and a careful enough audit of the banks books i could prove it he stared at pitt searching his eyes his face as if desperate to see some hope or understanding but the very fact that i would or thought i had to would make people wonder why he went on the suggestion is enough to ruin me and the bank too if they did not dismiss me the only course possible would be to resign he waved his hands wide jerkily and then there would be those who would take that as an admission of some kind of guilt for gods sake what can i do pitt longed to be able to give him some answer that would offer the hope he longed for but there was no such thing that would be remotely honest should he tell him there had been others is anyone else aware of this he asked indicating the letter only my wife tannifer replied she saw my distress and i had either to tell her the truth or invent some lie i have always trusted her absolutely i showed it to her pitt thought that a mistake he feared her reaction might be to become so afraid that she would unintentionally betray her distress or even feel the need to confide in someone further perhaps her mother or a sister tannifer must have read his feelings in his expression he smiled you have no need to fear mr pitt my wife is a woman of remarkable loyalty and courage i would rather trust her than anyone else i know it was an unusual statement to make and yet when he thought about it pitt would have said the same thing of charlotte and he blushed now with some guilt that he should have assumed less of mrs tannifer without the slightest evidence i apologize he said contritely i was only of course tannifer dismissed it speaking across him and for the first time allowing himself to smile in most circumstances you would be quite right there is no need to feel the least discomfort he reached for the embroidered bell cord and pulled it within moments a footman appeared ask mrs tannifer to join us will you tannifer instructed then as the man went out he regarded pitt seriously again what can you do to help us superintendant how should i behave regarding this threat to begin with tell no one else pitt replied watching him gravely do not even allow them to suspect if anyone observes your anxiety or distress think in advance of some other believable cause and attribute it to that better not to say there is nothing wrong when they may find that difficult to believe give no cause for speculation of course of course tannifer nodded there was a light rap on the door and a moment later it opened and a woman came in who at first glance appeared quite ordinary she was of average height a trifle thin her shoulders angular her hips in her very lightly bustled gown too lean to be fashionable or even very feminine her fair hair was naturally wavy and of a soft honey shade her features were not beautiful her nose lacked elegance her eyes were wide blue and very direct her mouth was sensitive and curiously vulnerable it was her bearing which made her remarkable there was an extraordinary grace within her which would have marked her out from any crowd and the longer one looked at her the more attractive did she seem both men rose to their feet parthenope this is superintendent pitt from bow street tannifer introduced them he has come about this wretched letter im so glad she said quickly her voice was warm and a little husky she looked at pitt earnestly it is pure evil whoever wrote it does not even imagine it is true he is simply using the threat of lies to hurt and toto extort i dont know what he doesnt even say what he wants how can we fight him she moved to stand closer beside her husband and almost unconsciously she slid her arm into his it was a casual gesture and yet intensely protective first behave as naturally as possible pitt repeated this time to parthenope tannifer but if anyone realizes you are anxious give them some other cause to explain it dont fob them off with a denial they will not believe my wifes brother is in india manipur to be exact the news from there is sufficient to worry anyone he saw pitt nod and continued as you know there was a palace coup in september last year our people decided that it constituted a rebellion and in march of this year our man in assam took four hundred gurkhas and marched to imphal the capital of manipur to talk they were promptly seized and killed he furrowed his brow as if he could still hardly believe what he said next apparently there was no commanding officer of sufficient rank left so the young widow of the political agent led the surviving british officers and the gurkhas out of the city through the jungle and up the mountains towards assam they were rescued by a troop of gurkhas coming the other way he gave an abrupt little laugh i can always say i am worried about him i should be believed he glanced at parthenope who indicated her agreement her eyes alight with imagination and pride pitt dragged his attention back from the extraordinary story of manipur to the present grim situation in london a deep chill settled inside him that two prominent men were being threatened with a very particular form of public ruin but no price was asked it also forced itself into his mind to wonder if general balantyne might be a third victim of the same plan but had been too afraid or too ashamed to speak of it and of course the threat to him was far greater there was a dead body on his doorstep which made the whole issue public and brought the police to investigate was albert cole the blackmailer it seemed highly unlikely the more pitt considered it the less did it seem credible he picked up tannifers letter and read it again it was complex and literate not the work of a private soldier turned peddler of bootlaces and yet he had had in his pocket balantynes snuffbox which as it transpired was not valuable but still extremely beautiful and possibly unique both tannifer and parthenope were staring at him is there something of importance that you are not telling me superintendent tannifer said with concern your expression causes me considerable anxiety parthenopes face was tight her mouth pulled crooked with fear pitt made an instant decision you are not the only person to suffer from this mans threats mr tannifer he stopped as he saw tannifers amazement and something which could have been relief this is monstrous parthenope burst out stiffening her body and removing her arm from tannifers she clasped her hands tightly in front of her who else is oh im sorry what a stupid question of course you cannot tell us at least i know you would not because if you did it might mean you would tell others of our predicament no mrs tannifer pitt agreed i would certainly not mention it without his specific permission like your husband he is a man of dignity and honor whose reputation has never been questioned before he is accused of the offense which would be most repugnant to him and yet which although he is totally innocent he cannot prove himself innocent of at least at the present he cannot prove it with diligent work it may become possible but his act also lies in the past and many of those who could have disproved what is charged are no longer alive poor soul parthenope said with profound feeling her face was flushed her eyes direct what can we do mr pitt he was desperate to offer some answer which would comfort her and make her feel she was participating in the battle but he turned to tannifer himself as he spoke there are certain things which will define this person he said thoughtfully he must know of the earlier matter you mentioned how public was it not at all tannifers face brightened i see what you mean it must be limited by those who either knew for them selves or had heard of it from those who did that does circumscribe it considerably but you said two things what is the other he must want something from you which will profit him if you think what you can doother than merely pay him money of coursethen you may learn something about who it is tannifer frowned do you not think it will be money when he has felt the exactness of his power well enough it may be pitt replied are you a wealthy man with funds available tannifer hesitated ii could not pay a large amount in any haste even if i were to sell property such a thing takes time influence parthenope put in quickly her expression eager of course that would make the most excellent sense she looked from tannifer to pitt has this other man influence superintendent more than money yes mrs tannifer he has great influence in certain areas a bitter smile touched tannifers mouth i assume you are not referring to brandon balantyne but to someone else balantyne has no influence now he shook his head minutely an oddly hopeless little gesture this is a filthy business superintendent i pray most profoundly that you can help us parthenope looked at him earnestly also but she did not add anything to her husbands words if you would make such a list mr tannifer pitt prompted of course i shall send it around to you at bow street the moment it is accomplished tannifer promised he held out his hand thank you for coming mr pitt i rest my trust in you we both do please convey my thanks to cornwallis for sparing you so instantly pitt left oppressed with foreboding and a sense that behind the threatening letters to both cornwallis and tannifer was a far greater power than he had at first imagined there was nothing clumsy or hasty in it not a greedy man simply taking a chance at extorting money from a mistake he had observed and seen an opportunity on which to capitalize it was a more carefully laid plan possibly over a period of time to obtain power by the deliberate corruption of men of influence and in spite of what tannifer had said about balantynes having now retired pitt could not help wondering if he too was the victim of blackmail he was certain balantyne had been deeply afraid of something and it was connected with the pinchbeck snuffbox found in albert coles pocket how had cole come by it in the answer to that would lie a great deal of the answer to his death pitt returned to bedford square determined to speak to balantyne again and see if he could learn from him anything further possibly even ask him outright if he had received a letter but when he enquired the footman told him the general had gone out quite early and had not said at what hour he would return he did not expect it to be before dinner that night pitt thanked him and went to see what he could learn about sigmund tannifer in the city his reputation and standing as a banker and if possible what particular or delicate influence he might have upon the finances of others and if there was any known connection with cornwallis or even balantyne charlotte had no intention whatever of abandoning general balantyne to hunt for the blackmailer on his own she joined forces with him the next morning they met on the steps outside the british museum again she saw him from several yards distance even though there were a number of people coming and going and at least half a dozen standing around or speaking with each other he was probably more conspicuous than he realized due to his ramrod stiffness she thought he looked as if he were expecting to face a charge any moment a platoon with fixed bayonets or perhaps a band of zulu warriors his face lit when he saw her but in spite of his obvious pleasure the tension did not slip from him good morning mrs pitt he said stepping down onto the pavement to meet her it is most generous of you to help in this way giving up your time in a pursuit that may meet with no success it is not much of a battle if there is no chance of failure she reminded him sharply i do not require assured success before i begin he flushed faintly i did not mean to sound as if i doubted your courage she shot him a dazzling smile i know that i think you are just a little despondent this morning because this is such a cowardly thing for anyone to do and we cannot strike back at something we cannot see she moved forward purposefully along great russell street although she had no idea where they were going it was simply better than seeming to stand still with whom do we begin the nearest geographically is james carew he answered he lives in william street near the park he raised his arm to call a hansom and a moment later one stopped he handed her up and followed after sitting beside her straightbacked staring ahead he had given the driver the address and they began to move swiftly weaving through the traffic of carts wagons drays omnibuses and carriages she thought of several things to say but glancing sideways at him she decided that anything at all would be an interruption to his thoughts and so she remained silent it was plain that idle talk would not lift his mind from his anxiety only irritate him beyond bearing it would indicate she had failed to understand the depth of his concern they alighted in william street and he paid the driver however when they rang the doorbell of the address they had been given the footman who answered informed them that james carew had undertaken an adventure to the mountains of the moon and no one knew when or even if he would return the mountains of the moon charlotte said as she strode towards albany street her skirts swirling around her ankles balantyne lengthening his stride to keep up with her impertinent oaf he took her arm restraining her with a gentle pressure they are in ruwenzori in the middle of africa he explained discovered by the same henry stanley i mentioned to you before if you recall two years ago two years ago she was confused he discovered them two years ago he elucidated in oh i see she slowed her pace and walked for several yards in silence feeling a trifle foolish who is next she asked as they reached albany street martin elliott he answered without looking at her there was no lift of hope in his voice she forgot her own irritation where does he live york terrace we might walk there unless he hesitated it was plain in his face that it had suddenly occurred to him she might not wish to walk so far or be accustomed to it of course she agreed firmly it is an excellent day we might usefully discuss what further plans to make after we have seen mr elliott if he does know who it is or if it is himself then he is unlikely to tell us the truth what manner of person is he balantyne looked startled i can hardly remember him he was rather older than i a career officer from an old military family i seem to think he had fair hair and grew up in the border country but i cannot remember whether it was the english side or the scottish he lapsed into silence again and walked with his eyes down as if studying the pavement charlotte gave her mind over to the evidence such as they possessed cole had been found dead on balantynes doorstep with the snuffbox in his pocket he had served on the same abyssinian campaign twentyfive years before somebody had sent the threatening letter to balantyne but had not yet actually asked for anything except the snuffbox as a pledge of intent and balantyne had been too aware of the damage they could do him to refuse it what else might they want apart from money she said aloud he swung around startled what she repeated the question a slow color spread up his cheeks and he looked away perhaps just the exercise of power he replied for some people that is a purpose in itself she spoke from impulse before she had time to question herself and perhaps lose her courage or think better and be more tactful have you some idea who it is he stopped wideeyed staring at her with amazement no i wish to god i had he colored faintly im sorry but that is one of the very worst aspects of it all i think of everyone i can imagine every man i know and have considered a friend or at least someone i could respect whether i liked him or not and now i wonder it is beginning to poison my views of everyone i catch myself wondering if people know if they are secretly smiling watching me and knowing what i fear and waiting for me to lose my nerve and all of them but one will be totally innocent a bitter anger filled his eyes that is one of the greatest evils of secret accusation the poison of it how it slowly destroys your trust in all those to whom you should be able to turn with honor and regard and how could the innocent forgive you for not having known they were innocent for having allowed it to even enter your thoughts that they could do such a thing his voice dropped how could i ever forgive myself a woman walking a small dog passed them and balantyne was too distracted even to acknowledge her by raising his hat a gesture so automatic to him he would normally have done it without thought impulsively charlotte reached out her hand and rested it on his arm holding him lightly you must forgive yourself she said earnestly and no one else will need to forgive you because they will not know this may be precisely what the blackmailer wants to make you so demoralized that when he asks for whatever it is you are willing to give it to him simply to be rid of the fear and the doubts to know at last who your enemy is so you can also know your friends she felt the muscles in his arm tighten as he clenched them but his hand did not move and he stayed close to her i have had a second letter he said watching her face it was much the same as the first cut from the times again and pasted onto paper it came by first post this morning what did it say she asked trying to keep perfectly steady he must not see how alarmed she was he swallowed he was very pale it was obviously difficult for him even to repeat the words that my friends would shun me cross over in the street to avoid me if they knew i was a coward and ran from battle and was saved by a private soldier and then would not even own up to my shame but let him conceal it for me he swallowed his throat jerking painfully his voice was hoarse that my wife who had already suffered so much would be ruined and my son would have to disown his name or his career would be finished he stared at her in helpless misery and not a word of it is true i swear that in the name of god i had not doubted you she said quite calmly the depth of his distress had the strange effect of setting a deep resolution in her to fight the issue in his defense to the very last iota of her strength or imagination and not give in even after that you must never allow him to think he has won she said with utter conviction unless of course it should be a tactical ploy to lead him to betray himself but i cannot see at the moment how that would be an advantage he started to walk again they passed half a dozen people laughing and talking together women with tiny waists and sweeping skirts flowers and feathers on their hats men in summer coats and all the time carriages were busy along the street they found the house where elliot had lived only to be told that he had died of a kidney ailment two months previously they ate luncheon in a small quiet restaurant trying to keep each others spirits up and then took the underground railway right across the city to woolwich to find samuel holt it was an extraordinary experience and entirely new to charlotte although she had heard about it from gracie it was acutely claustrophobic and the noise was beyond belief the whole train shot through long tubelike tunnels roaring like a hundred tin trays dropped upon a paved yard but it did achieve the journey in a remarkably short time they emerged into the blustery mild wind north of the river and only two streets from holts house he received them with great pleasure although unable to rise from his chair and apologizing for it with some embarrassment old wounds and rheumatism had disabled him but when asked he said that yes most certainly he had been on the abyssinian expedition and remembered it quite clearly how could he assist charlotte and balantyne accepted the seats offered do you recall the storming of the baggage train on the arogee plains balantyne said eagerly unable to keep hope out of his voice arogee oh yes holt nodded nasty balantyne leaned forward do you remember a small bunch of men panicking before enemy fire holt thought for a few moments his blue eyes misty and far away as if he were seeing the plains of abyssinia again the brilliant skies the dry earth and the colors of fighting men a quarter of a century before nasty he said again got a lot of men killed that way never panic worst thing you can do do you remember me holt squinted at him balantyne he said with evident pleasure do you remember me going back for the wounded balantyne said eagerly my horse fell i was thrown but i got up after a moment or two got manders and helped him back he was shot in the leg you turned and went for smith oh yes smith yes i remember he looked at balantyne with a charming wideeyed smile how can i help you sir you remember it of course dreadful business he shook his head the sunlight catching his white hair brave men too bad a shadow crossed balantynes face the abyssinians he questioned holt frowned our men remember the jackals eating the dead fearful what makes you mention it now sir he blinked several times lose a lot of friends did you balantynes face tightened a bleakness crossed it as if in that instant some hope in him had died do you remember that attack and my going back for manders do you remember how it happened of course i do holt insisted i said so didnt i why does it matter now just recollections balantyne replied leaning back bit of a difference of opinion with someone ask manders himself sir hell tell you you rescued the poor devil hed have been dead for certain if you hadnt what any officer worth his salt would do who says otherwise holt was puzzled it upset him terrible bloodshed remember the stench of bodies his face pinched with distress charlotte looked at balantyne he too was torn with the pain of memory good men holt murmured sadly manders wasnt one of them was he killed in india a couple of years later balantyne said quietly was he im sorry lost count you know so many dead he stopped searching balantynes face balantyne took a deep breath and stood up extending his hand thank you holt good of you to spare me your time holt remained seated in his chair his face lit with pleasure and he clasped balantynes hand fiercely clinging to it for several moments before he let go his eyes shone thank you general he said with deep feeling it was a great thing that you came to see me outside in the street charlotte could hardly wait to turn to balantyne and see his relief that proves it she said exultantly mr holt was there he can make nonsense of the whole charge no he cant my dear balantyne answered quietly controlling his emotions with such difficulty he would not look at her we lost no men at magdala in fact there were only two men killed in the entire campaign many wounded of course but only two dead she was astounded confused but the stench she protested still trying to force away what he was saying he remembered it abyssinians seven hundred at arogee with the baggage train god knows how many at magdala they slew their prisoners hurled them over the walls it was one of the worst things i ever knew but holt ssaid she stammered his mind is gone poor creature he walked quickly his body tight he is lucid in moments i think when i left he actually did remember me most of the time he was simply lonely and wanted to please he kept his face straight ahead and she saw the pain in it heard the thick huskiness in his voice she knew it was not for himself the hollowness of failure would come later she did not know what to do whether touching him would be an intrusion he was walking very rapidly she had to pick up her skirts and stride to keep up with him but he was unaware of it she moved beside him in silence every now and again giving a little skip not to be left behind loyalty was all she could offer tellman was very fully occupied learning more about the recent life of albert cole he began at lincolns inn fields with a pair of bootlaces he found the corner where cole had stood and already there was someone else there a thin man with an unusually long nose but a cheerful expression laces sir he held out a pair in a fairly clean hand tellman took them and examined them closely best youll find the man assured him you get them the same place as the fellow who was here before you tellman said casually the man hesitated not sure which was the best answer he looked at tellmans face and learned nothing yeah he said eventually who was that you buy em

their jobs did he have any money trouble tellman ignored the criticism course e did anyone wot peddles bootlaces on a street corners got money troubles the man said dryly you work fer a livin or wot you just do this cos yer like it mister tellman held his temper with difficulty he thought of his father who had left their two rooms in billingsgate at five in the morning and worked carrying bales and boxes in the fish market all day in the evening he had relieved a friend driving hansom cabs often until midnight all seasons of the year in the swelter of summer when the traffic was jammed head to tail and the smell of manure filled the air when the rain made the gutters swim and the rubbish and effluent swilled across the road and the cobbles shone black and glistening in the lamplight in the winter when the wind chapped the skin and the ice made the horses hooves slide dangerously even the pea soup fogs had not stopped him ive got nothing except what i work for tellman said the anger edging his voice till it cut and my pa could teach you what that word means or any man the bootlace supplier backed away frightened not by tellmans words but by the well of rage he had unwittingly tapped into tellman was mollified the ache of memory was not healed he could still see in his mind his fathers gaunt face worried cold too tired to do anything but eat and sleep there had been fourteen children eight of whom lived his mother cooked and washed and sewed and swept scrubbed and carried buckets of water made soap out of lye and potash sat up at night with sick children or sick neighbors she laid out the dead too many of them her own most of the people he worked with now did not even imagine what exhaustion hunger and poverty really meant they only imagined they did and those like general brandon balantyne with his bought and paid for career they lived in another world as if they were more than human and tellman and his like were less they had more respect for their horses come to think of it a great deal more and their horses had a far better life a warm stable and good food a kind word at the end of the day but alarmed as he was the supplier could tell him nothing more about albert cole except that he was absolutely honest in his dealings and worked as regularly as most men only missing the odd few days through illness that was until his disappearance a day and a half before his body was found in bedford square and no he had no idea what cole could have been doing there tellman took the omnibus and rode back towards red lion square he started visiting the pawnshops and asking about albert cole no one knew him by name but the third one he visited seemed to recognize the description tellman gave of him particularly the break in his left eyebrow ad a feller like that in ere fairly reglar he said with a gesture of resignation always ad summink a bit tasty like last time it were a gold ring a gold ring tellman said quickly whered he get it said e found it the pawnbroker replied looking straight at tellman without blinking goes down the sewers sometimes comes up wi all sorts he scratched his ear irritably down the sewers tellman said yeah the pawnbroker nodded find gold diamonds all sorts down there i know that tellman said thats why it costs a fair penny to buy a stretch of sewer to patrol and any tosherll knock your head in if you trespass the pawnbroker looked uncomfortable apparently he had not expected tellman to be so familiar with the facts of scavenging well thats wot e told me he said abruptly and you believed it tellman gave him a withering look yeah why not ow was i ter know if e were tellin the truth havent you got a nose on your face a nose but the pawnbroker knew what he meant the smell of a sewer scavenger was unmistakable just like the smell of a mudlark a man who sifted the river silt for lost treasures a thief tellman said scathingly but of course you wouldnt know that how often did he come here with stuff the pawnbroker was now extremely uncomfortable he scratched his ear again six or seven times mebbe i dint knowe were a thief e always ad a good tale i thought e were a yes a tosher tellman supplied for him you said always jewelry did he ever come with paintings ornaments or the like from down the sewers the pawnbrokers voice rose an octave i may not be as clever as you are about toshers but even i know as nobody loses paintings down the bath ole tellman smiled showing his teeth and no pawnbroker buys gold rings from a tosher without knowing that either no need to fence it if it was fair pickings the pawnbroker glared at him well i dunno were e got is things do i if e were a thief it werent nuthin ter do wif me now if yer int got nuffink else ter ask me will yer get out o me shop yer puttin orff me proper custom tellman left feeling angry and puzzled this was a very different picture of albert cole from the one he had gained previously he went back and had a late luncheon at the bull and gate public house in high holborn it was only a few yards from the corner where cole had had his position selling bootlaces perhaps on a cold day he had come in here even if only for a mug of ale and a slice of bread he ordered ale for himself and a good thick sandwich of roast beef and horseradish sauce he sat where he hoped to fall into conversation easily with some regular of the place he began to eat he was hungry he had been walking all morning and was glad to sit down he had not cared a great deal about clothes until lately he had bought one or two things in the last couple of months a new coat in good dark blue and two new shirts a man should have some selfrespect but boots that fitted were his greatest expense and had not been skimped on since his very first wage he bit into the bread and thought of gracies cake there was something about home cooking eaten at the kitchen table which sat better in the stomach than the best meat eaten in some anonymous place and paid for gracie was a funny mixture of a person at times she sounded so independent even bossy and yet she worked for pitt and lived in his house without any place that was really her own she was at his beck and call all hours not only day but night too he pictured her as he sat chewing on the beef sandwich she was very little nothing really but skin and bone not the sort of woman to attract most men nothing to put your arms around he thought of other women he had found pleasing at one time or another there was ethel all fair hair and soft skin plenty of curves there and nicenatured too agreeable she had married billy tomkinson at the time that had hurt he was surprised that he could think of it so easily now even with a smile what would gracie have made of ethel his smile widened he could hear her voice in his mind great useless article shed have said he could imagine the tolerant scorn on her face with its wide eyes and thin strong features she was strong she had all the courage and determination in the world shed never let you down never run away from anything like a little terrier face anyone and she knew right from wrong conscience like iron no maybe more like steel sharp and bright funny how much that sort ofthing could matter when you really thought about it not that gracie wasnt pretty in her own way she had a beautiful neck very smooth and the daintiest ears he had ever seen and nice fingernails ovalshaped and always pink and clean this was ridiculous he should stop daydreaming and get on with his job he needed to find out a great deal more about albert cole he bought another pint of ale and struck up a conversation with a large man standing at the bar he left an hour later having heard nothing but good of cole in the opinion of the barman and other regulars he had spoken to cole was a decent cheerful hardworking man as honest as the day careful with his money but always ready to stand a friend a drink when it was his turn and occasionally on a wet evening when the weather was too harsh to expect anyone to buy bootlaces he would take three or four pints and make them last several hours and then he would tell tales of his military career sometimes there were past war stories of europe sometimes heroic deeds of his regiment which had been the duke of wellingtons own and had fought brilliantly against the french in the napoleonic wars and sometimes if thoroughly pressedand it needed that because he was a modest man even shy when it came to his own deedshe would talk of the abyssinian campaign he reckoned general napier was the equal of any soldier on earth and was immensely proud of having served under his command tellman left thoroughly angry and confused the conflicting views of cole made no sense he presented two faces one honest ordinary a man like ten thousand others who had served his country and now lived in a boardinghouse and sold bootlaces on a street corner patronized by the welltodo of lincolns inn fields drinking at the bull and gate among friends the other was a thief who sold his takings to a pawnshop presumably broke into houses in places like bedford square and was murdered for his pains and he had had the snuffbox in his pocket but if he was killed because he was trying to rob someone what was he doing outside the house not inside it could he have been struck somewhere else and left for dead and then crawled away was he attempting to get help when he dragged himself up general balantynes step tellman walked smartly east along high holborn and turned north up southampton row towards theobalds road he would make more enquiries but they elicited nothing that clarified the situation a running patterer chanting the latest news and gossip for the entertainment of the public recounted coles death in doggerel verse tellman paid him handsomely and learned that cole was an ordinary man a trifle sober but a good enough seller of bootlaces and well liked by the people of the area he was known for the odd kindness a hot cup of soup for the flower seller bootlaces for nothing as a present to an old man always a cheerful word a constable at the local police station who had seen his sketched picture in the newspaper said he recognized him as a petty thief of a particularly quarrelsome nature who lived around shoreditch to the east of there where he had last been posted the man had an odd gap in his left eyebrow where a childhood scar ran across it he was vicious given to sudden outbursts of temper and had running feuds with at least one of the local fencers of stolen goods in shoreditch and clerkenwell a prostitute said he was funny and extravagant and she was sorry he was dead by the time tellman left the neighborhood of lincolns inn fields and high holborn it was too late to go to bow street but the contradictions in albert coles character weighed too heavily on him not to report them to pitt as soon as possible he thought about it for several minutes it was still light but it was nearly eight oclock the sandwich in the bull and gate was a long time ago he was thirsty and tired his legs ached a really hot fresh cup of tea would be marvelous and time to sit downfor at least half an hour if not an hour but duty must prevail he would go and report all this at keppel street that was the proper answer he could walk it in twenty minutes easily but when he got there his feet hot his legs aching pitt was not at home neither was mrs pitt gracie answered the door looking cool and fresh in a starched apron he was dismayed oh he said his heart racing as he stood on the front step thats a shame because i really should tell him what ive learned today well if its important yerd better come in she answered pulling the door wider and staring at him with a mixture of satisfaction and defiance she must really want to know about albert cole very much thank you he said stiffly following her inside and waiting while she closed the door then walking behind her along the passage back to the kitchen it had the same warm comfortable smell it always did scrubbed boards clean linen steam well sit down then she ordered i cant be getting on wif anything wif you standin in the middle o the floor spec me ter walk round yer he sat down obediently his mouth felt as dry as the pavements he had been walking gracie surveyed him critically from his slickedback hair to his dusty boots look like a fourpenny rabbit you do i spose you int ad nuffink ter eat in hours i got some good cold mutton an mashed potatoes an greens i can make you bubble an squeak if yer like she did not wait for him to answer but bent down and pulled the skillet out of the cupboard and set it on the top of the stove automatically she pulled the kettle over as well if youve got it to spare he said breathing in deeply course i ave she answered without looking at him so wot is it yer come ter say as is so important yer found out summink of course i have he mimicked her tone ive been looking into albert coles life something of a mystery he is he leaned back in the chair and folded his arms making himself more comfortable he watched as she moved about the kitchen swiftly she cut an onion off the string hanging by the scullery door and took it to the chopping board she melted a lump of lard in the skillet and then with swift light movements began to chop the onion into tiny cubes and drop them into the hissing fat it smelled and sounded good it was nice to watch a woman busy so wots the mystery she said ceptin oo killed im or why an why did they leave im on the generals doorstep because hes a decent soldier who served his queen and country in a crack regiment then when he was wounded came home and sold bootlaces in the street he replied and by night hes a quarrelsome thief who picked the wrong house to burgle in bedford square she swiveled around to look at him so yer got it all solved then she said with wide eyes no of course i havent he retorted rather sharply he wished he could have presented her with some brilliant answer maybe even before pitt did but all he had were pieces and they did not make sense she remained staring at him her face softened he thought in her own way that she really was pretty but with character not all peaches and cream with no taste some people said e was good an said e was a thief too she asked no different people he answered seems to have had two quite opposite sides to his life but i dont know why its not as if he had any family or any job where he had to impress people oh she whisked around as the fat in the pan sputtered loudly she pushed the onions around with a spoon then stirred the cabbage in with the mashed potato and spooned the whole lot into the skillet while it was heating and browning nicely she carved three generous pieces off the cold mutton joint and set them on one of the blueandwhite kitchen plates she put out a knife and fork for him then made the tea and fetched him a mug and then brought the jug of milk back from the larder as she returned the mutton when it was all ready she served it up and put it in front of him tea steaming gently in the mug he had not meant to smile but he found himself almost grinning he tried to change his expression to something less enthusiasticand less obvious thank you he said lowering his eyes from hers very civil of you yer welcome im sure mr tellman she answered pouring herself a mug of tea and sitting opposite him then she remembered her apron and shot to her feet to remove it before sitting down again this time a little more daintily so oo did yer get all this information from then id better tell mr pitt proper not just bits an pieces trying not to talk with his mouth full he recounted to her all the contradictory facts and opinions he had learned over the last two days he considered suggesting she should write it down not to forget it but he was not totally sure she could write he knew mrs pitt had taught her to read but writing was another thing and he did not want to embarrass her will you remember all that he asked the bubble and squeak was the best he had ever had he had eaten rather too much course i will she replied with great dignity i got a perfick memory ave ter ave only just learned to write since i come ere he felt slightly abashed he really should leave he would rather pitt did not come home and find him here with his feet under the table having eaten a thoroughly good meal the whole room was extraordinarily comfortable the clean smell of it the warmth the kettle singing faintly on the hob gracie with a flush on her face and her eyes bright it was not only albert coles life which was confusing it was sitting here having reported to gracie as if she were his superior at the same time being waited upon and spoiled and made welcome ive got to go he said reluctantly pushing his chair back tell mr pitt im following up on cole if he used to quarrel over the spoils of his thieving that may be what happened to him ive got to find out who he worked with ill tell him she promised mebbe that is wot appened makes more sensen anythin else thank you for supper sonly bubble an squeak it was very good yer welcome good night gracie good night mr tellman that sounded so formal should he tell her his name was samuel no dont be absurd she did not care what his name was she had been in love with that irish servant in ashworth hall anyway they disagreed about everything that matteredsociety politics justice a mans rights and obligations in the world she was perfectly happy being a servant and he deplored the entire concept as beneath the dignity of any human being he marched over to the door your bootlace is undone she commented helpfully he was obliged to bend down and retie it or risk tripping over his own feet as he went down the hall thank you he mumbled furiously sall right she answered ill see yer ter the front door only manners its what mrs pitt would do he stood upright and stared at her she smiled at him brightly he turned and went down the hall to the door her light quick steps after him charlotte knew that gracie had had something to report to pitt from tellmans visit the previous evening but it was one of those mornings when nothing seemed to be straightforward and she was not in the kitchen at the time at least only dashing in and out the day before had been mild and sunny but now the wind had a sharp edge and it was threatening rain the clothes she had put out for jemima to go to school in were now not warm enough jemima was very serious and did not complain about her pinafore as usual that meant something else was worrying her which was more urgent it took patient and careful questioning to elicit exactly what the difficulty was and the answer most solemnly given reminded charlotte how intensely important social questions were even at the age of nine the precise way of dealing with a matter of accepting favors from the acknowledged leader of the twenty or so little girls in the classroom was a matter of great consequence debts were incurred and must be lived up to refusals must be explained without offense or one would be placed outside the magic circle of those who were favored she treated the problem with appropriate gravity she had not gone to school herself having two sisters she was taught by a governess in the classroom at home but the principles were the same as in adult society and sometimes the pattern of hierarchy lasted as long certainly the wounds of exclusion were as deep all of which meant that daniel two years younger felt that something of importance was going on and he was not part of it he knocked and banged around dropping things and making loud comments ostensibly to himself but really to take charlottes attention so when she had finished with jemima she decided she would walk to school with daniel instead of sending gracie the result was that by the time she had returned dealt with the laundry decided exactly how much longer the socks would last which shirts needed their collars and cuffs turned a job she hated it was late morning when she sat down at the kitchen table for a cup of tea and gracie told her what tellman had said about albert coles strange contradictory character you did very well she said sincerely i give im dinner jus cold mutton an bubble an squeak i ope thats all right gracie answered blushing with satisfaction of course its all right charlotte assured her in return for information he can have the best food in the house id even buy in for him she thought privately that the food was incidental it was gracies company which brought him she had seen the slight flush in his face the way in spite of all his intentions to the contrary his eyes softened when he looked at her above all she had felt for his awkwardness and his grief for gracie when she had had to face the loss of her dreams in ashworth hall but she did not say so it would embarrass gracie and perhaps make her feel as if her most personal affairs were the subject of other peoples thoughts and plans that int necessary gracie dismissed it give im airs above is station jus sos its all right ter give im suffink most certainly use your own judgment what tellman had said about cole weighed heavily on charlottes mind she believed balantyne both as to his innocence of the original cowardice in abyssinia and certainly of the murder of cole but the more she learned the less chance did she see of proving it so far she had not told pitt about the blackmail but it would strain her conscience to withhold it a great deal longer and he must surely already have considered the possibility in view of cornwalliss similar plight she needed to be able to discuss it with someone whom she could trust absolutely not only for her discretion but also for an understanding of the sort of men both cornwallis and balantyne were and of the world in which they moved greataunt vespasia was perfect in both respects she was in her mideighties of an unassailable position in society and in her day had been the most beautiful woman in london if not in england she had excellent judgment of people and as sharp a tongue to express it as charlotte had ever known coupled with the wit to do so with very little unkindness she also had the courage to follow her own conscience and to fight for the causes she believed in regardless of other peoples tastes charlotte had never liked anyone more i shall go and visit lady vespasia cumminggould she announced to gracie as she stood up from the table i think we need her view of this matter she couldnt know about the likes o albert cole maam gracie said with surprise at is best e were an ordinary soldier an from what mr tellman says e were a thief looks like e fell out wif is mate over wot they took an e came orff worst mr pitt said as e looked like e bin in a fight charlotte felt considerably comforted by that thought it did seem to make sense however it still left the uneasy knowledge that he had had the snuffbox mebbe more was took gracie went on as if sensing charlottes thoughts she stood by the sink with the dishcloth in her hand an the other feller as em e just missed the box cos e were in an urry praps the lamplighter were comin an e scarpered yes perhaps charlotte agreed she could not tell gracie or anyone that balantyne had given the box to the blackmailer did that make cole the blackmailer or not or his messenger or had he stolen it from the blackmailer by an extraordinary chance i still think i shall go and see lady vespasia she stated i shall probably take luncheon out gracie looked at her keenly but she made no remark other than to acknowledge that she had heard charlotte went upstairs and took several minutes to select an appropriate gown on past occasions when she had needed to look more glamorous or impressive than her own very limited wardrobe allowed she had been given clothes by aunt vespasia dresses and sometimes capes or hats which she no longer used vespasias maid had altered them to fit charlottes rather fuller figure and changed the style a little usually bringing it both uptodate and making it a trifle more practical and less formal than it had been when vespasia had worn it vespasia had always loved clothes and had every intention of leading fashion not following it the only problem was that vespasia was in her eighties a trifle thin her hair was silver and her tastes extravagant to go with her station in life charlotte was in her thirties and dark with a rich tint of chestnut in her hair her skin a warm honey tone some adjustments needed to be made she chose a pale blue muslin it had gorgeous sleeves a very slight bustle gathered from an overskirt of green which took from it the delicacy which on her looked not sophisticated as it had on vespasia but rather insipid she had a pale blue hat which complemented the gown she was reasonably satisfied with the result and left at a quarter to twelve the only way to travel dressed like this was by hansomunless of course one had ones own carriage she arrived at vespasias house shortly after noon and was admitted by the maid who by now knew her very well vespasia was sitting in her favorite room opening onto the garden she was dressed in her favorite ivory lace gown with ropes of soft gleaming pearls the sunlight made a pool around her and her blackandwhite dog was lying on the floor beside her feet it rose and greeted charlotte with enthusiasm vespasia remained where she was but her face lit with pleasure how nice to see you my dear i was rather hoping you would come i am bored to weeping with the season this year there doesnt seem to be anybody with the slightest flair for the unpredictable everyone says and does precisely what i expect them to she moved one shoulder in elegant dismissal they even wear what i expect it is very fashionable but of no interest whatever it is frightening i begin to fear i am growing old i seem to know everything and i hate it she raised her eyebrows what is the point in being alive if you are never taken completely by surprise all your ideas scattered like leaves before a gale and you have to pick them up and put them together again and find the picture is new and different if you are not capable of passion or surprise you really are dead she surveyed charlotte critically but with affection well you are wearing something i had not predicted where on earth did you get that gown it is one of yours aunt vespasia charlotte leaned over and kissed her delicately on the cheek vespasias eyebrows rose even higher good heavens please be good enough not to tell anyone i should be mortified charlotte did not know whether to be hurt or to laugh she wanted to do both is it really so awful vespasia waved her to stand back a little and regarded the gown critically for several moments the pale blue doesnt suit me charlotte explained it was the addition of the green which seemed to be the focus of vespasias displeasure it would if you added cream vespasia replied that green is far too heavy you look as if you had fallen into the sea and come out covered in weed oh a sort of drowned looklike the lady of shalott charlotte asked not quite as peaceful vespasia said dryly dont tempt me to go further let me take that and find you something better she rose to her feet leaning a little on her silvertopped cane and led the way upstairs to her dressing room charlotte followed obediently it was while vespasia was looking through various swathes and shawls and other accessories that she said quite casually i suppose you are concerned about that peculiarly unfortunate matter in bedford square as i recall you were fond of brandon balantyne charlotte found herself blushing quite hotly that was not at all the way she would have phrased it she looked at vespasias elegant back as she fingered a piece of silvery cream silk and considered its suitability if charlotte were to argue over vespasias choice of words she would only draw attention to her selfconsciousness she took a deep breath i am upset about it yes i went to see him please dont tell thomas he doesnt know i i went on impulse without thinking about it except that i wanted him to have some sense of friendship she faltered to a stop vespasia turned around holding the cream silk it was soft as gauze faintly shimmering this will lighten it she said with decision this piece as a fichu and this around the bustle and down the front it will warm the whole effect of course you went to see him because you care for him and you wanted him to know that that was not changed by this new circumstance her face become more grave touched with a gentleness how was he she looked very carefully at charlotte and her own perception of distress became deeper as she read charlottes feelings not well he is being blackmailed charlotte replied surprised how sharply it troubled her to say so as if she were learning it for the first time herself over something he did not do but he cannot prove it vespasia remained without speaking for several moments but it was transparent in her face that it was the silence of thought not of indifference or a failure of understanding charlotte had a sudden chill feeling that vespasia knew or guessed something which she herself did not she waited with a tightening of her throat for money vespasia said almost as if she did not expect an answer in the affirmative not for anything charlotte replied just just to show that the blackmailer has the power so far i see vespasia draped the silk over charlottes gown and tied it expertly she fiddled with it pulling it here and there rearranging it but her fingers moved absentmindedly there she said when she had finished do you care for that more charlotte surveyed herself in the glass it was a great deal better but that was hardly important yes thank you she turned aunt vespasia but vespasia was already walking away towards the landing and the stairs down she held the banister to steady herself something she would not have done a year or two before charlotte had an acute sense of her fragility and painful knowledge of how much she loved her she wanted to say so but it might be overfamiliar after all they were not really related and this was not the time at the bottom of the stairs in the hall vespasia started back towards the morning room now full of sunlight i have a friend she said thoughtfully mr justice dunraithe white charlotte caught up with her and they went into the pale bright room there were early white roses in the green bowl on the center table and the sun through the leaves outside made shifting patterns on the carpet theloneus tells me he has made some very odd decisions lately quite out of the character he has hitherto shown he has delivered opinions which at the very kindest could be described as eccentric theloneus quade was also a judge and a longtime admirer of vespasia twenty years before he had been deeply in love with her and would have married her had she accepted him but she had felt the difference in their ages to be too great he was still in love but now it was also a deeper friendship she sat down on her favorite seat near the window and let the stick go the blackandwhite dog thumped its tail with pleasure vespasia looked steadily at charlotte you think he is ill or charlotte began then realized her slowness of perception you think he is being blackmailed too i think he is under very great pressure of some sort vespasia said more exactly i have known him for many years and he has always been a most honorable man scrupulously so his responsibilities to the law are central to his life second only to his love for marguerite his wife they have no children and perhaps have consoled each other for this and grown closer than many others charlotte sat opposite her rearranging the newly glamorous gown she was hesitant to ask the next question but it burned in her mind and her concern for balantyne gave her a boldness she would not normally have had are these decisions in favor of anyone in particular or any interests a flash of understanding lit vespasias eyes and wry sadness not yet according to theloneus these are merely erratic ill thought out quite unlike his usual careful consideration and weighing of all factors she frowned it is as if his mind were only half on what he is doing i was most concerned about him i thought perhaps it was illness which it may be i saw him two or three days ago and he looked most unwell as if he had slept very little but there was more a sense of abstraction in him only when you told me of brandon balantyne did the thought of blackmail occur to me she moved her hands fractionally there are so many things a man may not be able to disprove once the suggestion is made one only has to look at this ridiculous tranby croft affair to see how easily ruin may come simply by a misplaced word a charge whether it can be proved or not is gordoncumming going to be ruined charlotte asked and is he innocent she knew vespasia would be at least to some degree acquainted with the principal characters concerned and very probably know a good deal about their private lives vespasia shook her head slightly i have no idea whether he is innocent but it is perfectly possible the whole matter should never have arisen it was handled appallingly badly when they believed he was cheating they should have called an end to the game without requiring him to sign a piece of paper promising never to play cards again which was tantamount to an admission of guilt condemning who was present somebody was bound to speak of it and then scandal was inevitable with two wits to rub together they could have foreseen that she shook her head with impatience but theres got to be something we can do about this threat of blackmail charlotte protested it is monstrously unjust it could happen to anyone vespasia was very tense unaccustomed lines of anxiety in her face what worries me is what this blackmailer may ask for you say he has made no demand of balantyne yet no except a snuffbox and that was found on the body of the man who was murdered on his doorstep she found her own fingers clenching thomas knows all about the murder of course because it is his case but that is not all there is worse vespasia said quietly it was more of a conclusion than a question yes assistant commissioner cornwallis is being blackmailed too also for something in the past in which he cannot prove his innocence what precisely taking the credit for another mans act of courage and general balantyne that he panicked in the face of the enemy and allowed someone else to conceal it for him i see vespasia looked deeply troubled she understood only too bitterly how such rumors no matter how softly whispered how passionately denied would make a mans life nigh to intolerable less vicious charges than either of those had at best driven men to retire from all public life and move to some remote spot in the wilder parts of scotland or even to leave britain altogether and become expatriates without a purpose at worst they had caused suicide we must fight charlotte urged leaning forward a little we cant let it happen you are right vespasia agreed i have no idea whether we can win blackmailers have all the advantages she rose to her feet again using the cane the dog uncurled itself and stood up also they use methods we cannot and would not she continued they fight from the shadows they are the ultimate cowards we shall have luncheon then we shall call upon the whites she reached for the bell rope and pulled it when it was answered she informed the butler of her plans for him in turn to tell the cook and the coachman dunraithe and marguerite white lived in upper brook street between park lane and grosvenor street charlotte and vespasia alighted from the carriage in the bright midafternoon sun vespasia knew all the proper etiquette for calling on at home days once or twice a month anyone with a suitable degree of acquaintance might come all morning calls actually took place in the afternoon from three oclock until four for the most formal and ceremonial from four to five for those less formal and from five until six for those which were quite intimate or between close friends however there were certain advantages to high birth and the passage of time when vespasia chose to break the rules no one complained except those who would like to have done so themselves but did not dare to and they made their comments very quietlyand if overheard denied them fortunately this was not an at home day mrs white was without company and a somewhat startled maid took vespasias card and returned a few moments later to say that mrs white would receive them charlotte was too concerned about the issues which had brought them there to take anything but the slightest notice of the house or its furnishings she had a fleeting impression of heavy goldframed pictures rather a lot of carved oak and curtains with fringes in the withdrawing room marguerite white stood near a chaise longue covered with cushions rather as if she had just risen from it she was slender and pale with a mass of dark hair her eyes were hollow heavy lidded her brows delicate she was a beautiful woman but charlottes most powerful impression was that she was not strong and the slightest exertion would tire her she was dressed in a dark muslin gown which was obviously not what she would have chosen had she expected callers a greater surprise was that her husband was standing behind her he was only a little taller than she a trifle portly now and broad shouldered but in spite of his ample frame and genial features he looked as if he too had been ill there was no color in his skin and the shadows under his eyes were dark vespasia how charming of you to call he made an effort to be courteous and a genuine good nature was unmistakable in his voice nevertheless he could not entirely conceal that he was puzzled to see her and of course he was unacquainted with charlotte vespasia greeted him with warmth and made the appropriate introductions all the usual remarks were made about health and weather and tea was offered although no one expected it to be accepted at this hour thank you vespasia said with a smile sitting down on the wide sofa and arranging her skirts with the merest flick of her hand indicating that she fully intended to stay marguerite looked startled but there was nothing she could do about it short of extreme rudeness and it had been apparent from her first response to vespasia that she was fond of her and perhaps a little in awe charlotte sat down nervously what could she possibly say in this absurd but desperately important situation something flattering but innocuous she glanced out of the window what a delightful garden you have mrs white marguerite looked relieved it must be a subject that gave her pleasure her face eased of some of its tension her eyes brightened do you like it she asked eagerly i wish it were larger but we do what we can to give the illusion of space you succeed admirably charlotte was able to say it with sincerity i should love to have such a skill or perhaps i should say an art i doubt it is something which can be learned would you like to see it more closely marguerite offered it was precisely what vespasia had most hoped for and intended to bring about were she able charlotte had accomplished it within the first few minutes of their visit charlotte turned to her enquiring if it were acceptable was a necessary courtesy vespasia smiled but casually as if it were of no importance by all means my dear i should go while the sun is out and you can enjoy it to its very best advantage i am sure mrs white will be willing to allow you to look at it closely enough to see the delicacy of the details of course marguerite agreed it is one virtue most gardeners possess we all love to show off but we seldom mind sharing our ideas she turned to her husband you will excuse us wont you i seldom have anyone here whose interest is more than an indulgence of my passion i am so tired of polite nothings of course my dear he said gently and his regard for charlotte changed in that moment it was clear in his expression the way his shoulders relaxed as he moved to open the french doors for them both that she had in that one gesture become a friend when they were gonetwo graceful figures across the small strip of green lawn outlined by the background of trees urns of pale flowers reflecting the sunlight white petunias dramatic against the dark flames of cypresshe closed the doors and came back across the room to vespasia you look tired dunraithe she said gently he remained standing half turned away from her i was awake a little last night it is nothing it happens to all of us now and again she must not waste precious time while marguerite was occupied outside he would certainly not tell her anything once his wife returned he had always done everything in his power to protect her from distress of any kind and yet if vespasia were precipitate he would regard it as intrusive and be offended not only would she not have helped but she would also have damaged a friendship which she valued it does she agreed with a selfdeprecatory little shrug then an idea came to her there was no time to weigh its merits the garden was small and charlotte could keep marguerite outside only a given length of time i have lost some sleep myself recently he wished to be courteous but his attention was only half upon her and in spite of his efforts she was aware of it theloneus was right dunraithe white was deeply worried about something oh im sorry he said with an absentminded smile it did not occur to him to enquire as to what the cause might be she was going to have to be far more blunt than she had wished it is the curse of an imagination she responded that was something to which he could not easily think of a casual reply of an imagination his attention was real at last are you afraid of something vespasia not for myself she answered meeting his eyes for my friends which i suppose in the end is the same thing we are given pain or happiness through those we care for of course he said it with sudden intensity it is the core of what we are without the ability to love we would be half alive less and what we have would be of no value no joy and no pain she added his eyes clouded and there was a fierce tenderness in his face suddenly his emotions were raw she had always known he loved marguerite but in that moment she saw something of the depth of it and the vulnerability she could not help wondering if marguerite white was really as fragile as he believed but it was a judgment only he had the right to make yes of course he said in little more than a whisper the two are inseparable she waited but he did not go on either he was too absorbed in his own feelings or he believed that asking her about herself would be intrusive she took a deep breath and let it out silently one cannot see a true friend suffer perhaps even be ruined without attempting to help she watched him as she spoke his head jerked up his body became rigid it was as if she had struck him the quiet room sunlit from the garden beyond was permeated with fear still he said nothing she would not let it go she could not dunraithe i need your advice that is really why i have come at this very inappropriate hour i do know better than to call unannounced at three in the afternoon a flash of painful humor crossed his face and vanished you of all people do not need to apologize how can i help you at last someone i know and care for she answered and for reasons which will be obvious to you i should prefer not to name him is being blackmailed she stopped the expression on his face did not change in the slightest indeed it was unnaturally frozen but the blood rushed into his cheeks and then fled leaving him ashen if she had ever doubted that he too was a victim she could not possibly do so now had he any idea how his color had betrayed him did he feel the heat in his skin and then the faintness she looked into his eyes and still was not certain she continued because the only alternative was to retreat over something which in fact he did not do she gave a tiny smile but he cannot prove it it was all many years ago and rests now on the word of people whose memories are dulled or whose testimony may not be sufficient she gave the minutest shrug anyway i daresay you are as aware as i that a whisper can be enough to cause irreparable damage whether it is true or not many of the people one would like to admire actually have very little charity when it comes to the chance to cause a stir with a piece of gossip one has not far to look to know that is true he started to say something then swallowed convulsively do sit down dunraithe she said softly you look as if you are quite ill a stiff brandy might help but i think a word of friendship might do more you also are carrying a great burden of some sort one does not need the eye of a friend to see that i have shared my concern with you and feel better for it even if you are not able to give me any practical advice and i admit i cannot think what such advice might be what can one do against blackmail he avoided her eyes looking down at the roses in the aubusson carpet beneath his feet i dont know he answered his voice husky if you pay then you only dig yourself in the more deeply you have created a precedent and shown the blackguard that you are afraid of him and will yield that is part of the trouble she watched him intently you see he has not asked for anything not asked for anything his words were stilted his face drained of color not yet she kept her own voice level it is most unpleasant and of course my friend fears that in time he will the question is what will it be money there was a lift of hope in him now as if a demand for money would have been almost a relief i imagine so she answered if not then it may be something far uglier he is a man of influence the worst possibility is that he may be asked to do something corrupt to misuse his power he closed his eyes and for a moment she was afraid he was actually going to faint why do you tell me this vespasia he whispered what do you know of it only what i have told you she replied and that i fear he may not be the only victim dunraithe i am very much afraid there may be a far larger conspiracy involved than merely the misery of one man or even two one cannot keep ones reputation however justly earned by committing an act of dishonor possibly even greater than that with which one is falsely accused suddenly he looked at her very directly anger and desperation in his face i cannot tell how much you know even if that is why you are here and what of your friend is mythical what true his voice was rough almost angry but i confess i also am being blackmailed for something of which i am totally innocent but i will not risk having it said by anyone i shall pay him whatever he asks but i will keep him silent he was shaking he looked so ill as to be on the point of collapse my friend is as real as you are it mattered to her that he did not think she had lied no matter for what reason i did not know you were also a victim but your distress caused me to wonder i am profoundly sorry it is the filthiest of crimes she spoke more fervently but we must fight him we must do it together if necessary we must believe in one another my friend was accused of cowardice in the face of the enemy a sin which would be anathema to him a shame he could not live with im sorry the words were wrung from him she could not doubt he meant them passionately it was in his face the angle of his body the clenched shoulders but to allow what i am accused of to be said aloud would be a torment marguerite could not live with and that i will not allow whatever he does to me there is no use arguing with me vespasia i will do anything on earth before i permit her to be hurt and she would be devastated this was no time for tactful evasions charlotte and marguerite would return at any moment charlotte had already kept the conversation on gardening alive miraculously long what are you accused of vespasia asked he was pale to the lips again the answer seemed forced from him suit for the paternity of the child of one of my closest friends he struggled for breath the husband passed away recently he cannot even deny that he contemplated such a thing his voice rose of course he did not the child was his and he never could have thought otherwise but even a whisper of doubt would ruin the mothers reputation and mine the more so since we were friends and even call into question the sons inheritance both of his fathers title and his considerable wealth his face crumpled and his voice trembled now to have anyone think that i could have behaved in such a way would kill marguerite she is very frail you know that she has never ever been strong and of late she has suffered i simply will not allow it but you have done nothing wrong she pointed out there is nothing for you or marguerite to be shamed by his lip curled the bright sunlight streaming through the windows showed the contempt in his face and do you imagine people will believe that all people there will be whispers glances he laughed derisively some wellmeaning busybody will be sure to tell marguerite what is being said probably in the guise of forewarning her perhaps in simple malice and so you will do what he asks of you vespasia said the first time and the second and maybe the third by which time you will truly have done something to be ashamed of and his hold upon you will be real she leaned forward a little how far will you go you are a judge dunraithe justice must be your first loyalty marguerite is my first loyalty his voice was raw his fists clenched i have loved her nearly all my life and i will do anything to protect her vespasia said nothing he did not need her to repeat that for him to betray his trust sell his honor would also devastate marguerite he must see it all in her eyes he could not bear to look beyond the first danger and deal with them one at a time pay the cost and think about tomorrows evil afterwards hope then for some escape perhaps someone else would defeat the blackmailer before that the french doors opened and charlotte and marguerite came in in a gust of bright wind and billowing skirts there was color in marguerites cheeks and she looked excited and happy dunraithe made a mighty effort to master the pain and the fear that had been so naked in him a few moments before his whole expression changed he straightened his body he smiled at both the women extending his warmth towards charlotte as well your garden is quite lovely charlotte said with very real admiration what marvelous things can be achieved when you have both the art to see what should be done and the skill to do it in the nicest way i am perfectly envious i am so glad you enjoyed it he said she is very clever isnt she the pride in him was enormous a thing of unalloyed pleasure marguerite beamed with happiness the tea was brought and it was now almost four oclock anyway they sat making another half hours trivial conversation then said their farewells and the carriage was called vespasia told charlotte what she had learned as they traveled back to keppel street i am very afraid that this is far bigger than we had at first supposed she said grimly i am sorry my dear but you can no longer keep your knowledge of brandon balantynes involvement from thomas i realize it will not be easy for you to tell him how you have become aware of it but you have no alternative now charlotte looked at her steadily do you really think this is some kind of conspiracy aunt vespasia do you not think it looks like it vespasia replied cornwallis balantyne and now dunraithe white yes i suppose so if only he had asked for money he would still have to be stopped vespasia pointed out money is only the beginning i suppose so it was not an easy conversation as vespasia had predicted but charlotte broached the subject as soon as pitt returned home for once he was quite early coming into the kitchen in his stocking feet and finding her busy putting away clean crockery she did it immediately because once she had determined to do it she could not settle to any kind of peace of mind until it was accomplished she had rehearsed it several times never entirely satisfactorily thomas i have something i must tell you about the bedford square case i dont know whether it is relevant or not i hope not but i feel you should know it was not her usual pattern of speech and he caught the difference turning from the sink where he was washing his hands and looking at her with surprise she stood in the middle of the kitchen floor half a dozen plates in her hand she took a deep breath and then spoke without waiting for him to ask or allowing him to interrupt i spent the afternoon with aunt vespasia one of her friends judge dunraithe white is also a victim of this blackmailer who is threatening mr cornwallis he stiffened how do you know did he tell vespasia his voice was high and sharp with incredulity not easily of course she answered putting the plates back on the table and passing him a clean towel but they are old friends i occupied his wife who is a most excellent gardener i must tell you more about thati know later she interrupted herself quickly vespasia spoke alone with mr white and he confessed to her his situation he is absolutely distracted with worry and fear but the accusation is that he fathered the eldest son and heir of one of their closest friends and now that the friend is dead and cannot deny it the blackmailer is saying that he was actually going to sue mr white pitt winced his expression conveying plainly how he appreciated the hurt he dropped the towel over the back of the chair nearest to him and mr white said such a thing would devastate his wife she is very frail and so they have no children of their own he adores her and will pay any price asked of him rather than allow that pitt hunched his shoulders and pushed his hands hard down into his pockets thats cornwallis white and i heard today also a man named tannifer a merchant banker in the city hes accused of fraud with his clients funds another one she was startled it was looking increasingly as if vespasia was right and the problem was far larger and more serious than any individual blackmail for greed he looked at her gravely have you considered that perhaps general balantyne is also being blackmailed i know you would rather not think so in view of the murdered man on his doorstep but i cant dismiss it just because i would prefer to now was the time he is she watched his face to see how angry he might be he stood absolutely still all kinds of emotions conflicting in his eyes anger and amazement pity understanding and something which for an instant she thought was a sense of betrayal she went on talking quickly trying to cover the moment i went to convey my sympathy for his new tragedy really that the wretched newspapers had raised the christina business all over again as if living it once were not enough now what was in his face was unmistakably pity memory of indescribable pain not for himself but for balantyne and understanding of what she had done i knew something else was extremely wrong she went on smiling at him now and i offered my friendship for whatever comfort that was he told me with great embarrassment that he is being blackmailed over an incident in the abyssinian campaign twentyfive years ago which never happened but he cannot prove it most of the other people concerned are either dead or abroad or senile she took a breath and hurried on again no one has asked him for money either or anything else but he has had a second letter and it is very threatening such a charge would ruin him and lady augusta whom i dont care about but brandy too he is trying to find anyone from the campaign who can help but he hasnt succeeded so far what can we do thomas this is dreadful he remained silent for several moments thomas what im sorry i didnt tell you about general balantyne earlier i wanted to see if i could find something and prove his innocence of the accusation you also didnt want me to know because it would make me suspect him of killing albert cole because the snuffbox was his he said levelly did he give it to cole no he gave it to the blackmailer he was asked for it as a pledge and it was collected by a boy on a bicycle she waited for what he would say next how angry would he be about that she really should have told him he regarded her steadily she felt the color hot in her face but if she were in the same position over again she would do the same thing she had no doubt whatever that balantyne was innocent he needed defending and augusta would certainly not do it pitt smiled with a curious little twist he knew her rather too well for comfort at times your apology is accepted even if it is not entirely believed he said gently i suggest for your leisuretime reading you try don quixote she winced now and lowered her eyes are you ready for supper yes he sat down at the table and waited for her to lay plates for them put away the rest of the plates finish preparing the meal and then serve it vespasia did not know about sigmund tannifer but what she did know was enough to cause her such grave concern that she used the telephone an instrument which she found quite marvelous to ask her friend theloneus quade if she might call upon him that evening he responded by offering to call upon her instead she was tired enough to accept with gratitude had the offer come from anyone else she might have declined even with asperity she refused to concede any more to age than was forced upon her and most certainly not in front of others but theloneus was different she had come to realize that his love for her had transcended his initial fascination with the beauty she had possessed even into her sixties and the core of which was still with her now it was a love for the person she was and the experiences they had shared over a lifetime through a tumultuous century it had begun for her at least when the emperor napoleon had threatened the very existence of britain she remembered waterloo queen victoria had been a child then and relatively unknown now she too was an old woman who wore black and was empress of a quarter of the world steamships sailed the seas and the thames embankment was illuminated by electric lights theloneus arrived a little before eight he kissed her on the cheek and for a moment she smelled the faint perfume of clean skin laundered cotton and felt the warmth of him then he stood back what is it he asked with a frown you look extremely worried they were in her sitting room there was still bright sunlight outside it would not be dark for nearly two hours but there was a coolness already in the air in spite of its golden brilliance he sat down because he knew how it irritated her to have to stare upwards i spent much of the day with charlotte she began we called upon dunraithe white i am afraid you were correct in your fears for him he confided in me the source of his anxiety it is worse than you thought he leaned forward his thin gentle face creased with worry you feared premature senility or even madness didnt you she asked he nodded at worst yes i did what could he have told you that you find even more serious that he is being blackmailed dunraithe white he was aghast i find that almost impossible to believe i never knew a more predictably righteous man in my life or a more transparently honest one what on earth can he have done for which anyone could blackmail him let alone which he would pay to keep secret his face was creased in lines of pity and concern but underlying it all was still incredulity vespasia understood only his love for marguerite made dunraithe white vulnerable and that was what was so frightening the blackmailer must be close enough to him to have known that otherwise he would not have wasted his time with the attempt theloneus was waiting for her to explain watching her he is not guilty of anything she said softly except the desire to protect marguerite from the whisper of unkindness true or untrue then she told him of the accusation and dunraithes response theloneus sat for some time without answering the blackandwhite dog lay asleep in the sun snoring gently and occasionally giving a little whimper as she dreamed i see theloneus said at last you are right it is far worse than i thought he will not refuse the man whatever he demands she said gravely i tried the arguments of reason i told him that he has nothing whatever of which to be ashamed now and marguerite will understand that but if he does something because this man forces him to something he would not do of his own will then he will have and she will know that too did he not perceive it for himself he leaned forward a little t think he is too frightened for her to look beyond tomorrow she answered sometimes fear can be like that paralyzing the will or the ability to see what is too horrible is she really so delicate vespasia he looked uncomfortable unwilling to appear harsh and yet he needed to ask she considered hard before she answered him thinking of all she knew of marguerite white over the years piecing together memories wondering how she had interpreted them then and how with hindsight they might be different now perhaps not she said at length speaking slowly certainly she does not have good health that has always been true how ill she is would be difficult to say she is in her midforties at least perhaps a trifle more so the delicacy that was feared in her youth must have been overestimated she was told that she could not bear children that to do so would certainly jeopardize her life he was watching her closely listening she wished to be fair but memory crowded in and doubt she was glad she was speaking to theloneus whom she loved and would not have him think ill of her but also whom she trusted well enough that she dared allow him to see in her what was vulnerable and perhaps frightened or weak or less than beautiful he would judge with the eyes of a friend yes he prompted she is also used to thinking of herself as the one to be protected she went on the one who must never be distressed or asked too much of dunraithe has spoiled her with the very best intention perhaps he was sometimes too careful to be wise she might have become stronger at least in spirit had she faced reality more often most of us will run away if there is someone who will protect us face all the unpleasantness for us and count it a privilege to do so could she face this he asked his eyes wide and intent unwavering from hers i dont know she replied i have been asking myself that considering all the avenues one might take even to precipitating some crisis to draw out this blackguard i can hardly bear to think what will happen if he asks dunraithe to do something which would be an abuse of his office theloneus put his hand over hers very gently touching rather than holding she noticed with surprise how thin it was how visible the veins his face had changed so much less the curve of the nose was the same the steady eyes the sensitive mouth it was so natural to protect someone you loved someone you saw as vulnerable and to whom you felt a burning loyalty someone without whom you would have no happiness no laughter no sharing perhaps above all someone who loved you the answer is that whether marguerite would survive it or not my dear she said with absolute conviction dunraithe will never be sure enough of it to take that risk we must assume that if some demand comes he will accede to it he sat back then i shall have to watch all his decisions with the greatest care a thing i do not wish at all i do not ask what this person accuses him of but i think perhaps i need to know whether it is an offense in law which may affect his position no it is purely a moral one she replied with a twisted smile if this were to be an offense in law our prisons would be full and the houses of parliament empty oh his answering smile was instant i see of that nature i should find it difficult to believe of dunraithe but i can see how difficult that might be for marguerite even if the better part of her knew it was untrue sometimes laughter is the cruelest judgment she must tell him the rest that is not all it is not even the worst of it theloneus something in her voice an edge of fear caught him with a sudden sharpness it was so unlike vespasia to be afraid of anything she was far more likely to respond to evil with anger what is it dunraithe white is not the only one john cornwallis and brandon balantyne are being blackmailed also almost certainly by the same person or people brandon balantyne his eyes widened in amazement john cornwallis i find that almost impossible to credit and you said people do you imagine more than one she sighed suddenly she was weary with the effort of the ugliness she could imagine perhaps nothing has been asked for yet dunraithe is not a wealthy man but he has great power great influence he is a judge to corrupt a judge is very wicked it strikes at the root of the only barrier between the people and injustice the loss of trust in society to protect its members in the end against chaos and the rule of the jungle she saw his agreement in his face he did not interrupt and john cornwallis similarly she went on he is not wealthy but as assistant commissioner of police he too has great power if the police are corrupted then what protection has anyone against violence or stealth order begins to fail and men take the law into their own hands because they trust no other the one i do not yet understand is brandon balantyne she saw the lack of comprehension in his face did he tell you that he is being blackmailed he asked quickly no charlotte did she is most concerned about it she is very fond of him and that is an entirely different problem he did not understand that either she saw it plainly in his eyes no she said with the ghost of a smile that is not what i mean at all she answered the question he was only thinking but she has little perception that he may be fonder of her than either of them realizes she moved her other hand slightly dismissing the idea for the moment but i am deeply afraid theloneus what does this blackmailer want if he exercises his power with sufficient skill the damage he may do is incalculable who else may be affected he was very pale i dont know my dear but i think we must face the possibility that there are more and that we may not be able to find them or even to guess who they are vespasia this may be very serious indeed far more than the reputation of any one person may rest on it important as that is is it possible that brandon balantyne may be persuaded to stand out against the pressure perhaps she thought of all she knew of balantyne the fleeting memories his face as a young man the grief that had come to him since the accusation against him is cowardice in the face of the enemy theloneus winced he was not a military man but he knew enough of war and honor to grasp at least something of what such a thing meant he has already been hurt so much she said quietly but perhaps with having endured that he can face public ignominy again with more courage than others i pray that it will not be necessary and cornwallis he asked taking credit for another mans act of courage at sea she replied in each case the charge is the most painful that particular man could face we are dealing with someone who knows his victims well and can hurt with a unique skill indeed he said grimly we shall need as much skill if we are to beat him and i think a great deal of luck as well a great deal she agreed perhaps we should not go into battle on an empty stomach would you care for a little late supper i believe cook has asparagus brown bread and butter and i expect there is champagne knowing you my dear i am quite sure there is he accepted cornwallis paced along the pavement outside the royal academy of art he was suffering a kind of pain he had never experienced before he was long familiar with loneliness the physical discomfort of coldness exhaustion miserable food stale sea biscuit and salt bacon brackish water he had been seasick feverish injured he had certainly been frightened ashamed torn with pity he did not know how to bear only since he had met isadora underhill the wife of bishop underhill had he understood what it was to think of a woman with a pleasure and a pain which were inextricably bound together to long to be in her company and to be so terrified of hurting or disappointing her that the thought of it made him sick nothing in the world was as sweet as the thought that she also cared for him in what way he had not dared to contemplate it was sufficient that she thought well of him that she believed him to be a man of honor and compassion of courage and that inner integrity which no outside circumstance can tarnish or bend the last time they had met she had mentioned that she would attend the exhibition of paintings by tissot at the royal academy if he did not go she would believe he did not wish to see her their relationship was far too delicate for him to offer any explanation as if she had expected him and yet if he did go and they were to meet and they would and fall into conversation as they must would she see the fear in him caused by the letter she was so perceptive in some ways she understood emotions in him no one else had even guessed at if he could agonize as he was doing and she were to walk and talk with him and be unaware of it then what was their affection worth and yet if she did see it how could he explain it even as he was saying this to himself he was mounting the steps and going in the room of the exhibition was posted he walked past the grave delicate beauty of a fra angelico madonna which normally would have stirred a unique joy in him today he barely noticed it he would not go to the room with the turners their passion would overwhelm him without realizing it he was already at the exhibition of tissot there was isadora he could always see her at a glance her dark head held at just such an angle her hat had a sweeping brim very plain she was alone regarding the paintings as if she took great pleasure in them they were not really her taste he knew that too stylized she preferred landscape vision and dream he walked across to her as if drawn by a power beyond him to resist good afternoon mrs underhill he said quietly she smiled at him good afternoon mr cornwallis how are you very well thank you and you mrs underhill he wanted to say how lovely she looked but that would have been far too familiar there was a perfect grace in her bearing a beauty in her far deeper and more pleasing to the mind than simple perfection of line or coloring it was in the expression of her eyes and her lips he wished he could tell her that a fine exhibition he said instead indeed she answered without enthusiasm a very slight smile touching her lips but i prefer the watercolors in the next room i too he agreed immediately shall we look at them instead i should like that she accepted taking his arm and walking beside him past a small group of gentlemen admiring a portrait of a young woman in a striped gown in the room beyond they were almost alone as one they stopped in front of a small seascape he has caught the effect of light on water very well dont you think he said with fierce admiration i do she agreed turning to glance at him momentarily the touch of green is exactly right it makes it look so cold and translucent it is difficult to make water look liquid there was concern in her eyes as if she saw in his face the marks of sleeplessness fear the mistrust which was beginning to creep into every waking thought and last night even into his dreams what would she think if she knew would she believe that he was innocent would she understand why he was afraid might she even be afraid herself in case others believed it and she would want to distance herself from the shame of it the embarrassment of having to say she did not believe it explain why see the looks of polite amusement and wonder and then afterwards be abashed mr cornwallis there was a lift of concern in her voice yes he said too quickly he felt a slight warmth in his cheeks im sorry my thoughts were wandering shall we move to the next picture i always find pastoral scenes most agreeable how stilted he sounded as if they were strangers forcing a meaningless conversation and how cold agreeable what a lukewarm word to use for beauty of such deep and abiding peace he looked at the blackandwhite cows grazing in dappled sunlight and the rolling countryside glimpsed through summer trees it was land he loved with a passion why could he not say so to her what is love without trust forgiveness patience and gentleness mere hunger and need joy in anothers company shared pleasures even laughter and perceptions are merely the things of good acquaintance to be more than that must be giving as well as taking cost as well as gain you look a little concerned mr cornwallis she said gently have you a troublesome case he made a decision yes but i intend to leave it behind for half an hour he forced himself to smile and linked his arm through hers something he had never done before i shall look at this perfect loveliness which nothing shall fade or destroy and it will be doubled from now because i shall share it with you the rest of the world can wait i shall return to it soon enough she smiled back at him as if she had understood far more than he had said how very wise of you i shall do exactly the same and she walked close to his side keeping her arm through his tellman needed to know more about albert cole most particularly his comings and goings in the last few days of his life so far every additional fact had only added to the confusion he must go back to the beginning and start again the best place for that was coles lodgings in theobalds road the house was shabby more so in the clear morning sunlight than it had seemed the first time he had been there but it was clean and there were neat rag rugs on the board floors and the landlady was busy with pail and scrubbing brush her faded blond hair was tied up in a cloth cap to keep it off her face and her redknuckled hands were covered in suds good morning mrs hampson he said pleasantly sorry to bother you again when youre busy he glanced at the halfscrubbed floor of the passage the smell of lye and vinegar reminded him of the rooms where he had grown up of his mother kneeling just like this with a brush in her hand her sleeves rolled high he could have been a small boy again with bare knees and holes in his boots mrs hampson stood up stiffly smoothing her apron syou again is it i dunno any more bout your mr cole now than i did wen yer first come e were a quiet decent sort o man always got a civil word i dunno wy anybodyd wanter go an kill im for can you think back to the last few days of his life mrs hampson he

head dont encourage callers int room an yer never knows wot theyll get up ter anyway decent man e were if e ever did anythink like natural e dint do it ere tellman did not think coles death had had anything to do with women he did not bother to pursue that path when did he come and go during the last few days of his life mrs hampson she thought for a moment well the last day i saw im which were

me the lawyers start later bein gents like an o course theres casuals all the time and the day before can you remember some she ignored the brush in her hand still dripping water onto the floor cant remember particlar but id a remembered if it a bin different same every day gruel fer breakfast an a piece o bread look mister i got work ter do if yer wants moren this yerll ave ter come inside an let me get on she knelt and wiped up the drips and then the last few inches of soap and water and he picked up the pail to carry it for her their palms meeting on the wooden spool of the handle she was so startled she nearly dropped it but she said nothing in the kitchen she left the pail in the corner and began to mix white brick dust into a paste with linseed oil to scour the tabletops she mixed some more with water to polish the knife blades and the large brasshandled poker by the stove tellman sat in the corner out of her way he watched her work he asked her everything he could think of about albert cole an hour later she had finished cleaning the kitchen and he followed her as she took the besom brush made of coarse twigs to sweep the landing floor and give the mats a hefty beating and return them by the time tellman left he had a fairly good idea of coles domestic life ordinary decent and comfortably monotonous as far as she knew he spent every night alone in his bed presumably asleep tellmans next stop was the corner of lincolns inn fields to ask passersby and local tradesmen if they remembered seeing cole in his usual spot it was hard to disentangle memory of one day from that of another the flower seller diagonally across leading to new square was a little more help e werent there sunday cos folks dont buy on sunday anyow most of em int ere she said scratching her head and pushing her bonnet a trifle crooked e were ere monday cos i seen im ad a word wif im e said summink abaht gettin a bit o money soon i laughed at im cos i thought as e were avin me on like but e said as e were serious e wouldnt say as ow e were gonner get it an i never seed im again that would be tuesday he corrected no monday she assured him i always know me days cos o wots appenin in the fields beanpole es the patterer e tells us everythink it were monday tuesday e werent ere an then on thursday mornin the police found is corpse in bedford square poor soul e were orright e were so where was he on tuesday tellman asked puzzled dunno i took it as e were sick or summink tellman learned nothing more in lincolns inn fields nor with close questioning at the bull and gate either in the afternoon he returned again to the mortuary he loathed the place on a warm day like this the smells seemed to be heavier more claustrophobic sticking in the back of his throat it was a strange mixture of sharp and sour but on a cold day the damp seemed to run from the walls and the chill of it ate into his bones as if the whole place were like some scrubbed and artificial sort of public grave only waiting to be closed over he always half expected to find himself locked in nobody new for you the attendant said with surprise i want to see albert cole again tellman forced himself to say the words it was the last thing on earth he really wanted but where cole had been on the day before he was killed could be the only clue as to what had happened to him please course the attendant agreed we got im in the ice ouse all tucked up safe be with you in a trice tellmans footsteps echoed as he followed obediently to the small bitterly cold room where corpses were kept when the police still needed to be able to examine them in connection with crime tellman felt his stomach clench but he lifted back the sheet with an almost steady hand the body was naked and he felt intrusive he knew so much and so little about this man when he had been alive his skin was very pale over his torso and upper legs but there was an ingrained grayness of dirt as well and the stale odor was not entirely due to carbolic and dead flesh what are you looking for the attendant asked helpfully tellman was not sure wounds for a start he answered he was a soldier in the rd he saw a lot of action he was invalided out shot in the leg no e werent the attendant said with certainty might a broke a bone or two couldnt tell that without cutting im open but shot goes through the skin leaves a scar theres a knife scar on is arm an another on is chest down the side of is ribs int nuthink on is legs but look for yerself it was on his military record tellman argued i saw it he was wounded very badly look for yerself the attendant repeated tellman did so the legs of the corpse were cold the flesh slack when he touched it but there were no scars no marks where a bullet or musket ball had smashed in this man had certainly not been shot in the legs or anywhere else the attendant was watching him curiously wrong records he asked twisting up his face or wrong corpse i dont know tellman replied he bit his lip i suppose any records could be wrong but it doesnt seem likely but if this isnt albert cole who is it and why did he have albert coles socks receipt on him why would anybody steal a receipt for three pairs of socks beats me the attendant shrugged ow are yer gonner find out oo this poor devil is then could be anyone tellman thought furiously well its someone who spends a lot of time out on the streets in boots that dont fit very well look at the calluses on his feet and hes dirty but hes not a manual worker his hands are too soft but his nails are broken and they were before he fought off his attacker because the dirt is in them hes thin and he looks a lot like albert cole enough that the lawyer who passed cole regularly and bought bootlaces from him thought it was him lawyer the attendant shrugged don suppose e looked at is face much more like looked at the laces anjus passed a word or two tellman thought that was very probably true so where yer gonner start lookin then the attendant was eager almost proprietorial about the matter with people who said albert cole was a thief tellman replied with sudden decision beginning with the pawnbroker maybe it was this man who took the stolen things to him good thinking the attendant said respectfully drop in when yer passin by ave a cup o tea and tell me wot appens thank you tellman answered with no intention whatever of coming back if he were not driven by inescapable duty he would write a letter the pawnbroker was anything but pleased to see him his face registered his disgust when tellman was barely through the door i told yer i get nothin ere as is stolen far as i know get orff me back and leave me alone tellman stood exactly where he was he stared at the man seeing his anger and discomfort with pleasure you said albert cole came in here and sold you gold rings and other bits and pieces he found in the sewers thats right an so e did the pawnbroker squared his chin no you said it was the man whose picture i showed you tellman corrected thinnish sort of man fair hair going bald a bit at the front hatchet face break in one eyebrow an you said it were a geezer called albert cole wot was a soldier and got isself killed in bedford square the pawnbroker agreed so wot of it i dint kill im an dunno oo did right i told you it was albert cole tellman hated having to admit it well it seems it wasnt army records so now id like to know who it was and im sure you would like to be of assistance in identifying the poor devil since you can earn the favor of the police without dropping anyone else in it think again anything you can tell me about this man who claimed he was a tosher perhaps he really was and not a bootlace peddler at all the pawnbrokers face twisted with contempt well if e were a tosher e didnt find much as i ever saw some o them toshers down west does real well id a never believed rich folks was so careless with their gold an stuff so tell me everything you know about him tellman insisted letting his eyes wander around the shelves speculatively thats a nice clock handsome for the kind of person who needs to pawn their things the pawnbroker bristled we get some very classy people in ere and bad times can it anyone it you one day mebbe then yerll not look down on folks so easy well if they do i wont have a clock like that to hock tellman replied id better go to the police station and make sure the owner isnt suddenly in a position to redeem it like perhaps its on a list of missing property now this man who came and sold you jewelry what do you remember about himeverything the pawnbroker leaned forward over his counter look ill tell yer everything i know then will you get ant an leave me alone e came in ere once an some woman came in lottie menken she lives up the corner about fifty yards she come ter ock er teapot does it reglar poor cow she knows im called im joe or summink like that go an find er shell tell yer ooeis thank you tellman said gratefully if youre lucky you wont see me again the pawnbroker breathed out a prayer or it might have been a blasphemy it took tellman nearly an hour to find lottie menken she was a short woman so immensely stout that she moved with a kind of rolling gait her black ringletted hair sat on her head in uncombed profusion rather like a hat yeah she said when tellman addressed her she was busy in her scullery making soap which she did for a living there were tubs of animal fats and oils to mix with soda for hard soap but far more in quantity to mix with potash to make soft soap which was more economical to use he saw on shelves above her which she presumably used the kitchen stools to reach jars of powder blue and stone blue for the final rinse which would help remove the coarse yellowish color given by starch or natural in linen of a lower quality he knew better than to interrupt her work he leant against one of the benches casually as if he belonged in this neighborhood as indeed he had once in one just like it i believe you know a thinnish sort of fairhaired bloke called joe who sells things to abbotts pawnshop now and again that right what if i do she asked without looking up measurements must be right or the resultant soap would be no good dunno im much just ter see or pass a word whats his full name josiah slingsby why still without looking up she asked him oo are yer an wy dyer care i int gettin mixed up in any o slingsbys business so yer can take yerself orff outa ere go onget aht her face closed in anger and perhaps it was also fear i think he may be dead he said without moving for the first time she stopped working her hands still the liquid almost up to her rolled sleeves joe slingsby dead wot makes yer say that i think he was the body found in bedford square not albert cole this time she actually turned to look at him there was an expression in her face which tellman thought was hope perhaps you would come and take a look at him he asked see if it is youd know he understood the cost of wasting time for her it would be a service to the police which naturally you would be paid for say a shilling she looked interested but not yet certain cold work identifying corpses he added wed need a good hot dinner afterwards and a glass of porter yeah i suppose we would at that she nodded setting her ringlets turning well then wed best be about it were is this corpse thats mebbe joe slingsby the following day tellman went straight to see pitt at bow street to catch him before he should go out and to inform him that the body was definitely not that of albert cole but of josiah slingsby petty thief and brawler pitt looked nonplussed slingsby how do you know tellman stood in front of the desk as pitt stared up at him over the scattered papers on its surface identified by someone who knew him he replied i dont think she was mistaken or lying she described the gap in his eyebrow and she knew about the knife wound in his chest remembered when it happened a couple of years ago it certainly isnt albert cole military records make that plain because of the shot cole was invalided out of the army with his leg wound the corpse had none sorry sir he did not elaborate pitt deserved an apology but not a long story and certainly not an excuse pitt leaned back in his chair and pushed his hands into his pockets i suppose the barrister who identified him did his best i daresay he wasnt used to corpses most people arent and we rather assumed it was cole because of the socks which brings us to the interesting question of why he had albert coles receipt in his pocket or was it his own dont think so he didnt live anywhere near red lion square lived miles away in shoreditch i checked yesterday afternoon nobody around holborn had ever seen or heard of himnot on the streets not in the pub far as i can see he never met albert cole or had anything to do with him the more i think of it the less sense it makes slingsby was a thief but why would anybody steal a receipt for socks theyre only worth a few pence nobody keeps that sort of thing more than a day or two if that pitt chewed his lip so what was slingsby doing in bedford square thieving tellman pulled the other chair over and sat down probably but the funny thing is nobodys seen cole either hes disappeared as well his things were left in his room and his rent is paid up but nobodys seen him on his patch or in the bull and gate but he was there on monday when slingsby was in his usual haunts as well we are definitely dealing with two different men who only happen to look alike and slingsby was found dead with coles receipt in his pocket pitt added did he take it from cole for some reason we havent thought of or did someone else some third party we dont know about take it from cole and give it to slingsby and if so why maybe theres some stupid little reason we havent thought of tellman said without meaning it he was just casting around hopefully maybe it doesnt have anything to do with why slingsby was killed and why he had general balantynes snuffbox in his pocket pitt added general balantyne was being blackmailed tellman was startled his opinion of balantyne was poor as it was of all privileged men like him but it was a contempt for those who took from society more than they put in and who assumed an authority they had not earned it was something most people accepted and it was certainly not a crime what did he do he asked tilting his chair back a little a quick flare of anger crossed pitts face and suddenly a gulf opened up between them all the old hostilities and barriers were there again just as when pitt had first been given command of bow street they were both of humble origin pitt was no more than a gamekeepers son but he had aspirations to something more he spoke like a gentleman and tried to behave as if he were one tellman was faithful to his roots and his class he would fight the enemy not join them he did nothing pitt said icily and perhaps rashly but he cannot easily prove it and the accusation would ruin him it refers to an incident in the abyssinian campaign in which as you proved albert cole was also involved whether josiah slingsby had anything to do with the blackmail is what we have yet to learn the snuffbox tellman said with satisfaction payment and the moment the words were out he regretted them automatically he straightened up in his chair pitts face was a picture of scorn for a pinchbeck snuffbox hardly worth the effort is it josiah slingsby might murder for a few guineas but balantyne wouldnt tellman felt himself clench with anger for his own stupidity he knew it showed in his face much as he tried to conceal it the snuffbox might not be all of it he said sharply might only be one payment we dont know what else he may have given him maybe that was the last of many and the general just lost his temper perhaps he realized he was never going to be rid of him and would just be bled dry and then maybe ruined anyway and coles socks pitt asked makes sense tellman leaned forward eagerly now putting one hand on the desk cole and slingsby were in it together cole was the one who told him maybe he knew how he would use the information maybe not maybe slingsby killed cole over the proceeds except that its slingsby whos dead pitt pointed out all right then cole killed him tellman argued which leaves balantyne innocent pitt said with a tight smile tellman refrained from swearing only with difficulty thats one thing that would be possible he conceded dont know enough to say yet no we dont pitt agreed so youd better find out all you can about it see if you can discover any connection between slingsby and balantyne and if balantyne had paid out anything apart from the snuffbox or done anything that could have been forced on him by slingsby yes sir tellman stood up but casually not to attention and tellman yes this time youd better report direct to me here not at home tellman felt the heat burn up his face but there was nothing he could say that would not only make it worse he refused to stoop to giving explanations that might be taken for excuses he stood stiff and unanswering i dont want anyone else to know you are enquiring into his life pitt emphasized or following him is that clear and anyone includes gracie and mrs pitt yes sir is that all its enough pitt replied at least for the present the following mornings newspapers were filled with two scandals one was the continuing saga of the tranby croft affair growing increasingly ugly with every new revelation it now appeared that after the initial accusation of cheating at baccarat gordoncumming had been persuaded to sign a letter promising never to refer to the matter with another soul then two days after christmas gordoncumming had received an anonymous letter from paris mentioning the tranby croft affair and advising him never to touch cards if he should come to france because there was much talk about the subject naturally he was horrified the pledge of secrecy had very obviously been broken nor had that been the end of it shortly after that news had come of the story from another source the prince of waless latest mistress lady frances brooke an inveterate gossip nicknamed babbling brooke gordoncumming wrote to his commanding officer colonel stracey sending in his papers and asking leave to retire from the army on half pay a week later general williams and lord coventry the two friends and advisers of the prince visited sir redvers butler at the war office and formally told him all about the events at tranby croft that weekend then requested a full enquiry by the military authorities at the earliest possible moment gordoncumming appealed to butler to delay such an enquiry in order not to prejudice his own pending civil action for slander the prince of wales wound himself into a state of all but nervous exhaustion over the prospect of having to testify but to no effect the other witnesses the wilsons the lycett greens and levett all refused to withdraw their charges of cheating now the case was being heard before the lord chief justice lord coleridge and a special jury in the glorious sunshine of a hot early july the courtroom was packed and the public hung on every word pitt was interested in the case only for its reflection on the fragility of reputation and how easily a man any man could be ruined by a suggestion let alone a fact lower down the page another scandal caught his eye it was a story printed beneath a photograph of sir guy stanley mp speaking with a very strikingly dressed woman named in the caption as mrs robert shaughnessy they had been caught in a moments close conversation mr shaughnessy was a young man with radical political ambitions contrary to government policy he had lately succeeded in a brilliant move towards his aims greatly assisted by what looked like inside information in the picture he had his back turned to his wife and sir guy and was looking away the story below suggested that sir guy a favored candidate for a ministerial position had been far more intimate with mrs shaughnessy than was consistent with morality or honor and threaded through the ambiguous phrases was the implication that he had let slip government business in return for her favors there was also a difference of some thirty years in their ages which made it uglier and lent it a sordid and pathetic air if sir guy stanley had been hoping for preferment he would not now receive it a blow like this to a mans reputation whether the suggestion was founded or not would make him an impossible choice for the post in the government for which his name had been put forward pitt sat at the breakfast table holding the newspaper in his hand his toast and marmalade forgotten his tea growing cold what is it charlotte asked anxiously im not sure he said slowly he read out the article about guy stanley then lowered the paper and met her eyes is it coincidence or is this the first threat carried out as a warning to the others he wondered what could have precipitated it even if it isnt she pointed out it will serve the same purpose she was pale faced as she put her cup down in its saucer as if the tranby croft business were not enough without this it will reinforce the blackmailers message whether this was his doing or not do you know anything about guy stanley no more than ive read here and this mrs shaughnessy nothing at all he took a deep breath and pushed away his plate i think i must go and see sir guy i need to know if he had a letter more than that i need to know what he was asked to do and had the courage to refuse charlotte remained silent she sat with her body tense her shoulders pulling at the rosecolored cotton of her dress but there was nothing more to say he touched her lightly on the cheek as he passed and went out to collect his boots and his hat the newspaper had given guy stanleys address and pitt alighted from the hansom half a block away and walked briskly in the warm morning air up to the house and rang the doorbell it was answered by a footman who informed him that sir guy was not in and would not be receiving callers he was about to close the door again leaving pitt on the step pitt produced his card and held it out i am afraid it is police business about which i need to see your master and it cannot wait he said firmly the footman looked highly dubious but it was not within the bounds of his authority to refuse the police in spite of the orders he had been given to admit no one he left pitt on the step while he went to enquire carrying the card on his silver tray the slight wind was already welcome in the rising heat of this unusual july by midday it would be sweltering it was an uncomfortable wait reminding pitt sharply of his social status a gentleman would have been asked in even if left in the morning room the footman returned with a look of slight surprise and conducted pitt into a large study where he had only a moment to wait before the door opened and sir guy stanley came in he was a tall thin man only barely recognizable from the newspaper photograph which must have been taken at least two or three years previously his white hair was markedly thinner now and his sidewhiskers shorter and neater he walked carefully as if uncertain of his balance and he banged his elbow against the oakpaneled door as he closed it his face was almost bloodless pitts heart sank stanley did not look like a man who had faced the enemy down at whatever the cost but like someone who had received a fearful and unexpected blow he was still reeling with the shock and barely in command of himself good morning mr he glanced at the card in his hand mr pitt i am afraid this is not a fortunate morning for me but if you tell me in what way i may be of assistance i shall do what i can he indicated the overstuffed chairs leather buttoned into complex patterns please sit down he almost fell into the closest of them himself as if not certain he could remain on his feet any longer pitt sat opposite him there is no pleasant or diplomatic way of putting this sir so i shall avoid wasting your time and simply tell you the situation however i shall omit the names of the people concerned in consideration of their reputations as i will yours should you be able to assist me there was no understanding in stanleys face only polite resignation he was listening only because he had promised to four prominent men of my acquaintance are being blackmailed pitt began he stopped abruptly seeing the sudden blaze of interest in stanleys face the rush of blood up his thin cheeks and the clenching of his hands on the woodandleather arms of the chair pitt smiled bleakly i believe each to be innocent of the charge leveled against him by the writer of the letters but unfortunately in every case it is almost impossible to prove it they are also in every case the offenses of which each would be most profoundly ashamed and therefore peculiarly vulnerable to pressure i see stanley curled and uncurled his fingers on the arm of the chair no money was asked for pitt continued in fact so far nothing at all has been named or given except one small token of faith or if you like submission stanleys hands knotted more tightly i see and what is it you think i may be able to help you with mr pitt i have no idea who it is or how to battle against such a thing he smiled with bitter selfmockery surely today i am the last man in england to offer advice on the safeguarding of ones honor or reputation pitt had already decided to be honest before i came here sir guy i had wondered if perhaps you were also a victim of this man and when he had named his price for silence you had told him to go to the devil you thought better of me than i had warranted stanley said very quietly the color bright on his thin cheeks i am afraid i did not tell him to go to the devil in spite of profoundly wishing him there he looked at pitt very steadily he only asked one very small thing of me a silverplated brandy flask as a token of good faith or perhaps surrender would be more accurate you gave it to him pitt asked dreading the answer yes stanley replied his threat was couched in roundabout terms but it was perfectly plain as you no doubt observed in this mornings newspapers he has carried it out he shook his head a little a gesture of confusion not of denial he gave me no warning no further threat and he did not ask for anything he smiled very faintly i like to think i would not have given it him but now i shall never know i am not sure whether i really wish i had tested myself or not i have my illusions still but no certainty is that better do you think he stood up and walked towards the window facing the garden not the street in my better moments i shall believe i would have damned him and gone down with my own honor intact no matter what the world thought in my worse ones when i am tired or alone i shall be convinced my nerve would have failed and i should have surrendered pitt was disappointed he was startled by how much he had been trusting that stanley had actually been asked for something specific even use of his influence and had precipitated this act by his refusal it would have been an indication of what to expect regarding the others it might even have narrowed the field to who the blackmailer might be stanley saw his face and read the emotion correctly but misjudged the reason for it the hurt was in his eyes and the shame pitt shrugged very slightly a pity im sorry to have intruded at such a time i came because i hoped he had tipped his hand far enough to ask you for some abuse of influence or power and then we would know what he wanted you see the other victims are men in many different fields of achievement and i can see no common link between them im sorry stanley said sincerely i wish i could be of help naturally i have racked my mind as to who it could be i have gone over every personal enemy or rival anyone i might have slighted or insulted anyone whose career i have affected adversely whether intentionally or not but i can think of no one who would stoop to such a thing not shaughnessy himself pitt asked with little hope stanley smiled i disagree profoundly with everything shaughnessy believes in and is trying to bring about with a great deal more chance of success lately but he is open about it a man to meet you facetoface and fight his cause not resort to blackmail or secrecy he gave a very slight shrug a weary little lift of one shoulder apart from which if you consider recent political history such an effort on his part would hardly be necessary he already has all i could have given ruining me will taint his own cause not help it and he is not a fool his lips tightened and although this picturehe gestured to the newspaper lying on the deskpaints me as gullible and treacherous it also paints his wife as a whore not a thing any man wants in the eyes of the public whatever the truth in private may be and although i do not know mrs shaughnessy nearly as well as the comments imply i have observed her on many occasions and i have seen no cause to doubt her virtue yes of course pitt was forced to agree shaughnessy had no motive whether he had the means and the opportunity or not do you still have the letter distaste curled stanleys thin lips no i burnt it in case anyone should chance to see it but i can describe it to you it was cut from the times in some cases individual letters sometimes whole words and pasted onto a sheet of plain white paper it was posted in central london can you recall what it said i see by your face that that is what you expected stanley observed i assume the others were the same yes stanley let out his breath in a sigh i see yes i think i can not perhaps word for word but the intent it stated that i had given mrs shaughnessy government information helpful to her husband in return for her physical favors and should such a thing become known i would be ruined and most certainly fail to receive the ministerial appointment i had hoped for it asked that as a pledge of my understanding i should give to the writer a token gift a small silverplated flask would serve very well instructions were included as to how i should parcel it up and give it to a messenger on a bicycle who would call for it pitt sat forward a little how did he know that you possessed such a thing i have no idea i admit his knowledge unnerved me considerably stanley shivered very slightly i felt as if he were observing me all the time unseen but always there i suspected everyone his voice tailed off defeated full of pain and did you give him the flask pitt asked in the silence that followed exactly as instructed stanley replied in order to give myself time to think it was asked for immediately to be collected that day i see pitt replied it fits the pattern of the others thank you for your candor sir guy i wish i could offer any way of mitigating this circumstance but i know of none however i shall do everything within my power to find this man and bring some kind of justice on him he meant it with a vehemence that startled him there was a rage inside him that was almost choking as real as for any murder or violence of the flesh some kind of justice stanley questioned the extortion of a silverplated flask is not a very great crime pitt pointed out bitterly and if you can prove that he has libeled you then you may sue for damages but that is your decision rather than mine it is a course most men hesitate to pursue simply because to take the issue to court brings it far more publicity than to say nothing poor gordoncumming and the tranby croft affair is surely the most eloquent proof of that that one could ask he stood up instinctively holding out his hand i am well aware of it mr pitt stanley said ruefully taking pitts hand and grasping it and all the proof in the world would not undo the damage in the publics eyes that is the nature of scandal its tarnish hardly ever wears oft i suppose it will be some satisfaction if you catch the devil but i daresay he is a man whose own reputation would be little hurt by the exposure of his acts there i disagree with you pitt said with sudden satisfaction i think he is a man whose intimate knowledge of his victims indicates he may well be of a similar social standing i travel in hope stanley looked at him very directly if i can be of any assistance whatever mr pitt please call on me at any time i am now a far more dangerous enemy than i was yesterday because i have nothing left to lose pitt took his leave and went out into the hot sun the air was completely still and the pungent odor of horse droppings came sharply to his nose a carriage passed by loud on the stones the brass on the harness winking in the light ladies with parasols up to shade their faces footmen in livery sweating pitt was not more than fifty yards along the street when he saw lyndon remus coming towards him his expression alight with recognition pitt felt himself tense with dislike which was unjust and he knew it remus had not written the article exposing sir guy stanley but he was there ready to make capital of it good morning superintendent he said eagerly been visiting stanley i see are you investigating the allegations against him whether sir guys relationship with mrs shaughnessy was proper or improper is none of my business mr remus pitt said coldly and i dont see that it is any of yours oh come now mr pitt remuss fair eyebrows shot up if a member of parliament is selling government information in exchange for a ladys favors that is the business of every man in the kingdom i have no evidence that he has done so pitt stood still on the hot pavement facing him i have merely read the implication made by innuendo in a newspaper but if it should be it is still not my concern there are appropriate people to enquire into it and i am not one of them nor are you i ask in the public interest mr pitt remus persisted standing directly in front of him surely you dont say that the ordinary citizen has no right to be concerned in the honesty and morality of the men whom he elects to govern him pitt knew he had to be careful remus would remember what he said and perhaps even quote it of course not he answered measuring his words but there are proper ways of enquiring and libel is a moral offense even where it is occasionally not a civil one i went to see sir guy stanley on a completely different issue where i thought he might be able to give me some assistance from his experience he did but i am not able to discuss it with you because it would jeopardize a current investigation the murder in bedford square remus concluded swiftly is sir guy involved in that do you not understand me mr remus pitt snapped i told you that it is a matter i cannot discuss and i gave you the reasons surely you dont wish to hinder me do you well no of course not but we have a right to know you have a right to ask pitt corrected him you have asked and i have answered you now would you please step out of my way i must return to bow street reluctantly remus did so in his room in the police station pitt considered remus again was it worth having anyone enquire a little more closely about him he was almost certainly simply doing his job with rather more relish than pitt found pleasant but investigation of corruption and abuse of office or privilege was a legitimate part of his duties just as it was of pitts own society required such men even if on occasion they trespassed into peoples private lives in a way which was intrusive painful and unjustified the alternative was the beginning of tyranny and the loss of the right of society to understand itself and have any curb upon those who ruled it still the privilege of the press could also be abused membership in its ranks did not confer immunity from police enquiry he could have someone see if lyndon remus had any connection with albert cole josiah slingsby or any of the men who were being blackmailed but before he could attend to that he was met with a message that parthenope tannifer wished to see him the very first moment it was possible and would he please call upon her at her home he had expected it not from parthenope tannifer but from her husband and possibly from dunraithe white also although since white had told vespasia he had no intention of fighting the blackmailer no matter what he should demand perhaps he would not wish to draw police attention to himself pitt also thought of how balantyne would feel when he saw the morning newspapers he must be ill with anxiety and helpless even to know which way to turn to defend himself he could not prove the original charge was untrue he could not prove he had not killed the man on his doorstep cole or slingsby the fact that it was slingsby did not clear balantyne of suspicion slingsby could have been a messenger of the blackmailer most of all as pitt went down the stairs again and out into the hot dusty street he thought of cornwallis and the misery which he must feel this morning as he realized that the threats were fully intended and the blackmailer had no hesitation in carrying them out he had the will and the means he had demonstrated it now beyond doubt or hope pitt was received in the tannifer house immediately and was shown to parthenopes boudoir that peculiarly feminine sitting room where ladies read embroidered or gossiped pleasantly together with very rare intrusion from men this particular room was unlike others he had been in the colors were very simple and cool with none of the usual oriental affectations that had become so fashionable over the last decade it was most individual catering entirely to the taste of its owner making no concessions to what was expected the curtains were plain cool green no flowers similarly the green glazed vase on the small table had no blooms its own shape was sufficient ornament the furniture was simple old very english thank you for coming so rapidly mr pitt parthenope said as soon as the maid had closed the door she was dressed in dusky bluegray with a white fichu at the throat and it became her well enough in spite of being rather severe something softer would have disguised her angular proportions she looked extremely distressed and made no attempt to hide it the morning newspaper was lying on the table beside her chair her embroidery was in a heap next to it the needle stuck into the linen silks in shades of brown and taupe and cream spilled all around it where she had presumably left it last scissors and a silver thimble were on the carpet as if dropped in haste have you seen it she demanded pointing her finger at the newspaper she stood in the center of the room too angry to sit good morning mrs tannifer if you are referring to the article about sir guy stanley yes i have read it and i have spoken to sir guy himself have you she cut across him how is he her eyes were bright her face full of concern and pity for a moment the fear overridden do you know him he was interested no she shook her head quickly but i can imagine what pain he is enduring at the moment you assume he is innocent of the implications in the article pitt said with some surprise it was a kinder judgment than many people would be making she smiled briefly like a flash of sunlight there and gone i suppose that is because i know my husband is innocent am i mistaken that was a demand almost a challenge not so far as i know he replied sir guy is a victim of the same letter writer as mr tannifer and therefore i believe him when he says the charge is unfounded her voice dropped a little but he had the courage to defy him as the duke of wellington said publish and be damned how i admire him her voice rang with sincerity and there was a faint flush in her cheeks what a terrible price to pay i cannot imagine he will now obtain the post in the government that he desired his only comfort will be his own courage and perhaps the respect of those friends who know him well enough to dismiss the accusation she took a deep breath and straightened her slender shoulders there was a warmth in her tone that lent an extraordinary beauty to her voice i hope we shall face the future as well i shall write to him this morning and tell him of my regard for him it may be of some small comfort it is all i can do he did not know how to answer her he did not want to lie and perhaps he could not afford to if he were to learn anything from her but neither was he prepared to lay open stanleys confidences and his own personal doubts you hesitate mr pitt she observed watching him closely there is something you do not wish to tell me it is worse than i feared no mrs tannifer i was merely considering how to phrase what i say so i do not betray confidences even though sir guy stanley and mr tannifer are in the same situation i would not discuss one with the other to their embarrassment of course she agreed quickly that is admirable but have you learned anything more about who this devil may be surely all information must be helpful i i called you today not just because i am at my wits end to know what to do how even to begin to fight this battle but because i have information to give you myself please sit down she indicated the soft plain chair opposite her own pitt did as he was bid as soon as she had seated herself suddenly there was a lift of hope yes mrs tannifer what have you learned she leaned forward a little leaving her skirts disarranged as they had crumpled in the chair we have received a second letter in much the same terms as the first but rather more direct using words like cheat and embezzler her cheeks colored with embarrassment and anger it is so unjust sigmund has never profited a hapenny except by his own skill and judgment he is the most honorable man i have ever known my own father was a soldier the colonel of a regiment i know much of honor and loyalty and the complete trust one must have in everything and how it must be earned she lowered her gaze im sorry that is not what you want to know we are already assuming all the accusations are unjust this one was cut from the times as well and glued onto a sheet of ordinary paper it came by the first post it was put in a box in the city just like before only the wording was different she looked up at him but did he ask for anything mrs tannifer no she shook her head her thin hands were clenched in her lap her eyes grave and troubled he seems to be some kind of monster who merely wishes to inflict pain and terror upon people for no gain to himself beyond the pleasure it affords him she looked at him with desperate earnestness but i believe i know who may be another victim mr pitt i have hesitated whether to tell you or not and the fact that i do so may not please my husband but i am distracted to know how to face this matter and avoid just the kind of ruin he has cost poor sir guy stanley pitt leaned forward tell me what you know mrs tannifer it may help and i doubt very strongly that it can hurt any more than will be inevitable regardless of what we do she took a deep breath and let it out slowly she was obviously embarrassed by what she had done and yet the determination in her to fight to defend her husband did not waver in the slightest i had been in the study with my husband discussing the matter he is far more troubled by it than i believe he allowed you to see it is much more than financial ruin or the loss of career it is the knowledge that ordinary people friends those whom one admires and whose opinions mean so much will believe you to be dishonorable that is what hurts beyond any reparation perhaps when all is said and done a quiet conscience is the greatest possession but a good name in the eyes of others is second he did not argue he knew how dear to himself he held the belief in others that he was honest and perhaps even more that he was generous that he never deliberately caused pain what did you hear mrs tannifer i had just left but i did not quite close the door i was in the hallway when i heard my husband pick up the telephone we have one it is an excellent instrument he placed a call to mr leo cadell of the foreign office at first i was about to continue on my way to the kitcheni was intending to speak to the cookbut i heard his voice change suddenly he became very grave and there was both sympathy and fear in his tone she regarded pitt intently i know my husband very well we have always been extremely close and keep nothing from each other i knew straightaway that mr cadell had told him something grave and confidential i concluded from what i could hear of my husbands part of the conversation that mr cadell had asked about raising money a large amount at very short notice he is a man of considerable means but it does not necessarily follow that a large sum can be realized with ease good financial advice is imperative if one is not to lose a great deal she took a breath sigmund tried to be of every assistance to him but i know from what he said that he guessed it was to pay some suddenly incurred debt the size of which was not yet known but it could not be avoided or delayed in any way it does sound as if it could be blackmail pitt agreed but if that is the case he is the first one to be asked for anything specific no one else has been asked for money at all i am not certain that is what it was she conceded but i heard the tone of sigmunds voice and i saw his face afterwards she shook her head quickly he would not discuss it with me of course because whatever mr cadell told him was in confidence but it was not an ordinary matter of luxuries sigmund was deeply troubled and when we spoke he referred to the blackmail letter again and asked me how deeply i would mind if we were to find ourselves in greatly reduced circumstances would i be prepared to leave london and live somewhere quite different even in another country if it should come to that her voice was strong full of confidence i said that of course i would as long as we kept our honor and went together i should live anywhere and do anything that necessity drove us to she lifted her chin and looked very directly into pitts eyes i should rather be ruined by libel like poor sir guy stanley than pay a halfpenny to this monster and feed his evil thank you for your frankness mrs tannifer pitt meant intensely what he said she was a remarkable woman possessed of a courage and loyalty he admired and at the same time in her there was passion and a fierce knowledge and ability to feel pain her compassion for stanley was not born purely of imagination he rose to his feet to take his leave will it help she demanded standing also will you be able to learn anything further i dont know he admitted but i shall certainly go to see mr cadell he may be able to tell me more about what he has been asked for and possibly what he is threatened regarding all information should narrow the possibilities as to who could have known enough to write the letter in each case the victim is accused of the sort of offense likely to hurt him the most deeply that speaks of a certain knowledge mrs tannifer if you should learn anything more please call me immediately of course godspeed mr pitt she stood in the center of her uniquely peaceful room a slender rather angular figure of burning emotion find the devil who does this for us all as soon as pitt had left to go and see sir guy stanley charlotte picked up the newspaper and read the article again she did not know if stanley had been threatened by the blackmailer or not or what he might have been asked for and really it was irrelevant whatever the truth of the matter was the other victims would feel the same horror and pity for him and fear for themselves whether it was a fortuitous accident or a deliberate warning to them the result would be exactly the same a tightening of the pressure perhaps this time almost beyond bearing she explained her intentions very briefly to gracie then went upstairs and changed into the same yellow morning dress she had worn on the first occasion because it was the one in which she felt most confident and then set out to walk to bedford square her sense of outrage and anxiety carried her all the way to the doorstep of balantynes house and when the door was opened she explained with the greatest simplicity that she had come to call upon the general if he was in and would receive her however she was crossing the hall when she encountered lady augusta dressed magnificently in browns and golds augusta came down the stairs just as charlotte reached the foot with its elaborately carved newel good morning mrs pitt she said icily her eyes wide her brows arched over what hitherto unknown disaster have you come to commiserate with us today has some catastrophe occurred of which my husband has not yet informed me charlotte was too angry to be awed by augusta or anyone else and she had been lately in vespasias presence something of the older womans supreme confidence had rubbed off she stopped and regarded augusta with equal chill good morning lady augusta so kind of you to be interested but then as i recall you were always a person of warmth and most generous judgment of others she ignored the flush of anger on augustas face the answer to your question rather depends upon whether you are just descending for the first time today or if you have already been down perhaps for breakfast again she overrode augustas sharply indrawn breath and obvious irritation i am afraid the news is most distressing there is a highly scurrilous article about sir guy stanley and of course the usual miserable disclosures about the tranby croft affair although i did not read that then how do you know they are miserable augusta snapped charlotte widened her eyes very slightly as if a mere flicker of surprise had touched her i regard it as miserable that an unfortunate matter of gentlemens behavior while playing cards should have passed into public dispute and comment she replied was i mistaken in imagining that you would also augustas face was tight no of course you werent she said through her teeth im so glad charlotte murmured wishing profoundly that balantyne would appear and rescue the situation augusta was not easily bested she resumed the attack then since it is not the tranby croft affair which brings you here i must assume it is because you have supposed that sir guy stanleys misfortune is somehow of concern to us i do not believe i am acquainted with him indeed charlotte said vaguely as if the remark was completely irrelevant as indeed it was augusta was now visibly irritated no so why should you imagine that i am sufficiently distressed by his misfortune deserved or not that i should require your sympathy mrs pitt particularly atshe glanced at the long case clock in the hallhalf past nine in the morning her tone of voice conveyed how outlandish it was that anyone at all should call at such an unheardof hour i am sure charlotte agreed with surprising calm wishing even more fervently the general would appear had i thought for a moment you were concerned i should have sent you my card and called by at three then not only is your journey unnecessary augusta retorted glancing again at the clock but you are somewhat early charlotte smiled at her dazzlingly wondering frantically what she could say apart from her desire to see balantyne she hated to be beaten by a woman she realized she loathednot for anything she might have said or done to charlotte but for her coldness towards her own husband i cannot assume you could be aware of general balantynes regard for sir guy and remain so unconcerned she said with glittering and spurious charm that would be too uncharitable indeed it would be heartless which no one would think of you augusta drew in her breath and let it out again there were footsteps along the passageway and general balantyne appeared in the hall he saw charlotte and started forward mrs pitt how are you this morning his face was haggard with anxiety fear and distress the skin around his eyes was shadowy and paperthin the lines at his mouth deeper she turned to him with immense relief effectively dismissing augusta i am quite well she answered meeting his look frankly but i found the news appalling i had not foreseen such a thing and i dont yet really know what to make of it thomas has gone there of course but i will not know what he has learned until this evening if he will discuss it at all balantyne looked beyond her to augusta and saw the expression in his wifes face charlotte did not turn augusta made a slight sound as if she thought of saying something and then reconsidered there was a sharp swish of skirts and a rustle and tap of feet as she walked away charlotte still did not turn it was kind of you to come balantyne said quietly i admit i am extraordinarily glad to see you he led the way to his study and opened the door for her inside was warm and bright and comfortable with long use there was no fire litthe unusually hot summer did not require oneand there was a large greenglazed vase full of white lilies on the drum table the flowers perfumed the whole room and seemed to catch the sunlight from the long windows he closed the door you read the newspaper she said immediately i did i dont know guy stanley well but the poor devil must be feeling beyond description he ran his hands over his brow pushing his hair hard back of course we dont even know yet if he is one of us but i dare not believe he isnt it almost seems irrelevant this has shown just what ruin can come upon us with a whisper an innuendo as if we didnt know with the tranby croft affair although i think gordoncumming might well have been guilty suddenly his face paled tightening with pain god what am i saying i know no more of the man than rumor the gossip that passes in the club snatches overheard thats exactly what is going to happen to all of us he walked unsteadily over to one of the large leather chairs and sat down heavily what hope have we she sat down opposite him it is not quite the same as mr gordoncumming she said quietly but very firmly there is no question that they were playing baccarat no one denies that and mr gordoncummings reputation prior to this is such that there are many who do not find it difficult to believe that he would cheat seemingly there have been doubts before has anyone ever made so much as a whisper that you could have panicked on the battlefield no he lifted his head a little he smiled very slightly that is some comfort but there will still be many only too happy to assume the worst i never heard any question of stanleys honor or integrity before and yet look at the newspapers i doubt he will be able to sue for libel it is so subtly worded and what could he prove even if he did what could he win back that would be a quarter the value of the reputation he has lost money answers so very little where love or honor are concerned it was true and to argue with him would be not only pointless but offensive no value except punitive she agreed and i suppose a court case would only give people the opportunity to throw more accusations and all the charges are so cleverly chosen that one cannot prove they are untrue he has obviously thought of that she leaned forward the sun catching the corner of her sleeve in vivid gold but we must not give up trying there must be someone still left alive from the ambush in abyssinia who can remember what happened and whose testimony would be believed we must just keep searching for them there was no hope in his face he tried to compose himself to some kind of resolution but it was automatic without heart of course i have been thinking who else i might approach he gave a half smile one of the ugliest aspects of all this is that one begins to suspect everyone of being involved i try hard not to wonder who it is but when i am awake at night thoughts come into my mind unbidden his mouth tightened i determine not to entertain them but the hours go by and i find i have done i can no longer think of anyone without suspicion people whose decency and whose friendship i had never questioned before suddenly become strangers whose every motive i look at again my whole life has changed because i see it differently i question everything good might it really conceal deceit and secret betrayal he looked at her with undisguised anguish and in thoughts like that i am betraying all that i am myself all that i want to be and thought i was his voice dropped perhaps that is the worst thing that he is doing to me showing me something in myself i had not known was there she understood what he meant she could see it in him too clearly isolated frightened and alone so vulnerable all the certainties he had built over the years dissolving in a space of days it is not you she said gently putting out her hand and laying it not on his hand but on his arm on the fabric of his coat it is just being human any of us might be there the only difference is that most of us dont know that and we cannot imagine it when it is outside our experience some things no imagining can reach he sat silently for a few moments he looked up at her once and there was warmth in his eyes a tenderness she was not certain how to interpret then the instant passed and he drew in his breath i have other people in mind whom i could ask about the abyssinian campaign he said in a studiously casual voice and i must go to my club for luncheon he could not hide the sudden tension about his eyes and lips i should greatly prefer not to but i have obligations i cannot avoid i wont i will not allow this to make me break my promises of course she agreed withdrawing her hand and standing up slowly she would have liked to protect him from it but there is no defense against failure except to keep trying to face the enemy open or secret she smiled at him a trifle wanly please always count on me to help in any way i am able i do he said softly thank you he colored painfully and turned away walking to the door into the hall and opening it for her she went past him and nodded to the waiting footman pitt stood in vespasias pale calm sitting room staring at the sunlit garden beyond the windows waiting for her to come downstairs it was too early in the afternoon for a social call especially on someone of her age but his business was urgent and he had not wished to arrive and find she had gone out to pay calls herself which could have easily happened if he had left his own visit until a more appropriate hour the white lilacs still perfumed the air and the silence away from the road was almost palpable it was a windless day there was no rustle of leaves once a thrush sang for a moment and then the sound disappeared again lost in the heat he turned as he heard the door open good afternoon thomas vespasia came in leaning a little on her cane she was dressed in ecru and ivory lace with a long rope of pearls catching the light almost to her waist he found himself smiling in spite of the reason for his visit good afternoon aunt vespasia he replied savoring the fact that she permitted him to use that title im sorry to disturb you at this hour but it is too important to me to risk missing you she brushed the air delicately with one hand dismissing the idea my calls can wait for another day it was nothing of importance merely a way to spend the afternoon and fulfill a certain duty tomorrow will do as well or next week for that matter she walked across the carpet and sat down in her favorite chair facing the garden you are very generous he replied she looked at him candidly rubbish i am bored to tears with idle conversation and you know it thomas if i hear one more silly woman make some remark about annabelle watsonsmiths betrothal i shall cause my own scandal with my reply i was going to call upon mrs purves and how she has an unbroken lamp mantle in her house i cannot imagine her laugh would shatter crystal you know me well enough not to try humoring me im sorry he apologized good and for heavens sake sit down i am getting a crick in my neck looking up at you he sat obediently in the chair opposite her she regarded him steadily i assume you have come about this appalling business of guy stanley have you ascertained if he is another victim she shrugged very slightly just the lifting of one shoulder even if he is not and this is simply a coincidental tragedy the effect upon everyone else will be the same i can imagine what dunraithe white will feel thomas this is really very serious i know it is it seemed strange to be speaking of such evil and deliberate pain in this beautiful room with its simplicity and its scent of flowers and you do not yet know the full extent of it i went to see sir guy this morning and it is uglier than i had supposed he was indeed threatened in exactly the same manner as the others and he refused she finished for him her face grim and this is the terrible revenge and the warning to everyone else no i wish it were her eyes widened i do not understand please be frank thomas whatever the truth is i am not too fragile to hear it i have lived a long time and seen more than i think you imagine i am not being evasive he said honestly i do wish the answer were as simple as sir guys having been asked for something and refusing it he was not asked for anything at all except a silverplated flask as a token much as i assume balantyne was asked for the snuffbox just something individual and marking the blackmailers power sir guy gave him the flask by messenger this exposure comes without warning and for no reason other than to make a display of power it chanced to be sir guy who was the victim it could as easily have been anyone else she looked at him steadily absorbing what he had said unless sir guy has nothing the blackmailer wants he went on thinking aloud and he was chosen in order to expose him and frighten the others so the poor man never had a chance she was pale and she spoke sitting very upright her back stiff and her chin high her hands folded in her lap she would never betray panic or despairshe had been schooled to greater selfmastery than thatbut in the earlyafternoon sun there was a rigidity in her that spoke of inner pain nothing he could have said or done would have affected the outcome i doubt the offense with which he is accused has much to do with him either he says not pitt agreed and i believe him but it is actually about something else that i have come to you i know of no way in which you could help me regarding sir guy stanley in this other matter you may her silver eyebrows rose other matter mrs tannifer sent for me this morning she is deeply concerned having heard the news tannifer she interrupted who is she the wife of the banker sigmund tannifer he had temporarily forgotten that she did not know about him another victim yes she is a woman of courage and individuality and tannifer himself did not keep the truth from her the ghost of a smile touched vespasias lips i assume mr tannifers supposed offense was not of a marital nature no financial the momentary humor flickered through him also the betrayal of trust regarding his clients funds ugly and certainly ruinous if it were even considered possible it were true but not personal in the same way mrs tannifer is wholly behind him and she is alarmed very naturally yes he nodded but not simply that she is determined to fight in every way open to her she called me because she overheard a conversation on the telephone between her husband and mr leo cadell who apparently holds a position of importance in the foreign office he stopped seeing a new pain in vespasias face a very slight tightening of her fingers in her lap i came to ask you if you knew mr cadell i see that you do i have known him for years she answered so quietly he had to strain to hear her she saw him lean forward and cleared her throat i have known his wife since she was born indeed i am her godmother i was at her wedding twentyfive years ago i have always liked leo tell me what i can do im sorry i hoped you might know them but i wish it were not so well he meant it the ugliness of this seemed to be touching so many places the pain and the fear spreading and he still had so little idea even where to look never mind where to strike back have you any idea as to a connection between balantyne cornwallis dunraithe white tannifer and cadell anything at all they have in common no she said without waiting to give the matter a thought i have already spent too many hours trying to imagine any sphere of influence or power they have in common or the remotest family connection and i should be surprised if they were even more than passingly acquainted with one another i have wondered if there was anyone they could have injured even unknowingly but cornwallis was in the navy balantyne the army dunraithe has never been abroad so far as i know and has always served the law you say tannifer is a banker and leo is in the foreign office they are not of a generation so even if they went to the same school it could not have been at the same time brandon balantyne must be at least fifteen years older than leo cadell she looked confused and at a loss i have tried everything else he conceded i have tried financial and business interests investments even gambling or sporting pursuits there doesnt seem to be anything that ties them all together if there is it must be far in the past ive asked cornwallis he is the one man i can press for any detail he can recall he swears he never even heard of any of them except balantyne until a couple of years ago then i had better go and call upon theodosia vespasia rose accepting pitts hand reluctantly as he stood more rapidly than she and offered it i am not yet decrepit thomas she said a trifle stiffly i simply do not shoot to my feet as you do he knew she was not angry with him but with her own limitations most especially now when she felt helpless to protect her friends and was growing daily more bitterly aware of how serious was the threat to them thank you for listening to me he said walking beside her please do not give any undertaking to keep confidences unless you have no other possible way of learning the truth i need to know all you hear she turned to look at him her hooded eyes dark silvergray i am as aware as you are of the depth of danger in this case thomas and not only of how deeply it could scar the individual men and women involved but also of the corruption to our society altogether if even one of these men succumbs to whatever it is that is asked of them even if it is trivial and not illegal the very fact that they can be persuaded to do it at anothers command is the first symptom of a disease which kills i know these men my dear i have known men like them all my life i understand what they are suffering and what they fear i understand their sense of shame because they do not know how to fight back i know what the esteem of their fellows means to them he nodded no more words were necessary vespasia alighted from her carriage on the pavement outside the house of leo and theodosia cadell it was a trifle early to call except for the most formal of visits which was the last thing she intended but she had no inclination to wait theodosia could leave a message with the footman that she was not at home should anyone else come she could select any reason she chose an elderly relative was unwell that was hardly truevespasia was in excellent healthbut it would satisfy she was certainly distressed she told her driver to take the carriage around to the mews out of sight she would send for him when she was ready to leave she permitted him to pull the doorbell for her before moving to obey she was admitted by the parlormaid and was shown to the large old withdrawing room with its burgundy curtains and chinese vases she had always disliked they were a wedding gift from an aunt whose feelings they had never wished to offend theodosia joined her within moments good afternoon my dear vespasia surveyed the younger woman carefully there were thirtyfive years between them but just at the moment that was less than usually apparent theodosia also had been remarkably beautiful perhaps not in the unique way vespasia had but sufficient to turn a great many headsand not a few hearts her blueblack hair was touched with silver now not only at the temples but across the front of the brow her dark eyes were magnificent her high cheekbones just as clear but there were shadows in her skin and a lack of color that spoke of poor sleep there was a tightness in her movements and a loss of her usual grace aunt vespasia no weariness or fear could mar the real pleasure in her greeting what a delightful surprise if i had known you were coming i should have instructed the staff that i am not at home to anyone else how are you you look wonderful i am very well thank you vespasia answered a good dressmaker can achieve a great deal however even the best cannot work miracles a corset can hold together your body and provide the best posture on earth but there is nothing that can do the same for the face there is nothing wrong with your face theodosia looked surprised and half amused i hope not except a certain passage of time vespasia agreed wryly but i cannot be so kind to you my dear and do so with the remotest honesty you look worried sick what little color there was blanched from theodosias cheeks she sat down suddenly in the chair opposite vespasia who naturally had not risen oh dear is it so apparent i thought i had disguised it rather better than that vespasia relented from most people i daresay but i have known you since you were born also she added i have fashioned a few repairs to the appearance myself well enough to know how they are done i am afraid i have not been sleeping very well theodosia said looking at vespasia then away again silly but perhaps i am coming to the time of life when late nights are not as easy to accommodate as they used to be i hate to admit that my dear vespasia said very gently late nights are usually followed by late mornings and you are in an excellent position to sleep until noon if you so wish if you do not sleep well it is because you are ill or something is worrying you too profoundly to allow you to forget it even in your bed i rather think it is the latter it was clear in theodosias face that she meant to deny it it was so plain she might almost have spoken then she met vespasias unwavering gaze her resistance crumpled but nevertheless she did not explain may i tell you something about a friend of mine vespasia enquired of course theodosia relaxed a little the immediate pressure had been removed from her she sat back in the chair preparing to listen her skirts in an elegant swirl around her her eyes on vespasias face i shall not tell you a great deal about his history or circumstances vespasia began because for reasons which will become apparent i prefer to keep you from guessing his name he might not mind in the slightest your knowing his predicament but that is not my decision to make theodosia nodded i understand tell me only what you wish he is a military man of distinguished service vespasia began never taking her eyes from theodosias face he has now retired but his career was long and honorable he had great courage and qualities of leadership he was held in high esteem both by friends and by those who liked him less for whatever reason theodosia was attending closely but with no more than polite interest it was a great deal easier than being questioned as to her own anxieties the hands in her lap were loosely folded the pearlandemerald ring catching the light he has had his share of personal grief vespasia continued as most of us do however lately something quite new has happened without the slightest warning im sorry theodosia sympathized it was clear in her wide eyes that she expected some domestic discord or possibly financial reverse the sort of misfortune which can afflict most people vespasias voice did not alter he received a letter anonymous of course cut from words in the times newspaper she saw theodosia stiffen and her hands lock but she affected not to have noticed it was very plainly and articulately phrased accusing him of cowardice in the face of the enemy a great many years previously during one of our lesser foreign campaigns theodosia swallowed her breath rapid as if she were struggling to gain sufficient air and this warm and pleasant room were actually suffocating her she started to say something and then changed her mind vespasia hated going on but if she stopped now she would have served no purpose and helped no one the threat to disclose the details of this incident entirely false was quite plain she said as was the ruin it would bring not only to my friend but of course to his family he is quite innocent of the charge but it is all so long ago and happened in a foreign land with which we now have little connection so it will be wellnigh impossible to verify it it is always harder to prove that something did not happen than that it did theodosia was very white her body so stiff beneath her smokyblue dress that the fabric seemed strained the curious thing vespasia went on in the silence is that the writer of the letter did not ask for anything no money no favor nothing at all he has now written at least twice that i am aware of that is terrible theodosia whispered what is your friend going to do there is very little he can do vespasia watched her closely i am not sure if he is aware that he is not the only person so victimized theodosia was startled what i mean you think there are others there are four others that i know of i think there may be five dont you my dear theodosia licked her lips she hesitated for several long silent minutes the clock in the hall struck the quarter hour in the garden outside the long windows a bird sang somewhere beyond the wall children were calling out in a game i promised leo i would tell no one theodosia said at last but the anguish in her face made it desperately clear how she longed to share the burden vespasia waited outside the bird was still singing the same liquid call over and overa blackbird high in a tree in the sun i suppose you already know theodosia said at last i dont know why i hesitate except that the nature of the accusation is oh its all so stupid and yet so real so almost not true but she signed what am i making excuses for it doesnt matter it doesnt alter anything she looked steadily at vespasia leo has received two of these letters as well making the charges but not yet asking for anything just pointing out how if it became public it would ruin him ruin us both and sir richard aston as well vespasia was puzzled she could imagine no charge that could possibly include leo and theodosia and aston aston was leos superior in the foreign office a man of highly distinguished career and very great influence his wife was connected to several of the great aristocratic families in the land he was a charming man possessed of both wit and intelligence theodosia laughed but it was a hollow sound amusement without pleasure i see you had not even thought of it she observed it was sir richard who was responsible for leos promotion it was entirely merited vespasia replied he has amply proved that but even had it not been it is a mistake to promote someone beyond their ability but it is not an offense and certainly not leos offense or yours your trust in me is making you naive theodosia said with an edge of bitterness the suggestion was that leo paid for his promotion thats balderdash vespasia dismissed it but without conviction or relief it was so foolish it could be only part of the story aston has all the money he could need and leo hasnt sufficient to pay an amount that would make any difference and you mentioned that you were involved or at least you implied you had some part in it greater than simply that his ruin would accomplish yours as well then even as she spoke a glimmering of another idea came to her it was repellently ugly because she cared for theodosia but not unbelievable of someone for whom she had no regard others would believe it i can see it in your face theodosia said gently you understand at last you are right the letter said that sir richard had admired me far more than as a friend and leo had sold me to him as a lover in return for his promotion and sir richard had accepted she winced as she gave it words and her hands were twisting in her lap the only part of it that bears any relation to fact is that i was aware that sir richard did desire me but he never made any improper suggestion let alone advance i was simply a trifle uncomfortable because of his position regarding my husband her jaw set why should i have to apologize for that i was beautiful i could name a score of other women two score who were the same you do not have to explain vespasia pointed out with a flash of humor i do understand theodosia blushed im sorry of course you do better than i you must have faced envy and discomfort on that account all your life the little remarks and suggestions vespasia lifted her chin a trifle it is not quite in the past my dear the body may become a little stiff and tire more easily the appetites of the flesh become controlled the hair may fade and the face betray the years and all that one has made of them but the passion and the need to be loved do not die nor i am afraid do the jealousies or the fears good theodosia said after only a moment for all its pain i think i like the way we are but what can i do to help leo keep silent vespasia responded immediately if you make the slightest attempt to deny it you will raise thoughts in peoples minds which had never entered them before sir richard will hardly thank you for that nor will lady aston she is not an easy creature rather overbearing and the kindest thing that can be said of her appearance would be to liken her to a wellbred dog one of those ones that has difficulty breathing most unfortunate theodosia tried to laugh and failed she is actually quite pleasant you know and even if it was a dynastic marriage to begin with i believe he is very fond of her she has humor and imagination both of which last longer than beauty of course they do vespasia agreed and they are a great deal easier and more rewarding to live with but too few people realize it and beauty has such an immediate impact ask any girl of twenty whether she would rather be beautiful or amusing and i will be surprised if you find one in a score who will choose humor and lucy aston is undoubtedly one of the nineteen i know is that all i can do aunt vespasia nothing it is all i can think of for the moment vespasia insisted but if leo should receive a letter which asks him to do something under duress if you have any love for him or for yourself do all you can to dissuade him from it whatever the cost of scandal precipitated by his making this charge public it will be small compared with the ruin agreeing to it will bring it is no guarantee the blackmailer will keep silentguy stanley is witness of thatand you will add the real dishonor of whatever he would have you do he may damage your reputation but only you can damage your honor dont let it happen she leaned forward a little looking intently at the younger woman assure him you can withstand anything that is said of you wrongly and all that may come because of it but not that he should allow this man to turn him into the kind of creature he is or to become a tool in his evil i will theodosia promised in a quick gesture she reached forward and took vespasias hands in her own gripping them warmly thank you for coming i should not have had the courage to come to you but i feel stronger and quite certain of what i must do now i shall be able to help leo vespasia nodded we shall stand together she promised there are several of us and we shall not stop fighting tellman was meanwhile busy tracking the last few days in the life of josiah slingsby someone had murdered him either with deliberate intent or accidentally in a fight which had gone too far that was one of the few things in this whole affair of which he was certain whether it had any connection with the blackmail attempt or not it must be solved it was the original case and must not be lost sight of in whatever else was occupying most of pitts time tellman fully expected the trail he was following to cross general balantynes path and it might be easier to come at it from this angle than from pursuing balantyne directly although that too would have to be done he began by discovering where slingsby had lived it was tedious and timeconsuming but not difficult for someone who was used to the mixture of threat trickery and small bribes necessary to deal with fencers of stolen goods prostitutes and keepers of netherskens as cheap rooming houses were called where those who wished to keep well out of the way of the police could rent a space to sleep in for a few pence a night the owners asked nothing about their patrons and simply took the money none were friends of the law and whatever business they were involved in was best not discussed lapsing into the attitude of the beggars and pickpockets lounging around the area tellman fell into conversation with a bullchested man whose terriercrop haircut indicated he had not long been out of prison in spite of his impressive physique he had a hacking cough and dark circles of exhaustion under his eyes from him tellman learned that slingsby frequently worked in partnership with a man named ernest wallace infamous for his ability to climb up drainpipes and balance along roof ledges and windowsills and for his filthy temper he spent the rest of the day in shoreditch learning all he could about wallace little of it was to his credit he seemed to inspire both dislike and considerable fear he was very good at his chosen skill of thieving and his profits were both high and regular so far he had escaped the attention of the law who might well have been aware of him but had not yet proved any charge against him however he had quarreled with almost everyone with whom he had had dealings and two or three of them that tellman found carried the scars in this area it was understood that no one cooperated with the police to the extent of betraying one of their own even at the cost of life tellman was the enemy and he knew it but revenge might be sought in more than one direction he needed to find someone whom wallace had hurt badly enough that he would be willing to savor wallaces downfall and pay the price a little fear and a little profit might sway the argument it took him another day of slipping in and out of gin mills crowded markets being bumped and jostled carrying nothing in his pockets and even then the linings were ripped by cutpurses so skilled he did not feel their hands or their knives he ate from a sandwich stall walked dripping alleys stepping over refuse hearing rats feet scurrying away and mixed threats and wheedling but finally he found the person he sought not a man but a woman wallace had beaten her and as a result she had miscarried her child she hated him enough not to care how she took her revenge tellman had to be very careful how he questioned her he must not prompt her into saying anything intentionally to ruin wallace and thereby end up being useless in any trial its slingsby i want he insisted she stood leaning against the dark brick wall of the street her face half shaded in the gloom the sky was hazed over with chimney smoke and the smell of effluent was heavy in the air well find ernie wallace an yerll find joe she answered joe slingsbys the only one asll work wifim least e were dunno if e still does she sniffed ad a fight summink terrible baht a week agoit were cos o the big row down at the goat an compasses were the same night ernie damn near killed joe the bleedin swine int seen joe around ere since then i spec e went orff she sniffed again and passed the back of her hand across her mouth id a come back an stuck a shiv in is ribs if id a bin im bleedin bastard would now if i could get near enough the swine but ed see me comin an es too fly by alf ter ang around any dark alleys by isself but youre sure joe slingsby was with him that night a week ago tellman tried to keep the excitement out of his voice he could hear his words falling over each other with eagerness she could hear it too din i just tell yer she stared at him yer deaf or summink i dunno were joe is i int seen ide ner air of im since then but i know were ernie wallace is es bin throwin money around summink wild like e ad it all tellman swallowed you reckon he and joe slingsby did a burglary that day and fought over the takings and wallace won course i do she said with contempt wot else yer int very bright are yer may be true he must be very careful he affected doubt turning away from her an maybe not she spat on the narrow pavement oo cares she took a step back her voice hard i do he reached out and snatched her arm i gotter find ernie wallace its worth something to me to know for sure what happened well joe wont tell yer she said derisively e got the worse of it i know fer sure how do you know he insisted cos i saw it o course ow dyer think did slingsby say hed get back at wallace whered he go after i dunno e never went anywere she pulled her arm away roughly e could a bin dead fer all i know suddenly her face changed jeez mebbe e were dead nobody int seen im since then in that case tellman said very slowly looking straight at her if it can be proved then ernie wallace murdered him and hell swing for it oh it can be proved she stared back at him wideeyed ill see ter it i swear ter that i do ill get it fer yer she was as good as her word the evidence was all he needed he took two constables and together they found and arrested ernest wallace and charged him with the murder of josiah slingsby but regardless of the subtlety or persistence of questioning or the threats or promises made to him wallace was adamant that he had left the body of slingsby in the alley where he had fallen and himself left the scene with all the speed he could muster wy the bleedin ell should i a took im ter bleedin bedford square he demanded with amazement wo for dyer fink im gonna carry a corpse wot i done in alfway roun lunnon in the middle o the night jus so as i can leave im on someone elses bleedin doorstep wo fer the notion of placing albert coles bill for socks in the pocket of the corpse had him seriously questioning tellmans sanity yer bleedin mad you are he snorted his eyes wide wot the ell are yer on abahtsocks he guffawed with laughter tellman left the shoreditch police station deep in thought unconsciously he pushed his hands farther into his pockets not realizing how he was mimicking pitt he believed wallace simply because what he said made sense he had killed slingsby in a fight which was violent stupid born of an ungoverned temper and a quarrel over money there was no forethought in it no planning either before or after so who put the socks receipt in slingsbys pocket and where had he got it from where was albert cole now alive or dead and above all why there was only one answer that came to his mind in order to blackmail general brandon balantyne the street was shimmering with heat it rose in waves from the stones and the sheer brick walls on either side seemed to hem him in the horses trotting briskly between the shafts of hansoms and drays alike were dark with sweat the smell of manure was sharp in the air he preferred it to the stale clinging odor of drains a running patterer stood on the corner with a small group of listeners gathered around him he was spinning a doggerel poem about the tranby croft affair and the prince of waless affection for lady frances brooke his version of the tale reflected rather better on gordoncumming than on the heir to the throne or his friends tellman stopped and listened for a minute or two and gave the man a threepenny bit then crossed the street and went on his way what did the blackmailer want money or some corrupt action and there had to be more to it than merely slingsbys body even if it were believed to be that of albert cole or balantyne would never submit the answer to those questions must lie with balantyne he would do as pitt had told him and investigate the general more thoroughly but he would be highly discreet about it and he would tell gracie nothing his face burned at the thought and he was surprised and angry at how guilty it made him feel that he would be keeping it from her after he had given her his word at least implicitly to help he pushed his hands deeper into his pockets and strode along the pavement with his shoulders hunched and his lips in a thin line the smells of rotten wood soot and effluent catching in the back of his throat he began early the following morning by looking again at what he knew of balantynes military record he needed to know something of the man in order to understand his weaknesses why he might have created enemies and who they would be according to what little tellman had learned by following him since the discovery of the corpse in bedford square he was a cold precise man whose few pleasures were solitary tellman squared his shoulders and increased his pace along the footpath he was absolutely certain there was a great deal more to learn more that was actually relevant to the blackmail and whoever had moved the body of josiah slingsby and left it on the generals doorstep perhaps as far as the law was concerned it did not matter a great deal tellman had arrested and charged wallace with the murder but blackmail was also a crime whoever the victim was he did not want to speak to officers men of balantynes own background and situation in life who also had purchased their commissions and would close ranks against enquiry as naturally as against any other enemy attacking the quality of their comfortable privileged lives he wanted to speak to ordinary soldiers who would not be too arrogant to answer him man to man and to praise or criticize with honesty he could speak to them as equals and press them for detail opinion and names it took him three hours to find billy treadwell who had until five years before been a private in the indian army now he kept a public house down by the river he was a thin man with a large beak of a nose and a ready smile with crooked very white teeth the middle two of which were chipped general balantyne he said cheerfully leaning on a barrel in the yard of the red bull well major balantyne as e were then course its goin back a fair bit but yeah i remember im course i do wot about it it was not said aggressively but with curiosity years in india had burned his skin a deep brown and he seemed not to find this extraordinary heat wave in the least uncomfortable he narrowed his eyes against the reflection of the sun on the water but he did not look for shade tellman sat down on the low edge of the brick wall that divided the yard from the small vegetable garden the sound of the river was a pleasant background just out of sight but the heat burned his skin and his feet were on fire you served with him didnt you in india he asked treadwell looked at him with his head a little on one side you know that or you wouldnt be ere askin me wot about it why fer dyer wanna know tellman had weighed in his mind how to answer this question all the way there on the steamer he had taken up the river he was still uncertain he did not want to prejudice the mans answer thats hard to say without breaking confidences he said slowly i think theres a crime going on and i think the general might be one of the intended victims i want to stop it happening so why dont you just warn im treadwell said reasonably glancing over his shoulder at a steamer as it passed close to shore wondering if it might be likely custom it isnt that simple tellman had prepared himself for that we want to catch the criminal as well believe me if the general could help he would treadwell turned back to him oh i believe that he said with feeling straight as a die e were always knew where you stood with im not like some as i could name strict for law and order was he tellman asked not special he gave his full attention now business forgotten ed bend the rules if e could see the reason e understood that men ave got ter believe in a cause if yer asking em ter die for it just like they gotter believe in a commanding officer if theyre gonna obey im wen they dont see the reason why e gives an order you dont question an order tellman said with disbelief no course not treadwell answered disdainfully but some yer obeys slow like an some yer trusts which was balantyne trust im the reply was unhesitating e knew is job never sent men ter do summink as e couldnt do isself some men leads from the back not im he moved over and sat on the barrel top settling to reminisce squinting a little in the sun but ignoring its heat i member once when we was up on the northwest frontier there was a faraway look in his eyes yerd ave ter see them mountains ter believe em yer would great shining white peaks anging over us in the sky they was reckon as they was scrapin oles in the floor of eaven he took a deep breath anyway major balantyne was told by the colonel ter take a couple o score of us an go up the pass an come down beind the pathans e were kind o new at the northwest didnt reckon much ter the pathans major balantyne tried ter put im right told im they was some o the best soldiers in the world clever tough an dint run away from nuffink on gods earth he shook his head and sighed wearily but the colonel e wouldnt listen one o them daft bleeders wot wont be told nuffink he looked at tellman for a moment to make sure that he was following the story and tellman prompted shifting his feet uncomfortably he could feel the sweat trickling down his body so the major stood ter attention treadwell resumed yes sir no sir an took is orders then as soon as we was well out o sight o the post e said in a loud voice as is compass was broke an gave orders to go aboutface an followed is plan ter come at the pathans from two sides at once an instead o standin our ground ter keep movin just a couple o rounds o shot an then while they was still workin out which way we was comin we was gone again he looked at tellman narrowly did you win tellman was caught up in spite of himself course we did treadwell said with a grin an the colonel took the credit for it was as mad as all ell but couldnt do nuffink abaht it stood an listened ter them say wot an ell of a clever feller e was an thanked them fer it ad ter didnte but it was the majors idea tellman protested didnt he tell them whoever was in charge treadwell shook his head yer never bin army ave yer there was pity in his tone and a certain kind of protectiveness as of the worlds innocents yer don show up one o yer own even if e looks for it loyalty the majord never a done that one o the old sort e were take wot comes ter im an never complain i seen im so wore out e were near droppin ter the ground but e jus kep goin wouldnt let the men down yer see thats wot bein an officer is abaht them wots any good yer always gotta be that bit bettern others or ow could they foller yer there was a bellow of laughter from the open door of the public tearoom tellman frowned did you like him he asked to treadwell it was an incomprehensible question wot dyer mean like im e were the major yer don like officers yer either love em or ate em yer like friends fellers wot yer marches beside not them as yer follers tellman knew the answer before he asked still he needed to hear it in words did you love or hate the major treadwell shook his head if i dint see yer face id reckon you was simple int i just bin tellin yer e were one othe best tellman was confused he could not disbelieve treadwell the light in his eyes was too clear and the amusement at an outsiders failure to grasp what was so plain to him tellman thanked him and took his leave what had happened to balantyne in the intervening years which had made him the stiff and solitary man he was now why was treadwells view of him so unrecognizable the next soldier he found was one william sturton another ordinary man who had risen through long service to the rank of sergeant and was immensely proud of it he was stiff with rheumatism now and his white hair and whiskers shone in the dappled shade as he sat on the park bench eager to talk remembering the glories of the past with this young man who knew nothing and was so happy to listen course i remember colonel balantyne he said with a lift of his chin after tellman had introduced himself it were im as led us wen we rode inter lucknow after the mutiny never seen anyfink like it his face was set hard as he strove to control the anguish of memory that tore him even now tellman could not imagine what lay in his inward vision he knew poverty crime and disease he knew the ravages of cholera in the slums and freezing corpses of the beggars and the old and the children who lived in the streets he knew all the agony inflicted by helplessness and indifference but he had never seen war individual murders were one thing the carnage of mass destruction was beyond his knowledge he could only guess and watch the sergeants face you went in he prompted yeah sturton was looking beyond him his eyes misted over it was seein the women and children that got me im used ter seein men cut ter pieces colonel balantyne tellman said forcing him back to the issue he did not want to hear the other details he had read about it been told in school enough to know he dreaded it a thread of breeze stirred the leaves making a sound like waves on a shore away in the distance a woman laughed never forget the colonels face sturton was lost in the past he was in india not the milder heat of an english summer afternoon looked like death isself e did thought e were gonna fall orff is horse stumbled wen e got orff knees fair wobbled wen e walked over ter the first pile o corpses ed seen plenty o death on the battlefield but this were different in spite of himself tellman tried to imagine it and felt sick he wondered what balantynes emotions had been how deep he looked like such a stiff cold man now what did he do he asked sturton did not look at him his mind was still in lucknow thirtyfour years before we was all took bad at it he said quietly the colonel took charge e was white as death an is voice were shakin but e told us all wot ter do ow ter search the buildings ter make sure there werent no ambushes ter see if there were anyone iding like there was fierce pride in his voice faraway things remembered and the fact that he had done his duty and survived into these softer times secure the bounds put a watch in case they returned he went on not looking at tellman beside him e sent the youngest fer that keep em out o the way o the dead some of us was took pretty ard by it like i said it were the women some of em wi babes even e went round isself to see if any of em was still alive like gawd knows ow e did it i couldnt a but then thats wy es a colonel an i int he was a colonel because his father bought his commission tellman said then instantly and without knowing why wished he hadnt sturton looked at him with patient contempt his face was eloquent that he considered tellman beneath explaining to you dunno nuffink about duty or loyalty or nuffink else or yer wouldnt say such a damn stupid thing he retorted colonel balantyne were the sort o man wed a followed any place ed a gorn an proud ter do it e elped us bury the dead and stood over the graves and said the prayers for em even on ot nights if i shut me eyes i can still ear is voice sayin them words never wept course e wouldnt but it were all there in his face all that orror he sighed deeply and remained silent for several moments this time tellman did not venture to interrupt he was full of strange and troubling emotions he tried to imagine the general as a younger man a man with an inner life of emotions anger pain pity all masked with a mighty effort because it was his duty and he must lead the men never let them doubt him or see weakness for their sakes it was not the balantyne he had believed he knew so wot dyer want ter know about the colonel for then sturton burst across his thoughts i int gonna tell yer nuffink agin im int nothing ter tell if yer think as e done suffink wrong yer daft even dafter an more iggerant than i took yer for an thats saying a lot tellman took the reproach without argument because he was too confused to justify himself no he said slowly no i dont think so im looking for someone who is trying to hurt him an enemy he saw the look of anger on sturtons face possibly from the abyssinian campaign perhaps not yer got any idea wot yer doin sturton said disgustedly wot kind oenemy someone vicious enough to try to attempt blackmail with a false story tellman answered then was afraid perhaps he had betrayed too much he felt as if any step he took he was on uncertain ground suddenly everything was shifting beneath his feet then yerd better find im sturton said furiously an soon ill elp yer he stiffened as if to move and begin straightaway tellman hesitated why not he could use any expert help he could obtain all right he accepted i need to know anything you find out about the attack on the supply train at arogee thats the event thats being lied about right sturton agreed bow street yer said ill be there tellman spent the next two days discreetly following balantyne himself it was not difficult since balantyne went out very little and was so deep in thought as never to look to either side of himself far less behind tellman could have been striding step by step with him and probably not have been noticed the first time the general went out in a carriage with his wife a dark handsome woman tellman found intimidating he was very careful not to catch her eye even by accident he wondered what had made balantyne choose her and then realized that perhaps he had not maybe it was an arranged marriage family links or money she was certainly elegant enough as she walked across the pavement past the general barely looking at him and accepted the coachmans hand up into the open carriage she arranged her skirts with a single expert movement and stared straight ahead she did not turn as balantyne got in beside her he spoke to her she replied again without looking at him she told the coachman to proceed before he moved to do so tellman felt vaguely embarrassed for the general as if he had been somehow rebuffed it was a curious sensation and one that took him entirely by surprise he followed them to an art exhibition where he was not permitted inside he waited until they emerged a little over an hour later lady augusta looked bright and hardand impatient balantyne was speaking with a whitehaired man and they seemed deep in conversation they regarded each other with respect which bordered on affection tellman remembered that the general painted in watercolors himself lady augusta tapped her foot balantyne was some minutes more before he joined her all the way home she ignored him and back in bedford square she alighted from the carriage and went to the front door without waiting for him or looking back on the second occasion he went out alone palefaced and very tired he walked quickly he gave a threepenny piece to the urchin who swept the crossing over great russell street and a shilling to the beggar on the corner of oxford street he walked to the jessop club and disappeared inside but he came out less than an hour later tellman followed him back to bedford square then tellman returned to bow street and went to pitts old files to read the case of the murders in the devils acre and the startling tragedy of christina balantyne it left him with a feeling of horror so intense the helplessness to affect it knotted inside his stomach the anger at the pain he could not reach the willful destruction and the loss he ate a brief supper without any pleasure in it his imagination in the dark alleys of the devils acre the blood on the cobbles but every now and then worse scenes intruded into his imagination frightened little girls children no older than pitts jemima screaming unheard except by other little girls cowering and just as helpless he wondered about christina balantyne and the general perhaps in his place he might have chosen solitary pursuits as well please god he would never be in such a place to know it was with a very different feeling that he followed balantyne the next morning when to tellmans amazement he met charlotte pitt on the steps of the british museum tellman felt like an intruder a voyeur as he saw the joy in balantynes face when he caught sight of her there was an acute vulnerability in him as if he cared intensely and dared not acknowledge it even to himself far less to her and watching her quick concern the direct way she met his gaze her complete candor tellman was suddenly aware that she had no idea of the nature or the depth of the generals feelings she was frightened for him it was clear in her face even had tellman not known that from gracie he could have guessed it watching her now they turned to go inside and without even considering any other possibility he followed them in then as charlotte glanced at a woman almost on her heels he realized with a sudden chill a feeling of almost nakedness that if she saw him she would recognize him instantly he dropped to one knee and bent his head as if to tie his bootlace causing the man behind him to trip and only regain his balance with difficulty and some ill temper the whole incident drew far more attention to him than if he had simply followed at a more discreet distance he was furious with himself from now on he must remain at the far side of any room and observe them by reflection in any of the glass cases that housed certain of the exhibits balantyne disregarded him he was interested only in charlotte but she would recognize tellman in profile perhaps even entirely from the back for some time he contrived to stay always behind a garrulous woman in black bombazine and watch as charlotte and balantyne moved from room to room speaking together pretending to look at the exhibits but seeing nothing she knew of the blackmail of the murder and was determined to fight to help him tellman had seen her like this before perhaps never caring quite so passionately but he knew her capacity to become involved every now and then as they moved to stand in front of an other case he was obliged to pretend to be absorbed in whatever was closest to him in this place a man alone would be conspicuous if he were not seen to be looking at something he found himself next to what was listed on the little plate as a carving from a palace in assyria seven centuries before christ there was an artists impression of how the whole building would have appeared he was amazed at the size of it it must have been magnificent he could not pronounce the name of the king who had ruled it it was surprisingly interesting one day he would come back here and look at it again when he had time to read more he could even bring gracie now he must follow after charlotte and balantyne he had nearly missed them he was beginning to understand why this case mattered to charlotte balantyne was none of the things tellman had thought of him which meant he had been mistaken full of misjudgments if he could be so wrong in his assumptions about balantyne what about all the other arrogant overprivileged people he had disliked and dismissed what about all his preconceptions what kind of an ignorant and prejudiced man did that make him one gracie would not want one who was angry with himself and confused he turned and walked away from the exhibition out of the museum and down the steps into the sun he had a great deal of thinking to do and his mind was in chaos his emotions even more so after what parthenope tannifer had told him pitt felt compelled to go and see cadell perhaps he had no idea more than any of the others who the blackmailer was but even the slightest chance could not be overlooked it was always possible he would be the first victim to be asked for something specific and he was certainly in a position of power from the foreign office he could affect the outcome of delicate negotiations in a number of areas it had occurred to pitt that perhaps one of the victims was more important to the blackmailer than the others that one was central to whatever purpose he had in mind and it could be to influence the government in some policy abroad or within the empire fortunes could be made and lost on such decisions events in africa alone were highly volatile where land and gold were concerned there were many to whom life was cheap let alone honor in the rush to explore to press even farther into that vast continent such men as cecil rhodes and others in his footsteps were used to thinking in terms of armies and nations a single mans wellbeing here or there might hardly be noticed pitt had never left england but he knew enough of those who had to understand that for both men and women on such fringes of everexpanding civilization death was around them frequent and sudden from violence or the many endemic diseases of tropical climates it was too easy in all the other extreme necessary changes to life and values to forget the notions of honor which were still powerful in england the stakes were so high they could dwarf individual considerations he had had to make an appointment to see cadell and it was two days after speaking with parthenope tannifer when he was admitted to his rooms in the foreign office then he was kept waiting nearly a quarter of an hour when finally he was shown in cadell rose from his desk with a puzzled look on his lean face he was not a handsome man but his features were regular enough and the lines of habitual expression were goodnatured even gentle however today he looked tired and harassed and obviously was unwilling to see pitt he was doing it only because pitt had insisted it was most urgent police business which could not wait nor could anyone else help him good morning er superintendent cadell said with a slight smile offering his hand and then almost immediately withdrawing it as if he had forgotten what the gesture had been for im sorry to rush you but i am due to see the german ambassador in twentyfive minutes i do apologize but it is a matter which cannot be delayed he indicated a very beautiful queen anne chair with crimson upholstery please sit down and tell me what i can do for you pitt accepted and began straightaway twentyfive minutes was very little indeed to explore such a delicate and painful matter but he knew cadell meant what he said then i will waste none of your time in civilities if you will excuse me he said meeting cadells eyes this is too grave a subject to leave partway through because other business calls cadell nodded pitt hated being so blunt but there was no alternative what i tell you is in confidence and i shall keep in confidence anything you say to me so far as i am able cadell nodded his gaze straight and unblinking if he had the slightest idea what pitt was going to say he was a superb actor but then as a diplomat perhaps he was several prominent men of position rather than of wealth are being blackmailed pitt said candidly cadells face tightened so slightly it could have been no more than a change in the bright light from the window he said nothing no one has been asked yet for money pitt continued the implication is that it may be influence or power that is demanded instead a sword is hanging over each of them and no one knows when it may drop or in precisely what manner to the best of my belief each man is innocent of the accusation but it is so subtle and so far in the past that not one of them can disprove it cadell let out his breath very slowly i see his eyes did not waver from pitts face they were so intent it was unnatural may i ask if guy stanley was one of them you may and yes he was pitt said levelly he saw cadells eyes widen and heard the very slight sound as he drew in his breath i see no i dont think you do pitt corrected he was not asked for anything except a relatively worthless silverplated flask as a token of submission more than anything else it was of no value of itself only symbolic of victory then why why was he exposed i dont know pitt admitted i would guess it is as a warning to the other victims a demonstration of power and of the will to use it cadell was sitting very still only his chest rising and falling as he breathed unnaturally slowly his fingers did not clench on the desk but they were stiff he was holding himself in control with a massive effort footsteps passed along the corridor and disappeared you are quite right he said at length i have no idea how you knew i was a victim as well perhaps i should not ask the suggestion made about me is disgusting and totally untrue but there are those who for their own reasons would be only too willing to believe it and repeat it it would ruin not only me but others as well even to deny it would suggest the idea to those to whom such a thought would never have occurred i am helpless but you have been asked for nothing so far pitt insisted nothing whatsoever not even a token of submission as you put it thank you for being so frank mr cadell would you describe the letter for me better still if you have it may i see it cadell shook his head i dont have it it was cut from newspaper i believe the times and glued on plain paper it was posted in the city exactly like the others pitt nodded will you keep me apprised of anything further you may receive or anything you consider could throw any light on this at all of course cadell stood up and ushered pitt to the door pitt left uncertain of whether cadell would tell him or not cadell was obviously a man of great selfcontrol deeply shaken by events unlike others he had not told pitt what the threat to him had been it must cut too sharply cause too deep a fear but then dunraithe white had told only vespasia he would not have told pitt he caught a hansom in whitehall and went straight to see cornwallis he found him at his desk amid a sea of papers apparently searching for something he looked up as soon as pitt came in he seemed glad to abandon his task his face showed the marks of tiredness and strain his eyes were redrimmed his skin papery shadowed on his cheeks and around his lips pitt felt a tug of pity for him and anger welled up driven by his own helplessness he knew that what he had to tell cornwallis now would make it worse morning pitt have you news cornwallis asked before the door was closed he looked closely at pitts face and understanding of failure came slowly into his eyes something in his body relaxed but it was not ease so much as despair a knowledge of being beaten again pitt sat down without being asked ive spoken with leo cadell at the foreign office mrs tannifer was right he is another victim just the same cornwallis looked at him sharply the foreign office yes but he hasnt been asked for anything not even a token cornwallis leaned forward over the desk and rubbed his hands over his brow up onto his smooth head thats a police commissioner a judge a junior minister in the home office a diplomat in the foreign office a city banker and a retired general what have we in common pitt he stared at him a flicker of desperation in his eyes ive racked my brains what could anybody want of us i went to see stanley poor devil so did i pitt said sinking back in the chair and crossing his legs he couldnt add anything he didnt defy the blackmailer cornwallis leaned forward the poor devil didnt have the chance i think we have to assume that his exposure was a demonstration of power to frighten the rest of us he waited to see if pitt would disagree when he did not cornwallis went on his voice lower catching a little i had another letter this morning essentially the same as the others a little shorter just told me id be blackballed from all my clubs thats only three but i value my memberships he was looking down at the disordered papers on the desk as if he could not bear the intrusion of meeting anyones eyes i i enjoy going there and being able to feel comfortable at least i did now god knows i loathe it i wouldnt go at all if i were not involved in certain duties i would not betray his lips tightened the sort of place where you would wander in if you felt like it or not visit for a year and it would be just the same as when you were last there big comfortable chairs always a fire in bad weather warm crackling i like the sound of a fire sort of a live thing like the sea around you like a ships crew stewards know you dont have to be told each time what you like can sit there for hours and read the papers if you feel like it or find some decent sort of chap to talk to if you fancy a spot of company i he looked away i care what they think of me pitt did not know what to say cornwallis was a lonely man without the love or the warmth the belonging or the responsibilities of a wife and children such as pitt had only servants waited for him in his rooms he could come and go as he pleased he was not needed or missed his freedom had a high price now there was no one to talk to him demand his attention or offer him comfort take his mind from his own fears and loneliness distract him from nightmares or give him companionship and the kind of love that does not depend upon circumstance cornwallis started pushing around the papers on his desk as if he were looking for something making what had been merely untidy into complete chaos white has resigned he said gazing at the shambles in front of him pitt was startled he had had no idea from the judiciary when cornwallis jerked his head up no from the jessop club although his voice was strained i suppose he might resign from the bench as well it would at least remove him from the power or the temptation to comply with this mans wishes if that is what they are he pushed his hand over his head again as if he had hair to thrust back although judging by his treatment of stanley he could be perfectly capable of then exposing white even more violently to warn the rest of us and surely white will have thought of that i dont know pitt said honestly cornwallis sighed no neither do i when i saw him at the club just before he resigned he looked appalling like a man who has read his own death warrant i sat in my chair like a fool pretending to read some damned newspaper you know i cant look at the times these days his fingers were fiddling with the letters notes and lists in front of him but idly not as if he had the faintest interest in what they were i looked at white and i knew what he was feeling i could practically read his thoughts they were so like my own he was ill with anxiety trying to suppress the fear in case anyone else guessed attempting to appear natural and all the time half looking over his shoulder wondering who else knew who thought he was behaving oddly who suspected thats one of the worst things of all pitt he looked up his face tense the skin shining across his cheekbones the mind racing away with thoughts you hate and cant stop people speak to you and you misinterpret every remark wondering if they mean something more by it you dont dare meet a friends eyes in case you see knowledge there loathing or worse that he should see the suspicion in yours suddenly he stood up and strode over to the window his back half turned to pitt i hate what i have allowed this to make me into and even as it happens i dont know how to stop it yesterday i met an old friend from the navy quite by chance i was crossing piccadilly and there he was he looked delighted and dodged in front of a brougham nearly being clipped by the wheels in order to see me my first thought was to wonder if he could be the blackmailer then i was so ashamed i couldnt look in his face pitt scrambled for anything to say that would be of comfort everything would be lies he could not say the man would have understood or would have forgiven does one forgive for being considered a blackmailer even for an instant if cornwallis had suspected pitt pitt could never have liked him the same way afterwards something irreparable would have been broken he should know pitt better than that blackmail was an abysmal sin cruel treacherous and above all the act of a coward cornwallis laughed abruptly thank you at least for not replying with some platitude that it doesnt matter or that he would never know or do no better himself he was still staring at the street below his back to the room it does matter and i wouldnt expect anyone to forgive i couldnt forgive any man who thought me capable of such a thing and worst of all whether anyone else knows i know it of myself im not what i thought i was i havent the judgment or the courage thats what i hate the most he turned to face pitt his back against the light hes shown me part of myself i would rather not have known and i dont like it it has to be someone who knows you pitt answered quietly or how would he have learned of that event sufficiently to twist it as he has cornwallis stood with his feet slightly apart braced as if against the pitch of a quarterdeck ive thought of that believe me pitt in the small hours ive walked the bedroom floor or lain on my back staring at the ceiling and thought of every man ive ever known from schooldays to the present i racked my brains to think of anyone to whom i might have been unjust intentionally or not anyone whose death or injury i could even have been perceived to have caused or contributed to he spread his hands jerkily i cant even think of anything i have in common with the others i barely know balantyne to speak to we are both members of the jessop club and of a services club in the strand but i know a hundred other people at least as well i dont suppose ive spoken to him directly above a dozen times but you know dunraithe white pitt was searching his mind also yes but not well cornwallis looked mystified weve dined a few times hes traveled a little and we fell into conversation about something or other i cant even remember what now i liked him he was agreeable fond of his garden i think we spoke of roses his wife is clever with space and color he was obviously devoted to her i liked it in him cornwalliss face softened for a moment as he recalled the incident i dined with him again another time he was held in town late some legal matter he would have preferred to go home but he couldnt his decisions have been erratic lately pitt said remembering what vespasia had told him are you sure cornwallis was quick to question have you looked into it who says so with anyone else pitt would have hesitated to answer thinking discretion better but with cornwallis he had no secrets in this theloneus quade quade cornwallis was startled surely he is not another victim god in heaven what are we coming to quade is as honorable a man as any i know of no hes not a victim pitt said hastily it was he who noticed whites opinions lately and became concerned lady vespasia cumminggould approached white because of it oh i see cornwallis bit his lip he frowned walking back towards the desk and staring moodily at the tossed piles of paper he turned to pitt do you think his erratic judgments are born of his anxiety over the blackmail for fear of what will happen next what he will be asked for or could it be the price he is paying to the blackmailer and somewhere among the eccentric decisions is the one that matters the one this is all about pitt considered it seriously the thought had occurred to him before briefly he had given less weight to it only because he was so overwhelmingly concerned about cornwallis it could be the latter he replied are you sure that is not the connection between you a case in which you both have some part but if it is then where are the others involved cornwallis asked is it political stanley is already ruined his part hardly matters now or does it was it always part of this plan to destroy his power to prevent him from obtaining the position he sought he jerked his hands wide and cadell is there a foreign power involved tannifers bank certainly deals with many european banks enormous amounts of money could be concerned balantyne fought in africa could that be it his voice rose a tone suddenly an edge of eagerness in it could it be to do with the financing of diamonds or gold in south africa or simply land perhaps expeditions inland to claim whole new tracts like mashonaland or matabeleland or some discovery we know nothing of balantyne served most of his time in india pitt said thoughtfully turning it over in his mind his only african experience that i know of was abyssinia and thats the other end of the continent cornwallis pulled his chair around and sat on it staring at pitt leaning forward a capetocairo railroad think of the money involved it would be the biggest thing of the coming century the african continent is an entire new world pitt caught a glimpse of the vision but it stayed on the edge of his mind just beyond clarity but certainly it was a fortune a power for which many men would kill let alone blackmail cornwallis was staring at him his face dark with the enormity of what he perceived his voice was urgent when he spoke pitt we have to solve this not just for me or for any of the individual men it may ruin this could be far more widely reaching than a few lives made or lost it could be a corruption which could alter the course of history for god knows how many he leaned farther forward his eyes intense once any of us yields to the threat and does something that really is wrong perhaps criminal perhaps even treasonous then his hold is complete and he could ask anything and we would have no escape except death yes i know pitt agreed seeing an abyss of corruption open up in front of him every man suffering alone driven by fear exhaustion suspicion on every hand until he could bear the pressure no longer simple murder would have been less cruel but rage was a waste of energy possibly exactly what the blackmailer wanted useless timeconsuming clouding the mind pitt composed himself with an effort ill look into all dunraithe whites cases over the last year or so and all those scheduled to come before him as far in the future as is known tell me cornwallis demanded sharply you had better report every day so we can compare what we know at the moment we are in the dark we dont even know in which direction to begin it could be fraud or embezzlement or a simple murder that appears domestic there must be money or it wouldnt involve tannifer and some foreign interest for cadell and possibly balantyne his voice sharpened and he raised his hand banging his forefinger on the desk mercenaries a private army perhaps balantyne knows the man who would recruit for it or lead it he might have knowledge he does not even realize and some criminal case that white and i are both concerned with or that i may become concerned with perhaps we are beginning to understand something pitt there was hope in his eyes i could have asked white myself but hes resigned from the jessop and i dont have the opportunity to speak to him casually anymore and balantyne only comes for the committee meetings i think he hates it as much as i do the man looks as if he hasnt had a decent nights sleep in weeks pitt forbore from saying that cornwallis looked the same cadell less so cornwallis added rising to his feet again but then i suppose it is a week or so since i saw him before poor stanley was ruined you know cadell pitt said quickly he had not been aware of that although it should not surprise him society was small hundreds of men belonged to a mere handful of clubs and associations cornwallis shrugged slightly he was on the committee at the club its a group who meet every so often to do with a charity for orphans its the only reason i go now cant let them down pitt rose also ill start to look into dunraithe whites cases i think that is where well find the link it must be something in the recent past or on the calendar for the future i think the future is more likely good let me know the moment you find anything however tentative cornwallis urged i might be able to see the connection before you do pitt agreed again and left to begin collecting a list of all the current investigations over which cornwallis had a general authority then armed with a brief note of introduction and explanation he took a hansom to the old bailey courthouse the afternoon had gained him a list of cases but it was bare information and there were several pending with which both cornwallis and white had some connection even if tenuous what he needed was an informed opinion preferably that of someone who was aware of the situation theloneus quade was the obvious choice pitt had no idea where he lived and to approach him in court where he was presiding would be difficult and possibly unwise six oclock in the evening found him on vespasias doorstep have you news she asked him when he was shown into the withdrawing room where she was sitting in the lateafternoon sun reading the newspaper she put the paper down immediately not merely from good manners but from a very real concern the small blackandwhite dog at her feet opened one eye to make sure he was who she thought he was then satisfied closed it again and went back to sleep not really he replied glancing at the times where she had let it fall she had been following the tranby croft affair black letters proclaimed that the verdict had been brought in guilty pitt found it strangely chilling he had no idea whether sir william gordoncumming had been guilty of cheating or not but that a simple matter of dishonor at cards should have escalated into a formal court case involving so many people in conflicting testimony which had now laid bare hatred and national scandal was a tragedy and it was one which need not have happened there was too much that was beyond human ability to avoid it was absurd that this should have reached such a stage i suppose the prince of wales at least will be relieved it is over he said aloud vespasia glanced at the paper half on the floor her face was bleak with disgust one presumes so she said coldly this is the first day of the ascot races he did not stay in court to hear the verdict lady drury called by on her way home she told me he drove to the royal box accompanied by lady brooke which was tactless to say the least and was met by boos and hisses from the crowd pitt remembered vespasias dislike of craning her neck to look up at him and accordingly sat down what will happen to gordoncumming he asked she replied unhesitatingly he will be dismissed from the army expelled from all his clubs and boycotted from society in general he will be fortunate if anyone continues an acquaintance with him her face was difficult to read there was a sharp pity in it but she could have considered him guilty and still felt that pitt knew her well enough to realize how complex were her emotions she belonged to a generation to which honor was paramount and the prince of waless own gambling and selfindulgent manner of life were not excused by his royal status in fact it made them the more reprehensible she was of the same generation as victoria herself but from all he had heard as unlike her in nature as possible although they had lived through the same epoch of history do you think he was guilty he asked she opened her amazing silvergray eyes wide her perfectly arched brows barely moving i have considered it carefully for reasons relating to the problem facing us it serves as something of a measure of public opinion at least that part of it which would be of concern to men like dunraithe white and brandon balantyne she frowned slightly looking directly at pitt it seems undeniable his method of placing his wager was ill advised most particularly in the company in which he found himself the expression in her eyes was impossible to read no one comes out of this well neither man nor woman there has been a suggestion not entirely absurd that the whole matter was deliberately brought about in order to discredit gordoncumming and thus disqualify him as a rival of the princes for the affections of frances brooke the lady brooke with whom the prince arrived at ascot today pitt asked surprised it seemed either extremely stupid or unnecessarily arrogant and possibly both the same she agreed dryly i have no idea whether it is true but the fact that it can be suggested is indicative of opinion innocent he said quietly i dont know she replied the jury apparently took only fifteen minutes to reach their decision it was greeted by jeers and hisses also but after the summation given by the judge little else was possible to save the prince he asked she gave a very slight gesture of despair that seems unarguable then it has no bearing upon our situation she smiled very slightly other things will have my dear thomas public opinion is a very fickle animal and i fear our blackmailer has great skill he has chosen his subjects far too well for us to delude ourselves that he is likely to make mistakes to answer your question yes i think poor gordoncumming may well have been innocent i have looked through all the possible cases where there might be a connection between cornwallis and dunraithe white he said thoughtfully reverting back to the reason for which he had come a very ugly fear is in the back of my mind that the conspiracy may be a great deal more ambitious than i imagined to begin with nothing to do with simple payment of money but the corruption of power he watched her face as he spoke seeking to read whether she found his thought absurd he saw only the greatest gravity to do with expansion in africa perhaps that is the area involving all the people we know about which comes most easily to mind indeed she nodded of course we do not know who else may be concerned that is one of the most frightening aspects of this case there may be other members of government or the judiciary or any other area of power or influence but i agree africa does seem likely the amounts of money to be gained there at present are beyond the dreams of most of us i think mr rhodes may end up building little short of his own empire and throughout history people have been dazzled by the prospects of gold it seems to breed a kind of madness he brought out the piece of paper on which he had written the names of the cases in which cornwallis and dunraithe white were both involved there were only five he showed it to her she picked up her lorgnette to read his handwriting what do you need she asked when she had finished to know more about them yes white would not tell me because he intends to yield to the blackmailer you told me that yourself i should prefer not to ask cornwallis because i believe he is politically naive and i would also rather not compromise him should we not be able to prevent the matter from becoming public he felt a weight inside himself a heaviness of foreboding it was not easy to dispel even here in this calm sunlit room with which he had become so pleasantly familiar i must be able to help him if it should come to that you do not need to explain it to me thomas she said quietly i understand the nature of suspicion and of honor she met his gaze steadily i think perhaps that you should speak to theloneus what he does not know already he will be able to learn he is as deeply worried by this as we are he also fears it may be a political plan of farreaching nature with high and irrevocable stakes involved we shall call upon him unless of course you feel it wiser to go alone there was no shadow of personal hurt or affront in her silver eyes he answered honestly i should value your judgment you may think to ask him questions i would have missed she nodded her assent she was grateful she loved to be involved her intellect and her curiosity were as sharp as ever and the foibles of society had bored her for years she knew them all so well she could predict them only the rarest most genuine eccentric still awoke her interest or amusement but of course she would not say so she merely smiled and asked pitt if he would care for dinner first which he accepted asking permission to use the telephone to let charlotte know that he would not be home of course there are many possibilities theloneus quade said as they sat in the lateevening sun in his quiet library the small summer garden beyond the window filled with the sounds of birdsong and of falling water from a stone fountain the long light was apricotgold on the fullblown roses and a white clematis shone in a flash of silver tannifer may be pressured to grant a loan which he is aware cannot be satisfactorily guaranteed he continued earnestly or indeed repaid or to overlook dealings which are fraudulent not to investigate accounts when there has been embezzlement i know pitt sat back in the comfortable chair the room was quiet charming and full of individual touches he had noticed books on a wide variety of subjects as he came in the fall of byzantium chinese porcelain a history of the tsars of russia the poetry of dante and of william blake and a dozen other unrelated subjects and on the wall a watercolor of ships by bonington which he thought was probably quite valuable certainly it was very lovely it could also be someone who has already committed some act for which he will shortly be tried theloneus went on and he hopes to subvert the cause of justice possibly without being aware of it the other victims may be in some way witnesses to it and he believes they may be suborned by the threat of disclosure or their testimony invalidated by their own ruin he looked at pitt steadily the question in his eyes his features were mild sensitive but there was an acute intelligence in him which burned through and only a foolish man would mistake his quiet voice his outward gentleness for any weakness of courage or intent ive not found any connection between all the victims we know of pitt explained they do not seem to have any common interest or background they have only the slightest acquaintance as all london of a certain social level has there are a limited number of gentlemens clubs the museum the national geographic society the theater the opera the races the same round of social events even so they do not have any interest in common i can find or any specific acquaintance that does not equally include a thousand others and no one has yet been asked for money theloneus said i am not certain pitt thought of cadell it is possible cadell of the foreign office may have he told him of parthenope tannifers information and his own visit to cadell and his denial theloneus remained silent for several moments turning it over in his mind outside the light was fading the lawn was already in shadow and there was a flush of gold across the sky i cannot help feeling that it is more than money vespasia interrupted the silence money could more easily be extracted by slow and reasonable threats and a means of payment made more obvious the pattern does not seem to be right pitt turned in his chair to look at her her face was very grave in the slanting light which was gentler than the white clarity of morning it lent a glow to the beauty of her bones still exquisite untouched by the years her hair could almost have been gold rather than silver i am inclined to agree with you theloneus said at last the exercise of power is so deliberate i feel there will be something asked for which will be repugnant to each man we know of but by the time the demand is made he will be so weakened by the tension the fear and the exhaustion that he will not be able to summon the strength to resist he will be prepared to do almost whatever he is asked even something he would normally refuse without consideration what concerns me vespasia said with a frown is why brandon balantyne was the one chosen for the dramatic and rather extreme measure of having a corpse placed upon his doorstep she looked from pitt to theloneus and back again that was bound to bring the police into this affair why did our blackmailer wish that one would have thought it would be the last thing he desired that puzzles me also pitt confessed except it would seem that possibly some extreme pressure was desired upon balantyne but why i have no idea i suppose it is not coincidental theloneus asked could it be merely fortuitous that poor albert cole died where he did no pitt realized he had not told them about tellmans discovery he saw their surprise at his certainty no its not coincidence he said tellman has been working on it we assumed it was albert cole because of the bill for socks which certainly seemed to be his the lawyer from lincolns inn fields identified him as cole he had their total attention they both leaned forward eyes fixed upon his face but it turns out it was a petty thief by the name of josiah slingsby he continued who quarreled with his accomplice ernest wallace a man with a violent temper and wallace killed him and left him in bedford square vespasia said in amazement they were burgling bedford square theloneus concluded they stole the snuffbox from balantyne no you said he admitted giving it to the blackmailer thomas my dear friend this makes no sense whatever you had better explain yourself again we have missed something to begin with where is the real albert cole no wallace did not kill slingsby in bedford square pitt answered or anywhere near it they quarreled in an alley in shoreditch and he left slingsby exactly where he fell and ran away he swears he never went anywhere near bedford square and tellman believed him so do i and the receipt for socks theloneus asked did he know albert cole he says not and there seems no reason to suppose he did and what does cole say we havent found cole i have tellman looking for him then someone else took slingsbys body placed albert coles receipt on it and left it on balantynes doorstep vespasia said with a shiver she could not control surely there can be no other conclusion than an intention to embarrass brandon balantyne possibly even to have him arrested for murder you did not add my dear that it must be the blackmailer theloneus reminded her since he placed the pinchbeck snuffbox in the dead mans pocket as well she looked from theloneus to pitt why under arrest balantyne could neither pay money nor exert influence corrupt or otherwise then that brings to ones mind the only other alternative theloneus reasoned he may wish balantyne removed so he cannot have an effect upon whatever it is he is planning to do perhaps he tried to corrupt him and failed and this is his way of neutralizing his ability to affect the issue which brings us back to the most urgent need to learn what the issue is pitt said helplessly we dont know we have found nothing in common between them all mr quade he produced the list of cases and handed it to theloneus can you tell me anything about these they are all the charges in which cornwallis was concerned and are due to be heard before dunraithe white is there anything in any of these which could involve the others however indirectly theloneus studied the list very carefully and pitt and vespasia remained silent while he did so outside the light was dying more swiftly the roses were a pale blur only the tops of the trees were golden a poplar looked like a shimmering spire as the sunset breeze caught and turned its leaves a cloud of starlings whirled up into the air black against the deep soft blue of the sky the hustle and squalor of the city was only a matter of yards away the other side of a high stone wall but it could have been another land the clock in the hall chimed the half hour some of these cases are merely sad theloneus said at last people who have allowed shortsighted greed to sweep away their better judgment individual crimes which will bring down the families of the men concerned but no more there is a sense in which it is already inevitable and nothing cornwallis or white will do can change that an able barrister may mitigate the sentence by pleading the circumstances showing the accused in a more human light but the verdict will be the same and the others pitt pressed that is a domestic murder it is unlikely to implicate anyone else but not impossible the woman was beautiful and very liberal with her favors other men may be implicated but i find it difficult to believe blackmail will help the accused husband and since he is in prison awaiting trial it would have to be accomplished for him by someone else he does have two loyal and ambitious brothers it is not impossible could it involve all our blackmail victims pitt said dubiously if you are referring to laetitia charles then most certainly not vespasia said tartly certainly she was at the very kindest a woman of overgenerous affections she was also earthy in her tastes very frank to the point of vulgarity and had an uproarious sense of the absurd frequently at the cost of her admirersand of her husband she shrugged her thin shoulders very slightly in the shadows her face was unreadable she would have terrified the life from a man like captain cornwallis and he would have bored her to weeping leo cadell would have had more of a sense of selfpreservation than to have had anything to do with her even socially and dunraithe white has never looked at another woman in his life even if he had wanted to and i concede that he may his sense of honor would crucify him if he had and i at least would know of it theloneus smiled bleakly you are probably right my dear that leaves two cases of fraud and embezzlement both for very large sums of money one involves international banking in europegermany to be preciseand the transfer of funds to a very questionable enterprise in south africa the other is an attempt to pass forged bonds and deeds to mines again in africa could they be connected to each other pitt asked quickly not on the surface but it is possible theloneus regarded the paper again one would have to know who purchased the bonds it is conceivable that it may concern all our victims where in africa pitt pressed as i recall several places theloneus frowned i think it may bear further investigation the case is not complete yet the trial lies some time in the future is it still under investigation pitt asked with a sinking in his stomach by whom superintendent springer theloneus replied reporting to cornwallis he regarded pitt steadily a sadness in his eyes and in the lines of his face but he would not look away nor temper the perception that was all too plainly in his mind i see pitt said slowly hating himself for the thoughts he could not dismiss vespasia was watching him also less easy to see clearly in the half darkness as no one had wished to light the gaslamps the last of the day was slipping away rapidly the rustle of the poplar leaves sounded through the open windows like breaking waves on a shore far away theloneus said it for him of course it is a possibility cornwallis may be pressed to abandon the case to order springer to withdraw from it discontinue investigation somehow contaminate the evidence and dunraithe white may similarly be pressed to render an eccentric or perverse decision would that not cause a mistrial pitt asked only if there was a verdict of guilty theloneus replied the crown does not have the right to appeal against an acquittal if it did cases might never end of course pitt had not been thinking clearly the idea of cornwallis in such a situationthat in fact he might already be compromisedwas even more painful than he had expected he had said nothing but he was a uniquely lonely man used to the isolation of command at sea where he could never confide in anyone or his power to lead would be damaged beyond repair the captain was as alone on the quarter deck as if he were the only man on the face of the ocean the slightest weakness indecision possibility of ignorance or error and his position was forfeit everything in the structure of rank obligation and privilege conspired to make it so it was the only way someone could survive in an element which obeyed only its own rules and knew neither thought nor mercy cornwallis could not change in a few short years perhaps not ever when he faced danger he would revert to the skills he knew the ones that had carried him through countless perils before it was an instinct he probably could not have helped even had he wanted to is tannifer involved pitt asked thinking of parthenope and her fierce loyalty it is embezzlement it is possible theloneus answered cadell pitt went on african funds the foreign office may be concerned balantyne i cant see how but there is much yet to be uncovered i see pitt stood up slowly thank you very much for your time and your thoughts vespasia leaned forward to rise and theloneus offered her his arm she took it but lightly as a gesture not an assistance i am afraid we have not helped have we she said to pitt i am sorry thomas the roads of friendship are sometimes strewn with many pitfalls and some of them can hurt a great deal i wish i could say cornwallis will not fail but it would be a lie and you would know it nor can i say that even with the utmost courage and honor he will not be hurt but we shall not cease to fight with the very few and inadequate weapons we have to hand i know that he smiled at her we are not beaten yet she gave a very slight smile back but was too tense to argue they parted from theloneus leaving him standing in the lighted doorway and drove home in her carriage through the lamplit streets neither feeling it necessary to speak any further the following morning pitt went to see cornwallis he was torn between the personal loyalties of friendship and the necessities of his duty to pursue knowledge to its end whether cornwallis understood that or not he could not deliberately fail in it and remain of use to either of them cornwallis was pacing the floor again he swung around and stopped as pitt came in almost as if he had been caught in some nefarious act he looked as if he had not eaten properly or slept well in days his eyes were sunken into his head and for the first time since pitt had known him his jacket did not sit smoothly on his shoulders i have had another letter he said baldly this morning he waited for pitt to ask what was in it pitt felt his stomach lurch and his body go cold this was the demand at last he could see it in cornwalliss eyes what does he want he tried not to betray his knowledge cornwalliss voice was rough as if his throat were sore and he spoke with difficulty that i should drop a case he replied if i dont then the hms venture matter will be exposed in every newspaper in london i could deny it all i wished but there would always be those who believed those who doubted my version of events i i should be blackballed from my clubs perhaps even lose my naval rank and standing look what happened to gordoncumming and for far less his face was ashen and he controlled his hands from trembling only by supreme effort of will which case pitt asked waiting for him to say the embezzlement that springer commanded this case cornwallis frowned the blackmail investigation the truth about slingsby and the bedford square murder who put the body on balantynes steps what in gods name does the man want from us his voice was rising in spite of himself a note of panic creeping in the room seemed to swim with the sunlight blazing in through the open window the noise of traffic in the street below rose like thunder but you wont pitt said forcing the words through stiff lips a faint patch of color blushed up cornwalliss haggard cheeks something in his mouth softened no of course not he said with intense choking emotion it seemed to take him by surprise as if he had not thought he could feel so passionately about anything no pitt of course i wont he seemed about to add something more a word of thanks for having assumed so much but at the last moment the words were too open too intimate an acknowledgment of friendship of vulnerability it was all better understood where it could be glossed over later men did not say such things to each other naturally pitt shoved his hands down inside his pockets at least it gives us something further to look into a better place to begin he must say something trivial and matteroffact it did not really matter what i think ill go and see cadell again yes cornwallis agreed yes of course let me know what you learn pitt went to the door i might see balantyne too he added as he went out ill tell you if theres anything pitt had been late home the previous evening but even so he had wanted to tell charlotte what he had learned and the troubling thoughts he could not still in his mind she had been more than willing to listen not only in concern for his feelings but because she wished intensely to know for herself they had sat talking long after midnight unable to let go of the anxiety and the need to share it with each other this morning she was more than ever concerned for general balantyne it seemed he was targeted by the blackmailer in a more personal and specific way than any of the other victims pitt had very carefully refrained from saying that had the murder of josiah slingsby been blamed upon him he would have been effectively removed from complying with the blackmailers demands either for money or for the exercise of influence nevertheless she had understood it perfectly clearly therefore it followed that what he wanted might not be anything balantyne could give but rather his destruction not an act but the inability to act and either ruin or death would serve the same end pitt had skirted around it being so careful trying not to hurt her but the thought was inevitable once the train of ideas was begun it was a brilliantly sunny day but fortunately a little cooler at last there was a breath of breeze to break the suffocation of the heat wave it was too pleasant to be inside if one did not have to she had agreed to meet balantyne in the british museum as before but was delighted when a boy on a bicycle brought a note to the door asking if she would find it acceptable to meet at the gate of the royal botanical gardens in regents park instead she wrote a hasty answer that she would be happy to accordingly at eleven oclock dressed in deep pink and wearing one of vespasias most extravagant hats she was standing in the sun just inside the gates watching the passersby it was an occupation which in small amounts she found most interesting she imagined who they were and what sort of homes and lives they had left this morning why they might have come here whom to meet there were the obvious lovers strolling arm in arm whispering to each other and laughing seeing no one else there were those less open pretending they were merely friends and had met by chance being elaborately inconsequential several young girls in pastel dresses passed by giggling huddled close together swinging their petticoats eyeing the young men and trying to look as if they werent their muslin skirts drifted in the slightest breeze their hair gleamed the blood warm in their cheeks two young soldiers paraded by in uniform dashing and elegant charlotte could not help thinking that probably in ordinary browns and grays they would have looked like any other clerks or apprentices the bravado made all the difference she smiled as she watched them they had a kind of brash innocence had balantyne once been like that thirty years ago it was impossible to imagine him so young so callow and unaware an elderly lady came past dressed in lavender perhaps she was in halfmourning or maybe she merely liked the color she walked slowly her entire attention upon the flowers profuse and dazzling in their beauty although charlotte was waiting for balantyne she did not see him until he was at her elbow good morning he said startling her they are beautiful arent they she realized he was speaking about the roses oh yes marvelous she was suddenly completely uninterested in them in the bright sunlight the weariness showed in his face the network of fine lines about his eyes and mouth the shadows from too little sleep how are you he continued looking at her as if the answer mattered to him greatly let us walk she suggested reaching to take his arm he offered it unhesitatingly i am very well she answered as they passed between the flower beds just another two people among the many but the situation is hardly better in fact i am afraid it is worse she felt his arm tighten under her hand there have been very curious developments which have not been in the newspapers it is proved beyond doubt that the body was not that of albert cole at all but a petty thief from shoreditch called josiah slingsby he stopped and swung around to stare at her but that makes no sense he protested did he steal the snuffbox from whom he cannot have been the blackmailer i received another letter this morning she had known more would come and yet she still felt a shock as if someone had struck her he had touched them again closely personally had reminded them of his reality his power to act to hurt them what did he say she found the words awkward her lips dry the same he answered beginning to walk again in the shelter they had lost the breeze and the perfume of the roses was heavy dizzying in the sun did he still not ask for anything she pressed she wished he would waiting for the blow to fall was almost worse than facing it when it did but then that was presumably a large part of the plan the weakening the fear the wearing down before the attack no he faced straight ahead avoiding looking at her there is still no request for money or anything else i have lost count of the hours i have lain awake trying to imagine what he could wish of me i have thought of every area in which i could act or have influence of every person i know whose behavior i could affect for good or ill and i can think of nothing she hated the thought but it must be faced if it were to be fought against is there anyone in whose path of promotion or gain you are standing militarily he laughed with a sharp desperate sound hardly i am retired i have no title or wealth that should pass to anyone but brandy and he could not be behind this you know that as well as i any other position social or financial she pressed any elected office he smiled i am president of an explorers club which meets once a quarter and tells each other stories greatly embellished by imagination and wishful thinking entirely for entertainment we are all of us over fifty and many over sixty we live in the glory and the color of our past exploits we remember africa when it truly was a dark continent full of mystery and adventure we traveled for love of the unknown long before anyone thought of it in connection with investment and the extension of empire but you have knowledge of it real knowledge from having been there she pressed of course but i cannot think it is of any use to presentday explorers and financiers he frowned do you think this has anything to do with africa thomas does at least he holds it as a possibility greataunt vespasia believes it is a very powerful conspiracy and great profit for someone lies at the root of it they were passing other flower beds now which were brilliant with color and perfume the drone of bees was audible above the swish of skirts and a faint murmur of conversation that seems likely he answered any other offices she asked i was president of a society promoting young artists but my term finished last year his voice emphasized the triviality of it other than that newly being a member of a group within the jessop club that raises finances for an orphanage i cannot imagine anyone desiring to take my place in that it is hardly exclusive anyway i believe anyone who wished to join it would be welcomed it doesnt sound like the sort of thing one would commit blackmail to achieve she agreed they walked in silence for a hundred yards or so across the pathway which circled the gardens and out into the main part of regents park the sun was growing hotter and the breeze had dropped somewhere in the distance a band was playing i dont think the fact that the body is that of slingsby and not cole has made any difference to the polices believing i could have been responsible for his death he said at length i suppose he could have been running errands for the blackmailer as easily as anyone else you say he was a thief yes from shoreditch nowhere near bedford square she said quickly he was killed in shoreditch by his accomplice thomas knows it had nothing to do with you at all then why is his sergeant still making enquiries about me to learn what the blackmailer wants she said with conviction it must be some influence you have some power or information what have you in common with the other victims he smiled bleakly a flash of hard humor since i dont know who they are i cannot even guess oh she was taken aback yes of course they are a banker a diplomat sir guy stanley of course you know she saw the wince of pity in his face but went on a judge should she mention cornwallis or not pitt might prefer she did not but the situation was too serious for secrets that were largely a matter of saving embarrassment and an assistant commissioner of police he looked at her cornwallis he said softly i dont expect you to answer that of course im sorry hes a very decent man you know him well no very slightly simply members of the same club two clubs actually always thought him a good fellow very straightforward again he lapsed into silence for several yards i knew guy stanley too not well but i liked him you are speaking of him in the past his face tightened so i am im sorry that is inexcusable ive been thinking about him a lot since that news broke poor devil he shivered a little and hunched his shoulders knotting the muscles as if he were cold in spite of the sun i called on him wanted to tell him i dont know perhaps only what you came to me to say that i still regarded him as my friend i dont think him guilty of that charge but i have no idea if he believed me a dog scampered across their path carrying a stick in its mouth he stared straight ahead perhaps i should have had the courage to tell him i was a victim of the same blackmail but i couldnt bring myself to tell even him what it accused me of i do not admire myself for that i wish now that i had then he might have known i believed him but i suppose if i were honest i was afraid he would not believe me he swung around to face her again that is the thing i am not sure of anybody anymore i mistrust where i would never have thought of it even a month ago people offer me decency friendship kindness and i look at them and doubt i try to see motives behind which are ugliness and duplicity double meanings to remarks that are made in innocence i am tainting even the good that i have she squeezed his arm more tightly standing close to him in the bright light the feathers of her hat fluttered in the breeze almost close enough to him to touch his cheek you must keep not only your head but also your heart she said gently you know it is not true you must think better of us than to imagine we are so easily misled or so quick to be cruel she made herself smile you have only one enemy that we know of and even he does not actually believe it is true he knows better the wind caught a loose strand of her hair and blew it across her brow thank you he said very quietly it was little more than a breath then he put out his hand and pushed the hair back where it had come from under the brim of vespasias hat in that one gesture he had committed himself and he knew it in this isolated moment in the sun it did not matter tomorrow perhaps it would but today could not be taken from the memory she felt a moment of sweetness and pain and a realization that she was guilty of a wild kind of carelessness that she had never intended and could similarly never be undone a little way off a woman with a blue parasol laughed two little boys chased each other tumbling in the grass and getting happily dirty she must start to walk again say something natural as i mentioned aunt vespasia thinks it may have something to do with africa she remarked the situation there is so volatile with fortunes to be made and lost she is right he agreed also beginning to move forward his mind returned to the matter in hand that would explain the various men he has apparently chosen the capetocairo railway she suggested they discussed african politics for some time cecil rhodes and the expansion northwards the possibilities of vast quantities of gold to be discovered land diamonds the conflicting interests of other european countries most particularly germany but by noon when they parted they were no closer to knowing what any such political adventurers could demand of balantyne or anything he knew which could stand in any mans way to the fortunes to be exploited in africa or anywhere else while charlotte was in the royal botanical gardens talking to balantyne pitt returned to see sigmund tannifer at his request he found him in a grave mood and this time parthenope was not present i have discussed this with my wife tannifer said as soon as the formalities had been met and he and pitt were sitting facing each other in his handsome rather ornate study we have given a great deal of thought to who may be involved and even more as to what they may demand of me when they finally reach that stage he also appeared haggard and as if his nerves were stretched almost to the breaking point his left hand constantly fidgeted and pitt noticed that the crystal decanter on the chiffonier behind him was less than a quarter full of brandy he would not have blamed any man in these circumstances for seeking a little extra comfort and you have some conclusion he asked aloud tannifer bit his lip not really conclusions superintendent more speculation i would like to put before you he gave a half smile perhaps i am looking for excuses to speak with you obtain some reassurance i fear it is rather like pulling the dressing off a wound to see if it is healing or not he shrugged his heavy shoulders it was an oddly defeated gesture it doesnt help in the slightest neither the wound itself nor ones ease of mind and yet the compulsion is irresistible pitt understood perfectly and what are your thoughts mr tannifer tannifer looked slightly selfconscious i am not trying to usurp your office superintendent i am sure you know far more about it than i do but i was considering all the areas in which i might have some ability to act and which could be misused to someone elses advantage his fingers drummed silently on the arm of his chair it always comes back to finance of some sort he stopped regarding pitt gravely pitt nodded indicating that he understood but he did not interrupt tannifer could not hide his nervousness the first thing that came to my mind was to wonder what we may have in common of course i do not know the identities of the other victims beyond what i may deduce with a little common sense poor guy stanley is obvious although since in his case the threat has been carried out his fingers increased in their rhythm of drumming on the chair arm and i can assume brandon balantyne he waited to see if pitt would confirm it or if he could read it from his expression his lips tightened apparently he could and as i believe my wife mentionedshe told me she had spoken with youi am certain in my own mind that leo cadell is also threatened in the same way he believes he will be asked for money at least that is the impression he has given me but i have never thought that was at the root of the blackmailers aim pitt nodded you agree tannifer said quickly his voice gaining strength i am sure we are right i have been making certain very discreet enquiries into their affairs and thinking back upon my own responsibilities it is within my powers to grant very large loans for investment in certain areas most particularly land and the development of mining for precious metals such as gold pitt found himself sitting a trifle more upright in spite of his intention to not betray any of his own feelings if tannifer noticed he did not show it he sat slumped in his own chair his face heavy with concentration it would be corrupt of me to agree to such loans without proper security he said thoughtfully but not beyond my actual power in seeking to learn which areas might be involved so as to decide who might be concerned i looked into leo cadells recent travels and what i could discover with discreet enquiry of his interests he was watching pitt with intense concentration in all cases superintendent they centered in africa the possibility is barely realized of the enormous treasure lying in the areas cecil rhodes is developing a man who could involve himself now could in the next twenty years amass a kings ransom and perhaps build himself an empire it was what vespasia and theloneus quade had feared now tannifer was saying virtually the same thing tannifer was watching pitt acutely his eyes unblinking his shoulders hunched i see you follow me perfectly he took a deep breath i was speaking with cadell and he let slip a remark which leads me to believe that mr justice dunraithe white might be another victim pitt was startled how could cadell have known that was it observation of whites erratic behavior or the emotional strain under which he labored almost to the verge of illness perhaps it was not so difficult to detect a fellow victim being acutely aware of ones own suffering i cannot comment pitt said quietly but you may assume that at least one judge is involved does that make your deductions any plainer i am not sure i see it very murkily i admit tannifer smiled grimly perhaps i am wasting your time but i find it almost impossible to sit and wait until the blow falls and do nothing to try to ward against it he seemed embarrassed uncertain how to continue and yet obviously there was something further he wanted to say be frank mr tannifer pitt urged if you are correct then this conspiracy is wide and deep and the effects if it succeeds will be far greater than the ruin of a few good men and their families tannifer looked down i know it is only some feelings for the privacy of others which hold me and perhaps at this stage such delicacy is misplaced he looked up quickly cadell indicated to me that there was some incident in the naval career of assistant commissioner cornwallis which could be open to misinterpretation and therefore to the same kind of pressure as is being exerted upon me he was watching pitt with acute concern i am deeply afraid that the blackmailer may attempt to have this whole enquiry dropped in order to protect himself perhaps cornwallis could not further his african ambitions but he might be persuaded to manacle you he let out his breath in a heavy sigh this is hideous everywhere we turn we are faced with blind alleys and new threats pitt made some sign of assent but his mind was racing on the remark tannifer had made about cadell without realizing its importance the incident in cornwalliss naval career was not questionable only the blackmailer had seen it as such tannifer would not know that but pitt did he must not betray his understanding it is a profound danger pitt said and he had no need to invest his expression of face and voice with any false anxiety the fear was very real his regard for cornwallis made it the more painful because he could foresee it happening it was the next obvious step for the blackmailer and he now knew cornwallis would suffer perhaps already was suffering if it happened would he even tell pitt he hated himself for allowing the thought to enter his mind but it was there like a knife pricking him at every turn and surprising in its painfulness but you will not permit it to prevent you tannifer said huskily you will he let the rest of the sentence fall away pitt did not answer what would he do if cornwallis were threatened in such a way and if he asked pitt to protect him he had not doubted cornwalliss innocence would he allow him to be ruined shamed publicly driven from all he valued he could not honestly make such promises tannifer looked away it is not so easy is it he said softly we like to think we would have the courage to tell him to go to the devil but embarrassment loneliness and humiliation are real he looked back at pitt levelly to speak of ruin is one thing to face it is another i thank you at least for your honesty we had considered the possibility of the extortion of agreement to large funds for expedition into africa north from the cape into mashonaland and matabeleland pitt said thoughtfully or an investment in a capetocairo railroad tannifer sat up sharply brilliant he clenched his fists on the arms of his chair i commend you superintendent your perception is more finely attuned than i had given you credit for i admit i am most encouraged perhaps foolishly so but i shall cling onto it he rose to his feet and held out his hand pitt took it and was startled by the strength of tannifers grip he left feeling as if at last he had taken a step for ward even if it was towards an unknown and certainly harsh conclusion he had no alternative but to go again to see leo cadell he was unable to do this at the foreign office where cadell was fully engaged for the afternoon but he called at his home and was waiting for him when he arrived it was not an interview he was looking forward to and cadells weary face made it more difficult he rose to his feet from the sofa where he had been sitting good evening mr cadell i am sorry to trouble you at the end of the day but i am afraid there are matters i need to discuss with you and you were not available earlier cadell sat down he did it as if his body ached and it was apparent he was using all his reserves of inner strength to maintain an air of courtesy what is it you wish to discuss mr pitt i have been giving a great deal of thought to what unjust pressures might be brought to bear upon you particularly with regard to your position in the foreign office pitt began it was difficult to maintain the anger he had felt when he was in tannifers house he had to remind himself of the pain the man opposite him might be inflicting on others of the ruin that the blackmailer had unquestionably already unleashed on guy stanley without giving him any chance to fend it off even dishonorably it was not impossible that the blackmailer might disguise himself as one of the victims what better way to ensure that he knew the direction of the investigation or its success who knew what lay behind cadells anxious face and the polite patient smile he was a diplomat he had made his career successfully masking his emotions he was watching pitt now waiting for him to make his point you have considerable interest and responsibility in african affairs pitt continued particularly in the exploration of such areas as mashonaland and matabeleland i am concerned with relations with other european powers who have interests in the area cadell corrected slightly germany in particular is also concerned in east africa the situation is far more sensitive than perhaps you are aware the potential for making vast amounts of money is immense most of the population of south africa is not british but boer and their feeling towards britain is not kindlynor i fear in any way to be relied upon he watched pitts face as he spoke trying to gauge his understanding mr rhodes is a law unto himself dearly as we would wish it we have little control over him pitt was unwilling to allow cadell to know too much of his thoughts perhaps the knowledge tannifer had given him was his only advantage however smooth a face a blackmailer wore he was a ruthless man without scruples as to whom he hurt or how deeply it would seem he enjoyed the taste of his own power the ruin of guy stanley would suggest as much he looked steadily at cadell if you were to be asked by the blackmailer mr cadell what would be within your ability to do to serve his ends were he interested in african expansion a private fortune in that country or perhaps domination of a capetocairo railroad cadell was startled good god is that what you think he wants was it the idea which shocked him or pitts perception of it would it be possible pitt insisted i i dont know cadell looked acutely uncomfortable i suppose there is information i might pass to certain people information as to her majestys governments intentions which would benefitcould benefitsuch a person how about a military adventurer pitt went on someone intending to raise a private army for example cadell was whitefaced he sat forward in his chair this is far more serious than i had imagined i i supposed it would be a matter of money perhaps i was naive believe me if anyone should approach me with any such suggestion i should report it immediately to sir richard aston whether i knew who it was or not the consequences would have to follow as they may i would not betray my country mr pitt pitt wanted to believe him but what else would he say whatever he would actually do pitt could not rid his mind of the knowledge that this man sitting so innocently opposite him had told tannifer of cornwalliss vulnerability a thing he could not know other than from the blackmailer in truth it did not exist that was the only thing all the men unarguably had in common the blackmailer knew them well enough to be familiar with what could be manufactured from their pasts to destroy all their usual courage and resolve reduce them to nerveracked selfdoubting men living in a waking nightmare suspicious of even those closest to them do you know assistant commissioner cornwallis pitt asked abruptly what cadell was taken by surprise no well slightly belong to the same clubs see him occasionally why or should i not ask did he say that because he knew or was it the intelligent guess any man might make in the circumstances he must think of a noncommittal answer and he should not betray tannifers confidence if cadell was the blackmailer he was cruel enough to exact a vicious revenge he is in charge of the case ultimately he said aloud he mentioned the possibility of a political motive i cannot help you cadell replied wearily believe me mr pitt if i knew anything at all which could be of use and i were free to discuss it with you i would i presume i do not have to explain to you that a great deal of the information i have about africa concerns the governments plans regarding mr rhodes and the british south africa company and is confidential so also are all matters to do with the settlement of mashonaland and matabeleland or our relations with other european powers who have interests in the continent of africa it would be an act of treason for me to speak of them to you except in the broadest way which would be of no use to you pitt realized that there was no purpose in pressing him further and after thanking cadell he took his leave vespasia was walking slowly across her lawn thinking that it was time it was mown again when she saw pitt standing in the open french windows of her sitting room she was startled to find her breath catching in her throat and her heart racing fearing what news he might have brought she walked rapidly towards him barely leaning on her stick good evening thomas she said as soon as he joined her on the grass she refused to betray her anxiety i am afraid the best of the tulips are over they are beginning to look dreadfully blowsy he smiled in the evening sun glancing at the heavy roses in full bloom and the cascade of wisteria and a few huge gaudy tulips past their best it looks perfect to me she regarded him up and down she remembered that he liked gardening when he had the opportunity i agree but perhaps the purist would not he offered her his arm and she took it as they walked slowly back across the grass to the terrace and up the steps i am afraid i have very unpleasant news aunt vespasia he said when they were inside and she was seated i can see it in your face my dear she replied you had better tell me what it is tannifer sent for me today he also seems to be of the opinion that the blackmailers ultimate goal may be to influence african affairs to his own advantage that is not news thomas she said a trifle sharply she had not realized how tense she was she heard the edge in her own voice we had assumed as much she continued did he offer any evidence he must have caught her emotion he came directly to the point he mentioned cadells name in two regards one intentionally concerning his professional interest in african affairs his face was filled with distress and it touched her with in creasing fear she found herself swallowing with an effort but she did not interrupt the other was accidental at least as to meaning he continued quietly he was concerned that cornwallis might also be a victim and that thought was prompted by cadells having referred to an incident in cornwalliss career which was open to misinterpretation and therefore made him vulnerable for a moment she did not understand her concern was for pitt but cornwallis said that he saved the man she argued does that now make you reconsider his innocence no he shook his head minutely it makes me wonder how cadell knew of it and why he should even consider cornwallis as a victim then she understood a great weight of coldness settled inside her she dared not think of the tragedy that might lie ahead she had known theodosia and cared for her since her birth she had watched her grow up as she had her own children leo cadell is a victim also she said and knew the remark was pointless even as she made it the blackmailer could easily pose as a victim it would serve his purpose in many ways pitt did not argue with her he knew it was unnecessary i realize that does not exclude him she said very deliberately but i have known leo for a great many years i have watched his pattern of behavior and dont tell me people can change with pressure or temptation i know that thomas she was talking too quickly too vehemently and she could hear it in her voice and yet it seemed to be beyond her control her thoughts were far ahead and already inescapable he has his weaknesses of course he is an ambitious man and a good judge of other mens characters but he is fiercely patriotic in a conventional way she felt a thin shudder of horror he is not a greedy man nor an adventurous one pitt was listening to her his face grave the sunlight through the french windows lengthened across the carpet apricot gold the blackandwhite dog had gone back to sleep as it lay in the warmth i do not believe leo has the cruelty or the ingenuity to have conceived a scheme like this she said with conviction but that he should use theodosias beauty to win advancement is not impossible he would deny doing it even to himself she hated what she was saying it was repugnant in every way it felt like a betrayal to admit such a thing even to pitt but it was true it had crossed even her mind to wonder if the accusation could hold some truth that in itself was the most powerful illustration of the blackmailers brilliance even she had entertained the idea how much more easily would others believe it she was ashamed of herself for her disloyalty not only to leo but even more to theodosia and yet the thought had come and the doubt pitt was still talking i called on him he said gravely watching her face he seems to consider he may be asked for money mrs tannifer overheard a conversation about raising a large unspecified amount but the blackmailer has not asked for money she responded that makes no sense but even as she said it the thought darkened in her mind she refused to accept it it was disloyal untrue she was doing exactly what the blackmailer wanted she had yielded her independence her belief its rubbish she said too loudly he did not argue they discussed it a little longer and then he took his leave but even when he had gone she could not rid her mind of the thought and the unhappiness which oppressed her and she spent a long and surprisingly lonely evening while pitt was talking to vespasia charlotte was sitting in her kitchen pouring tea for tellman who had called expecting to find pitt at home to judge from the expression on his face he was both disconcerted and pleased to find that pitt was unexpectedly late and the only people home to hear his report were charlotte and gracie he sipped the tea appreciatively and rested his feet he would probably have liked to take his boots off as pitt himself would have done but that was far too much of a liberty well gracie said watching him from where she stood at the sink yer must ave come fer summink ceptin ter sit down i came to see mr pitt he replied avoiding meeting her eyes gracie kept her patience with difficulty charlotte could see the temper in her face and watched her thin chest rise and fall as she took a deep breath archie the marmaladeandwhite cat stalked across the floor found just the right place in front of the stove and sat down that means yer dont trust us ter pass it on ter im gracie said quietly tellman seemed almost to have forgotten charlotte the idea that gracie thought he did not trust her was obviously acutely uncomfortable to him his struggle within himself was palpable gracie did not help him at all she waited her arms folded regarding him her small face full of impatience its nothing to do with trust he said at last its police business thats all gracie thought about that for a moment or two i spose youre ungry too she said that took him by surprise he looked up quickly he had been expecting an argument or a flash of temper well are yer she demanded cat got yer tongue her tone became sarcastic that int a plice secret is it of course im hungry he said coloring dull pink ive been walking around the streets all day follerin poor general balantyne ave yer she said also ignoring charlotte well that must a bin ard work wered ego then i didnt follow him today he replied nothing to follow him for so e dint do nuffin then she concluded never thought as e did she sniffed tellman was silent if anything his discomfort seemed to have increased watching him charlotte was aware that his mind was going through a kind of turmoil quite unfamiliar to him his ideas had been challenged and found severely wanting he had been forced to change his opinions about someone presumably general balantyne and so perhaps a great many other people he had previously grouped together as a class and now had been obliged to see as individuals to have ones prejudices overthrown is always painful at least at first even if one can eventually accommodate them and it becomes liberating in some distant future she felt sorry for him but that would be the last thing he would want she still remembered now and then how when she had first met pitt he had shown her another world full of individual people with loves and dreams fears loneliness and pain perhaps different in cause but essentially the same as her own before that she had barely noticed some of the ordinary men and women in the streets they had been a class to her rather than people just as unique as she was with lives as full of incident and feeling as her own the realization of how blind she had been was painful she had despised her own narrowness and it was not easy to acknowledge it even now she could see the confusion in tellmans face his bent head his bony hands lying on the table beside the mug of tea gracie had given him angus the black cat came in through the back door and sauntered across to sit so close to archie that he was obliged to move angus began to wash himself gracie cleared her throat well if yer like i can get yer a kipper an some bread an butter she offered barely glancing at charlotte to gain her permission she was about detecting business and that did not really require any additional sanction tellman hesitated but his desire to accept was far plainer than he could possibly have realized gracie gave up shrugging her shoulders she treated him as she would sevenyearold daniel she took the decision out of his hands she snatched the skillet from the rack and put it on the hob poured water from the kettle into it then went for the kipper yer avin it poached she said over her shoulder i int messin around wif fryin anyway tenderer poached and she disappeared into the larder to fetch it tellman glanced up to charlotte anxiously you are very welcome mr tellman she said warmly im glad you have discovered general balantyne is not involved in the death of josiah slingsby and i am grateful to hear it he bit his lip he was still confused inside himself he seems to be a good man mrs pitt a good soldier i spoke to quite a few men who served with him they have a lot of respect for him more than that a kind of loyalty affection the surprise and reluctance was still in his voice charlotte found herself smiling partly with sheer relief she had not thought differently but it was important to have tellman say so she was also amused to see his expression gracie came back with a large kipper and ignoring both of them placed it in the simmering pan with satisfaction both cats immediately sat up noses quivering startled and went eagerly towards the stove then gracie went to the wooden breadbox and took out a loaf cutting them first from the end she buttered several thin slices and laid them on a plate she refilled the kettle and set it on the hob working busily as if she were alone in the room still smiling to herself charlotte decided to leave them tellman could work through his awkwardness the best he was able he gave her a quick rather desperate look as she went to the door but she pretended to have no idea of the emotion in the room and excused herself to have a game of charades with jemima and daniel leaving gracie to finish the kipper pitt was later than usual in to bow street the following morning in fact he had only just arrived when there was a sharp bang on his office door before he could answer it opened to admit a breathless sergeant his face filled with consternation sir mr cadell has been found shot he swallowed hard catching his breath looks like suicide he left a note pitt was stunned even as he sat motionless with the sense of shock sinking into him like ice his brain told him that he should have expected it the signs had been there he had simply refused to recognize them because of the pain it would cause vespasia he thought of her now and of theodosia cadell for her this would be almost unbearable except that one had to bear it because there was no alternative was he to blame had his visit to cadell yesterday evening precipitated this would vespasia hold him responsible for it no of course not it would be unjust if cadell were guilty then it was his own doing sir the sergeant shifted from one foot to the other his eyes wide and anxious yes pitt stood up yes im coming is tellman in yes sir shall i get im send him to the door ill get a hansom he went straight past the sergeant not even thinking to pick up his hat from the stand only snatching his jacket off its hook downstairs he met tellman coming from the back of the station his face grave and pale he did not say anything and together they went out onto the pavement and walked in the sun smartly along to drury lane pitt stepped into the road waving his arms startling a shire horse pulling a wagon full of furniture he shouted at a hansom coming around the corner from great queen street and started running towards it holding up all the traffic and being very thoroughly sworn at he scrambled in calling out instructions to the driver and slid across the seat to make room for tellman of course it was pointlessa few minutes here or there in reaching cadells house could make no difference nowbut the urgency of action released some of the anger and misery inside him two or three times as they rode tellman made as if to speak then seeing pitts face changed his mind when they arrived pitt paid the driver and strode across the pavement to the front door there was a constable posted outside his face stiff his body at attention mornin sir he said quietly sergeant barstones inside hes expecting you thank you pitt brushed past him opened the door and went in it was absurdly like yesterday evening the elaborate long case clock in the hall still ticked loudly the hand moving from second to second with a little jerk each time the brass edge of the umbrella stand still gleamed but now from the sunlight streaming under the closed withdrawing room door the bowl of roses had not shed any petals or the maid had picked them up already all the doors were closed he had not thought to ask where cadells body was and he had let himself in there was no one else in the hall he went back to the door again and rang the bell then returned to wait do you want me to speak with the servants tellman asked dont know what we could find this looks like the end of it not really what i expected i suppose you might as well pitt agreed somebody might tell us some small thing which will explain how it all happened yes yes of course he straightened up he was being careless we dont know it was suicide yet we are assuming yes sir tellman went willingly pitt knew why he hated having to face the families of the dead corpses did not trouble him the same waythey were beyond their painbut the living the shocked bewildered grieving were different he felt helpless and intrusive even though he could have justified his role to anyone pitt understood exactly he felt the same the butler appeared from the green baize door into the servants quarters he looked startled and angry to see pitt already in the hall in the distress of the morning he had apparently forgotten who pitt was good morning woods pitt said gravely im sorry for mr cadells death is mr barstone in the withdrawing room woods recollected himself yes sir he swallowed moving his neck as if his collar were too tight the the study is locked sir i assume you will be needing to go in is that where mr cadell is yes sir i pitt waited woods searched for words he was obviously troubled by profound emotions i dont believe it sir he said gruffly ive been with mr cadell for nearly twenty years and i dont believe hed take his own life it has to be something else some other answer pitt did not argue denial was the natural response to something so ugly and from this mans point of view so utterly inexplicable how could it make any sense to him of course well investigate every possibility he said quietly would you let me into the study sergeant tellman has gone to speak with the rest of the staff who found mr cadell this morning polly sir shes the downstairs maid went in to dust and make sure the room was clean and tidy im afraid you cant speak to her yet sir shes taken it terribly hard awful thing for a young girl to find he blinked several times shes usually very sensible good worker no trouble but she just fainted clear away shes in the housekeepers sitting room and youll just have to give her time cant help that sir of course perhaps you can tell me most of what i need to know to begin with if i can sir woods conceded perhaps helped in the immediate moment by the fact that he was able to be engaged in doing something he fished in his pocket and produced a small brass key he stood with it in his hand waiting what time was that pitt asked him just after nine sir was that the usual time for polly to go into the study yes sir things sort of fall into a routine best way then nothing gets forgotten so everyone would know that polly would go into the study at that time yes sir woods looked deeply troubled it was easy to understand and his thoughts were plain in his face cadell himself would have to have been aware of the almost certainty that a young maid would be the one to find him and the door was unlocked pitt stated the obvious but with surprise people who intended killing themselves very often ascertained that they would have privacy yes sir did anyone hear the shot it must have made a considerable noise no sir not that we realized if you know what i mean woods looked embarrassed as if he had been at fault if they had heard it they might have prevented the tragedy it was irrational but grief and incomprehension had numbed his faculties you must understand sir most of the staff were busy about their duties that hour of the day the kitchen was full of comings and goings there were tradesmens boys in the yard with deliveries and the like wagons and carts and things clattering up and down the road and with the windows open to air the house there was a certain amount of noise anyway i expect we heard it but never realized what it was did mr cadell have breakfast this morning no sir just a cup of tea wasnt that unusual no sir not lately im afraid mr cadell was not himself as far as his health was concerned he blinked again stirring to govern his emotions he seemed very preoccupied if you understand me i daresay there is some foreign business that gives cause for concern it is an extremely responsible he tailed off suddenly remembering again that his master was dead his eyes filled with tears and he turned away embarrassed to lose such control of himself in front of a stranger pitt was used to distress he had been in situations like this countless times he affected not to have noticed where did mr cadell take his tea it was a moment before woods replied i believe didcott the valet took it up to his dressing room sir he said at last and then he went down to the study i believe so didcott would know well ask him thank you now ill go to the study if you will let me in yes sir of course and with slightly shaky steps woods led the way across the hall and down a fairly long passage to an oak door which he opened with the key he remained outside while pitt went in leo cadell was slumped forward over the desk his hands on top of it a trifle awkwardly his head on one side blood from a wound to his right temple spilled out over the wooden surface of the writing top a dueling pistol lay touching his right hand two inches from a quill pen the ink dried there was also a cushion on the floor near the chair pitt bent and picked it up putting it to his nose and sniffing the smells of gunpowder and charring were plain that explained why nobody had heard the sharp report of the shot it did not explain why cadell had not locked the door from the inside so people would know there was something wrong and it would not be a young maid or even his wife who would be the first to find him but then a man capable of the kind of blackmail which had been practiced was hardly likely at this point to consider the feelings of a maid or of anyone else how easy it is to be totally and disastrously mistaken in ones judgment of people pitt still found it hard to accept and vespasia possibly never would apparently even as wise and shrewd as she was she could be utterly wrong he looked at the papers on the top of the desk half a dozen in a neat pile were letters and minutes from the foreign office one alone to the left of the pile was composed of pieces clipped from newspapers probably the times again and pasted onto plain white paper he read it i know the police are close behind me now i cannot succeed and i will not wait for them to arrest me i could not face that this is a quick clean end and i shall not be aware of what happens after i am gone except that the case is ended it is all over leo cadell it was terse no regrets no apologies perhaps there was another letter somewhere to theodosia pitt could not believe she had known his guilt he looked closely at it again it appeared exactly the same as the others he had seen the spacing was a trifle different less precise but then in the circumstances that was unsurprising there were scissors along with a paper knife a stick of sealing wax a small ball of string and two pencils in a holder on the desk he could not see any glue or paste perhaps it had been used up and the container thrown away where was the newspaper from which the words and letters had been cut it was not on the desk or on the floor he looked in the wastepaper basket it was there folded neatly he took it out yesterdays copy of the times it was easy to see where the pieces had been cut he let it fall again there seemed little more to say cadell was right as far as the police were concerned the case was complete for the victims most of all for theodosia it never would be the sharp morning sunlight fell through the clear glass of the french doors into the garden the maid had been too distraught to think of closing the curtains there was no one in sight he moved across and did it now closing the latch on the door and then drawing the heavy velvet across he went out and locked the hall door behind him he must speak with theodosia speaking to the family of the victim and the ultimate arrest of someone the shock and anguish of their family were the two worst times in any investigation in this one they were bound together in one occasion and the grief in one person she was sitting in the withdrawing room grayfaced her body stiff her hands clenched together in her lap so hard her knuckles shone where the skin was stretched tight she stared at him wordlessly out of eyes almost black she was alone no maid or footman with her he came in quietly and sat down opposite her not only had she lost her husband a man vespasia said she truly loved and her future was gone butimmeasurably more painfulher past was destroyed as well the whole precious image of her world and all it had meant was shattered the foundation upon which she had built her beliefs was gone everything about her husband that truly mattered that formed the structure of her relationships even of her understanding of herself and her own judgments was proved a lie she had been misled deceived in everything what was left how often do we perceive the world and those we love not as they are but only as we want them to be he wished he could offer her any comfort at all but there was none would you like me to call vespasia for you he asked her what oh she remained silent for a few moments struggling within herself then she seemed to reach some inner conviction no thank you not yet she will find this very difficult she was her voice cracked she was fond of leo she thought well of him please wait until i am more composed until i have a better idea of what happened so that i can tell her would you like me to tell her he offered i can go to her home otherwise she will read it in the newspapers the very last vestige of blood drained from her face and for a moment he was afraid she was going to collapse she struggled for breath instinctively ignoring conventions he moved forward to kneel on the floor beside her holding her hands where they were knotted iron hard on her lap he put his other arm around her slowly he commanded breathe slowly dont gasp she obeyed but even so it was several minutes before she regained physical control of herself i am sorry she apologized i beg your pardon i had barely thought of the newspapers ill call on vespasia as i leave here he said decisively i am sure she will wish to be with you it will be easier for her to face this if she is not alone she looked at him and there was a warmth of gratitude momentarily in her eyes she did not question his decision perhaps she was glad to have any step taken for her anything that relieved a bit of the weight she must bear alone from now on thank you she accepted there was nothing else to ask her he rose to his feet she could summon the maid if she wished she might prefer just at the moment to be alone perhaps to weep although that would probably come later he was at the door when she spoke mr pitt my husband did not kill himself he was murdered i dont know how or by whom except that i have to presume it was the blackmailer if you stop now he will get away with it the last sentence was said with sudden choking anger and her eyes blazed a challenge to him on the brink of blame he did not know what to say there were no grounds for her charge except loyalty pain and despair i wont take anything for granted mrs cadell he promised i shall look for proof of every detail before i accept it he and tellman questioned all the household staff but there had been no breakin no strangers had been seen the delivery boys at the back door had not gone through the wooden gate in the wall to the garden indeed they had been too busy flirting with the scullery maid and the ladys maid respectively to leave the step at all they had barely succeeded in doing the duty they were employed for no one had come through the house and the only person to go through the garden door was the gardeners boy delivering ties and doing a little work on the old white climbing rose which was in bloom and in need of holding up no one knew anything about the gun cadell must have had it for some time there were a pair of pistols in a case locked into the corner cupboard in the study but this was not one of them theodosia said she had never seen it before but admitted that she hated guns and would not recognize one from another the staff were not permitted to touch them or have anything to do with them so they could offer no information at all it seemed that where cadell had obtained it or how long he had owned it would remain a mystery like much else to do with his whole blackmail scheme pitt called at vespasias house before returning to bow street she too was shocked by the news of leo cadells death and found it almost impossible to believe that he was responsible for the blackmail but she did not deny it as theodosia had done she thanked pitt for coming to tell her personally rather than allowing her to read of it in the newspapers then she called for her carriage and her ladys maid and prepared to go and offer whatever comfort she could to her goddaughter pitt decided then to tell cornwallis he also should not learn it from the evening editions of the newspapers cadell he said in amazement he was standing in the middle of his office as if he had been pacing the floor his face was haggard he had neither eaten nor slept well in weeks there was a very slight nervous tic in his left temple i i presume you must be sure can you think of another explanation pitt asked unhappily cornwallis hesitated he looked profoundly miserable but even as they spoke some of the agonized tension had eased out of his body and his shoulders were lowering into a more natural position whatever the surprise or the understanding of grief his own ordeal was over and even if he despised himself for it he could not help but be aware of that no he said at last no from what you say that must be the answer what a damned tragedy im sorry i could have wished it were someone i didnt know i suppose thats idiotic it had to be someone i knew it had to be someone we all knew well done pitt and he wanted to thank pitt for his loyalty it was there in his eyes but he did not know how to word it ill go back to bow street pitt said briefly and tidy up the details yes cornwallis nodded yes of course vespasia went immediately to theodosia taking her ladys maid with her and such necessities as she would require to remain overnight or longer she had no intention of allowing theodosia to remain alone in the grief confusion and despair which must follow upon such an appalling loss in her long life she had encountered suicide before it was in many ways the hardest of all to endure and the loneliness and the guilt which invariably followed all but doubled the pain there was nothing to do that first afternoon and evening but to survive them to be there and allow theodosia to begin to realize that leo was truly dead of course tomorrow morning would be worse sleep however little of it would bring respite then with waking there would be a few moments before memory returned that would be like hearing it all over again only without the numbing mercy of shock they sat up and talked in theodosias boudoir she seemed to need to speak of leo most particularly of the kind of man he had been when they first met with a rising tone of desperation she recalled dozens of good things he had done brave or kind or wise acts of honesty where less would have passed uncriticized even unnoticed but he had silently done his best vespasia listened and indeed she could remember a great many of them herself it was only too easy to recall all that was likable in him all she had admired over the years a little before midnight theodosia suddenly found she was able to weep and the release of tears exhausted her after that vespasias maid brewed her a sleeping draft and she went to bed vespasia took a draft herself and retired fifteen minutes later the morning was even worse than she had expected then she was angry with herself for not having foreseen it she met woods in the hallway as she was crossing to the breakfast room he looked pale and redeyed good morning your ladyship he said hoarsely and cleared his throat how is mrs cadell asleep vespasia answered i shall not disturb her will you be good enough to bring me the newspapers the newspapers your ladyship his eyebrows rose yes please he stood unmoving did you mean the whole newspaper your ladyship of course the whole newspaper woods am i not making myself plain it would have been pleasanter to have them burnt it was her first instinct but she needed to know what they said there were truths that could not be avoided i shall be in the breakfast room i shall have tea and toast no more will be necessary yes your ladyship woods said hastily ill ill have them ironed dont bother she realized that with the master dead the usual duties in this respect had been abandoned ill look at them as they are and without waiting for argument she passed him and went to the breakfast room he brought them on a tray smoothed but unironed and she took them from him they were uniformly dreadful one of them summed up everything that was worst in all three and added a great deal of speculation that was both cruel and destructive it was written by lyndon remus he had done his own investigation into the corpse found in bedford square and its possible connection with general balantyne he must have followed pitt because he also was aware of his visits to dunraithe white tannifer and sir guy stanley in his article on cadells suicide he suggested a conspiracy that pitt had discovered and that he had been on the brink of arresting cadell superintendent thomas pitt refused to comment but bow street police station did not deny that mr cadell was being investigated in connection with a very serious matter involving extortion and murder and figures in the establishment both financial and military as well as in the government since mr cadell who shot himself to death in his study yesterday morning held a high position in the foreign office one cannot but wonder if the conspiracy concerned the interests of great britain abroad and even treason may have been narrowly averted by swift action from the police it is to be hoped that if there are other guilty parties they will not now be protected from answering for their crimes whether carried out or simply intended lesser men have been exposed for lesser offences and paid the cost he continued for several paragraphs in a similar vein and by the time vespasia came to the end of it she was so angry she could hardly hold the paper still enough to read it she set it down on the table lyndon remus might have begun as a sincere journalist intending to expose corruption but he had allowed ambition to warp his judgment the chance of his own fame and the power that the pen afforded had prompted him to make unfounded assumptions all of them had a marked lack of compassion for the results of his speculation upon the bereaved who might have been innocent but for whom proof of that would come too late to undo the pain or the ostracism that went hand in hand with suspicion i have read them she said to woods when he returned to see if she was ready to have the table cleared you may burn them now there is no need for mrs cadell to see them yes your ladyship he said quickly his opinion was clear in his face and his hands when he took the papers shook a little how are the staff vespasia asked him we are managing your ladyship he replied i regret to say there are persons outside in the street attempting to ask questions for the newspapers they are most ill mannered they are intrusive and have no respect for death have you locked the areaway doors she asked we can do without deliveries today i i hadnt he admitted with your permission i shall do so you have it and no one is to answer the front door unless they have first ascertained who is outside and sought either my permission or mrs cadells is that clear yes indeed cook asked me to enquire what you would like for luncheon lady vespasia i assume you will be remaining he looked a little desperate most certainly she answered him i think whatever cook cares to prepare will be excellent may i suggest something very light an egg custard would be a suitable pudding or a fruit fool yes thank you your ladyship vespasia went to the withdrawing room somehow the formality of it seemed appropriate to the mood theodosia came down a little after ten she looked exhausted and wretched dressed entirely in black but her head was high and she wore an expression of resolution there is a great deal i need to do she said even before vespasia had the opportunity to ask her how she was although it would have been a pointless question she would probably never in her life suffer more than she was doing this morning and you are the only one i can ask to help me she finished leo must have had a man of affairs vespasia replied regarding theodosia gravely there is very little youre required to do yourself even that i can do for you if you wish theodosias eyebrows rose i am not referring to that sort of thing aunt vespasia i am quite sure mr astell can do all of that although i should welcome your advice as to what you think would be suitable she frowned very slightly concentrating i am quite certain leo did not take his own life no one could drive him to that no matter what he thought or feared i am even more certain he was not behind the blackmail she stood with her back to the room her face towards the garden but blind to its flowers and dappled light i do not delude myself i know everything about him she said slowly one never does nor should one it would be intrusive and more dangerous than that it would be boring but i really do believe i knew leo too well for him to have deceived me either to his elation when the plan seemed to have been succeeding or his despair when he would have felt such imminent failure as to have driven him to this vespasia was uncertain what to say she had often imagined she knew people better than events had proved but theodosia had spoken of emotions not morality and that was a matter of observation it was less easy to dismiss there is no need to humor me theodosia said quietly still facing the window i realize how i sound what woman could admit to such a thing of her husband without struggling against it but i intend to do a great deal more than wring my hands in protest it will not be easy vespasia pointed out tentatively i am afraid you must be prepared for a great deal of opposition of course theodosia did not move if leo did not do this then someone else did they are hardly going to welcome my disturbing what they wish to appear a very tidy end to the affair she turned at last will you help me aunt vespasia she looked at theodosias haggard face her stiff shoulders and the desperation in her eyes it might be hopeless it might bring more grief upon them than there was already but how could she refuse it would not prevent theodosia it would only leave her more isolated to do it are you sure you wish to she asked gently what we discover may not all be what you would like my dear sometimes one is better knowing less of the truth rather than more and you will assuredly make enemies of course theodosia remained standing do you imagine it will be much worse for me than it will be anyway when this becomes known mr gordoncumming will not be the only person who will find it unbearable to remain in london or the home counties the blackmailer has taken so much from me he has left me very little still to lose now i do not need you to promise me fairytale endings aunt vespasia i know there are none i only wish you to lend me your intelligence and your support as i daresay you know i shall persist whether you give it me or not but i shall have much less chance of success vespasia smiled dryly a small sad gesture put like that you leave me little choice unless i wish you to believe i preferred you to fail nothing would please me better than to discover leo was innocent both of the blackmail and of taking his life we must consider carefully how to proceed and of course where to begin theodosia moved back across the room and sat down heavily looking suddenly a trifle lost im sorry she said but who else could i turn to and who better for all her determination she actually had very little idea what she could do are you sure you are willing to face whatever we may discover vespasia asked for a last time it may not be what you wish no the word was flat and certain there was no happiness in it but there was conviction but it will not be what they are saying at the moment where do we begin with logic and a hot cup of tea vespasia said decisively theodosia gave a ghost of a smile and walked over to the embroidered bell rope when the maid came she ordered hot tea now for the logic she requested when they were alone again vespasia settled herself to begin whoever the blackmailer is he is personally acquainted with all of his victims because he is aware of their past experiences sufficiently well to know to what charge they would be most vulnerable and where in their careers he can make it most reasonably believable quite theodosia agreed you say he does it have to be a man could it not be a woman it is naive to suppose a woman incapable of such intelligence or such cruelty of course it is vespasia answered but i think that might be to suppose that the placing of the corpse on brandon balantynes doorstep was unconnected which seems to me unlikely i find it difficult to imagine circumstances where a woman who had the acquaintance of the victims would also be aware of the death of slingsby and have the means to move his body although i suppose it is not impossible i had forgotten about that theodosia admitted we shall consider men first i know something about most of leos life where he was born grew up went to school and to university and then into the diplomatic service i have already racked my mind to think of any enemies who could be responsible for this she frowned anyone who succeeds is bound to arouse envy if nothing else and it is regrettable but many of those who succeed far less will explain it to themselves by blaming others the maid arrived with fresh tea on a tray and set it down on the low table between vespasia and theodosia she offered to pour but theodosia declined preferring to do it herself when they were alone again vespasia replied i do not believe this is a matter of personal vengeance unless we can find some affair in which all the victims were involved did leo even know them all theodosia looked at her with a thin shred of humor i dont know you have been far too discreet to tell me who they are oh vespasia had forgotten that there seemed little point in worrying about indiscretion clearing leos name and finding the true blackmailer if it was not he were more important general balantyne john cornwallis sigmund tannifer guy stanley and dunraithe white theodosia looked startled i did not know that she said quietly they are different generations and quite different kinds of men i know parthenope tannifer she has called several times a most interesting woman and is not dunraithe white a judge yes and john cornwallis is assistant commissioner of police vespasia added one wonders if some subversion of the law is intended except how could that involve brandon balantyne there must be some connection theodosia said fiercely it is up to us to find it it cannot be professional it cannot be from school or university then it must be social vespasia deduced sipping her tea the hot liquid was peculiarly refreshing even though the room was warm and bright in the summer morning sun the whole house was unusually silent the servants on tiptoe someone had thought to put straw in the street outside to muffle the hooves of passing horses vespasia had a sudden thought or financial could leo have invested in some scheme or other and those other people also and there is something wrong in it theodosia seized the idea eagerly yes why not that would make some sense of it she rose to her feet there will be notes of it in his study we shall look vespasia went with her the tea abandoned they spent the rest of the morning and early afternoon there stopping for a brief luncheon only because vespasia insisted for theodosias sake and theodosia obeyed for hers they searched for records of all leo cadells investments of any nature whatever and discovered that he had been on the whole extremely prudent there had been one rather rash backing of an adventure in the caribbean which had lost him a modest amount but all the rest were either adequate or extremely good there was startlingly little invested overseas in anything speculative and he had been scrupulous to avoid anything with even the semblance of profiting from his knowledge gained as a member of the diplomatic service vespasia became increasingly saddened reading the dry facts of investment and return over the years they demonstrated the financial life of a man who made good provision for his family but was extraordinarily careful erring on the side of loss never to make a penny from his professional advantage it reflected the man she knew nothing like the person lyndon remus wrote of in the newspapers or the police presumed from the manner of his death funny that a series of figures should convey so much theres nothing here theodosia said desperately a little after half past three she was sitting at the desk with papers strewn all around her she looked wretched and exhausted he gave to certain charities but thats about all i can think of that he could have had in common with the other people you mention and then it wasnt much i mean not the sort of money anyone would blackmail over what charities vespasia asked simply for something to say to not allow the silence to make it seem she had given up theodosia was surprised specifically an orphanage that was governed by several members of the jessop club i knew he still went on attending that committee most of the time even when he was exceptionally busy he mentioned that general balantyne was on it also and without saying anything further she took a bundle of letters out of the desk drawer and began to read through them vespasia went to one of the other drawers and found some more for half an hour she saw nothing that seemed of any relevance at all it was unpleasant reading through another persons letters which had been intended as private there was nothing leo would have had cause to be embarrassed or ashamed of not even anything especially personal it was simply intrusive for a third person to read them she had a terribly oppressive sense of his death going through his belongings made its reality almost tangible she read one letter through although it was more of a memorandum and then she nearly missed the relevance it was on the letterhead printed below that of the jessop club the handwritten part was addressed to leo cadell and concerned the patronage of a fundraising art exhibition a notable society lady was to attend it had been held over six months before and was of no importance leo had presumably kept it only because he had written an address on it some collector of chinese ginger jars living in paris it was the names of the committee that caught vespasias eye brandon balantyne guy stanley mr lawrence bairstow dunraithe white john cornwallis james cameron sigmund tannifer and leo cadell she looked up theodosia was still reading a growing pile of discarded papers strewn around her do you know lawrence bairstow vespasia asked or james cameron i knew mary ann bairstow theodosia replied looking up why what have you found could lawrence bairstow be another victim there was sudden disappointment in theodosias face no the poor man is senile he is a great deal older than she is i am afraid he would be incapable of exerting any influence at all for good or ill and i believe his personal affairs are looked after by the family solicitors she could not keep the weariness of pain out of her voice and james cameron vespasia pressed not sure why or if there was any purpose in it it was simply unbearable to give up the only james cameron i knew of went to live abroad several months ago theodosia answered he has poor health and he moved to a drier warmer climate india i think but im not sure why why are you asking what is that i think just possibly we may have discovered what they have in common vespasia said slowly although i cannot see for the life of me what conceivable profit there could be in it theodosia shot to her feet and snatched the paper from her she read it then looked up puzzled they are all on this committee within the jessop club but its for an orphanage that is what the money is for could that be it misappropriation of funds the expression in her eyes hovered between hope and despair it hardly seems worth it how much could it be a great deal of disgrace if it were discovered vespasia answered gravely trying to keep the emotion calm in her voice to steal from an orphanage is particularly despicable i hadnt thought of that theodosias hands were trembling she gripped them together to control the movements she so fervently wanted this new information to mean something she dared not hope too much and yet she was so close to surrendering to grief she could not let go either that that could be it couldnt it vespasia did not have the heart to deny it even though she felt it could not be true perhaps to give theodosia some shred of light now was more important than a probable truth she must survive it could she agreed let us see if there is any other reference to it here then i shall take it to thomas and see what he makes of it you mean superintendent pitt the hope fled from theodosias face he is sure leo was guilty he will listen if i tell him about this vespasia filled her voice with an absolute conviction she did not feel will he theodosia clutched at it most certainly now let us see what else we can find in another two hours of meticulous reading of every piece of paper in the desk and in the drawers of the cabinet they found only one other thing which seemed to have any bearing it was a letter dated some two weeks earlier my dear cadell perhaps i am being over zealous but i am concerned about the amount of money going to the orphanage at kew i have reread the accounts and it seems to me to require some more detailed evaluation i have raised the matter in committee once but was overruled of course it is possible i am out of touch with the cost of things but i would value your opinion i hope we may discuss the subject at a time suitable to you i remain your most obedient servant brandon balantyne theodosia was so encouraged by it that vespasia could not bring herself to point out how trivial the matter almost certainly was youll take it to superintendent pitt theodosia urged of course immediately i shall call on him before i return home vespasia promised now my dear i am far more concerned about you will you be all right alone tonight i can return if you wish me to it is not an inconvenience in the slightest i can send for a change of linen without any trouble at all theodosia hesitated no i shall have to learn to become used to it i think she tailed off vespasia made the decision for her i shall return when i have seen thomas i do not know how long it shall be as i may not find him immediately please do not wait supper for me i shall be perfectly happy with whatever cook can make for me then of course theodosia agreed her face filled with gratitude i thank you in the event vespasia did find pitt in his office in bow street as far as anyone could tell the case was closed and he was now obliged to deal with a great many other matters that had arisen while he was wholly occupied with the bedford square murder and the blackmail he was delighted to see her and welcomed her with enthusiasm she regarded his piled desk critically i can see that i am interrupting you she said with very gentle sarcasm perhaps i should wait and call upon you at home please he readjusted the chair he was holding for her there could be nothing more urgent than seeing you it looks extremely urgent she observed with a dry smile sitting carefully in the chair but perhaps also rather arduous i shall not keep you for very long never mind he smiled back at her his eyes alight for the first time in weeks he returned to his own seat i shall have to make do with what time you can spare what is it she sighed her humor vanishing almost certainly nothing but in going through leo cadells papers i have discovered one thing which all the blackmail victims had in common and which was a cause of concern to at least one among them the one who was most viciously accused by implication balantyne he looked surprised what is it she took the letter and the memorandum on the jessop club paper from her reticule and passed them both over to him he read them carefully and then looked up an orphanage what about those other two people bairstow and cameron are they victims as well i have no reason to suppose so in fact every reason to believe they are not and could not be she replied bairstow is senile according to theodosia and cameron has left england to live abroad that leaves of the committee members only those we know she watched his face closely she saw the lift of interest and the slight change in his expression will you do me the favor of investigating it thomas for theodosias sake i appreciate that it is extremely unlikely to be anything other than what it seems a worthy cause assisted by a group of gentlemen who happen to belong to the same club but i am extremely fond of theodosia and i too find it difficult and painful to believe that leo was guilty of blackmail and of suicide i am compelled to explore any possibility that it is not so however remote she hated asking favors and she saw the understanding of that in his face of course he agreed i shall go out to kew tomorrow and require to see their books and send men to check on bairstow and cameron cornwallis will give me all the excuse i need thank you thomas i am most grateful she rose to leave it had been an exhausting two days and now suddenly the grief overtook her and she found it difficult to muster the strength to face returning to theodosia and staying awake long into the night to offer her what comfort and companionship she could she could not lessen theodosias pain only share it but she could hardly love her and do less the next day was beautiful the heat wave continued bright and hot but there was a clarity to the air and every now and then a breeze people were out in the streets and parks and on the river were scores of little boats pleasure steamers ferries barges and every other kind of vessel that could take to the water the sounds of singing barrel organs and pennywhistles drifted on the air children shouted to one another and every so often there was a burst of laughter pitt took the boat up the river to kew it seemed not only the pleasantest way to travel but also probably the fastest as he stood on the deck between a fat woman in a striped blouse and a man with a red face he wondered if he should really be doing this at all it was an escape from the paperwork that had piled up while he was occupied with the blackmail case and he did not want to refuse vespasia she had looked unusually tired grief had taken none of her spirit or her determination but there was an acceptance of defeat in her which was the profoundest change he could have imagined it troubled him enough to justify this trip up the river with the sun and the breeze on his face as the steamer made its way up past battersea and turned south towards wandsworth there was another complete s bend before kew he would enjoy it he found himself smiling as he watched the rowing boats plying back and forth narrowly avoiding getting in everyones way little boys in sailor suits stood up precariously and anxious women held them by the britches little girls with ribboned straw hats waved excitedly fathers bent their backs to the oars with proprietorial satisfaction on the shore people picnicked on stretches of grass he thought idly that a few of them were going to be burned by this evening at the waters edge they did not realize how strong the sun was he was wasting his time going to an orphanage even if there had been petty pilfering and balantyne had suspected it it was not the same degree of crime as the sort of blackmail they had been dealing with it could only be a few hundred pounds at the very most and that would have to have been over years or it would have been noticed long before now why had balantyne questioned it instead of requiring an audit of the books he had written to cadell about his concerns cadell would hardly be blackmailing him with something as extreme as a murdered man on the doorstep in order to stop him from pursuing such a request but that did raise a genuine question to which pitt had seen no satisfactory answer who had moved the body of josiah slingsby from shoreditch to bedford square who had put albert coles receipt for socks in slingsbys pocket how had he had it in the first place for that matter where was albert cole now if he was alive where had he gone and why and if he was dead why had slingsbys body been left on balantynes step and not coles body had he coincidentally died of natural causes that seemed to be stretching unlikelihood too far and it did not answer the questions about slingsbys body and how cadell had even heard of it let alone how hed moved it to bedford square did any of it matter now except that it was a puzzle a pleasure steamer went by its passengers shouting and waving its wake setting the ferry rocking the sun was dazzlingly bright on the water was he being selfindulgent expecting every case to have a complete solution wanting to understand exactly what had happened or was he being diligent making sure of the truth what he was really doing was taking a trip up the river instead of sitting in bow street doing his paperwork and trying to help vespasia a little although she would have to accept in the end that leo cadell was the blackmailer he had confessed it in a letter exactly like all the others possibly he had gained his knowledge of the lives of the other victims through knowing them in the jessop club one could learn a great deal about people from casual conversation expanded by a little questioning as if from interest or admiration the rest he could have gleaned from public records army and navy details he could easily have asked for on the pretext of having some need to know in his position at the foreign office but the question remained how did he know slingsby at all let alone remark his resemblance to cole pitt put it out of his mind for a while and enjoyed the river and the brilliance of the day all around him people were having fun the orphanage at kew green was a large rambling old house with a garden walled around and overhung with trees it looked spacious enough to house fifty or sixty children at the very least and the appropriate number of staff to look after them he walked up to the front door noticing the clean scrubbed step and pulled the bell it was answered within minutes by a girl of about seventeen she was wearing a dark blue cotton dress starched apron and cap yes sir she said helpfully pitt explained who he was and asked if he might speak to whoever was in charge he conveyed in his manner that refusal was not to be tolerated she conducted him to a very pleasant room facing the front entrance and invited him to sit in one of the threadbare but surprisingly comfortable seats while she went for mr horsfall when he arrived closing the door behind him with a snap he was taller even than pitt very rotund around the middle and with a genial face as if he smiled often and easily yes sir he said agreeably what can we do for you dolly said something about the police i hope none of our charges have been creating a nuisance we do the best we can to see they are well behaved and if i say so myself i think we more than succeed most times but children will be children i have no reason to doubt it pitt replied honestly i am from bow street not kew he ignored the surprise in horsfalls face and it is regarding financial matters i have come the recent suicide of one of the committee of beneficiaries who donate a large amount to your establishment had raised some questions as to possible irregularities horsfall looked suitably saddened oh dear how painful well sir of course you may examine our books with pleasure but i do assure you if there has been anything amiss it has not been after any funds have reached us we are very careful he nodded we have to be we mustnt lose sight of the fact that we are dealing with other peoples money if they cannot trust us then there will be no more he looked at pitt with wide eyes what he said was transparently true and pitt felt foolish for wasting both horsfalls time and his own but he could hardly say so now thank you he replied it is merely to complete the matter i would be negligent to overlook it of course of course horsfall nodded again hooking his thumbs in his waistcoat shall i bring them to you here or would you prefer to come through to my office where you can sit at a desk that would be very courteous of you pitt accepted he was aware that there was always the possibility of two sets of books but he acknowledged to himself that he had never really expected anything from his visit beyond being able to tell vespasia he had tried he spent the rest of the morning and most of the afternoon apart from a brief respite for luncheon at the local public house going over endless receipts both for money and for goods food fuel clothes wages and found everything in the most meticulous order had horsfall not explained his need for exactness he might have found the perfection suspicious but there was not a farthing unaccounted for and he did not doubt for a moment that if he went equally carefully through the jessop clubs donations he would find a faultless match he was barely aware of the children who must fill the building as horsfall had said they were remarkably well behaved he did see two little girls walking hand in hand aged about five and six respectively and suddenly one of them began to run pulling the other along they were followed a moment later by a girl of ten or so carrying a boy not more than two other movements caught the corner of his vision and he heard voices he closed the books thanked horsfall and apologized for troubling him then took his leave of the orphanage feeling a trifle foolish there seemed no reason whatever why balantyneor cadell for that mattershould have been concerned perhaps it was a matter of raising funds rather than their use which had worried him he could ask balantyne but it hardly seemed worth it the question of how cadell had known of slingsbys death and how he had moved the body seemed far more important and where was albert cole if he was dead they should know if it had been a result of natural causes and if not then what had happened to him he would put tellman onto that as soon as he returned to bow street tomorrow tonight he would write to vespasia and tell her that the orphanage books were immaculate charlotte was grieved by the news of leo cadells death largely for aunt vespasia but her imagination extended to how his widow must feel however she was relieved of an immense weight of anxiety even of fear regarding both general balantyne and cornwallis she liked cornwallis profoundly and she knew also how deep was pitts affection for him she knew balantyne must have read of cadells death in the newspapers he could hardly have missed it it was sprawled across the front page along with lyndon remuss speculations as to what sort of long and tragic story might be behind cadells fall from brilliant diplomat to blackmailer extortionist and ultimately suicide half of her mind could understand the necessity for freedom to question and investigate the lives of all public figures without such liberty secrecy begot oppression and ended in tyranny but with freedom came responsibility and the immense power of the written word could so easily be abused there was a sense in which lyndon remus was doing exactly the same thing as cadell had attempted the fact that cadell and his family were now the victims did not leave her with any sense of satisfaction or poetic justice just an awareness of the vulnerability of reputation and the thought of how theodosia cadell must feel an errand boy delivered a note from general balantyne and she gave him the answer that she would be happy to meet him again in the royal botanical gardens at three oclock in the afternoon the day was less oppressively hot and a considerable crowd was taking the air for one sort of pleasure or another she marveled at how many people seemed to have no other call upon their time and were free from the necessity of any form of work before she had met pitt such a thought would never have crossed her mind young ladies of her social class then had far too much time and too little to fill it that gave anything but the most momentary satisfaction then she seemed always to have been looking forward to tomorrow for something that might happen she saw balantyne as soon as she was through the gates he was standing alone facing the parade of soldiers in uniform couples arm in arm girls with parasols accompanied by their mothers parasols swinging dangerously as they glanced at the young men and pretended they werent he appeared to be watching them but the stillness of his head betrayed that his thoughts were elsewhere charlotte walked over to him and was almost beside him before he noticed her mrs pitt he looked at her gravely searching her eyes how are you he paid not the slightest regard to her appearance he was concerned entirely with her feelings i am quite well she answered equally concerned for him looking at his face she could see little of the relief she would have expected considering that the threat of ruin that had dogged him for weeks was now lifted and you he smiled very slightly i had expected to feel better he admitted perhaps i am still bemused i liked cadell he offered her his arm isnt that ridiculous but i cannot rid myself of the emotion in a single day in spite of knowing now what he was really planning i suppose i am not the judge of mens characters that i thought i was he gave a very slight rueful shrug im sorry she said simply i dont think greataunt vespasia has ever been so fearfully mistaken either mrs cadell is her goddaughter you know i didnt he walked in silence a few yards poor woman i can imagine the devastation she must be feeling now the confusion and loss charlotte thought of christina perhaps he was remembering her when he spoke time might have blunted the edge of his own pain but nothing could remove it looking sideways at him now she would not intrude it would be inexcusable but she imagined him thinking of theodosia cadell with a pity that could only spring from his own knowledge his mouth was tugged tight at the corners the muscles in his neck tense we are all relieved of our fears he said after a little while moving between the banks of roses heavy with perfume in the sun we need no longer dread the delivery of mail we can encounter our friends in the street and meet their eyes without wondering what they are thinking what double meaning may lie behind the simplest remark i feel guilty for the people i doubted i hope to heaven they will never know it oddly in all my suspicions i never thought of cadell she wanted to answer with something intelligent but she could think of nothing he did not seem to be waiting for her to say anything merely glad of her companionship and grateful for the presence of someone to whom he could speak his thoughts as they came to him it is terrible that our relief the end of our ordeal has to be the beginning of someone elses he went on how will mrs cadell endure this the knowledge will destroy everything of the past as well as the future does she have children do you know no i dont i think aunt vespasia said something about daughters im not sure i wasnt really listening how shatteringly life can change from one day to another she looked at the people passing by them all seeming so carefree as if there were nothing on their minds more serious than whether their gowns were fashionable or not whether a young man had smiled at them or the girl behind them and yet underneath their hearts could be breaking too every one of them must succeed in some way or fail and the price of that was heavy perhaps poverty perhaps loneliness she had been as young and as desperate in her own way once what i dont understand balantyne went on frowning is why cadell put the body of slingsby on my doorstep with albert coles receipt on him and the snuffbox in his pocket what was he trying to do have me arrested for his murder he turned and looked at her his eyes full of confusion did he hate me so much why i liked him i dont know she confessed what is more difficult to understand for me is how he got the body slingsby was killed in shoreditch he sighed i suppose we shall never know the man must have had a life quite separate from anything we guessed i have never found myself so mistaken in anyone he gave a very slight laugh when i was worried about the orphanage in kew he was the one i wrote to what worried you she asked not that it mattered it was simply something to continue the conversation the money he replied smiling at her ruefully it all seems terribly trivial now it wasnt even a large amount missing she asked no quite the contrary i thought we were not giving enough enough to meet the demands that is perhaps i am a trifle naive as to how one may manage if one is skilled in housekeeping i daresay they have a good kitchen garden i have forgotten what children eat i seem to recall rice pudding plum duff and bread and jam i suppose there must have been a great deal else they walked a little farther in silence five minutes later they had completed the circle and were back at the gates again he stopped i he cleared his throat i i am deeply grateful for your friendship he coughed removing his arm from hers i value it a great deal more than you knowor than it is remotely suitable that i should tell you he stopped abruptly knowing he had already said too much she saw the passion of gentleness in his eyes and understood all that he could never say and she should not have allowed to happen she closed her eyes not to meet his i acted on impulse she said almost under her breath sometimes in fact quite often i have more feeling than sense i apologize for it but i never believed you were guilty and i cared so much to prove it she made herself smile still with her eyes lowered i am very glad that that at least has been proved i wish we could have solved all the other things too but they will have to remain as they are for an instant she looked at him then after a moment turned and walked away back towards the gates and outside knowing that he watched her until was she out of sight but she could not look back she must not pitt arrived home late after seeing vespasia on the way back from kew he felt deeply sorry for her nothing he had been able to tell her was anything but crushing to the last shred of hope now he sat in front of the empty fireplace in his parlor the doors to the garden were closed after having been open nearly all day it was still light but there was a coolness in the air that could be felt if one were sitting still the sweet smell of the neighbors newcut grass lingered in the room reminding him it was time he attended to his own lawn not to mention the weeding charlotte was sitting opposite him her sewing discarded he could see from the rough shape of it that it was a dress for jemima there seemed so much material he recalled with a jolt how rapidly she had grown she was not a little girl anymore and she most decidedly had opinions of her own that had come forcibly to his attention a few times lately it made him think with sharp pity of christina balantyne and brought an awareness of how time can change people and one can be too preoccupied to notice it girls grow up and become women was there nothing at the orphanage charlotte asked interrupting his thoughts he was pleased to be able to share his findings with her it did not make it any better it simply hurt less no everything was in exceptionally good order i went through the books in detail every penny was accounted for not only that but it was all clean and obviously well cared for and the half dozen or so children i actually saw seemed happy and in good health well clothed and clean also but general balantyne was worried about it she frowned slightly he told me that himself she looked at him very steadily and he knew she was waiting to be asked when she had seen him again he found himself smiling in spite of the gloom that he felt she was very transparent well it looks as if he need not have been he answered i wish all institutions were as well run he didnt think they were misappropriating funds she explained he thought they werent using enough she took a deep breath but he did admit that perhaps he didnt know very much about budgeting i daresay he hasnt much idea what you can do with things like potatoes and oatmeal and rice pudding and of course bread i assume he doesnt know much about army catering then he observed i didnt ask she admitted i think honestly he was more troubled by his misjudgment of leo cadell he truly liked him and trusted him i know pitt said quietly it has wounded aunt vespasia profoundly as well i think yes she was quick to respond her face earnest you might visit her a little more often for a while at least offer to somehow make it tactful she smiled a little ruefully it is not easy to be tactful with aunt vespasia she can read my thoughts almost before i have them then perhaps you had better not try simply offer thomas she said tentatively yes what did he want i mean what was cadell going to ask them all for was it just money or something to do with africa as you thought i dont know his note said very little what puzzles me far more is how he knew about slingsby at all that he resembled cole let alone that he was dead you dont know she was startled no i can see why he wanted slingsbys body to be taken for albert coles to increase the pressure on balantyne but why not use the real albert cole he would be far more likely to have met him he worked in lincolns inn fields where cadell could easily have been any of the victims could have and dunraithe white assuredly has well what happened to albert cole she asked her face puckered where is he i have no idea why didnt he come forward when his death was reported in the newspapers she pressed i dont suppose he reads the newspapers he answered with a smile he may not read at all oh i never thought of that she showed a moments consternation at her own blindness then hurried on even so other people do and he isnt anywhere in his usual places is he hes gone from his lodgings and from the corner where he sold bootlaces and from the public house where he drank you told me that his brief moment of humor vanished i am afraid he may also be dead perhaps he died of some cause that didnt suit their purpose such as what she demanded illness of some sort or for example drowning we could hardly blame general balantyne for a drowned body that turned up on his doorstep in spite of herself she laughed it was absurd grotesque but the moment was soon gone poor man she said more to herself than to him but that doesnt answer how cadell knew about slingsby and just happened to be in shoreditch at the time what on earth would he be doing in shoreditch at all he shrugged i dont know im not sure whether i need to know i want to but does it matter now yes there was no hesitation in her at all this doesnt make any sense you need to know at the very least what happened to albert cole just because nobody misses him doesnt mean he doesnt matter he did not argue perhaps it was the excuse he had been wanting pitt went to see cornwallis in the morning he looked a different man the shadows of tiredness were still in his face but the haunted air had gone from his eyes and he stood upright his shoulders square again and he met pitts gaze almost eagerly in the first moment after coming into the room pitt realized just how heavy had been the weight upon cornwallis how very sharp the fear now that it was gone every aspect of his life had changed again courage and belief in himself had returned pitt almost let it rest whatever had happened to albert cole it could not be undone did they really need to know cadell was guilty by his own admission it filled all the facts he was in a position to have gained all the information about the other victims he knew them all from the jessop club good morning pitt cornwallis said cheerfully excellent job im most extremely grateful his expression darkened although im damned sorry it turned out to be cadell i liked him at least i liked what i believed him to be it is hard to discover that someone is not remotely what you supposed it shakes your confidence in your own judgment i used to think i knew a mans character he frowned it was part of my job everyone was mistaken in him pitt replied standing a little rigidly cornwallis relaxed i am afraid so still its over now he raised his eyebrows have you something else on your mind this was the moment to make his decision there were too many questions he thought of vespasia no im afraid it is still the same case im not satisfied yet cornwallis looked startled and dismay flashed in his eyes what you cant have any doubt that cadell was guilty for heavens sake he confessed and shot himself you cant imagine he was doing it to protect someone else he spread his hands jerkily who if he wasnt guilty then he was as much a victim as the rest of us are you suggesting there was a conspiracy no pitt was beginning to feel foolish nothing like that i just want to understand how he did it ive been thinking about it cornwallis interrupted jamming his hands into his pockets and walking back towards his desk it seems fairly clear now we know who it was he knew us all reasonably wellat least at the jessop if nowhere else he sat down and leaned back in his chair crossing his legs he looked up at pitt earnestly i can remember dining with him i dont know now what we talked about but different places wed been i could easily have mentioned which ships id served on from there he could have looked up my naval record as a member of the foreign office he wouldnt need much of an excuse he smiled bleakly pitt sat down as well ready to argue when the time came similarly he could have looked up balantynes career cornwallis went on its amazing how comfortable one can get over a good dinner at the club he smiled a little you reminisce and with a fellow you like who is a good listener maybe tells a bit about himself as well you find yourself talking into the small hours no one disturbs you or tells you its time to leave he could have learned all manner of things about any of us he looked at pitt with a sudden bleakness if you think its worth going to the jessop and asking the stewards if they remember cadell sitting up late with anyone do so but it would prove nothing either way they could have forgotten or it could have been somewhere else most of us belong to more than one club i hadnt doubted where he got the information pitt replied a little conversation some enquiries and then some imaginative guesses would be quite sufficient the snuffbox cornwallis said quickly he may have visited balantynes home but even if he hadnt i can remember balantyne having it at the club because ive seen it myself when i think back not closely i wasnt paying attention its the sort of thing you see but dont see i daresay guy stanley used his flask the same way some people prefer their own particular whiskey or brandy i have half a memory that he liked a single malt yes thats all simple enough pitt agreed again it wasnt that i was thinking about how much should he say were vespasias doubts anything more than the loyalty of a friend how did he know about slingsbys death in shoreditch and how did he get the body back to bedford square more than that how did he know slingsby resembled cole and so would be any use to him how did he get coles receipt and where is the real cole ive no idea why he was in shoreditch cornwallis replied with a frown the man seems to have had a life we knew nothing about perhaps he gambled his face creased with distaste and there was an edge of exasperation in his voice he could have had a liking for bareknuckle fighting or any of a dozen other things some men do a darker side to the character you must know that even better than i do perhaps he was there when slingsby was killed and saw his chance to pass him off as cole and leave him on balantynes doorstep pitt asked why why take the risk of carrying him halfway through london in the middle of the night and what happened to the real albert cole where is he obviously cadell was a man who liked taking risks cornwallis said a little sharply it would seem his respectable life as a diplomat married to one woman all his adulthood and always behaving with the utmost correctness oppressed some part of his nature ive known it to happen before unconsciously his hand on the desk clenched and there was an increased edge to his voice for heavens sake pitt plenty of men behave like fools women too for all i know he leaned forward why do we gamble drive carriages too fast ride dangerous horses fall in love with all the wrong women why do we even try to do something pointless and dangerous climb mountains or pit ourselves against nature to test our strength nine times out of ten theres nothing at the end of it except the knowledge that we succeeded thats all we want and you think cadell was that sort of person pitt could not keep the doubt from his face i hadnt thought so no cornwallis answered but i was obviously mistaken i hadnt thought he was a man to blackmail his friends for the sheer pleasure of exercising power over them and watching them suffer he added bitterly i cant begin to understand why anyone should take delight in such a thing i can only suppose he was in desperate need of money hed lost gambling and he intended to ask us all for everything we could afford when he was ready when he was sure we would pay pitt chewed his lip and where is albert cole cornwallis stood up abruptly and walked over to the window he stared out of it with his back to pitt ive no idea its probably a coincidence he went away or died it had nothing to do with cadell and the receipt pitt could not give up not only for vespasia but because reason demanded better answers than he had cornwallis remained staring at the street i dont know he admitted perhaps it was a mistake the man in the shop was in error does it matter now pitt looked at cornwalliss broad straight shoulders balantyne went to cadell about the orphanage funds he was worried they were insufficient cornwallis turned around puzzled why do you mention that what has it to do with anything it probably hasnt pitt confessed i went out to the orphanage the books are perfect why lady vespasia cumminggould still finds it very difficult to believe cadell was guilty of course she does cornwallis came back across the room frowning with annoyance his widow is her goddaughter it is difficult for anyone to believe someone they cared for could have been guilty of a wretched vicious crime i dont find it easy myself i liked the man he took a deep breath but the longer she resists it the harder it will be to accept and the more painful pitt spoke more from emotion than reason if you think aunt vespasia is simply being an old lady who is refusing to accept an unpalatable truth you know very little of her and underestimate her profoundly she knew leo cadell since before his marriage and she is a woman of considerable wisdom and experience she has seen more of the world than either you or i particularly of men like the ones we are concerned with he had spoken more sharply than he intended but it was too late to moderate it cornwallis blushed for a moment pitt thought it was from anger then he realized it was from shame cornwallis turned away im sorry i have the greatest regard for lady vespasia my own relief has has blinded me for a moment to the reality of other peoples grief his voice thickened with tightly suppressed emotion i want this to be the end of it so fiercely i cannot bear to believe otherwise it has obliged me to think about a great many things events and people which i had taken for granted most of my life other mens opinions of me i assumed i knew even my career has still that is hardly important now he let out his breath in a soundless sigh and turned back to face pitt you had better find cole or at least have tellman look for him there is nothing else pressing is there before pitt could answer that there was not there was a sharp rap on the door come in cornwallis replied looking towards it the man who came in looked startled mr justice quade is here to see you sir he said to cornwallis he is extremely perturbed and says the matter is urgent send him in cornwallis directed pitt youd better stay theloneus quade appeared the moment after and indeed the clerk had not exaggerated quades thin gentle face wore an expression of deep concern i apologize for intruding upon you mr cornwallis he glanced at pitt fortunate to find you also here thomas i am afraid there has been a development i find disturbingmost disturbingand i felt i should inform you of it in case it has meaning he looked abashed and yet perfectly determined what is it pitt asked with sinking misgiving though with less surprise than he should have felt theloneus looked from one to the other of them dunraithe white has just excused himself from a case he was scheduled to hear it was rather an important one involving a major fraud in one of the large investment trusts his withdrawal will severely inconvenience everyone and delay the hearing until someone can be found to replace him cornwallis stood motionless is he ill he said without hope he has said so theloneus replied but i saw him at the opera yesterday evening and he was in excellent health then his lips tightened i happen to be acquainted with his doctor i took the liberty of calling him when i heard i am afraid i practiced an untruth i asked if dunraithe had been taken to a hospital that i might send him a letter or attend to anything he might wish his doctor quite obviously had no idea what i was talking about and assumed i must be mistaken he may of course be ill at home and not have found it necessary to send for any medical help but that would be an unusual way to behave and dunraithe is a conventional man mrs white would have sent for someone even if he had not cornwallis opened his mouth to argue with some reasonable answer and then changed his mind without being aware of it his body was tense again the ease gone from his face it occurs to me theloneus said sadly that a letter has been overdue in the mail and perhaps he received it only this morning he may imagine that cadell was not alone in his crime and that a threat still exists he looked from one to the other of them i dont know if you know the answer to that but if you do then you might persuade him of it if not then we had better continue our work it would seem it is not entirely finished cornwallis glanced at pitt then back to theloneus we dont know the answer he said frankly we were discussing it before you arrived we dont know exactly what cadell wanted we have assumed it was money but it is only an assumption we also assumed he was alone and perhaps we should not have his voice was roughedged the weight of fear he had only just cast aside had descended upon him again it seemed the heavier for the short respite quite suddenly he was once more haggard the color gone from his skin the one nights untroubled sleep need never have been given him or the few meals eaten with pleasure ill go and see mr white pitt said quietly he looked at theloneus will you come with me he may simply refuse to admit me he could send his butler with a message that he is too ill i can scarcely argue that i know he has not yet sent for a doctor of course theloneus agreed i had thought of it myself i can persuade him on judicial business if nothing else he cannot refuse to speak to me on that whatever his state of health he gave a sad little grimace i do not know whether to wish he is telling the truth or not it proved a wise decision when the butler opened the door there was a cool refusal in his face prepared for whoever should consider disturbing his masters peace however when theloneus introduced himself and declared the nature of his business the butler recognized that it was not within his jurisdiction to refuse and he dutifully carried theloneuss card upstairs on his silver tray he returned several minutes later his face grim mr white is not well this morning sir as i explained if the matter truly cannot wait then of course he will see you perhaps you would not mind doing him the favor of allowing him a few minutes to compose himself and come downstairs it was not really a question of course theloneus said sympathetically he sat down in one of the large chairs in the study where they had been shown pitt could not help thinking that it was one of the few rooms in the house where marguerite white would almost certainly not interrupt them dunraithe would not have to explain their presence to her pitt and theloneus sat in silence several times pitt nearly spoke then changed his mind they had already said all there was until they knew whether white had indeed received a letter or if perhaps he had some genuine illness perhaps he had and the anxiety and distress of the past few weeks had so worn down his courage that he no longer had the strength to fight back the door opened and dunraithe white came in closing it behind him he was dressed in trousers and a soft smoking jacket he looked grayfaced as if he had not slept for nights on end and there was a dry stiff texture to his skin he had shaved but poorly as if his attention had not been upon the task as well as a small missed patch on his chin there were two tiny spots of blood where the blade had caught him the butler had simply reported pitt as another gentleman and white was profoundly shaken to recognize him superintendent has something further happened he cleared his throat stokes did not tell me you were here only you he turned to theloneus i i thought it was a judicial matter it is theloneus replied staring at him levelly and without the slightest evasion i am deeply concerned over your withdrawal from the leadbetter case as you must know it will cause the deepest inconvenience to the court calendar and a considerable cost due to the delay which must necessarily follow until someone else can be found to hear it is there any way whatsoever with your physicians assistance that in a day or two you may be recovered sufficiently to resume your role he regarded white with innocent concern no white answered without hesitating to give the matter thought it would be quite misleading of me to allow you to think i will be well i really cannot say that he swallowed in in fairness to all concerned the prosecution and the defense you must replace me he looked at theloneus with something like despair in his eyes seeing the compassion in theloneuss face pitt expected him to relent but he did not without a moments change in the gentleness in his eyes or his voice he continued as if white had not spoken i am sorry my dear fellow i must know the truth of this you do indeed look as if you are suffering greatly but you do not seem unwell which is a different thing white made as if to protest but he could not find the words if you have some ailment theloneus went on then allow me to send for your physician i know him well and i have no doubt he will come to you within the hour really white protested i am perfectly able to to send for him myself should i require his assistance you take too much he half turned away moving his arm ineffectually please accept my word quade and my apologies and let the matter be i have said all i have to theloneus remained where he was i think not he said very quietly perhaps i wrong you and if so i am in your debt but i think you are not ill in any medical sense and even the lord chancellor would understand if white wheeled around are you threatening me he accused his eyes hot and angry theloneus did not even look surprised is somebody threatening you even though cadell is dead he asked mildly what shred of color there was left whites face for several moments he did not speak and neither theloneus nor pitt broke the silence are you sure cadell was the blackmailer white said at last his voice strained to cracking he confessed pitt said speaking for the first time his note was exactly the same as the blackmail letters and on the same white notepaper i want to believe that white said desperately dear god you dont know how much i do theloneus frowned why do you find it so hard have you received another letter were you told to drop the leadbetter case white shook his head there was a bitter laughter in him close to hysteria no nothing to do with the leadbetter case his voice cracked i simply cant face it i think i shall resign from the bench altogether i cannot go on like this he held his hands out in front of him palms down they trembled very slightly but you are correct i did receive another letter in the post this morning may i see it pitt requested white gestured towards the fireplace i burnt it in case marguerite found it but it was just the same as the others threats talks of ruin and pain but nothing asked for unconsciously his hands clenched i cannot continue like this i will not he looked from one to the other of them my wife is terrified she has no idea what is wrong but she cannot help but be aware that i am beside myself with worry i have told her it is a case i am concerned with but she will not believe that forever she knows little of the ways of the world but she is not a foolish woman nor unobservant in spite of himself his voice softened and she cares for my welfare with the tenderest concern the whole matter is beginning to affect her health also and i cannot keep it from her indefinitely she will begin to know i am lying and that will make her even more afraid she has always trusted me it will destroy every shred of peace of mind she has he lifted his chin and his shoulders stiffened you may enquire all you wish quade i shall do whatever this blackguard asks of me i will not subject marguerite to scandal and ruin i have told you this before and i fail to see why you did not believe me then i thought you knew me better he turned away his back rigid his jaw set a dozen arguments rose to pitts lips but he knew dunraithe white was not listening fear exhaustion and the passionate desire to protect his wife had closed his mind to argument of any sort theloneus tried a last time my dear fellow cadell is dead he cannot hurt you or your family please reconsider before you commit yourself to a course of action which will bring to an end a long and memorable career i shall deem that i did not hear your last words white turned around glaring at him because if i had theloneus continued i should have to inform the lord chancellor of their import he might then find it most difficult to keep you in a position of high trust knowing that you would place the love of your family before the duty of your calling white stared at him ashenfaced swaying a little on his feet you are very brutal quade i had not seen it like that he swallowed with difficulty i suppose it may look like that to you it would look like it to you my dear fellow were our places reversed theloneus assured him and if you think of it for a moment you know that would you prefer i told you only after you had made your decision white took several moments to answer no he said at last no i should not i have enjoyed my career i shall be at a loss without it but i can see that my present ill health must become a permanent thing i shall write my resignation to the lord chancellor this morning there was a finality of despair in his voice it will be in the afternoon post you have my word then i shall disregard this damnable letter whoever it is from i think that perhaps my wife and i should take a short holiday in the country for recuperation perhaps a month or so theloneus did not make any further attempt to dissuade white he took his leave quietly and he and pitt went out into the sun and the noise and ordinariness of the street neither spoke of it except on parting when pitt thanked theloneus for having come with him there really was nothing that needed more words pitts mind was still troubled over the details of cadells knowledge how he had learned and invented sufficient detail with which to blackmail his fellow members of the jessop club was not difficult to imagine but pitt could still think of no answer to the question of how cadell knew of slingsby and cole not to mention ernest wallace and the murder in shoreditch had it been simply money he was after eventually and if so why what was he spending it on that he needed more than his very ample salary and his inherited wealth or was it the sadistic power to hurt to torment and to ruin such a thing was entirely outside anything aunt vespasia had observed in the man in over quarter of a centurys acquaintance or was it as they had considered before some mad african venture into speculation and empire building whatever it was a more careful scrutiny of all his papers and a more thorough and directed questioning of his wife and his household staff should reveal a thread a shadow some indication of an answer accordingly pitt hailed the next cab which passed him and gave the driver directions to cadells house there was still straw muffling the street outside and of course all the curtains were drawn giving the windows a blind look almost as if the house itself were dead but when he pulled the bell he was let in immediately and theodosia herself came into the withdrawing room within minutes she was dressed in black with no relief except a jet mourning brooch at the throat her eyes were hollow and her skin had no color at all anything artificial would have stood out like a clowns makeup even so she was a beautiful woman her high cheekbones and long slender throat could not be affected by any grief nor the thick carefully dressed dark hair with its silver streaks she reminded him of vespasia is there something further i can do for you superintendent she asked or have you discovered she tried with painful intensity to keep hope out of her voice and almost succeeded how could he answer without the cruelty of suggesting something only to snatch it away again nothing new he said immediately and saw the light fade from her eyes just questions to which i cant find any answers and i must at least look she was too wellbred to be impolite and perhaps she remembered he was a friend of vespasias i assume that you wish to look here please i would like to go through mr cadells letters and papers once more everything he kept at home and speak to the staff again in particular his valet and the coachman why she asked then immediately comprehension flooded her face and a darkness of misery you dont believe he killed that wretched man who was found in bedford square do you you cant how would he even know him no i dont believe he killed him he said quickly we know who did that it was witnessed we have the man arrested and charged but he swears that he did not move the body from shoreditch to bedford square he simply fled that was witnessed as well i want to know how the body got to general balantynes step and who put his snuffbox in the pocket and tried to have the body identified as albert cole what snuffbox she was completely bemused general balantyne had a highly unusual snuffbox he explained like a reliquary only made of pinchbeck he gave it to the blackmailerhe saw her wince at the word but there was no other he could useas a token of surrender it was found in the corpses pocket along with a receipt for socks from which we identified himwrongly as it turns outas albert cole a man who had served with balantyne on the campaign where the incident occurred over which he was threatened and you believe my husband found the body wherever it was and moved it and put those things on it she asked with disbelief but no strength to deny she was dizzy with confusion and pain do the details matter now mr pitt do you need to dot every i and cross every t i need to understand more than i do now mrs cadell he replied there is still too much of it which seems inexplicable i feel as if i have left something undone and i want to know what happened to the real albert cole if he is alive where is he and if he is dead did he die naturally or was he also murdered she stood very still i suppose you must i i want to hope that you will find some other explanation something that does not involve my husband every fact you have found so far makes that impossible and yet i cannot believe it of the man i knew and loved her lip trembled a little and she gestured impatiently you must mink me a fool i imagine every woman whose husband has done something criminal says the same thing you must expect it by now if people were so easy to read mrs cadell anyone could do my job and far better than i do it he said softly it can take me weeks to solve a case and too often i dont succeed at all even when i do i am frequently just as surprised as anyone else most of the time we see what we expect to see and what we want to the ghost of a smile touched her face where would you like to begin with the valet if you please but didcott the valet proved of little use he was obviously suffering from shock and bewilderment and the very natural anxiety as to what his own future would be he would have no employment once cadells belongings were disposed of he answered every question to the best of his ability but he could shed no light on the subject of cadells life outside what was generally known of his work at the foreign office and the social and diplomatic functions that one might have expected him to attend if he owned any clothes suitable for venturing to the east end or attending the rougher gambling houses let alone such sports as bareknuckle fighting or dog fights he did not keep them in the house pitt went through all the cupboards and drawers himself cadell had been a fastidious man well dressed as pitt would have expected but considering his position and his income certainly not extravagant almost all his suits were formal there was little of a more casual nature didcott kept a diary of events cadell attended in order that he might make sure every garment was ready clean and pressed when it should be required and that there were always sufficient clean shirts to hand pitt read it carefully going back over the previous three months if cadell had kept every appointment and didcott assured pitt that he had then his schedule allowed very little time indeed for selfindulgence of any sort it was difficult to see when he could have had time to go to shoreditch or anywhere else to overspend money on private vices it also appeared incidentally that he had very seldom been to the jessop club lately not above three times in the previous eight weeks at least according to didcotts diary perhaps pitt should go to the club and ask there maybe it was irrelevant but it was a silly little fact that did not fit the picture he went downstairs and outside to the mews where he found the coachman but even with the most detailed questioning he also could offer nothing of use he had driven cadell regularly over the previous eight years and had never taken him to shoreditch or anywhere like it he looked at pitt with wide sad eyes and seemed confused by almost everything pitt said it seemed that if cadell had gone on any private journeys he had done so by hansom or some other form of public transport or less likely with an associate was that the answer a conspiracy with whom he should go through all the papers again reread everything to see if there was any indication of another person another mind involved he was offered luncheon and accepted it eating it in the servants hall they treated him civilly enough but their grief was very obvious and they spoke little he returned to his task and it took him the rest of the afternoon going through every drawer and cupboard he even leafed through books from the shelves in the study the only room in the house which was private to cadell and not touched by any of the servants except in his presence it was where he had kept certain of his work when he had brought it home pitt questioned all the servants about the posting of a letter on the day before cadells death or that morning but no one knew of a letter to dunraithe white or anyone else there was no glue in the study desk drawer there was notepaper but it was of a different texture and a slightly different size from that of the letters it would seem cadell had not written them at home could he really have done it at the foreign office or was there a third place one they knew nothing of the only other thing that caught pitts attention was a note on the side of cadells appointment diary balantyne still worried about kew he is not a fool i should take it seriously he thanked theodosia and left to go to bedford square he had been to kew himself charlotte had spoken to balantyne also but perhaps there was something pitt could ask that would elicit an explanation as to why the general was concerned that made some kind of sense he did not believe it but he could not leave it undone as he was shown in by the footman he was greeted with icy disdain by augusta she was dressed in a gray striped gown and looked magnificent pitt was jolted by memory of the past her courage and resolution her grief and the loneliness that must haunt her solitary hours there was no happiness in her only cold strength there was something admirable about her something frightening and not a little that evoked a sense of pity what tragedy is it this time mr pitt she enquired coming towards him with a remarkably graceful step for a woman of her age there was nothing whatever fragile in her nothing that spoke of vulnerability and what makes you imagine that we can assist you in your confusion the same tragedy lady augusta he answered gravely standing in the middle of the wide hall and i am not at all sure that general balantyne can help but i have to ask do you she said with faint sarcasm i find that difficult to understand but i suppose you have to justify yourself somehow pitt did not argue he probably was wasting not only his own time but balantynes nevertheless he would still ask him about kew the orphanage balantyne said with surprise he stood with his back to the oak fireplace in the morning room staring at pitt yes i did speak to cadell about it twice i think possibly three times he was frowning slightly i dont understand why you are concerned now if they are incompetent or short of funds it is hardly a police matter incompetence is that what you were concerned about when you contacted cadell two or three times pitt asked with surprise why cadell did you speak to the committee in general yes of course i did no one else seemed to consider the matter of any substance you thought the funds were insufficient pitt said again you did not suspect that anyone was misusing them or diverting them to private profit no balantyne said i dont know what i thought was happening just that sufficient care was not being taken so you spoke to cadell why him i believed he would listen and take the matter up with the man in charge horsfall i went there myself pitt confessed i looked through the financial books they were faultless i dont doubt it balantyne said a little sharply i was not suspecting dishonesty only a reluctance to demand more money sufficient to care properly for the children there i was concerned that they might be cold or hungry i saw the children pitt replied they were clean and well clothed and looked in excellent health balantyne was puzzled then it would seem i was mistaken but there was disbelief in his voice he was reluctant to let go of the conviction he had held what made you think there was something wrong pitt was puzzled also because he respected balantyne and could not dismiss his ideas lightly even if they appeared to have no foundation balantyne frowned i go to kew every so often i am familiar with the size of it and how many children it could accommodate i do not understand how they can manage adequately on the funds they have it seems to me far too little he lifted one shoulder very slightly i dont know why they didnt press for more were you alone in this pitt thought of the other members of the committee in the jessop club surely no stretch of the imagination could connect the orphanage with blackmail or death i dont believe so balantyne answered a trifle ruefully i raised the subject when we all met cornwallis seemed to think i was mistaken but then he is used to naval catering which is hardly the same his lips tightened nor is it ideal especially for children i thought cadell at least considered the possibility of examining the situation i see pitt replied with a sudden and profound sense of disappointment what had he hoped for it was never going to be a motive for blackmail far less murder thank you for giving me your time general i really should let this subject go the orphanage at kew balantyne asked no no i meant the possibility of it being connected with cadells blackmail attempts or his death even if you are right it is hardly a motive balantynes surprise showed in his face had you thought it was i dont know it seemed to be the one thing you all had in common but i realize now it was membership of the committee not its purpose that counted what happened to the real albert cole balantyne asked i dont know but we shall go on looking for him pitt held out his hand thank you i hope i shall not need to disturb you again balantyne clasped pitts hand warmly but he said nothing further pitt walked home in the warm twilight still filled with unease trivial questions unanswered pricking his mind leaving him no sense of completion find albert cole pitt had said to tellman alive or dead if he is alive find out why he disappeared from his lodgings and from lincolns inn fields and if he is dead find out how he died naturally or otherwise if he was killed who killed him and why and also when and where tellman had made a sarcastic reply wondering why pitt had bothered to trail all the way out to kew and what on earth an orphanage very satisfactorily run could have to do with any of it pitt had had no answer for that and left tellman to go about his search he himself had begun with more about cadells movements could he have transported slingsbys body from shoreditch himself and if not which was probably the case then who had he had told tellman of his intention to visit cadells widow and enquire from the valet and coachman and see if he could trace cadell to shoreditch from that end tellman acknowledged the instruction tersely but if he were honest he was not unwilling to obey he thought that suicide was a frustrating way to conclude a case too much was unexplained they would probably never learn what had made a man like leo cadell jeopardize everything he had which was a vast amount wealth and happiness beyond tellmans dreams although his dreams had included some happiness lately and he blushed hot at the thought but he did not expect to understand the man only the facts of the case the logical material details and finding albert cole was part of that he set out with a profound determination pitt addressed himself to the task of learning how slingsbys body had been moved from shoreditch to bedford square and more importantly by whom naturally he began with cadell since he was dead the foreign office would not protect him in the way it had previously pitt had little trouble in tracing cadells movements on the day before the body had been found he had worked either in his office or at various meetings with officials from the german embassy at the time slingsby and wallace were fighting in shoreditch cadell had actually been in negotiation with the german ambassador himself like almost anyone else he could have gone to shoreditch in the small hours of the morning presuming someone had moved slingsbys body from the street where it had fallen kept it in a safe place and cadell had known where that was which would be to assume a great deal including that slingsby had been murdered intentionally and that wallace had conspired with cadell to that end because slingsby resembled albert cole how did cadell know a ruffian like wallace he quickened his pace striding along the footpath between the crowds of shoppers clerks and errand boys and sightseers he must go and talk to wallace again before he stood trial and was in all probability executed why had he not said he had moved the body when tellman questioned him before it would hardly make any difference to his sentence to plead that it had been a fight rather than a deliberate attack he would be hanged either way or did he expect to come up before dunraithe white and believe he would be acquitted was that why white was a victim and why kill anyone to have balantyne suspected why was the blackmail over the abyssinian affair not enough what extra was wanted from balantyne more than the others pitt found himself almost running and he hailed a cab with waving arms shouting at the driver as he leapt in newgate prison he felt the cab thrust forward throwing him against the seat but by the time he reached newgate he had changed his mind he leaned forward and rapped on the cab wall raising his voice sorry forget about newgate take me to shoreditch the driver grunted something unintelligible which considering its nature may have been as well and changed direction abruptly pitt began in the public house where tellman had said wallace and slingsby had started their quarrel then progressed to the regular denizens of the immediate area he had to part with a good few coins to assist memory and goodwill and he ended the day with nothing which would have served as proof in a court but he was quite certain in his own mind that wallace could have come back within half an hour of the murder and taken the body of slingsby certainly the body had disappeared within that time there was no knowledge or indication that anyone else had moved it and opinion seemed to be that it had been wallaces problem and he had dealt with it they had supposed it would be into the river but that was only because it was the most obvious thing to do taking a cart and carrying the body to bedford square would be too outlandish and utterly pointless to have occurred to them the best and final thing to do was to see if anyone had lent or had stolen from them such a vehicle with a little more generosity and a certain number of threats and promises he succeeded in discovering that one obadiah smith had indeed had his vegetable cart removed without his permission so he claimed and to his great inconvenience it had been returned in the morning he left shoreditch elated it was hardly worth going to newgate wallace would probably deny it but pitt was now convinced that wallace had murdered slingsby with the quite deliberate intention of moving his body and placing it on balantynes doorstep with the snuffbox in his pocket and the receipt for the socks perhaps obtained by wallace himself pretending to be cole and this had been done on cadells instructions it would be very satisfying to see wallaces face when he heard that cadell was dead and could not possibly rescue him but why slingsby and not the real cole where was cole now was tellman having any success in finding him however when tellman reported to pitt that evening within twenty minutes of pitts arriving home himself he had nothing to offer at all they sat around the kitchen table in deep gloom charlotte had made a large pot of tea and gracie had abandoned even pretending to be peeling potatoes or cutting the strings off the beans she was not going to be occupied in such things when there were really important matters to talk about nobody has any idea tellman said defensively he could have gone anywhere if he had any family no one heard him mention them they could be in wales for all anyone knew or scotland army records would know where he came from pitt pointed out tellman flushed he was furious with himself because he had not thought of that well if someone were arter im e wouldnt go back there would e gracie said defensively if we can work that out mebbe they could too stands ter reason dont it she looked from pitt to tellman and back again ed a gorn somewhere as nobdy knows im i would why would anybody be after him pitt asked he didnt do anything or know anything so far as we can tell well wy else would e scarper she asked reasonably goin by wot you said e ad a decent job an a good place yer dont jus up an leave things like that less yer got summink better or theres somebdy arter yer bit chancy wasnt it tellman said reluctantly flashing gracie a look of gratitude and obviously unwilling to slight the favor by criticizing her logic but driven to it by necessity someone we dont know of went after cole just the day before poor slingsby gets done in by someone who wants to pretend hes cole thats it pitt banged his fist on the table suddenly it was obvious they went after cole first they tried to kill him but somehow they failed he got away perhaps he was a better soldier than they realized experienced in handtohand fighting he said eagerly he escaped but he knew theyd come after him again perhaps a knife in the back next time or a shot so he took to his heels and disappeared anywhere it doesnt matter where just out of london to a place theyd never think of looking he turned to gracie as you said they know his military record thats why they wanted him so the last place hed go would be back to anywhere he had a connection with he stared around the table thats why we cant find cole and i daresay we never will so they found someone who looked like him charlotte took up the train of reasoning they had the snuffbox anyway and they either stole the sock receipt or had one made up had it made up tellman put in easy enough go and buy three pairs get yourself noticed say something about being a soldier the importance of keeping your feet right the shop clerk remembered all that but not much about his face who is they charlotte asked with a little shake of her head a sharp return from logic to emotion cadell if it has to be and who else ernest wallace why she bit her lip and her expression betrayed her disbelief i still cant accept that she looked from pitt to tellman you havent found any reason why he should suddenly need money or connected him to any plot to invest in africa or anywhere else aunt vespasia says he just wasnt that sort of person pitt sighed he reached his hand across the table and put it over hers of course she doesnt want to think so but what is the alternative that someone else is guilty she answered her voice without the certainty she would have liked and he killed himself because i dont know he was so worn down by the blackmail he hadnt the strength to go on and confessed pitt said gently knowing what that would do to his family to theodosia and they have grownup children a son and two daughters have you seen what lyndon remus and the other newspapers have made of the scandal poor gordoncumming pales beside it then he could never have done it she said desperately he must have been murdered by whom he asked no one came or went but the family servants and the entrances were observed all the time she took her hand away fists clenched well i still refuse to believe it theres something we dont know theres a lot of things we dont know he said dryly he ticked them off on his fingers we dont know why cadell wanted or needed money or even if that was the purpose of the blackmail we dont know why he chose specifically the other members of the orphanage committee of the jessop club there must have been dozens of other men he knew as well and could have created a web of fear around built on imagination and misinterpretation we certainly dont know how he ever made the acquaintance of ernest wallace or why he trusted him we dont know why wallace lied to protect him and is still lying tellman added yes we do pitt answered at least we can deduce it he is in newgate and doesnt know that cadell is dead he must be assuming that cadell will twist the knife in dunraithe white and wallace will be acquitted he also doesnt know that white has just resigned from the bench then tell him charlotte retorted that may concentrate his mind wonderfully show him he is completely alone he has been let down on every side cadell has escaped in a fashion and left him to hang alone dont make no difference whether you ang alone or together gracie said with disgust dont suppose it feels no different e killed slingsby so ell ang any which way pitt rose to his feet ill still go and see him charlottes eyes widened now its half past six ill be back by nine he promised walking to the door i have to speak to him pitt hated visiting prisons the walls closed in on him with the cold gray misery of countless angry and wasted lives hopelessness seemed to seep from the stones and his footsteps echoed behind the warders like multiple treads as if he were preceded and followed by unseen inmates ghosts who would never escape ernest wallace would be tried in a week or two he was brought into the small room where pitt waited for him he looked small and tight and beneath his smug expression there remained a lifelong anger that was bonedeep he glanced at pitt but there was no visible fear in his eyes it seemed to amuse him that pitt had come all the way to newgate to see him he sat down at the other side of the bare wooden table without being asked the warder a barrelchested man with a disinterested face stood by the door whatever these two were going to say he had heard it all before where did you go after you had fought with slingsby pitt began almost conversationally if wallace was surprised he hid it well don remember he answered wots it matter nah what did you fight about i told yer least i told the other rozzer baht summink wot e took orff me as ed no right ter i tried ter get it back orff im an e laid inter me i fought im natural ive a right ter save me own life he said that with some satisfaction meeting pitts eyes squarely pitt had thought he expected the blackmailer to influence the trial and get him acquitted at least of murder now in the fetid room with its smell of despair he was certain of it and when you saw that you had killed him you just fled pitt said aloud wot you ran away yeah well i didnt think as any rozzerd believe me an i were right werent i or i wouldnt be here now lookin at a charge o murder he said it with considerable selfjustification yerd a seen as i were defendin meself from a geezer wot were biggern me an got a right temper on im he almost smiled is albert cole dead too pitt said suddenly wallace kept his face straight but he could not prevent the ebb of color from his skin and his hands twitched involuntarily where he had laid them with a deliberate show of ease on the tabletop oo albert cole pitt smiled the man slingsby looked like and was mistaken for when we found him he had a receipt belonging to cole in his pocket wallace grinned oh yeah yer made a right mess o that dint yer it was the receipt that did it pitt explained and the lawyer from lincolns inn who identified him and of course cole is missing wallace affected surprise is e well i never lifes full o funny little things like that int it he was enjoying himself and he wanted pitt to know it pitt waited patiently yes it is he agreed you see i think you cant tell me where you went after you killed slingsby because you came back within minutes and loaded his body into a vegetable cart youd borrowed after dark you took it to bedford square and left it on general balantynes doorstep exactly as you were told to do wallace was tense his shoulder muscles locked the sinews in his thin neck standing out but his eyes did not waver from pitts do yer well yer cant prove it so it don make no difference i says as i killed im cos e came at me an scarpered arterwards cos i were scared as no rozzerd believe me his voice descended into mockery an im real sorry abaht that me lud i wont never make a mistake like that again talking about judges pitt observed steadily mr dunraithe white has resigned from the bench wallace looked mystified am i supposed ter know wot yer talkin abaht pitt was shaken but he concealed it perhaps not i thought you might come up before him well if e int a judge no more i wont will i stands ter reason pitt dropped the blow he had been waiting for and another thing you might not have heard being in here leo cadell is dead wallace sat motionless committed suicide pitt added after confessing to blackmail wallaces eyes widened blackmail he said with what pitt would have sworn was surprise yes hes dead yeah yer said so is that all he looked at pitt with wide eyes untroubled his lips still smiling not the fixed and awful grin of a man whose last hope has slipped away but the satisfaction of someone supremely confident even if he had heard some news which he did not completely understand it was pitt who was thrown into confusion reason and hope disappeared from his grasp wallace saw it and his smile widened reaching his eyes pitt was suddenly furious aching to be able to hit him he rose to his feet and told the warder he was finished before he betrayed his defeat even more he walked out of the gray suffocation of newgate totally perplexed he arrived home in keppel street still just as confused and if possible even angrier but now with himself rather than only with wallace whats wrong charlotte demanded as soon as he was in the kitchen they must all have heard his footsteps coming down the passage from the front door and were sitting around the table staring at him expectantly he had not even bothered to take his boots off he sat down and automatically gracie poured him a mug of tea i told him i believed he had come back and moved the body to bedford square he answered and i could see it shook him tellman nodded with satisfaction and i told him dunraithe white had resigned pitt went on and it meant nothing to him at all i dont suppose he knew his name charlotte explained just that there was a judge in the blackmailers power and then i told him cadell was dead pitt finished looking at their expectant faces he didnt give a damn what tellman was incredulous his jaw dropping he must have charlotte said abruptly he must have known cadell it cant have been all done by letter her eyes widened or are you saying it wasnt cadell after all i dont know what im saying he admitted except that i still dont understand it there were several minutes of silence the kettle whistled on the hob gathering shrillness and gracie got up to move it over pitt sipped his tea gratefully he had not realized how thirsty he was or how keen to get the taste of prison air out of his mouth charlotte looked apologetic and very faintly pink general balantyne was worried about the funds for the orphanage at kew she said tentatively ive been out there pitt answered wearily ive been over the books with a finetoothed comb every penny is accounted for and ive seen the children they are healthy well clothed and well fed anyway balantyne thought there was too little money given them not too much thats a turn up gracie said dryly i never eard of an orphanage afore wot ad enough money let alone too much an come ter that i never eard o one wot fed an clothed its kids proper beggin yer pardon mr pitt but i think you was took in it were likely the masters own kids as yer saw not the orphans no it wasnt pitt said wearily i saw upwards of twenty children twenty gracie was incredulous at least more like twentyfive he assured her in an orphanage yes ow bigs this orphanage then couple o cottages is it no of course not its a very large house dozen bedrooms or more originally i should think gracie looked at him with weary patience then you was took proper ouse that size theyd ave an undred kids at least ten to a room countin little ones big ones ter look arter em there were nothing like that many he thought back on the clear light rooms he had seen admittedly only two or three of them but he had chosen them at random and horsfall had been willing enough to show him everywhere he wished to go then were was the rest o them gracie asked there were no more pitt replied frowning and the money was about right for that number to feed and clothe and pay for the fuel and keeping of the house cant a bin much then gracie said dismissively yer can feed an orphan kid fer a few pence a day on bread an taters and gravy clothe em in andmedowns and stuff wots bin unpicked an remade get a pile fer a shillin down seven dials way same wif boots an wen yer places kids which int often like as not they leave their clothes beind an o course wen they grows out o them someone else grows inter em what are you suggesting charlotte turned to her her eyes wide and dark in the dying light the gas was flickering yellow on the wall maybe they are good at placing children tellman said if they give them a little education they could go into trades be useful you live in a dream you do gracie said shaking her head nobody places orphans that fast oo wants extra mouths ter feed these days less theyre workin they were little children pitt put in those ones i saw were as young as three or four years old most of them gracies eyes were full of pity and anger yer think kids o three or four cant work course they can work ard some o them poor little bleeders an dont answer back ner run away too scared nothin ter run ter work em till they either grow up or die they werent working pitt said slowly they were happy and healthy playing till they get placed gracie answered him theres good money in that sell an ealthy kid fer quite a bit specially if yer got a reglar supply like charlotte used a word that would have appalled her mother breathing it out in a sigh of horror tellman regarded gracie with dismay how do you know that he demanded i know wot appens ter kids wots got no one ter take em in she said bleakly appened ter one o me friends down the street er ma got killed an er pa got topped er an er bruvvers got sent ter an orphanage i went ter see er year arter she were gorn ter pick oakum an er bruvvers gorn up north ter the mines charlotte put her hands up to her face does aunt vespasia have to know thomas she couldnt bear it it would break her heart to know that cadell did such a thing i dont even know if its true yet he answered but it was a prevarication in his heart he was certain this was a secret worth committing blackmail to hide this was why brandon balantyne had been singled out for the most powerful threat even destruction if possible he had been asking too many questions after the devils acre he was one man who might be very difficult to silence this was why all the members of the orphanage committee were victims there was nothing random or opportunistic about it charlotte did not bother to argue she knew pitt too well tellman and gracie both sat silently tomorrow pitt said tomorrow well go out to kew pitt and tellman reached the orphanage at midmorning it was a hot still day already oppressive at ten oclock as they climbed the slight hill towards the large house tellman screwed up his face against the light and stared at it unconsciously thinning his lips pitt knew gracies words were sharp and hurting in the sergeants mind he drew in his breath as if to speak and then said nothing after all they approached the front door in silence it was opened by a girl of about eleven plainfaced and straighthaired yes sir she asked we would like to see mr horsfall pitt said bluntly allowing no opportunity for refusal a small boy ran down the hall making a noise in imitation of a galloping horse and another followed him laughing they both disappeared into a passageway at right angles to the one that led from the door and there was a squeal from somewhere beyond pitt felt the anger boil up inside him perhaps pointlessly maybe gracie was wrong there was far too much money for the few children he had seen but perhaps there were more somewhere else perhaps horsfall really did find homes for them perhaps there was a dearth of orphans at the moment and many childless families now if you please he added as the girl looked doubtful yes sir she said obediently and pulled the door wider if yerll wait in the sittin room ill fetch im for yer she showed them to the same homely room pitt had seen before and they heard her feet clatter along the wooden corridor as she went about her errand they remained standing too tense to sit dont suppose hell run do you tellman said dubiously pitt had thought of it but horsfall had no reason to fear anything now if he were going to hed have gone when cadell shot himself he said aloud suppose he knows tellman pursed his lips frowning if he does why is he still here does he inherit the orphanage where does the money go anyway why share it with cadell in the first place do you suppose this is cadells house those thoughts had occurred to pitt also and others that troubled him even more at the back of his mind was the complacent expression in wallaces face when pitt had told him dunraithe white had resigned from the bench and even when he had said that cadell was dead wallaces impassivity about white could have either of two explanations he did not know of whites involvement and therefore his resignation held no meaning for wallace or he knew the blackmailer would not allow white to resign he would let him know that if he did he would exercise his threat and ruin him anyway then why had he not been shattered to learn of cadells death that removed every chance for him of escape from the noose there could be only one answer it was not cadell he was depending upon either cadell had an accomplice which would explain why horsfall was still there or it was not cadell who was the blackmailer but someone else tellman was watching pitt waiting for him to speak it could not be guy stanley he would not have ruined himself not so completely neither did pitt believe it was balantyne he had never even considered that it could be cornwallis that left white and tannifer he looked up at tellman where was dunraithe white when cadell was shot you mean you dont think he shot himself tellman seized on the change of wording instantly i dont know pitt replied he shoved his hands hard into his pockets leaning against the wall and staring back at tellman no one else was there tellman pointed out you said so yourself wallace believes the blackmailer is still alive and he knows cadell is dead pitt argued what about tannifer i dont know tellman shook his head he moved restlessly about the room but he cant have been at cadells house or hed have been seen there was no further time to pursue it because at that moment the door opened and horsfall came in looking blankly from one to the other of them good morning gentlemen what can i do for you this time his smug unconcern infuriated pitt the more so for his own inner confusion something essential was still eluding him and he was bitterly aware of it good morning he said grimly his body tight and his jaw clenched how many children have you here at present mr horsfall horsfall looked startled why about fifteen i think he shot a look at tellman and then swallowed we have been very fortunate in placing several lately good pitt said where what where pitt repeated a little more loudly i dont understand he was still only mildly uncomfortable where have you placed them mr horsfall tellman moved to the door as if to cut off horsfalls retreat er you mean the exact addresses i should have to look it up is there something amiss has someone proved unsatisfactory unsatisfactory what an odd word to use of a child pitt said coldly sounds more like placing a servant horsfall swallowed again he eased his shoulders up and down as if to relax tense muscles yes silly of me he agreed but i feel responsible for our children sometimes people expect better behavior than than young people are capable of new surroundings strange new people not all children respond well they become used to us here of course used to our ways he was talking a little too quickly dont always understand change even if it is change for their good i know pitts voice was like ice i have children myself mr horsfall oh horsfall paled he licked his lips pitt had said nothing threatening but the look in his eyes was enough to warn of savage dislike well what is the problem mr er where were these children placed pitt repeated the original question horsfall was clenching and unclenching his hands i told you i should have to look it up i dont have a good memory for the details of addresses large numbers of addresses approximately pitt insisted oh well lincolnshire yes spalding and several as far north as durham yes and nottinghamshire pitt suggested horsfalls eyebrows rose why yes nottinghamshire too how about wales pitt went on south wales lot of mines in south wales horsfall was white a sheen of sweat on his face mmines yes children are useful in lots of places in mines up chimneys in factories cleaning out corners adults cant get into especially small children young thin even three and fouryearolds can be taught to pick rags pick oakum send them out into the fields to work all sorts of crops need taking up by hand little hands are as good as big ones and dont need paying not if youve bought them thats horsfall swallowed and choked slavery pitt finished for him you cant you cant prove that horsfall gasped his face was running with sweat oh im sure i can pitt smiled showing his teeth horsfall ran his hands over his brow do you know a man named ernest wallace pitt asked changing the subject suddenly small wiry very bad temper indeed horsfalls deliberation was plain in his expression he could not judge whether acknowledgment or denial was going to make his situation worse pitt watched him without the slightest pity tellman did not move i er horsfall hesitated you cant afford to lie to me pitt warned well horsfall licked his lips he may have done the occasional odd job around the garden for us yes yes he did wallace yes he stared at pitt as at some dangerous animal where does the money go pitt switched back to the original line of questioning mmmoney horsfall stammered pitt moved forward half a step i dont know horsfalls voice rose as if he had been physically threatened i only take my pay i dont know where it goes you know where you send it tellman said bitterly he was shorter and narrower than horsfall but there was such a rage in his voice that the bigger man quailed show me pitt commanded ii dont have books horsfall protested raising his hands as if to ward off a blow pitt was unimpressed you have accounts of some kind either you have a master who takes the money from you one way or another or else you havent and you are responsible for it all he did not need to continue horsfall was shaking his head and waving his hands in denial is this house yours pitt pressed no of course not it belongs to the orphanage and the profits from selling the children well i wouldnt use terms like that horsfall sputtered slavery mr horsfallthe selling of human beingsis illegal in this country you can be charged as an accomplice or all by yourself as you like pitt answered where does the money go illill show you horsfall surrendered i only do what im told pitt looked at him with complete disgust and followed him out of the room to find the notes he kept of his transactions he read them all and added them up over the space of eight years it amounted to tens of thousands of pounds but there were no names to prove in whose pockets it had ended the local police arrested horsfall and placed someone in temporary charge of the orphanage pitt and tellman set out on their way back to london traveling on the ferry glad of the bright air and the sounds of the busy river he should swing tellman said between his teeth that blackmailing swine wont get him off ill be damned if hell get wallace off either pitt retorted tellman stared straight ahead of him up the river towards the battersea bridge a pleasure boat passed them going the other way people waving ribbons and streamers bright in the wind he did not seem to see it if it isnt cadell then its got to be white or tannifer he looked at pitts bulging pockets weve got enough paper there to work out where the money went it took them a day and a half of painstaking minute unraveling of buying and selling of finding the names behind the names all accomplished with savage deliberation but by four oclock in the afternoon two days after their return from the orphanage they could prove that the trail led to sigmund tannifer tellman stood with the last piece of paper in his hand and swore viciously whatll he get he said fiercely hes sold little children to labor in the mines like they were animals some of themll never see the light of day again his voice caught with his emotion but we cant prove he knew what horsfall was doing hell deny it say it was rents or something surplus from other properties he blackmailed innocent men and near drove them mad with fear enough to make cadell shoot himself and white resign but we cant prove that either wed have to show that he threatened to expose them and that would only ruin them just like he said he would wed be doing it for him he swore again his fists clenched white his eyes blazing he was demanding an answer from pitt expecting him to solve the injustice somehow it wasnt even blackmail pitt said with a shrug he didnt ask for anything he would have their silence over the orphanage if they had ever found out but it never came to that weve got to get him for something tellmans voice rose to a shout his fist gripping the air lets go and arrest him for taking the proceeds of horsfalls business pitt answered no jury will believe he thought that it was profits from the kitchen garden that doesnt matter a damn tellman said bitterly oh i dont know pitt pulled a face i think that officious little newspaper writer remus could make a good story out of it tellman stared at him he couldnt know could he he could if i told him pitt responded we cant prove that tannifer knew what horsfall did i dont think that will bother remus too much tellmans eyes widened you would tell him i dont know but i should enjoy letting tannifer think i would tellman laughed but it was an unhappy mirthless sound sigmund tannifer received them in the ornate withdrawing room without the slightest indication in his smooth features that there was anything amiss or that he could be concerned over any matter but pitts progress in concluding his case he looked at parthenope who was standing beside his chair her vivid face for once completely at peace reflecting none of the anxiety that had so disturbed her on pitts previous visits good of you to come superintendent tannifer said pointing to the chairs where pitt and tellman could be seated miserable end to the matter i admit i never imagined cadell could be so i am at a loss for words vicious cruel utterly sadistic parthenope supplied for him her voice shaking and her eyes filled with anger and burning contempt i am so sorry for mrs cadell my heart aches for her what could be more terrible than to discover the man you have loved have been married to all your adult life and have given your loyalty and your trust is a total blackguard her whole slender body shook with the force of her emotions tellman glanced at pitt and away again my dear tannifer said soothingly you cannot bear the ills of the world theodosia cadell will recover in time there is nothing you can do for her i know there isnt she said desperately thats what makes it so awful if i could help i was quite shocked when i returned the day after his death and read the news tannifer went on looking at pitt i admit i would have believed it of almost anyone before him still he deceived us all returned from where pitt asked irrationally disappointed he already knew no one had been to cadells house what had he hoped for paris tannifer replied leaning back a little in his wide chair his hands folded comfortably i went over in the steamer the day before exhausting but banking is an international business why do you ask only interest pitt replied suddenly all his anger returned in a wave almost choking him and did you deposit money in a french bank tannifers eyes widened i did as a matter of fact is it of interest to you superintendent he was at ease bland sure of himself is that where the money ends up from the orphanage in a french bank pitt said icily tannifer did not move his expression did not change but his voice was oddly different in timbre money from the orphanage i dont understand you the orphanage at kew which is supported by the committee of the jessop club pitt explained elaborately all of whose members were victims of the blackmailer tannifer stared back at him were they you never mentioned the names of the other victims yes cornwallis stanley white cadell balantyne and you pitt answered him gravely ice in his voice balantyne especially thats why the corpse was left on his doorstep to terrify him possibly have him arrested for murder of course that is why wallace tried to kill albert cole to begin with only cole fought back and escaped his eyes did not move from tannifers then he thought of the excellent idea of using slingsby whom he knew and who resembled cole so much he bought the socks himself spinning a yarn so the clerk would remember him and identify him as cole and put the receipt on slingsbys body and balantynes snuffbox too of course ingenious tannifer was watching pitt closely he opened his mouth as if to lick his lips then changed his mind wasnt it pitt agreed not even allowing his eyes to flicker if any of the committee had taken up balantynes anxiety over the amount of money put into the orphanage for what was actually very few children indeed then the blackmail threat would have silenced them parthenope was staring at pitt her fair brows drawn into a frown her mouth pinched why did it matter that there was too much money and very few children superintendent she asked surely only too little would be cause for concern why would mr cadell want that kept silent i dont understand the answer was not easy to find he spoke now to her not to tannifer you see the committee put money into the orphanage and a great many orphans were sent there from all over london but it also made a huge profit tens of thousands of pounds over the years because the children didnt stay there very long he looked at her puzzled face the wild emotions in it and felt a moments misgiving but his anger was whitehot you see they were sold to work in factories and mills and mines especially mines where they can crawl into spaces grown men cannot she gasped her face bloodless her voice choking im sorry pitt apologized im sorry you had to know that mrs tannifer but the proceeds from this trade are what has finished this beautiful house and bought the silk gown you are wearing it cant be her words were torn from her in a kind of shout pitt took the papers from the orphanage out of his pockets and held them up parthenope swung around to tannifer her eyes beseeching filled with terror my dear they were east end orphans for the most part he said reasonably perfectly used to hard conditions they were not children of people like us they would have had to work wherever they were at least this way they wont starve she stood frozen parthenope there was impatience in his tone please have a sense of proportion my dear and of the realities of life this situation is something you know nothing about you really have no idea her voice was harsh a travesty of its previous beauty leo cadell was innocent there was agony in her cry he was innocent of blackmail yes he conceded but nothing was ever asked for except worthless trinkets he looked at her with exasperation but i presume he must have been guilty of using his wifes beauty to advance his career which is pretty disturbing because he shot himself when he feared exposure guilt does some strange things her face was racked with emotions so deep it was a white contorted mask terrible painful to see you know what he was accused of you had better go and lie down tannifer said more gently his cheeks a little red ill call your maid ill be up to see you as soon as i have dealt with pitt and he gestured at tellman whatever his name is no she staggered back then turned and fled from the room leaving the door swinging behind her tannifer looked back at pitt you really are unnecessarily clumsy superintendent you might have spared my wife that sort of description he glanced down at the papers in pitts hand if you think you have something with which to charge me come back when i have my legal representative present and well discuss the matter now i must go to my wife and see if i can help her to understand this business she is rather naive as to worldly things idealistic as women sometimes are and without waiting for pitt to answer he strode from the room and into the hall tellman glanced at pitt all his fury and frustration in his eyes challenging demanding some justice pitt moved towards the door before he reached it a shot rang out a single sharp explosion and then a thud pitt lurched forward and almost tripped into the hall tellman at his shoulder parthenope stood on the stairs with a dueling pistol in her hands her arms rigid out in front of her her back straight her head high sigmund tannifer lay on the tiled floor below her blood oozing from the hole in his forehead between his wideopen eyes his face filled with amazement and disbelief tellman went over to him but examination was pointless he had to be dead parthenope dropped the pistol and it clattered down the steps she stared at pitt i loved him she said quite steadily i would have done anything to defend him i did anything everything i dressed up as the gardeners boy and killed leo cadell be cause i thought he was blackmailing sigmund and would ruin him for something he didnt do i knew where to find him i wrote the suicide note on our own stationery just like the blackmail letters sigmund received wrote himself she started to laugh and then to choke gasping for breath pitt took a step towards her she unfroze her whole body was shaking in agonizing grief for love and life and honor lost she reached behind her waist to the back of her skirt and her hand came forward holding the other pistol the pair to the one on the floor at pitts feet no pitt shouted stumbling forward but quite calmly now as if his cry had steadied her she put both hands on the pistol lifted it to her mouth and pulled the trigger the shot rang out he caught her as she pitched forward holding her in his arms she was so slight there seemed hardly any weight to her for so much passion there was nothing he could do she was already dead the betrayal the grief and the unbearable guilt were ended he bent and picked her up to carry her unheeding of the blood or the pointlessness of being gentle now she had been a woman who had loved fiercely and blindly giving her whole heart to a man who had defiled her dreams and she had broken herself to protect something which had never existed he held her tenderly as if she had been able to know what he felt as if some kind of pity mattered even now he stepped over tannifer and tellman held open the withdrawing room door for him his face white his head bowed
